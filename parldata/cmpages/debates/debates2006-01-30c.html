 (Con): What the trend in applications for new casino licences under the Gaming Act 1968&nbsp;has been over the past 12&nbsp;months. [46090]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60130-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 The Gambling Commission received 43&nbsp;applications under the Gaming Act 1968&nbsp;for certificates of consent in respect of new casinos during 2005&#150;06&nbsp;compared with 25&nbsp;in 2004&#150;05. On 10&nbsp;November 2005, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced her intention to set a final date for such applications. We are currently consulting on a draft order, which will give effect to that commitment from 28&nbsp;April 2006.

<br>&nbsp;<br>many of the people who will use the new regional casinos will be those who are least able to pay gambling debts, how soon after the first regional casino is opened will the Government institute an assessment of that casino&#039;s impact on problem gambling?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60130-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That is not quite the same question, but I shall answer it. As the hon. Gentleman knows, only one regional casino will be set up, because the Opposition insisted that the figure be reduced from eight to one before the election. We are currently consulting on where the regional casino should be sited in the United Kingdom.

 I have heard my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). A prevalence study will be undertaken every three years, and we are currently examining the data on problem gambling. The UK has the toughest regime on gambling, and we shall retain it. The Budd report led to the development of a trust to examine the issues around problem gambling to which the industry is contributing &#163;3&nbsp;million a year. If the voluntary approach is not successful, the legislation contains reserved powers that allow the introduction of a statutory levy. Indeed, we will take the matter in-house to the Gambling Commission, if it is necessary to do so. Our regime on problem gambling is the strictest in the world.

Will he provide an assurance that the regulations are stringent?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60130-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, setting up a casino, whether it is large or small, involves a twofold licensing process. A casino requires a licence from the Gambling Commission and, importantly, a premises 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>licence and planning permission from the local authority. If a local authority does not want a casino to open in its area, that casino will not open.

When does he intend to implement those recommendations?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60130-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 My officials are currently engaged in dialogue with the industry on stakes and prizes. We are not prepared to go any further on liberalisation until we receive clear assurances on the conditions laid down in the Gambling Act 2005&nbsp;that the vulnerable&#151;particularly children&#151;will be protected and that the industry will be crime free.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60130-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham  (Coventry, South)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my hon. Friend say how many local authorities, and in particular how many Conservative local authorities, have asked for a change in the Government&#039;s policy? A regional casino is being prepared in Coventry, subject to Government approval.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60130-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Many local authorities have asked for such a change. A few days ago, the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i> seemed to indicate shifting sands, so far as the Opposition are concerned. I was interested to read that the Opposition are prepared to revisit the issue of the number of regional casinos, and it would be interesting if they were to let us know how far they would go with liberalisation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60130-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Minister realise that his answer to the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) on uprating stakes and prizes for category C and D machines is a terrible blow for all those who run family entertainment centres, where more than 1,000&nbsp;jobs have been lost in the past 12&nbsp;months alone? Will he acknowledge that the industry has provided him with a great deal of evidence over the past few months, and will he make a statement on the issue in the next two or three weeks?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60130-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I will not make a statement, but I will say that there has been no freeze on stakes and prizes&#151;on the contrary, we propose that the stake on amusements with prizes machines be increased from 30p to 50p. We made it very clear&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree, because he served on the Gambling Bill Committee, as did other Members in the House today&#151;that we would continue with any liberalisation only as long as all the conditions were met, including protecting the vulnerable and children, and ensuring that activities are crime-free. Discussions with the industry on stakes and prizes for AWPs will continue. If those can be satisfactorily concluded, I have no doubt that we can move forward.

<br>&nbsp;<br>undertake to monitor levels of gambling addiction? If the more liberal regime leads to more gambling addiction, will he consider restraining and restricting casinos in future?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60130-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The answer is yes. There has been a prevalence study. The difficulty with gambling is not with casinos or betting shops but with online gambling. That is why we introduced the Gambling Act 2005. Remote gambling and internet gambling are the major growth areas, but we cannot control them until the Act is fully operational.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">I would go further and say that this cannot be addressed by just one member state. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will this year convene a meeting with a number of Ministers with responsibility for gambling around the world to consider introducing international legislation whereby we can deal with problem gambling on the internet. There is a major issue with the credit card companies as well, and we will be engaging them in discussion. We are looking at the whole question of the new, modern gambling. Remote and internet gambling is a major issue facing this country and many others.
</p>

 (Con): Why has it been possible under the Gaming Act 1968&nbsp;to apply for a new casino licence up until April this year, whereas if an existing casino has to cease operation for any reason, such as a fire, it cannot rebuild or reinstate its licence until well into 2007? What other business has to live with that level of uncertainty?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60130-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely none. I admit that that is one of the problems with the legislation. We will address it with the industry, and if we can find a solution&#151;[Hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">We will resolve this issue with the industry by applying the same common sense that we have applied to many other issues.

Can she explain the real reason for the delay in the announcement, not the one that she has just given us?

 I regard that as simply a bit of bluster. UK Sport funds elite athletes. Since 1997&nbsp;and since Sydney, the rate at which our elite athletes are funded has increased by more than 33&nbsp;per cent.

I suspect that he was groping towards asking what we intend to do about further funding for athletes up to 2012. We are negotiating with the Treasury about the proper and appropriate amount of funding but we are determined to invest for the long-term future performance of athletes&#151;in 2008, 2012&nbsp;and 2016.

 Elite sport is already established in Milton Keynes. The city is home to the national hockey stadium and the national badminton centre.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point and I welcome the opportunity to congratulate SportsAid on its excellent work and the young athletes who benefit. We wish to pursue precisely that sort of model, which looks to private sponsorship and other sources of funding beyond Government to ensure that we continue the investment in our elite and our up-and-coming young athletes so that they have the best chance of success for themselves and their country.

<a name="stpa_o4">Before the Berlin wall fell, East Germany and Russia had by far the most successful Olympic athletes.

<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60130-02_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. Work in schools, and the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion that is invested in creating sporting opportunities and competitive sport for every child in school, allows precisely such talent identification and thus potential nurturing of children who show exceptional talent. My hon. Friend is right that one has to have the capacity to spot talent early and subsequently provide the resources and facilities that young people need to reach their potential. Our record since 1997&nbsp;shows that we are doing that.

When I last examined the figures, some 46&nbsp;sports were represented in the programme. That sends a clear signal to talented athletes throughout the country that we shall invest in them and remove obstacles, especially to families who cannot afford to fund their children&#039;s talent. We want to ensure that no talent is wasted. That will benefit the country and our prospects for 2012.

We need to put more athletes on the rostrum to act as role models, and we need to ensure that more young people are able to play sport. My hon.

 I was right with the hon. Gentleman for the first 30&nbsp;seconds of his question; we share that analysis. However, I find his figures on PE teachers hard to sustain against the evidence that we now have 400&nbsp;school sport partnerships right across the country, with PE teachers who have been properly trained in the art of teaching physical education, rather than teachers who double up with their other subjects&#151;as has happened in the past&#151;and who see PE as a kind of voluntary extra to which they contribute their time.

We will have spent &#163;1&nbsp;billion of lottery and Exchequer money over the past three years. New sports halls and school facilities are being built across the country, and old swimming pools are being replaced by new ones.

 The share of national lottery funding for all four good causes is guaranteed until 2009, and each cause will continue after 2009. But the public also want community learning and health projects, and we will not let them down by going back to the 1993&nbsp;priorities.

 That is splendid news. In the light of the Minister&#039;s answer, will he confirm that the National Lottery Bill will not erode the traditional independence of the way in which the lottery spends its money, that there will be no political interference, and that the Big Lottery Fund represents additional funding entirely based on the core principles on which the lottery was founded?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60130-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s first question was about independence. At the time of the Report stage and Third Reading of the National Lottery Bill, which is now in another place, we spoke to all the lottery distributors. They have agreed to show in their annual reports how they have delivered additionality. That information will be made available in both Houses of Parliament&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If hon. Members would like to commit the Opposition&#039;s time to a debate on that additionality, we should be more than pleased to respond to it. On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s second point, the lottery was set up under the previous Conservative Government led by John Major, and it is a first-class institution. However, it needs to be refreshed from time to time, and we have conducted a wide consultation on the issues. The MORI poll of 2000, and a subsequent YouGov poll, have shown that health, education and the environment were the areas that the general public 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 8</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>wanted to see their lottery money spent on in future. So that is what we are doing in the new Bill; those three themes will be the main recipients of the money from the Big Lottery Fund.

That is all very welcome, but does my right hon. Friend agree that it is essential to make it easier for constituents such as mine to access lottery funds and to ensure that they get their fair share? Will the guidance provided by the proposed lottery funding website play a part in spreading the benefits of the lottery right round the country, and especially to places such as West Lancashire?

<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60130-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The answer is yes, and my hon. Friend makes a valid point. As good as the lottery was in 1993, one of the big problems was the fact that it was very much capital driven and driven by the big schemes. Systematically, we have been bringing the lottery fund distributors more in tune with what people want and making things easier. The Big Lottery Fund will be, as it were, a one-stop shop. I hope that the information on the website will enable people and organisations to apply for lottery funding. Whatever the answer is to an application, it will be found by going through that one-stop shop, which is what the Big Lottery Fund will be. I hope that the new forms that are being designed will give assistance too. Even the smallest organisation should be able to apply with some ease to access lottery funding in future.

The Government have promised us many times that we are engaging in a big conversation, so will he explain why he has ignored voices not only from Parliament, but from communities across the country, which want the Big Lottery Fund to target expenditure on the four original good causes?

 That is interesting, because on the one hand the Conservatives say that there has to be independence, but on the other the hon. Gentleman says that the Government should instruct. However, let us park that one and I will answer the question. I should inform him that we have been out on the widest consultation and that what he has said is just not true. About 69&nbsp;per cent. of those in the MORI poll said that they wanted spending on health and 55&nbsp;per cent. said they wanted spending on education. The YouGov poll also involved the question of the environment. These are the concerns of the British people; that has been tested by MORI, YouGov and, indeed, a very wide consultation.

<p><a name="qn_o4">6. <a name="60130-03_wqn0"><b> Mr. Rob Wilson  (Reading, East)</b> 
 (Con): If she will make a statement on provision of public swimming pools. [46095]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="60130-03_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 There are more than 4,400&nbsp;swimming facilities of variable quality across England that are open to the public: 72&nbsp;per cent. are owned by the local authority or education sectors, and more than half are pay-and-play facilities. Since 2004, 131&nbsp;pools have opened across the country. More local authority pools have opened than have closed. Since 1997, the Government and lottery distributing bodies between them have invested more than &#163;3&nbsp;billion in physical activity and sport, and in that time &#163;249&nbsp;million of lottery investment has gone to swimming, which is the largest amount that has gone to any single sport.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="60130-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Wilson: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for her answer. Is she aware, however, that two swimming pools in my constituency are due to be closed with no certainty of like-for-like replacement? In addition, recent reports in the press indicate that 10&nbsp;per cent. of swimming pools in schools have already closed. Given the proximity of the 2012&nbsp;Olympics and the importance of swimming as a life skill, what steps are the Government taking to prevent further pool closures?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="60130-03_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, I understand that the Arthur Hill pool is scheduled for closure, but the local authority has given a clear commitment that a new facility will be built with the capital receipt, and that the Arthur Hill pool will remain open until the new facility is ready. If that is not the case, I am happy to pursue the matter with the hon. Gentleman. More generally, however, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) raised in an earlier question, we need more modern facilities. The average age of swimming pools is about 25&nbsp;years, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 10</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many are simply not of the standard that people are prepared to use regularly. That is why we are asking local authorities to review their stock and make decisions where appropriate about how they might reinvest in modern, new facilities, with coaches. Such opportunities, and the right-to-swim programme, are ways of increasing participation in swimming.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60130-03_spnew2"><b> Kate Hoey  (Vauxhall)</b> 
 (Lab): Will the Secretary of State comment on the position in London, where a number of boroughs are either in the process of closing swimming pools or talking about closing them, and many are not replacing them? Does she accept that we will increasingly face that problem as swimming pools get older, and that perhaps local authorities should take an all-party approach to the issue? All local authorities, whatever their politics, are having to close swimming pools, and they should not have to do so, given that we will host the Olympic games in 2012.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60130-03_spnew3"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 On balance, more pools have opened than closed, but I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the poor quality of many local authority facilities, which are old and for which we estimate the national maintenance backlog as something like &#163;500&nbsp;million. We therefore need to take steps. We have commissioned the Audit Commission to provide us with an assessment of the state of local authority facilities. However, we must also work with local authorities. The performance assessment will provide leverage to hold them to account in relation to leisure and sporting facilities, and to make the case for planning for the long term, divesting, selling off or pulling down those facilities that are too old to be serviceable again and, critically, reinvesting the money in the kind of modern facilities that people will want to use.

 (LD): What progress have the Government made in removing the long-standing discrimination operated by official funding bodies such as Sport England against open-air pools, including those that are heated and operate all the year round, such as the extremely popular Hampton pool in my constituency?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60130-03_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 That is a very good question. As someone who swims periodically in the open-air Hampstead ponds, I am happy to take up that important matter for the hon. Gentleman.

 (Lab): Wigan council recently agreed to fund free access to all its pools for those under 16. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that is an extremely exciting and bold initiative, which will encourage young people to join swimming clubs for health, safety and athletics purposes? Will she join me in congratulating the Labour-led council on that bold initiative?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="60130-03_spnew7"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I am delighted to congratulate my hon. Friend and his local authority. I hope that others will follow the excellent example that he and his Labour colleagues have set. Right-to-swim schemes are beginning to develop around the country: there is at least one in every region, and wherever they operate they are very successful in encouraging more young people to take up swimming regularly.

 (Con): My constituency does have a new swimming pool, but&#151;and it is a very big but&#151;a great opportunity was missed. Although the total sum available was enough to fund the building of an eight-lane, competition-size pool, there were so many strings attached to the lottery funding element, involving the provision of additional community facilities, that the result was only a six-lane, 25&nbsp;m pool with less water space than the old pool which it replaced.

<a name="stpa_o6">We could have had the only Olympic-size swimming pool in Greater London. Will the Minister think carefully about the strings attached to lottery funding?

</p>





<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60130-03_spnew9"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Obviously the hon. Lady is right. It is important constantly to ensure that application to the lottery fund is as simple and straightforward as possible. As for her point about the size of the pool, we will shortly have 19 50&nbsp;m swimming pools, at least one in every region. Consultation with the Amateur Swimming Association, the governing body, and Sport England leads to a decision on whether a 50&nbsp;m, a 30&nbsp;m or a 25&nbsp;m pool should be built. I think that their judgment is much better than mine in this instance.

 (Lab): We are losing a swimming pool in Plymouth because the landowner wants to redevelop the site. Almost in parallel, the city council is trying to establish a life centre which would meet the Government&#039;s emphasis on the health aims of sport and leisure, and which would include a swimming pool. As a former swimming coach and lifeguard, I well understand the value of swimming pools for health and leisure purposes, but will my right hon. Friend confirm that her Department is offering design advice to local authorities to ensure that pools meet not just leisure standards but competitive standards? I agree with the hon.

<a name="stpa_o11">The Church has an obligation to its wider community. We contribute 18&nbsp;per cent. to the Church&#039;s running during the year, and it has a statutory obligation to the House to make the best possible arrangements in relation to the sale of the Octavia Hill estates. Clearly, those arrangements involve consultation and we are aware of the concerns of the people there, but the decision is one for the Church. I read with interest the letter that the hon.

We welcome that letter and we will listen with great interest to what the archbishop says, but the legal duty rests with the commissioners.

 My hon. Friend must realise just how much anger there is in the communities represented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) and myself. This is a shocking state of affairs and it has gone on for far too long. Does he realise that this is doing the Church no good whatsoever; that, legally, it could sell to a social landlord tomorrow if it wished; and that it seems to all of us who represent those very strong communities in inner-city London that the Church is only interested in profit?

 On the latter point, the Church, of course, has an obligation to the wider Church, as well as to the people of the Octavia Hill estates, and it recognises that responsibility. The commissioners, however, are unwilling to ignore the statutory duties conferred on them by Parliament to manage their investments in such a way that they provide the maximum sustainable support to the wider Church.

 I had anticipated that the question of princes&#039; palaces would arise, but I would not wish to incur your wrath, Mr. Speaker, thus spoiling your sunny disposition, by widening the question from the Octavia Hill estates to the Bishop of Oxford. Let me simply say

<a name="time_0">
<a name="60130-05_time0"><h5>3.31&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60130-05_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 Today, we publish a White Paper outlining the Government&#039;s proposals for further improvements to health and social care services in the community. We are nearly six years through a 10-year programme of NHS improvement that has seen waiting lists dramatically reduced and more people treated faster and better than ever before. At the same time, social care services have been supporting more elderly people than ever before to live at home and maintain their independence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Our unprecedented investment in the NHS&#151;made possible by strong economic management and our decision to ask people to pay increased national insurance contributions&#151;means that, by 2008, we will have caught up with the historic underfunding of the NHS and caught up with the health care funding of other European countries. What matters is not simply how much we spend, but where we spend it. As a nation, we invest less than comparable countries on preventing people from becoming ill and less on services in the community. For instance, just 2&nbsp;per cent. of our health care budget is devoted to prevention, half the level in Germany.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I think that all of us know that our health and well-being depend at least as much on what we do ourselves as on what the NHS and social care services do for us. As Sir Derek Wanless said in his landmark report on the future of the NHS, people need to be &quot;fully engaged&quot; in their own health if we are to offset the challenges posed by an ageing population and ensure the sustainability of the NHS and social care, so the views of the public themselves were the starting point for this White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">More than 100,000&nbsp;people responded to the consultation on last year&#039;s Green Paper on adult social care, &quot;Independence, Well-being and Choice&quot;. Then we embarked on the innovative, &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot; public engagement programme, which culminated in a 1,000-strong citizens&#039; summit in Birmingham. I am grateful to everyone who was involved in that, particularly the 10&nbsp;members of the citizens&#039; panel who worked with us throughout the development of the White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Four themes emerged clearly from our public consultation: we need more emphasis on prevention, with earlier intervention; we need to give people more choice and more say in the services they receive; we need to provide more support for those who need it most, particularly people with long-term needs; and we need to do much more to tackle inequalities and provide more services conveniently within local communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The White Paper makes clear our desire to focus on prevention. It outlines the work that is now being done in the partnerships for older people pilots to help older people to remain independent in their own homes. It sets out our commitment to large-scale pilots covering at least 1&nbsp;million people in which health and care services will work closely together, with the intensive use of new technologies&#151;including, for instance, the telecare assessment of people&#039;s conditions in their own homes that is being trialled in some parts of the country&#151;to improve people&#039;s well-being and dramatically reduce emergency hospital admissions. The pilots will provide 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 22</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>further evidence of the benefits of new approaches and help the NHS and local councils to spread best practice much faster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Of all the proposals that came to us from the public themselves, the most popular was the idea of a health MOT. We have responded to that by setting out in the White Paper our proposal for an NHS life check at key points in people&#039;s lives. The NHS life check will ask people about their lifestyle and family history, with a follow-up from a health trainer and, if necessary, a nurse or GP, for people in high-risk categories. We will pilot the new health check, starting with parents of very young children and people in their early 50s, and introduce it initially in the areas with the worst health inequalities where we can make the biggest difference. I know that the proposal will be warmly welcomed by the public and by hon. Members, at least on this side of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">People also said that they wanted more emphasis on mental well-being. The White Paper sets out how we will improve people&#039;s mental well-being through greater use of psychological therapies and a focus on mental well-being in preventive work with older people and by giving people more information and support on how to stay mentally and emotionally well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">By giving people more choice and more say in the services that they use, we will ensure that people themselves become the main drivers of service improvement and that services become increasingly personal and built around the different needs of different individuals and their communities. In theory, people have always been able to choose their GP. We will make that choice a reality for far more people by simplifying the registration system and giving people an entitlement to far more information about the services available in their area. Starting from April this year, the GP contract will link an element of GPs&#039; pay to patients&#039; satisfaction with the practice, including the appointments system, thus providing a real incentive for more convenient opening times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In social care, we will increase the take-up of direct payments by introducing legislation to extend their availability at the earliest opportunity. We will pilot the introduction of individual budgets and bring together several different income streams from social care, community equipment, independent living funds and other programmes so that individuals can get the services that they need in the way in which they want them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Those who make the most use of our health and social care services are those with long-term needs: frail elderly people, those with serious disabilities and people with conditions such as asthma and diabetes. Many of those people need the support of several organisations, but are frustrated that, too often, those different agencies seem to work in isolation. We know that it makes sense for everybody if the local NHS and the local authority work more closely together. For instance, if elderly people&#039;s homes are adapted to reduce the risk of a fall, they are less likely to end up in hospital, which is far better for them and better, too, for the NHS. If proper rehabilitation occurs after an operation, a patient is less likely to need social care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">By giving local authorities and the NHS stronger incentives to work together, we have already reduced the number of patients who stay in hospital with delayed 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 23</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discharges because no arrangements are in place to support them in the community. Now we will strengthen that joint working by introducing a single assessment of health and care needs and a joint care plan for people with the most complex needs. By 2008, we will expect primary care trusts and local authorities to establish joint health and social care teams. A common budgetary and planning system will support more of those organisations in jointly commissioning services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">Six million people care for relatives or friends with long-term needs. Many of those carers, who are doing a wonderful job in our communities, have to reduce or give up their own work to do so and, often, their own health suffers as a result of the responsibility that they take for others. In future we will ensure that short-term home-based respite support is established for carers, to deal with emergencies. In response to what carers themselves have told us, we will establish an expert carers programme, similar to the enormously popular expert patients programme, to support carers with the skills that they need to look after their own health and that of the people whom they care for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">Despite the fact that we have 4,300&nbsp;more GPs than we had in 1997, there are still fewest in the poorest areas that need them most. The White Paper will ensure that care is more closely matched to need. We will tackle that inequality in two ways. First, over the next two years, as NHS funding continues to increase by unprecedented amounts, we will ensure that, as every area gets more, those who need most will get the most. Moving traditionally underfunded areas rapidly towards target means that, by 2008, when average NHS funding will be nearly &#163;1,400&nbsp;per head, primary care trusts in the worst-off areas will receive on average &#163;1,552&nbsp;per person: fairer funding across the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">Secondly, we will ensure that, where people are dissatisfied with the care that they receive and cannot get a better choice of services, primary care trusts will bring in additional services. Already, in six areas that are short of doctors, including inner-city communities in Barking and Bradford, we are supporting the local NHS to bring in new providers that will offer extended opening hours and a full range of services. Whether services are organised by traditional GPs, by nurse practitioners, by private firms or by social enterprises and the not-for-profit sector, the test will be simple: to get the best services for patients with the best value for money, all free at the point of need in accordance with the founding principles of the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Modern medical technology is making it possible to deliver in people&#039;s homes or neighbourhoods health care that in the past was available only in hospitals. A kidney patient can now receive dialysis in a local health centre, or even in their own home. Minor surgery can be done in a well-equipped GP practice or a modern community hospital. Yet in contrast to what happens in Germany, where most out-patient appointments take place in local health polyclinics, we continue to expect most out-patients to travel to an acute hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">As part of our strategy to provide care more conveniently, closer to the patient and with better value for money, we will work with the royal colleges to demonstrate how far more out-patient care and day-case procedures in medical specialties such as ear, nose 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 24</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and throat, and dermatology, can be carried out in the community, while high clinical standards are maintained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">We have already opened or are building 79&nbsp;new acute hospitals, with more to come. Now we will also develop a new generation of community hospitals&#151;modern facilities, with the latest diagnostic technology, able to provide a full range of out-patient and day-case treatment, and in many cases with intermediate beds as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Some primary care trusts are planning to close local cottage hospitals. Where these closures are due to facilities that are clinically not viable, or which local people do not want to use, local reorganisation is right. But community facilities that are needed for the long term must not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures. So we will expect primary care trusts to reconsider such proposals against the principles of the White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">This White Paper marks a strategic shift in how we provide care, moving services out of acute hospitals into community settings, with more investment in prevention and far better management of long-term conditions. People have talked for decades of a primary care-led NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now deliver it. Because of our reforms, with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stronger primary care trusts, practice-based commissioning, more freedom for GPs and payment by results, more work than ever before will be done locally. As NHS budgets continue to increase, more of that growth money will go into local community services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-05_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">The White Paper sets out a vision for health and social care that will give people more choice and more control over their health and well-being and the local services that support them. It is the next stage in creating an NHS that is truly patient led&#151;fair to all, but increasingly personal to each. I commend it to the House.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving me two-hour advance notice of the statement and a copy of the White Paper. I will not be so churlish as to say that it was more useful to read three days of briefing in the newspapers beforehand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_20">It is clear what Members on both sides of the House want to achieve: more accessible, high-quality health care available to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay and NHS staff and professionals who are increasingly enabled to deliver the care that they want to deliver in response to patient choice and patient voice. I welcome some of the Secretary of State&#039;s proposals in the White Paper. In 1996, before the 1997&nbsp;election, the Conservative party was the first to legislate for direct payments. Today, under a Labour Government, only 2.25&nbsp;per cent. of people eligible for direct payments have taken them up. The Secretary of State says that such payments should be more accessible and that she will legislate accordingly, which I welcome. She said that there should be more respite care. We all very much agree, but I hope she will be more specific about the entitlements to respite care that will be provided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_21">In the election, we all promised and intended to deliver increased resources for palliative care. The White Paper makes it clear that that will be delivered through end-of-life care networks, but the Secretary of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 25</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>State has not made it clear how much additional money that palliative care support represents. In particular, she did not say how much of that will go to support children&#039;s hospices which, at the moment, must survive with just 5&nbsp;per cent. of their resources derived from statutory or Government sources. East Anglian Children&#039;s Hospices in my own area has recently had to make 25&nbsp;staff redundant, so it would be very interested to hear the Secretary of State&#039;s answer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_22">I welcome the U-turn on community hospitals. On 15&nbsp;November last year, my hon. Friends will recall an Opposition debate in which we pressed Ministers to review the closure of community hospitals. Indeed, our motion stated that we should not allow short-term measures to be taken for budgetary reasons, because that would prejudice the delivery of care in the community in the long term. The Secretary of State now says that she will do precisely what Government Members voted against on 15&nbsp;November.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_23">The statement comes just five days after the Secretary of State sent financial hit squads into 18&nbsp;NHS trusts. The NHS Confederation threatened &quot;painful decisions&quot; and a &#163;1&nbsp;billion deficit across the NHS. That is not what we hear from the Secretary of State. Instead, we hear about the sunlit uplands of future health care with happy patients, doctors waiting in supermarkets for patients to drop by and hospitals that are empty for lack of patients. It is rather like &quot;Yes, Minister&quot;&#151;the NHS and hospitals would work perfectly if only patients did not keep turning up and wanting treatment. The Secretary of State must acknowledge reality before she embarks on a Patricia in Wonderland adventure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">Does the Secretary of State understand that primary care trusts have cut the precise services on which her White Paper plans depend? How can palliative care be improved if Macmillan nurses have been transferred to other duties for budgetary reasons? How can consultants offer out-patient clinics in the community or minor operations locally if 90&nbsp;community hospitals are being closed? How can young people using mental health services be supported as the White Paper promises if those services are being cut, as is the case in my constituency? How can she criticise GPs for lack of access to their surgeries when it is just under two years since the Government contract removed Saturday morning surgeries? It is Government targets that have turned the GP appointment system into chaos.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_25">The Secretary of State has not dared to tell the House what she is proposing to do to hospital services. Last Thursday, her Department published the document that I have in my hand. She did not tell us about it today and she did not make a statement last Thursday, but it makes it clear that, in 2006&#150;07, NHS costs will rise by 6.5&nbsp;per cent., but the tariff in hospitals will rise by 1.5&nbsp;per cent. Labour Members should read that document before they read the White Paper. The squeeze on hospitals will continue next year&#151;hospitals that have deficits this year will have larger deficits next year. The Secretary of State is planning a &#163;4&nbsp;billion shift from hospital care, but she has not told the House which wards and which hospitals will close, and perhaps she will address this point in her reply. NHS staff think it madness to engage with some of the additional proposals in the White Paper while the wards and hospitals that patients need are being closed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_26">The Secretary of State is taking an immense gamble, because unless patients can be more effectively and comprehensively cared for in the community, the hospital sector will be under-resourced to handle rising demand, and it will be patients who suffer. At least she understands that she must adopt the previous Conservative Government&#039;s policies to make progress in community and primary care. Market mechanisms with increased private sector involvement, direct payments in social care and GP fundholding are essential if we are to have success after eight years of failure to reform the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_27">The White Paper fails to spell out how the reforms will work. Will the Government legislate to allow direct payments to extend across health and social care, so that patients with long-term conditions can control the management of their care? Will GPs in practice-based commissioning&#151;new Labour-speak for GP fundholding&#151;be given real budgets as Professor Julian Le Grand, the former health adviser at No. 10, has recommended? Will GP budget holders be able to use the savings that they generate to improve their patients&#039; care or will such savings be siphoned off to meet PCT deficits? Will GPs be given the freedom to refer rather than being constrained by PCT decisions? Will the Government actually deliver real patient choice, given that their choose-and-book system is already 15&nbsp;months late? Finally, will GPs be able to hold and negotiate contracts? If the answer to those questions is yes, then the Opposition will support the White Paper and the legislation to bring back fundholding.

Pharmacies can provide such services to GPs, who can follow up on people with certain risk factors. Where will the so-called life checks come from, and why should they take place at 11, 18&nbsp;and 50?

However, the market must be genuinely competitive, and community health services should not be so concentrated in one provider&#039;s hands as to represent a monopoly. Of course, there is no reason why 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 27</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>PCTs should not continue to provide services, as long as they, too, are subject to competition. However, if they are providers of services, that undermines the case for them to become more distant strategic bodies instead of local providers that are more locally accountable. As the Select Committee on Health made clear, the whole process of PCT reorganisation has been a shambles. Even now, we do not know the future structure of commissioning, and the Government say that it will not be published for some months, yet that is the basis on which reorganisation should proceed. We should know the function of PCTs and then determine what their structure should be, not the other way round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_32">This White Paper should have been about commissioning. It should have set out how patients can have more choice, more control and a stronger voice. We have had the Government&#039;s sham consultations, and many of them, but where is the genuinely accountable patient and public involvement system for the NHS? That has not happened, and there are no proposals in the White Paper to do it. It should have explained how GPs can use real GP budgets to access the whole patient pathway; how we break down the barriers between health and social care, with individual budgets, including for those with long-term conditions; how we break down the barriers between primary care and hospitals instead of institutionalising, as the White Paper does, the idea that money can be shifted between hospitals and primary care rather than devoted to the needs of individual patients; and, most of all, how we can improve the effectiveness of public health and reduce the widening health inequalities in terms of life expectancy.

It is not, because GPs are at the heart of primary care, and this does not put them in the driving seat&#151;it puts primary care trusts in the driving seat. A PCT-led NHS is not what we should be looking for. We should have a patient-led NHS that does not try to manipulate from the top down, as the Government have done in the past and are proposing to do again. That approach has failed. There is much that we can applaud in the ideas behind the White Paper, but far too little to applaud in the mechanics of its implementation.

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support, albeit rather grudging support, for many of our proposals in the White Paper. He mentioned several issues, including palliative care, which we specifically deal with. That is enormously important. As a result of the increased funding over the next few years, including the money that we will shift from reduced administrative costs at a local level into front-line services, more money will go into local networks for palliative care, including better provision at home and in hospices for children who are terminally ill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_34">The hon. Gentleman referred extensively to GPs, particularly in relation to the target for appointments. I remind him that, when we were first elected, patients were rightly complaining that they often had to wait days, and sometimes weeks, to get an appointment to see their GP. We introduced the target of 48&nbsp;hours maximum to see a GP and 24&nbsp;hours to see a nurse 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 28</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>practitioner. That has improved the situation for very many patients. The hon. Gentleman still has not told us whether he would scrap that target, along with the other targets that have helped to achieve enormous improvements in NHS services. There are still problems, as I am the first to acknowledge. People sometimes find it difficult to get through to the GP service or to book an advance appointment. That is why we have already negotiated with the British Medical Association, as part of the new GP contract, the agreement that part of GPs&#039; pay in future years will be linked to an independent survey of patient satisfaction. That is part of putting patients in the driving seat. If they are not happy with the appointments system and their ability to get appointments when they need them, that will be reflected accordingly in their GP&#039;s pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_35">The hon. Gentleman talked extensively about a return to GP fundholding. We are not going to return to fundholding, because it was unfair, created a two-tier system and ended up with hospitals trying to compete on price and undercutting each other to try to persuade GPs to enter into contracts with them, resulting in the most enormous administrative costs and unnecessary bureaucracy. We will do none of that. However, through practice-based commissioning, which will extend to every part of the country and every GP practice by the end of the year, we will give GPs and primary care practices much greater freedom and responsibility for the money that is spent on behalf of their patients in acute hospitals, including, of course, emergency admissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">The result is an enormous incentive to GPs and primary care practices to deliver much better care closer to home, reduce emergency admissions to hospitals, keep their patients healthier and save money, which will then be available to the practice to reinvest in better services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the open contest for services in areas where they are inadequate. I said that, in six disadvantaged areas and many more to come, we are already holding open tenders through primary care trusts for the new primary care services. Applicants may be an existing GP practice that wants to expand, a nurse practitioner who wants to leave the service, a private firm, a not-for-profit organisation or a social enterprise, but the criteria&#151;indeed, the whole process&#151;will be open and transparent. Getting the best services for patients, with the best value for public money, will be the only thing that matters. I hope that the hon. Gentleman supports that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">The hon. Gentleman referred to primary care trusts. Local consultations are currently taking place in many parts of the country where primary care trusts propose to merge and change their boundaries. There is no doubt that, as we get more primary care trusts that are coterminous with a local social services authority, it will make joint working, which people rightly want, between social services and the local NHS much easier to achieve. It will mean stronger commissioning, especially of acute services, from primary care trusts, linked to much more choice for individual patients about health and social care, and a much stronger voice for them. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the chapter in the White Paper that covers the way in which we will strengthen 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 29</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the say of patients and users, including through independent surveys and a much stronger role for overview and scrutiny committees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_39">The hon. Gentleman mentioned funding. There has been overspending, sometimes for some years, by a minority of organisations, and a small number consequently have serious financial problems. Of course, we must get those under control. Last week, I set out the way in which we shall support those organisations even further to deal with their problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it makes no sense to force patients to go to an acute hospital for an out-patient appointment, diagnostics or minor procedures if they can be done with good clinical quality safely, effectively and more conveniently for the patient in the local community. That is why the Royal College of Physicians and especially the Royal College of General Practitioners have worked with us closely to identify initially six specialties in which we will redesign the patient pathways to deliver more clinical care in the community. We set that out in some detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_41">The hon. Gentleman twice mentioned the extension of direct payments, not only to social care but to health. That sounds like the revival of the patient&#039;s passport. It appeared in the Conservative manifesto only nine months ago and was recently dropped, but I fear that it will re-emerge.

 I, too, would like to thank the Secretary of State for giving us advance notice of her statement. I was going to say that we had already seen a lot about it in the press, but a great deal of that was clearly speculation, and much of it has not appeared in the White Paper. It would be churlish not to welcome the broad thrust of the document, and I particularly welcome the proposal to deliver more services closer to people locally, the greater combining of health and social care&#151;although it is not clear that the barriers between the two will be broken down completely; perhaps the Secretary of State could elaborate on that point&#151;and the greater provision for carers. Surely, however, that last proposal would result in an increase in social services funding, which is already stretched. Funding for older people is often one of the first things to be squeezed.

<a name="stpa_43">I must question the amount of money that was spent on the consultation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 30</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they do not have any say over the health services, so where is the greater accountability? Regarding the proposal to expand the use of private profit-making companies in the running of GP services, how will those services be accountable to the taxpayer and the patient? What guarantees can the Secretary of State give that existing GPs will not be poached by private firms offering higher salaries? Will such proposals not mean that we could end up paying more for almost the same level of service?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_45">These proposals constitute an admission that the Government got it badly wrong when negotiating the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GP contract. Should not they have predicted that the public would want access to their GPs at weekends and in the evenings? How does the Secretary of State plan to fund and staff the proposed greater access desired by the public? Reliance on the patient satisfaction survey will account for only a small proportion of what is at present in the GP contract. Does this not mean that the GP contract will effectively have to be renegotiated if the Secretary of State is to achieve her aims?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_46">The public clearly liked the idea of health MOTs, and this is where the consultation seems to have been something of a sham. The Liberal Democrats believe that there is some merit in targeted health checks where there is evidence that they could be helpful. The public seem to want a more general health MOT, however, at various times of life. What they will actually get is an online tick-the-box exercise&#151;a sort of &quot;health MOT lite&quot;. So, despite these checks being targeted at areas of deprivation, there is no guarantee that they will reach the people who most need them. Will they not be just a sop to the worried well? What incentives will there be to ensure that the people who would most benefit from them will take them up and have their cases followed up?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_47">We welcome the idea of individual budgets, but the present take-up of direct payments is small. For the system to work, it must be sustained by a system of support and advocacy. Will the Secretary of State tell us more about that? She has also announced the introduction of a single assessment of health and care needs. Will she explain how that will differ from the single assessment process that is supposedly already in place but has not been fully implemented across the country?

<a name="stpa_48">I echo the comments made about community hospitals. There have been reports that the private finance initiative budget is to be cut. Will the Secretary of State clarify that?

 I was going to thank the hon. Lady for the welcome she gave to at least some of our proposals. She welcomed in particular the intention much better to integrate health and social care, but rightly said that there are some barriers to that. We acknowledge those very readily in the White Paper, in particular the fact that there are different funding systems for health and social care, with NHS care continuing, as it must, to be free at the point of need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_50">Social care, of course, is offered on a different basis. We readily acknowledge that that is a problem, but, within that framework, we can still do far more: the single joint assessment of health and social care needs for people with complex conditions; the single health and care plan; far more joint commissioning by primary care trusts and local authority social services departments, in some cases pooling their budgets; and the requirement that, by 2008, local authorities and the local NHS should have joint health and care teams. All that will result in real improvements for some of the most vulnerable people in our community, who depend on those different organisations working together to meet their individual needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_51">The hon. Lady raised a number of issues on local accountability. We set out in chapter 7&nbsp;of the White Paper exactly what we intend to do to strengthen the local accountability of health and social care services. Overview and scrutiny committees, which already play an important part, will have more power, including the ability to institute their own review of a service where they believe, perhaps from their constituents, that a service is not doing well enough. That will be one of the triggers, to which we refer, that lead to a primary care trust needing to put in place an improvement programme or, in some cases, find a different provider for a particular service that is simply not satisfactory. Linked to that are not only independent surveys of patients and users&#151;and not just for GP practices, but for other services&#151;but the possibility of, for instance, user petitions and so on. All that will give people a much stronger say in the services they are getting.

<a name="stpa_52">Building on what was a most successful public engagement that helped to bring forward new ideas from the public in the &quot;your say&quot; consultation&#151;I am sorry the hon. Lady dismissed it so readily&#151;we need at local level to achieve far more effective engagement of local people, particularly at an early stage, where there are proposals to reorganise hospital services. In doing that, we need to build on the success of many patient and public involvement forums.

<a name="stpa_53">The hon. Lady mentioned the GP contract. It was a major concern of GPs and the British Medical Association that they did not want to be forced to continue to provide out-of-hours services. The new contract gave them that choice, with the responsibility falling back on PCTs if the local GP practice does not want to provide the out-of-hours service. For the first time, that new contract, which was negotiated three years ago, links the pay of GP practices to higher quality

That would not be a sensible use of NHS resources. Our proposal, which we have already discussed with members of our citizens panel and which is undoubtedly welcome, will result in people in high-risk groups getting the additional support and advice, and in some cases further tests, that they need. By piloting it in the most disadvantaged areas in the spearhead PCTs, we will ensure that it reaches the people who are most in need. I regret that the hon.

 Members on both sides of the House will commend the Secretary of State&#039;s statement that we need to do more to provide more services within local communities.

Andover hospital, for example, is about to lose general anaesthetics. Can she now answer the question that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) asked: what will she do to ensure that, in her words, &quot;community facilities that are needed for the long term are not lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures&quot;, when those pressures actually come from her Department?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60130-08_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Those financial pressures come from the fact that in a few areas of the country, there has been over-spending on NHS budgets, even at a time when, year on year, the NHS is receiving more money than ever before, including in north-west Hampshire. As well as publishing the White Paper, I am ensuring that primary care trusts that are considering the closure of community facilities, and particularly community hospitals, review those in the light of the clear strategy that we have spelled out in the White Paper to ensure that they have the facilities that will be needed as more services are moved out of acute hospitals into the community. That is not only better for patients, which must be our No.1&nbsp;concern, but provides better value for money.

Must that not also include a significant improvement in pay and terms and conditions for care and support workers who are currently in short supply, many of whom are paid even less than those who stack shelves in supermarkets?

I very much hope that they will involve all NHS staff in identifying the waste and inefficiency that need to be rooted out to secure better value for money.

That happens in the case of too many social services budgets, and has an adverse impact on the elderly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60130-09_spnew4"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I think that it was absolutely right to remove the ring fence. Local responsibility and local accountability are important when it comes to decisions about priorities. We are strengthening local area agreements, however, to ensure that local authorities&#151;in partnership with other agencies, including the NHS&#151;achieve the targets to which they have committed themselves, so that their objectives are realised and resources flow to where they are needed.

 How will the Secretary of State&#039;s proposals affect the voluntary sector, especially services such as the senior citizen link line based in Bilston, in my constituency, which was visited recently by her colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)? The service, run by volunteers, telephones 1,000&nbsp;elderly people in Wolverhampton on a weekly basis. It supports patients who come out of hospital, accompanies them to the GP&#039;s surgery, and performs a series of other services which enable them to look after themselves in their own homes. What will the Department do to support such services in Wolverhampton and elsewhere?
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60130-09_spnew6"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has made an important point. I am delighted to congratulate the link line on its excellent work in supporting elderly people in particular.

<a name="60130-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_57">We have already announced the investment of an additional &#163;80&nbsp;million in telecare services that will make it even easier for elderly and, indeed, disabled people to be supported in their homes. I believe that there is an increasing role for the voluntary sector and social enterprises in providing services for, in particular, groups in the community to whose needs they may be especially attuned. The social enterprise unit that we are creating in the Department will help to support those third-sector providers.

 What steps does the Secretary of State plan to take to end the confusion that exists between NHS and social services departments about what constitutes free care and what constitutes means-tested care, given last week&#039;s judicial review judgment that the Department&#039;s NHS continuing care guidance was flawed and was resulting in frail and vulnerable people being charged for care that should be free?
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60130-09_spnew8"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As we say in the White Paper, there are two different systems of funding, which can sometimes cause confusion in the agencies themselves and among people receiving care. However, the personal health and social care plans that we shall put in place, starting with the 250,000&nbsp;or so people with the most complex needs, will help to make much clearer to everybody what services are being provided within the NHS, free at the point of need, and what may need to be charged for within the framework of the local authority assessment. We shall publish a national framework shortly, which will also help to clarify matters.

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s statement, particularly her aim to create a primary care-led, prevention-oriented NHS, especially as regards chronic diseases and inequalities. In my area, however, the acute trust employs 611&nbsp;nurses while the primary care trust, which covers roughly the same area, employs only 176&nbsp;community nurses and 49&nbsp;practice nurses. What steps will my right hon. Friend take to address the huge inequality and imbalance between the secondary care and primary sectors so that we can start to make a real difference to primary care?

 I very much welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s comments. He is, I think, the only general practitioner in the House at the moment, and he makes an important point. As more services are delivered in the community and as resources shift towards prevention and support in the community for people with long-term conditions, we should expect more of our staff, particularly nursing staff, to be employed in the community rather than in acute hospital trusts. Many nurses across the country would welcome that, and both the stronger commissioning role of primary care trusts and practice-based commissioning will help to ensure that that shift in resources takes place.

 The Government were elected on a manifesto promising encouragement of community hospitals in our national health service.

Whatever the arguments are about finance and deficits, that is simply unacceptable to my constituents.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60130-09_spnew12"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will, I know, welcome the fact that there are more than 1,800&nbsp;more nurses and more than 1,400&nbsp;more doctors in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire than there were eight years ago. On proposals for local service reconfiguration, I can say that the proposals need to be developed locally by the primary care trusts in consultation with local people. They need to be subject to extensive local consultation, and they would come to me if they were referred to me by one of the overview and scrutiny committees. I believe that that is the right process. The important thing is for the primary care trusts to examine their proposals in the light of our White Paper and to ensure that they consult local people on the best way forward.

 I, too, welcome the patient-centred approach to health care and the much-needed focus on prevention. May I draw the Secretary of State&#039;s attention to the all-party group on breast cancer&#039;s report on screening, which recommends increasing flexibility for breast screening services? It found that one in six women who miss an appointment do so because the appointment was not convenient. They never get around to rearranging it. Will the Secretary of State outline what will be done to ensure that breast screening is more patient-centred?

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60130-09_spnew14"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an enormously important point that underlines the importance of designing services as much as possible around the needs of the individual. With hospital appointments, for instance, we are already giving people a choice of at least four hospitals or clinics for an acute operation. As choose and book is rolled out, it will be possible to book a convenient appointment for the patient through the electronic system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_58">As we move of the screening services into the community, it will be much easier for patients to get an appointment at the time they need it, rather than one that they are simply told to turn up for.

 I welcome the emphasis on mental well-being and the greater use of psychological therapies, but I am puzzled as to how that can happen.

 I welcome the statement, but does my right hon. Friend agree that the best primary care trusts, such as Staffordshire Moorlands, are already pioneering much preventive work? For instance, the trust has introduced community matrons to work with vulnerable patients to prevent emergency admissions to hospitals, deep vein thrombosis testing, prevention of falls programmes and GPs&#039; surgeries every Saturday and Sunday in the local community hospital.
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60130-10_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The work that her primary care trust and many others are doing in developing exactly that approach is the foundation on which we have created the White Paper. Many examples of excellent practice are given throughout the White Paper, including the use of community matrons&#151;one of our innovations&#151;to support people who need long-term care. What we now need to do is seize the opportunity that stronger commissioning and practice-based commissioning give us to ensure that the best practice in some parts of the country becomes the norm in every part of the country.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. When we set out the criteria for PCTs that were looking at new boundaries, we said that they needed to satisfy themselves and us that they would be able both to have effective commissioning of acute hospital services and to maintain the focus on local communities, especially the most disadvantaged. Where there is general public support for a proposal to merge several primary care trusts into a much larger area, one of the issues we will consider is how we may sustain that local focus and, in particular, how we may ensure that funding continues to go to the areas that need it most.

 I am happy to make it clear that in the first instance the NHS life check will not be carried out by GPs or nurses.

For people in high risk categories who may need more than the support of a health trainer, there would be follow-up by a nurse practitioner, a GP or some other qualified clinician.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Can the Speaker give help and guidance to provide more time for Members who have questions on the Order Paper? During Department for Culture, Media and Sport Question Time only seven Members whose names were on the Order Paper were called, whereas during Church Commissioners questions eight names on the Order Paper were called. Is it possible either that Ministers responding could be asked to give briefer answers or that the time for Church questions could be reduced so that the time for questions to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport could be increased?

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. In a sense, I am the wrong Member to raise this point of order, as you were kind enough to call me during the statement, but I noticed that Front Benchers&#039; questions and answers took almost three quarters of an hour of the hour and five minutes for the statement, which is unprecedented in my 14&nbsp;years as a Member of Parliament. Will you, Madam Deputy Speaker, be kind enough to draw that to Mr. Speaker&#039;s attention to see whether discussions between the usual channels could take place so that ministerial statements and questions could be kept a little shorter to give the large number of Back Benchers who could not get in today the chance to speak in future on important subjects such as the statement that we heard today?

 Six days ago, I was stopped mid-sentence when referring to Splott market, and hon. Members may or may not recall that the purpose of my mentioning the market in Splott or any other marketplace in Wales was to try to bring to the House&#039;s attention the fact that constitutional matters, such as those that we are discussing, may be of enormous interest to us, as politicians, and perhaps to academics, but the Bill and any legislation passed by the House of Commons and the House of Lords refers to people&#039;s lives. Hon. Members will recall that, over the past one and a quarter hours, the House has been dealing with an extremely important matter regarding the health service. So I make no apology to the House for saying that the basis for every Bill that we consider must be an improvement in the services that our people receive in Wales. However, we must understand that the way in which the Assembly Members are held to account by the people of Wales through the ballot box is also of great interest to our constituents. The amendment refers to the need to have proper consultation in the months ahead on the nature of the electoral system&#151;in particular, the so-called top-up system&#151;under which the National Assembly for Wales is elected.

Members look at clauses 8&nbsp;and 9&nbsp;or paragraph 57&nbsp;of the explanatory notes, they will see a rather convoluted and complicated description of how the so-called top-up Members are elected. That is for us to consider, but I recall that when I left the polling station after voting during the first election to the Assembly, a little old lady came out with me, clutching what she thought was a manifesto or an election address from a political party. As it turned out, it was the second ballot paper for the top-up Members. She asked me what to do with it, and I suggested that she should go back into the polling station and vote according to her conscience. But she did not know what that paper represented, and there had been plenty of publicity about the nature of the second electoral system.

<a name="60130-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">The figures speak for themselves about how it is that our constituents do not understand what it is that they do when they go into the polling station to vote in the second ballot. For example, my constituency is in the South Wales East region, which has almost 500,000&nbsp;electors. At the last election&#151;this applies to all parties other than mine&#151;the Liberal Democrat, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael German, won. He gained 17,661&nbsp;second votes out of 500,000&#151;3.76&nbsp;per cent. of the people in South Wales East. At the same time, he stood for my constituency&#151;Torfaen&#151;and received 2,746&nbsp;votes. Of course, he did not win, but he did win in the ballot for the top-up seats. It is virtually impossible for people in our constituencies to understand how it is that they pile up their votes&#151;for example, in South Wales East, for Labour&#151;yet none of them count in determining the second group of people who are elected to the National Assembly for Wales. Therefore, we need to take a very serious look at that system. Proportionality seems to be the answer for the second ballot. Why do people who elect Assembly Members not have them elected on the basis of proportionality and according to the votes that they cast?

That time was the high-water mark for nationalism in Wales, and the nationalists had a runaway success; ever since then they have been in continuous decline, and I think that that will go on into the next Assembly elections. The winner won, and the first-past-the-post system clearly identified who the people of Ynys M&#244;n wanted as their Assembly Member. I was the runner-up, yet through the list system the Conservative, who came third, was elected as an Assembly Member. The runner-up was out of the game, but the candidate who came third was elected.

When people vote for the National Assembly for Wales on a second ballot, they are voting for a party to represent them in that region, so many thousands of people are disfranchised because of the current d&#039;Hondt system, which is there to help the minority parties and other parties that do not win constituency seats.

It was especially graceless because the hon. Lady intervened on me in our debate last Tuesday to ask me a question to which I gave a straight reply; she is clearly not accustomed to that.

 On a historical point, there was no Wales-wide Government prior to the Acts of Union. There were various Marcher lordships, which were pretty much a law unto themselves, and Welsh-speaking feudal lords, who controlled other areas. There was no Wales from the point of the view of government and it is therefore not correct to say that Welsh was the language used in government before the 1532&nbsp;Act.

<a name="60130-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">Our amendment would provide not for full equality, but for a reasonable and gradual move in that direction. It would allow for circumstances in which Welsh need not be used on the same basis as English, but that would involve exceptional cases in which it would not reasonably be possible to do so, in contrast to the provisions in the 1993&nbsp;Act. We hold that that would be entirely reasonable, because we do not want the language to be used when it would be unreasonable to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">I shall give the House a brief example, involving some work that I did before I was elected to the House. I was proof-reading a quality assurance manual in Welsh, although it was going to be superseded in four months. I was paid quite well for doing the work, but it was a complete waste of time. We would not want to see the Welsh language being used if it were unreasonable to do so. However, we believe that such cases would be exceptional.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">Given the exemplary development of the Assembly&#039;s simultaneous translation service, the quality of its translations, the large number of Assembly Members who speak Welsh or who have learnt it&#151;very well indeed, to their credit&#151;and the growing number of Assembly staff who speak Welsh, it would be entirely possible to introduce the provisions in our amendment. It would be quite proper for the National Assembly for Wales to treat equally the two languages that are widely used in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_96">A growing number of young people speak Welsh as the result of educational changes introduced by the previous Conservative Government and by this Government, and I pay proper tribute to those Governments for doing that. Changes in the demography of Wales mean that more young people than older people speak Welsh, and there is a growing use of the Welsh language by private businesses. The National Assembly could give a clear lead by treating the Welsh language more equally, if I can put it like that. I shall be interested to see whether the Minister argues that the present situation&#151;which is characterised by the Welsh language being treated unequally&#151;is acceptable, given the advantages of our amendments. They would provide for the principle being breached in exceptional circumstances.

<a name="stpa_100">As I said earlier, the principle behind the Welsh Language Act 1993&nbsp;was to treat the Welsh and English languages on a basis of equality, but there has been dissatisfaction with the way in which the Act has been operated. However, given that we have the Act, even in its present form, it would seem reasonable that Ministers should be able to act to support its implementation.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_101">This amendment should also be considered in the context of the First Minister&#039;s decision to bring the Welsh Language Board into the Welsh Assembly Government.

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_102">The 1993&nbsp;Act set up the board, which carries out certain functions. It seems to me that, for the board to disappear, we might need another language Act. If it were set up by an Act, it should be taken into the Welsh Assembly Government by another Act. On that, the First Minister is equally unclear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_103">There is then the question of the regulatory functions of the board. The First Minister talks about setting up an office of y dyfarnwr, which means the adjudicator or the referee. It is unclear to me on what legal basis that office would be set up, as there is no reference to such a person in the 1993&nbsp;Act. What power will he or she have to ensure the proper implementation of that Act? Where are these ideas laid out? I have no idea; perhaps the Secretary of State has. Whatever the fate of the Welsh Language Board in 2007, given that uncertainty, we would argue that it is feasible for Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government to be able to support the implementation of the 1993&nbsp;Act.

<a name="60130-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_104">Lastly, amendment No. 124&nbsp;and new clause 10&nbsp;are more contentious, or perhaps less.

That is a peculiar exception. It would apply only to the Welsh language and to no other field. There are several reasons for proposing it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_105">I have already referred to the widespread dissatisfaction with the 1993&nbsp;Act. By the way, that Act was introduced in the face of much opposition from no other person than the First Minister, Mr. Rhodri Morgan, who was a Member of Parliament at that time and, I think, shadow Secretary of State. He promised the House that the new Labour Government would introduce a proper Welsh language Act, but, eight years later, we are still waiting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_106">In those circumstances, why should not the Assembly have the opportunity to use its power to introduce such a measure? The First Minister and, I think, the Culture Minister in Cardiff, as well as, possibly, the Government here, have already said that they will not expend a single moment of Government time on introducing a new Welsh language Act. If the Government will not do it, although they promised through Mr. Rhodri Morgan in 1992&nbsp;to do so, why should the Assembly be prevented from doing so in 2007, without having to wait?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-15_para15">

Interestingly, there is a coalition of thought across Wales, across a number of groups in Wales and across a number of political parties in Wales that we need to look again at the 1993&nbsp;Act.

The Secretary of State, in other arguments, talks about the need for the National Assembly to bed in. He has said that we need some time for it to prove its worth. The 1993&nbsp;Act has had ample time to do so. I do not want to discuss the merits or otherwise of that Act, and I pay tribute to Lord Roberts for his work on it, but the day has come to look at it again. Given its deficiencies and the pressures for reform, and given the Government&#039;s refusal to make time here, there is a strong case for the Assembly to have the power to pass a measure on this quintessentially Welsh issue.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60130-16_spnew3"><b> Hywel Williams: </b> 
 Amendment No. 33&nbsp;refers to hunting with dogs, which has been the subject of much controversy in this place. I had the dubious pleasure of serving on the Standing Committee that considered the Hunting Bill for many weeks. We discussed the issue very fully, and one of my amendments proposed that the Assembly should have responsibility for hunting in Wales. I shall briefly rehearse the arguments that I presented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_124">Agriculture is a devolved matter, and I think it fair to say that the Welsh Assembly Government and the Assembly have established amicable relationships with the farming unions in Wales. Farming in Wales has profited greatly from the existence of the Assembly. Agriculture in Wales differs from agriculture in England in that we have a great deal of upland farming, and fox predation is a considerable problem. Hunting, too, is different: there are many farmers&#039; hunts and, I understand, miners&#039; hunts in the south. Farmers&#039; hunts are essentially a co-operative activity. The co-operation is similar to that between farmers at harvest time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_125">A number of practical issues have come to my attention since the passing of the Bill that became the Hunting Act 2004. I think that that is a good argument for a change so that the Welsh Assembly can take a view. One of the issues is the effect of fox predation. We have a number of forests in Wales, run by the Forestry Commission and others. The commission lets contracts for hunting, because it recognises the difficulties caused by fox predation to upland farmers in particular. The hunts are finding it extremely difficult to control fox numbers in upland areas where there is forestry. There is a strong feeling in the country that the issue needs to be revisited. I think it appropriate for the Assembly to deal with it, at least in respect of upland farming, and to take the heat out of the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_126">Amendment No. 38, another amendment tabled by members of my party, refers to railway heritage. There are many small lines in Wales&#151;great little lines. There are three in my constituency. I have no idea why the Assembly should not have some say in the development of the lines. That would accord with its control over tourism. I favour an integrated approach.

: Amendment No. 33&nbsp;makes sense to us on purely devolutionary grounds. I accept that there were different views on whether hunting with dogs should be curtailed, but&#151;leaving aside the position that each of us took at the time&#151;surely anyone who feels that Wales should have parity with Scotland in terms of powers will recognise that the matter was devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Therefore, it seems reasonable that this issue, too, should be devolved to the Welsh Assembly.

<a name="stpa_127">The hon. Member for Caernarfon eloquently described farmers&#039; specific concerns about the Hunting Act.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60130-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. Roger Williams </b> 
: I, too, wish to speak about hunting with dogs. The points have been well made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) and my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), but hunting in Wales is not just about fox hunting as we know it; hunting with dogs involves flushing out foxes to guns, and it has been conclusively demonstrated that the element of the law that limits the number of dogs that may be used in that pursuit to two is quite inadequate and does not achieve the intended object. Given that different ways and means can be used to achieve things in Wales, it is appropriate that the matter be devolved.
</p>

<a name="60130-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_128">The amount of land in Wales owned by the Ministry of Defence has been brought to my attention. The MOD has responsibility for pest control in those areas. How will it carry out that duty if the letter of the law as currently expressed is adhered to?

<a name="stpa_129">Finally, there is the question of energy. As we go towards the energy review and the possibility that nuclear power will be part of the recipe for providing energy for the United Kingdom, I believe that the question of whether nuclear plants are allowed in Wales should be within the Assembly&#039;s planning powers. For those reasons, I support the amendments.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60130-16_spnew6"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> 
: I have some sympathy with the amendment. I have made it fairly clear that I do not in general favour more powers for the Welsh Assembly, but there is the occasional circumstance in which there might be some logic to them. An active agriculture Department is already up and running in the Welsh Assembly, which is responsible for payments to farmers. The payments may at some point be affected by whether farmers allow hunts to take place on their land, particularly if the hunts are found to be doing anything illegal, which I am sure will not happen in Wales and which certainly does not happen in Monmouthshire among the hunts with which I am closely connected. On this occasion, there is a good reason for considering whether a power might be best devolved to Wales and dealt with by the agriculture Department there and by the many Assembly Members who have first-hand experience of agriculture.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60130-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 I have some sympathy with the amendment on hunting with dogs. The difficulty, which we must face up to and which comes even more to the fore on the amendments to do with prisons, probation and the police, is that if we are to have a unified legal system, as England and Wales do, then while it is possible to have diversity within regulatory frameworks, to start to move towards dealing with fundamental issues of law and to have a divergence would mean that the principles of a unified legal system became increasingly difficult to operate. Of course, that applies more strongly to the police than to issues such as hunting with dogs. It could be argued that hunting with dogs falls within the regulatory framework, not that of fundamental legal principles. It is a difficult area, but as long as the people of Wales wish to see the maintenance of the union between Wales and England, with a measure of devolution and the retention of the principle of a unified legal system&#151;which is one of the underpinnings of that union&#151;we should be wary before we split the responsibilities for certain legal areas between London and Cardiff.

<a name="stpa_130">The amendments seek to expand the competency of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the National Assembly in various areas. On broadcasting, there is an anomaly in the devolution settlement: cultural policy is devolved and will continue to be so, but broadcasting remains entirely a reserved matter.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60130-17_spnew3"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 I understand the principle behind the hon.

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60130-17_spnew4"><b> Adam Price: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is well made in the context of recent events&#151;it would be inappropriate to go into detail at the moment. The issue of the arm&#039;s length principle in cultural policy is a broader question. I have some sympathy for the continental European model of Ministries of Culture, but in that instance it is for the Ministers involved to use those powers responsibly. That may not have happened in the case to which the hon. Gentleman refers.

Broadcasting will need to remain a competency at the UK level, but these proposals do not even allow for the possibility of shared competency. Given the likelihood of further developments, such as television through the internet, the clear dividing line in legislative competence in this Bill will not be conducive to such developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_132">Competition policy is a wholly reserved matter under this Bill, as it is under the Scotland Act 1998, but there are areas of confusion where competition policy has an impact on devolved matters. One example is the confusion over changes in pharmacy regulation that the Office of Fair Trading wanted to introduce some years ago to give supermarkets the power to increase their market share and to deregulate the sector. There was confusion about where legislative competence lay, as obviously there was an impact on health, which was devolved in Wales and Scotland, yet it was also a competition matter. Allowing some degree of shared competence in competition policy would clarify where legislative competence lies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_133">The proposals for the postal service are probably the most bold and radical in the group of amendments. As the Liberal Democrats have raised the spectre of Post Office privatisation, perhaps we should devolve responsibility for postal services or give the National Assembly the ability to get involved in their regulation. There is no guarantee about the future operation of postal services and we are all well aware of what has happened under the recent closure programme for urban and rural post offices.

<a name="60130-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_134">Finally, I return to the St. David&#039;s day public holiday&#151;an issue that I have raised with Secretary of State on several occasions. It is part of the wish list that the Welsh Assembly Government have sent as part of their legislative demands. Unfortunately, the Government at Westminster have not seen fit to accede to those demands. It should not be a matter of wish lists; it should be the right of the elected representatives of the people of Wales through their Government to decide whether we, like most other EU nations, should have an annual public holiday on our national day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">There may be a case for a public holiday on St. George&#039;s day, although this is not the time for that debate, but we in England and Wales have only eight public holidays by right, which is the lowest number in any EU country apart from the Netherlands. Of course, workers in the Netherlands are entitled to more annual leave, so there is a compensatory allowance. As the Secretary of State will know, there are 10&nbsp;annual public holidays in Northern Ireland. We are asking only for one extra day, not two.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_136">Bank holidays are entirely devolved to the Scottish Parliament and discussions about creating a national day are ongoing there. I understand that there has been reference to the possibility of creating a new annual British national day&#151;for example, on Trafalgar day&#151;so, surely, under the Bill the National Assembly for Wales and the Labour Government in the National Assembly should be given the right, for which they have asked, to have the same devolved competence as the Scottish Parliament so that, like most EU countries, we can have a public holiday on our national day.

The clause could be far reaching and damaging. Members from throughout the Assembly have said that it does not treat them in an adult manner and used other quite flowery language.

<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60130-19_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 This clause is about the Welsh Seal and the Letters Patent and I did not want it to pass by completely unnoticed. When I saw that it was in the Bill, I was absolutely fascinated and wanted to do a little research so that I could ask the Minister a couple of questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_162">The Great Seal of the Realm, the chief seal of the Crown, is used to show the monarch&#039;s approval of important state documents. In today&#039;s constitutional monarchy, the sovereign still acts on the advice of the Government of the day, but the seal remains an important symbol of the sovereign&#039;s role as Head of State and goes back, I believe, to the 11th century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_163">The seal meant that the monarch did not have to sign every official document in person and authorisation could be carried out instead by an appointed officer. I can find reference to the separate seals that exist for Scotland&#151;the Great Seal of Scotland&#151;and for Northern Ireland, but I found little if any reference to a Welsh seal. My first question for the Minister therefore is whether this is the first Welsh seal ever. If so, is it not right and proper to mark its arrival in the Bill and eventually in statute by holding a short debate?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_164">Her Royal Highness Her Majesty the Queen has had to have two seals in the time that she has been on the throne. The Great Seal of the Realm&#151;the monarch&#039;s stamp of approval&#151;has worn out because it has been used approximately 5,000&nbsp;times since 1953. In 2001, Her Majesty had to have a new seal commissioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_165">If this is the first Welsh seal, it is an historic moment. However, my second question is about how it will be used. The Great Seal matrix is obviously used to cover a wide range of documents requiring royal approval, including Letters Patent and royal proclamations, commissions and some writs. Can the Minister therefore tell us whether the Welsh seal will be used in relation to the writs for the election of Members to this place? The seal is also used for documents that give power to sign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ratify treaties. At the moment, about 100&nbsp;documents a year pass under the Great Seal. Will the Minister tell us how it is envisaged that the Welsh seal will be used and the documents for which it will be used?

<p>
<a name="60130-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_166">Interestingly enough, when the sealing occurs in the other place in the office of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, the seals are colour coded. Dark green seals are affixed to letters patent that elevate individuals to the peerage. Blue seals are used for documents relating to close members of the royal family and the scarlet-red seal is used for the appointment of bishops and most other patents. As part of a run around the field of the history of our great countries and in view&#151;hopefully&#151;of a big mark in the history of Wales, will the Minister tell us how he envisages the Welsh seal and how it will be used?

The seal is relevant in the context of Royal Assent because clause 114(4) provides that Royal Assent is given only when letters patent under the Welsh seal are signed with Her Majesty&#039;s own hand to signify her assent to a Bill.

 There are two points behind our amendments in the group, both of which are crucial to the future capacity and legitimacy of the Welsh Assembly. The first refers to the fundamental point of how big we want the Assembly to be. The Government seem deeply opposed to increasing the size of the institution. Our primary concern is the quality of the scrutiny to which legislation in the Assembly will be subjected. One does not have to be Carol Vorderman to work out the maths. If a party with 30&nbsp;Members forms the Government of a 60-Member Assembly, and thus appoints 12&nbsp;Ministers and deputy Ministers along with a presiding officer, it is left with 17&nbsp;Members to make up a majority on all the Committees. If one accepts that no Committee can be properly run with fewer than eight Members, one is left with a maximum of four Committees. However one does the sums, one is left with an unsatisfactory answer.

The main argument for the increase is the extra work load that will accompany the Assembly&#039;s additional powers. However, as the hon. Lady and the House know, the Assembly meets in plenary session only two days a week. Indeed, it meets only on two afternoons a week, between 2&nbsp;pm and 5.30&nbsp;pm on Tuesday and Wednesdays, and for rather fewer weeks in the calendar year than the House. Indeed, the Presiding Officer, Lord Elis-Thomas, has suggested that the Assembly&#039;s timetable could easily be based on a much longer working year, rather than the 33&nbsp;weeks that appear to be current practice. He suggested that the Assembly sit on Monday afternoons and Thursday mornings as well as Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Indeed, he was admirably frank in an interview published on Boxing day in the <i>Daily Post</i>:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;I agree with the Secretary of State, we all have to work harder here.

That work load will be even greater after primary powers are implemented, if a successful referendum is called in the next decade or thereafter. I agree with Lord Elis-Thomas.

However, that would alter the balance between list and constituency Members, with constitutional and political consequences, so I did not think that it was right to proceed with such a provision. Primary legislation would therefore be needed. If that were the case, we would need comprehensively to rethink the electoral system in a way that is neither possible nor desirable in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_193">Amendment No. 67&nbsp;and related amendments propose that the Assembly&#039;s electoral system should be changed, and that the single transferable vote system should be introduced. The Plaid Cymru amendment proposes that the 80&nbsp;Assembly Members should be elected from the five regional constituencies which were formerly used for the election of MEPs and which would be created from the existing electoral regions. Each constituency would return 16&nbsp;Members. That is a fundamental change, and it would mean that Assembly Members would serve gigantic constituencies, both geographically and in terms of the number of electors. It would damage severely the important link between constituency Assembly Members and the people they serve. The Mid and West Wales constituency, for example, would stretch from Harlech to Welshpool and from Fishguard to Crickhowell, and would thus be an enormous area to try to represent. The North Wales constituency would extend from Holyhead to Wrexham, and South Wales West from Gower to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 77</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bridgend, and so on. Two of the constituencies would have almost 0.5&nbsp;million electors, and even the smallest would have nearly 400,000.

 Under the status quo, the North Wales is exactly as the right hon. Gentleman describes. At the first Assembly election, Simon Thomas, who represented Ceredigion in the House, served as a list Member for an area extending from Eglwysbach in the Conwy valley in the north of my constituency, five minutes from Llandudno, all the way down to Fishguard. Things were far worse than they would be under our proposal.
</p>





<p><a name="st_263"><a name="60130-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That takes us to list Members as opposed to constituency Members, who represent constituencies of a manageable size. If the people who elect constituency Members do not like them, they can get rid of them. The problem with the STV system is that it is difficult to get rid of a particular Member whom the electorate think is underperforming or with whom they disagree politically. The STV system breaks the fundamental principle at the heart of our parliamentary system&#151;the link between the elected Member and their constituency&#151;which still forms the base for our devolved legislatures.

 Changing how we elect our Members of the European Parliament has not been a happy experience. From my vantage point in Welsh Labour, although I guess that this is generally true, I have noticed that individual Members of the European Parliament used to have a relationship with their constituency. They were able to attend civic functions and party meetings, which led to the constant injection of European issues into the wider political culture. Since that relationship was broken, accountability has not been the same. In retrospect, whatever the advantages of that change&#151;it was introduced to try to obtain fairer representation&#151;it served to break the link between MEPs and local electors.

Those proposals would have created lots of constituencies in urban areas, making it easier for Liberal Democrats to get elected in Labour-controlled areas, but a smaller number of constituencies in rural areas, where it would have been more difficult for Labour Members to get elected. In our democratic system, constituencies are of a relatively manageable size, and if the electorate do not like an individual Member, they boot them out, which is an important feature to retain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_197">Amendment No. 7&nbsp;would confer on the Secretary of State the power by order to change the number of Assembly constituencies. It would not be sensible to give the Secretary of State such an unfettered power, which would have serious democratic consequences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_198">For those reasons, the Government are not willing to accept the amendment. We propose to retain the existing electoral system, which we will improve. After improvement, the system will still have imperfections, but it will have far fewer imperfections than the fundamentally flawed STV system.

 I am not satisfied by the Secretary of State&#039;s response. For the Liberal Democrats, this is a matter of principle. We think it important that people get what they vote for, which is why I have no alternative but to divide the Committee.

</p>



<br>
<center><a name="amdthd_9">Power to Vary date of Ordinary General Election</center><br>


<p><a name="st_271"><a name="60130-24_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I beg to move amendment No. 196, page 2, line 35, leave out &#039;one month&#039; and insert &#039;three months&#039;.
</p>





<p><a name="st_272"><a name="60130-24_spmin0"><b>The Second Deputy Chairman:</b> 
 With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 197, in clause 4, page 2, line 36, leave out &#039;one month&#039; and insert &#039;three months&#039;.
</p>





<p><a name="st_273"><a name="60130-24_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The amendments need not take up the Committee&#039;s time. I am sure that the Secretary of State appreciates that they are probing amendments, which cover the powers in the clause to vary the date of the ordinary general election. With the hindsight afforded by the foot and mouth epidemic and perhaps the prospect of an avian flu epidemic, I wanted to ensure that we had built in sufficient flexibility in terms of altering the date and that we were not creating another Procrustean bed on which to tie ourselves in knots. Boxing ourselves into a corner on timing is inappropriate, not least because I would envisage some changes in a state of emergency or circumstances in which the movement of people was undesirable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_205">I should be grateful if the Secretary of State responded in the spirit of the way in which I tabled the amendments, gave us further and better particulars of what would happen if some unforeseen outbreak occurred and explained whether we had the desired flexibility.
</p>





<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60130-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I greatly appreciate the way in which the hon. Lady moved the amendment. She made some important points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_206">Clause 4&nbsp;enables the Secretary of State to change the date of an ordinary general election. However, it must be considered as a reserve power that would come into play only when it was necessary to deal with short-term emergencies, such as foot and mouth disease.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_207">I am concerned that extending the variants to three months either side of the first Thursday in May would give too great a margin of discretion. It could arouse suspicion that a Secretary of State was seeking to move an election date in a way that was politically advantageous to the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_208">The current provision is carried forward from the Government of Wales Act 1998, so the Bill simply re-enacts it. It would cover, for example, circumstances in which the nation was thrown into mourning close to the election date. A more prolonged crisis, which raised the question of whether the election should be postponed, would, and should, be a case for emergency legislation. I do not believe that a power for the Secretary of State to vary an election date by three months should sit on the statute book, because people could claim that it would be used for nefarious purposes, perhaps by a Secretary of State, who, unlike me, was unscrupulous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_209">I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_275"><a name="60130-24_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Secretary of State has considered his response to the amendments, which I shall withdraw. However, perhaps he would undertake to examine the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 83</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>drafting of the clause and ascertain whether anything could be built into it later to cover an emergency so that we did not have to rely on emergency legislation. Circumstances could arise that were purely local to Wales and it would be a shame if the Bill did not include the possibility of extending the time from a month to six weeks in exceptional circumstances.

 I do not think that we are at odds on that, for the simple reason that if people understood the system better they would have no problem with dual candidacy. The Government are particularly confused about this, as the Electoral Commission alleges, perhaps because people are finding it hard to get used to the perception of proportional representation. Certainly, Labour AMs are finding it hard to get used to. They have been used to having things all their own way and I am afraid that this has been a shock to their system, as I have no doubt we will hear again from the Secretary of State.

<a name="stpa_244">The Electoral Commission, in preparing its response, contacted all political parties registered to contest elections in Wales.

A perception exists that the change favours incumbency and the current party of Assembly government that holds the large majority of constituency seats&#151;the Labour party. The conclusion that the Electoral Commission drew on the provision says it all. On the evidence available, it said, it did not believe that a case for a change had been made. The Secretary of State should think hard before going against the opinions of one of our leading independent bodies.

Had the issue been a great concern, even at election time, when preparing the Labour party manifesto, the issue could have been addressed.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;I am confident that if Sir John Arbuthnott had considered the systematic abuses carried out by list Members in Wales, he would have reached exactly the same conclusion as we have&#151;that a ban on dual candidacy is the only effective solution.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>exceedingly carefully, so much so that the Secretary of State will find that the Arbuthnott commission refers to Wales in several places, specifically in paragraph 4.21, which alludes to the parallel situation and, for those Members who are interested, states:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;Referred to in Wales as the &#039;Clwyd West&#039; question, this might in Scotland be called the &#039;Cunninghame South&#039; question&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_251">Wales was therefore at the forefront of the minds of members of the Arbuthnott commission.

Candidates coming in second or third place who are then elected through the regional list are only losers in the context of a first past the post, &#039;winner takes all&#039; electoral system. This logic does not sit well within a proportional system and introducing it devalues and undermines the concept of proportionality.

It is better for the Government of the people to reflect the diversity of the people.

In other countries, such as Spain, France or Italy, most politicians would deliberately put high-ranking, publicly known figures at the top of their lists to attract people to vote in both halves of the election.

I believe that it is inappropriate for us to have that electoral advantage, so I do not believe that we are acting in a partisan way. In fact, for those who make that argument, the measure can be partisan only if they believe we will never lose a constituency seat.

<a name="stpa_294">The most important theology of all in democracy is not only that a person cannot stand in two elections, in two systems, on the same day. Incidentally, we abolished that when Keir Hardie stood in two elections on different days; he failed to be elected on the first day,

<a name="stpa_295">It is essential that we maintain the theology that if a political party puts a measure in its election manifesto, it should have the right to see it put through the electoral process. Members who throw that principle aside do so at their peril.

 I rise to speak to amendment No. 130&nbsp;and to talk about the principle under discussion. I understand the Secretary of State&#039;s dislike of the system as it stands, but having listened to the debate, I can say with fair confidence that, regardless of how inconvenient it may be for some of us that regional list Members may purport to focus primarily on a constituency, there is nevertheless a compelling democratic case to allow that to happen. I start where the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) left off: unless I am very much mistaken, one is entitled to stand for election in two constituencies in a general election. However, if one is elected in both seats, one must decide which to represent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_402"><a name="60130-30_spnew3"><b> Kevin Brennan  (Cardiff, West) (Lab):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is correct about that, as the law stands. The same candidate stood against the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) and me in the general election last year, but under the Electoral Administration Bill, supported by the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat parties, the law that allows that to happen will be abolished.
</p>





<p><a name="st_403"><a name="60130-30_spnew4"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The bottom line is that things have not changed. Furthermore, I have not heard a single hon. Member on either side of the House argue that Britain&#039;s parliamentary processes have been perverted by the opportunity to stand for election in two places. Obviously, by inference, the Secretary of State may want to respond to that point. Let me be clear that I do not disrespect the difference of view&#151;I understand it&#151;but the Liberal Democrat party is concerned that, whatever the motivations of the Secretary of State and others, the provision very much looks like a partisan step, because of the current electoral mathematics of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_296">The provisions are obviously intended to prevent candidates from standing for election on both a constituency and a regional list. We have been discussing the two reasons that Government have cited for that course of action, the first of which is the Clwyd, West problem, whereby candidates who seem to lose constituency elections can become Assembly Members via the list. To paraphrase a member of the Government, people who are losers are seen to be winners. The Government&#039;s second argument is that the provisions will prevent list Members from abusing their position for political advantage. Both arguments have been rehearsed to an extent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_404"><a name="60130-30_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 Many arguments have been cited, but it is still undeniable that such a change would not stop the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 104</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>abuses, as alleged by the Labour party, because a list Member, even if he did not stand for the constituency, could still open an office and say that he was the regional Member based in Rhondda or wherever. So the provision will not stop the very things that Labour Members are bleating about.
</p>





<p><a name="st_405"><a name="60130-30_spnew6"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The hon. Lady makes an accurate point, which is supported by all Opposition Members.
</p>





<p><a name="st_406"><a name="60130-30_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 As someone who has followed the debate closely but who represents an English seat, what I do not understand is why, if Assembly Members are abusing their position, that is not dealt with by Standing Orders in the Assembly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_407"><a name="60130-30_spnew8"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The answer is that the perception of abuse is not an objective interpretation of what is going on; it is a subjective interpretation derived entirely in the minds of Ministers and other Labour Members. Their paranoia causes them to interpret such things as abuse, while other people may interpret them as showing political initiative.
</p>





<p><a name="st_408"><a name="60130-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman recall that Leanne Wood, who was very unfairly mentioned earlier, was completely exonerated by the appropriate Assembly Committee?
</p>





<p><a name="st_409"><a name="60130-30_spnew10"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 That puts me in a difficult position, because I listened with the greatest of interest as Leanne Wood&#039;s words were quoted.

I do not believe that the public really talk about this.

One would imagine that it would act as a magnet for comments, but it did not receive a single piece of evidence on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_304">At the Welsh Affairs Committee, Dr. Roger Scully and Dr. Richard Wyn Jones gave specific evidence that has already been quoted. I shall not repeat it all except to highlight one crucial point:

<p>
<a name="60130-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_306">It is true that the Welsh Affairs Committee was split on this issue.

Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) voted against the proposals in the Bill, as did the three Conservative Members. It is clear that the situation was, at least to those of us who observed it from the outside, motivated by party political interests.

To the best of my knowledge, not one single regulation&#151;either in force, or proposed by the Government&#151;would prevent me from basing my party office in Neath, Rhondda, Ogmore, Ceredigion, or anywhere else.

 I apologise, Mrs. Heal. I was responding directly to the hon. Lady&#039;s intervention, and I would like to add two points of clarification. First, asteroids are rocket science. Secondly, any politician will seek to make a deep impact in his or her neighbourhood. Just as local councillors will seek to maximise the effectiveness of their political operation by basing their offices where they think that would be in the best interests of their party, it is hardly surprising that politicians elected to the Welsh Assembly will seek to maximise the effectiveness of their work, in their party interests as well as in those of the people whom they have been elected to represent, by basing their offices in an expedient fashion.

The danger of using short-term thinking to generate legislation is that it has long-term unintended consequences. Far from solving the problems that the Minister says he is trying to solve, he may be about to introduce something that not only creates a democratic injustice for the candidates but that could be challenged in human rights legislation, as the hon.

 Our debate is an impassioned one, and this part of the Bill has excited more interest and perhaps controversy than any other part. I should like to address three of the main arguments that the Opposition have made against the Government proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_319">First, we hear consistently that this is part of an attempt to enhance the electoral position of the Labour party. It has been suggested that it is an electoral plot, a means of gerrymandering, or an underhand method to pervert the democratic system. It is nothing of the sort. We have all heard those accusations, but we have not heard a single concrete example of the way in which that gerrymandering will be carried out. No one has demonstrated that, and no one can do so. It is possible&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I was hoping that someone would provide an example of the way in which the system could be gerrymandered but, despite the external pops, that is not possible. No one inside or outside the Chamber has demonstrated how the change proposed by the Government could enhance the Labour party&#039;s position. Quite simply, it cannot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_320">In fact, an interesting article by Dr. John Cox, published recently, demonstrates the contrary case. I do not know whether Opposition Members have received a copy, but it has been e-mailed to all Labour Members. Dr. Cox, who is no friend of the Labour party&#151;in fact, he is an implacable opponent&#151;said that the Labour party is wrong if it thinks that the measure will enhance its position. I stress that Labour does not think that way, but Dr. Cox argues that the measure will adversely affect its interests.
</p>





<p><a name="st_430"><a name="60130-32_spnew1"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 I have not had the privilege of reading that comment, but clearly Dr. John Cox thought that the Labour party believed that it was an advantage, otherwise he would not have issued that warning.

<p><a name="st_431"><a name="60130-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 The article by Dr. John Cox is designed principally to create mischief in the Labour ranks. He cites at length the Secretary of State and&#151; accurately, I think&#151;the Under-Secretary. Those arguments speak for themselves, and they are set out clearly. No one&#151;I repeat, no one&#151;has offered a convincing argument or, indeed, any argument at all to explain how the measure will enhance the Labour party&#039;s position.

 I apologise unreservedly to the hon. Gentleman. I was not trying to be ungracious; I was trying to be quick, although it still looks like we will not have time to discuss major provisions in the Bill. If the provision will not affect the smaller parties, why does not the Secretary of State adopt the approach of the Labour party in Wales, which is voluntarily not to stand in constituencies in the list system? That would be perfect, because it would leave the smaller parties, which would be elected only on the list system, to get on with it. The Labour party should adopt that approach as a self-denying ordinance.

<a name="stpa_321">Secondly, the Arbuthnott report suggests that dual candidacy should not be banned in Scotland. However, there is the obvious fact that Wales is not Scotland, and just because something is proposed for Scotland, it does not automatically follow that it should be introduced in Wales. Wales is an independent, freestanding country, and we should not be dictated to by what happens north of the border.

<a name="60130-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_322">The electoral systems in Wales and Scotland are profoundly different, because a larger proportion of Members of the Scottish Parliament are elected by the additional Member system&#151;in Scotland, the percentage is 42&nbsp;per cent.; in Wales, it is 33&nbsp;per cent.&#151;so we cannot use easy or simplistic parallels. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Those are the facts, which speak for themselves.

<a name="stpa_323">Although I do not want to interfere in Scottish politics, the Arbuthnott report is confused. On the one hand, it argues against dual candidature, but then suggests the introduction of STV for elections to the European Parliament. Where is the logic in that argument? If the report advocates STV for the European Parliament, it should advocate STV for the Scottish Parliament. The argument in the report is not intellectually consistent and does not stand up to careful analysis.

<a name="60130-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_326">The third argument that has been advanced concerns evidence given to the Welsh Affairs Committee by the Electoral Reform Society and others. As I pointed out earlier, that evidence was far more balanced than Opposition Members have suggested. It is important to say that the Electoral Reform Society emphasised, above all else, that there is a great deal of misunderstanding among most people as regards the electoral system and how it works. That is the essential point that it wished to convey. It is therefore hardly surprising that it was able to conclude that it had had very few representations made to it about inherent unfairness in the system.

However, the system at least has an intellectual coherence, which the Bill would remove. Although the Secretary of State claimed that the clause would make no difference, does not the hon.

Intrinsic to that referendum was the voting system that the Labour Government put in place. It was their system, not ours. It is simply not good enough that, seven or eight years after the referendum, they have decided that it does not quite suit their purpose to continue with that system, and that they are going to change it.

No one has ever complained to me about that electoral process in any of the many surgeries that I have held. However, let us take that criticism head-on. It would still be perfectly possible for any of us to stand as a councillor in any ward in our constituencies. Plenty of wards in my Monmouthshire constituency vote Labour, and I probably would not get elected if I stood as a councillor in any of them. However, I would still represent those wards as their Member of Parliament.

There is no evidence of any such confusion, except that of the Bevan foundation&#151;which is very independent, I am sure; it was set up a few years ago by some Labour party members&#151;which was cited by the hon.

However, if constituency Assembly Members are doing their job properly, they should have absolutely nothing to fear in that regard. It has certainly been my experience as a constituency Assembly Member that the first person to whom a constituent will go with a problem is their Member of Parliament, regardless of the problem and of who should deal with it. The second person they go to is their constituency Assembly Member. In fact, most people are unaware of who their regional list Members are, which is a matter that those Members might want to address. There is no reason for any constituency Assembly Member to be concerned about an office opening up in their constituency; if they have been doing their job properly, they will have nothing to worry about.

He has yet to tell us&#151;no doubt he will do so when he sums up&#151;how he came to that conclusion. Had he spoken to Sir John Arbuthnott? The Arbuthnott commission quotes extensively from the evidence given on Wales, all of it against the Secretary of State&#039;s position, in coming to its conclusion that to rule out dual candidacy would be &quot;undemocratic&quot; and a protection of the hegemony of one political party.

Lord Steel, the former Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament&#151;we have heard lots about Scotland this evening, even though this is a debate on Wales&#151;has also supported the Government&#039;s policy in this respect. To illustrate the cross-party concern about the issue, I want to put on record a number of other quotes. Lord Carlile, a former leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80">&quot;I am sure that many in Wales will welcome . . . the removal of the absurd dual candidacy opportunity.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_381">Glyn Erasmus, Plaid Cymru regional co-ordinator, said in a letter to <i>The Western Mail</i> on 17&nbsp;December 2005:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82">&quot;with the vast majority of regional list seats being taken up with constituency candidates there is a blockage that excludes other people from coming to prominence. This means that the &#039;elite&#039; of a party protect their own elitism by preventing others from gaining a personal profile . . . To finalise with a personal observation, &#039;two bites at the cherry&#039; and &#039;having your cake and eating it&#039; are both universally recognised as symptomatic of selfishness.&quot;</p>

<a name="60130-36_para20">
<a name="stpa_384">I conclude with a few final points. We have heard a whole series of specious arguments in the debate this evening and in the debate in Wales. First, we heard that the proposal&#151;regrettably this point was repeated by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gillan)&#151;could affect the quality of candidates. We have the proposition that bright high-quality candidates actually need two bites at the cherry. These bright candidates in all the opposition parties are so worried about being defeated by the electorates in the constituencies where they stand that they want an insurance policy, an each-way bet and a lifebelt. It is a funny sort of brightness that has no respect for democracy and no respect for the verdicts of the people.
<a name="time_22">

</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-36_para21">
<a name="stpa_385">What are the opposition parties afraid of? What are Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats united in this unholy coalition to seek to defeat the Government on this matter afraid of? I submit that they are afraid of the voters, because what this proposal does and what the Government are seeking to do is put the voters, and not the parties, in charge. It says that if a candidate is defeated in a constituency, that candidate should not pop up on a list as has been happening right the way through. This will affect the Labour party equally, and some may say disproportionately worse than the other parties. It is not a question of party bias.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-36_para22">
<a name="stpa_386">There have been charges of gerrymandering, which is a very serious charge to make. Gerrymandering comes from the process of rigging constituencies and rigging election systems for a particular party to gain party advantage. There is no way at all that any party can gain party advantage from this. Not one seat will change hands. Either a party will win a constituency or it will not. Whether the party wins or not will determine the number of party representatives on the list seat. Banning candidates from standing in both categories does not affect the party outcome at all. It does not affect it by one seat; it does not affect it by one iota. This is another of the specious attacks on the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-36_para23">
<a name="stpa_387">If there has been gerrymandering, it has been by those list Members abusing their position and abusing their Assembly allowances&#151;I think the Assembly ought to address this matter&#151;to set up constituency offices in target seats deliberately to target the Members who beat them the last time. That is an abuse of democracy and one of the reasons why the Government will fight to the very end&#151;and the House of Lords ought to respect our manifesto commitment and the Salisbury convention&#151;to have a clean system in the Welsh Assembly elections and to make sure that the voters are in charge once and for all instead of the parties manipulating the system for their own advantage.

<a name="60130-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_388">The confusion that the Secretary of State says is suffered by the electorate is no such thing. The only confusion that we are seeing is confusion by the Government. They have found themselves with Labour Members facing a problem that has now been identified as the Leanne Wood problem. To deal with that, the Labour party has taken the heavy-handed approach and decided to change the electoral system in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_389">Throughout this debate, we have asked for evidence of the confusion experienced by the electorate and the only evidence that the Secretary of State can give us is a quote from something from the, in his view, independent Bevan Foundation. That research has not been made available to any Members of the House and, when the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) introduced it, he did not even say who had commissioned it, who had paid for it and when it would be available to Members.

 The hon. Lady can have a copy immediately. It is in the British Library and the National Library of Wales; it is widely available. The foundation is entirely independent and it is an entirely independent report. Independence obviously hurts the hon. Lady.

 I will be brief because I do not want to interrupt this. When the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) says, &quot;Members,&quot; does he mean Members&#039; allowances? What aspect of the word &quot;Members&quot; does he mean?

<p><a name="st_508"><a name="60130-37_spnew10"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 Absolutely. I am more than happy to give transparency to hon. Members. The matter has been cleared by the House authorities. The report is independent. It was commissioned from an independent foundation&#151;it is independent research.

<p><a name="st_509"><a name="60130-37_spnew11"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I think that we have established that we are talking about a Labour party report that was commissioned by Labour Members&#151;it is not independent at all. Although we have heard anecdotal allusions to people wishing to change the electoral system, not one scrap of evidence has been put forward.

<p><a name="st_513"><a name="60130-37_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I will try to be helpful to the Chair, but I think that the intervention made by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) is worthy of further scrutiny. Hon. Members have been flinging rather dangerous allegations around the Chamber and effectively accusing Assembly Members of abusing their allowances. If Assembly Members have abused their allowances, that is a matter for the Assembly and its Standing Orders. Such abuses should be catalogued and brought before the proper authorities. I am not entirely sure how the allowances of the hon. Member for Caerphilly are used, but there will be an opportunity&#151;

 On a point of order, Sir Michael. Serious accusations are being made on the Floor of the House. I want to state absolutely categorically that such accusations are deplorable. The report was an independent piece of research that was commissioned from an independent research institute&#151;

<a name="stpa_390">I do not wish to detain the Committee for too long because we have had a long debate on the amendment. To be quite frank, I would be ashamed to be bringing forward such a proposal if I were Secretary of State for Wales. It has been established beyond all reasonable doubt that it is a party political move by the Labour party on behalf of Labour politicians, who have certainly had it all their own way, but now cannot face the competition. It is clear that there has been no demand for such a measure because otherwise evidence would have been put before the Committee, or at least placed in the Library. No other party in the House or the Assembly has demanded a change to the electoral arrangements. Most leading commentators&#151;certainly the Electoral Commission&#151;and many academics have spoken out clearly against the measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_391">There is no doubt that the Secretary of State is putting forward a grubby little measure. He has not even had the decency to discuss it with the Presiding Officer of the Assembly. I wanted to discover how well and even-handedly the Secretary of State had consulted people in the Welsh Assembly, so I read the evidence that the Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 128</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>gave to the Welsh Affairs Committee on 31&nbsp;October 2005. When he was asked whether the White Paper represented the Assembly&#039;s view, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84">&quot;We did not, for example, discuss questions surrounding changes in election rules, or preventing Members from standing for election.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_392">The Secretary of State did not even bother to discuss the matter with the Presiding Officer and I understand from the evidence given by the Presiding Officer that he did not discuss it with the Assembly parliamentary service, either. The Presiding Officer said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">&quot;As I understand it, there has been very little consultation with officials working with us, and with colleagues who are committee clerks and part of the parliamentary service . . .

 The Secretary of State wants me to give way&#151;and I am sure that he has discussed the subject with the Presiding Officer since that was reported on 31&nbsp;October. However, it remains the case that there has been no proper consultation, of which hon. Members have seen any evidence, with the Presiding Officer of the National Assembly.

<p><a name="st_519"><a name="60130-37_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is making an important point, so just for the record, may I say that I have discussed this matter with the Presiding Officer on a number of occasions over a number of months? It has been a live policy for a very long time.

 In that case, the Select Committee evidence from 31&nbsp;October 2005&nbsp;must be incorrect. I expect that the Secretary of State will be speaking to <i>Hansard</i> to get the transcript altered, because that is all down in black and white at paragraphs 145&nbsp;and 146&nbsp;of the evidence.

<p><a name="st_680"><a name="60130-40_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ben Wallace  (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b> 
 I am relieved to have been called for this debate, because it is certainly timely that the constituents of Lancaster and Wyre should be given answers as to their fate if they work in the Department for Work and Pensions across the Fylde coast. The Fylde coast has a number of DWP sites, including Norcross in my constituency, Peel Park, Warbreck in Blackpool, and Lytham St. Annes. I also have numerous constituents who work at the Department&#039;s Preston Dock site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_404">To date, there have been 169&nbsp;redeployments off site from Norcross, and 56&nbsp;on site. According to the Public and Commercial Services union, some 800&nbsp;jobs have already gone as a result of the current review. The job losses are planned not in a consistent and strategic way but in a haphazard way. My experience, after visiting the site, was that a number of civil servants had been told that, as part of the review of manning levels in the Department, their service had been centralised. The Pension Service is an example of that. Those civil servants had been removed from their former role and redeployed on site, perhaps to the Jobcentre Plus service. Having been there for a short time, they were then told by Jobcentre Plus that it was embarking on job cuts, and that they would either be redeployed again off site, or be told to wait until another agency of the Department had decided how to reconfigure the service. All this sounds rather farcical, and it is certainly not good for the civil servants, who want to know where their future lies.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060130/debtext/60130-41.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_681"><a name="60130-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend share my concern that many of these changes seem to be a result not of planning but of events? For example, as the crisis in the Child Support Agency appears to increase, more people have been put into jobs to deal with it, and cuts are having to be made elsewhere; in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, for example.
</p>





<p><a name="st_682"><a name="60130-41_spnew1"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 That is absolutely true. The Gershon review of manning levels is driven not only by financial pressure, efficiency savings and service reconfiguration, but by events. As we have seen, the disastrous CSA is now taking up the headlines and often, therefore, the job redeployment, at the expense of another part of the Department for Work and Pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_405">The way in which people are shuffled around the different agencies shows that the Department does not seem to have a grip on the problem. I mentioned earlier that the off-site and on-site redeployment sounded farcical, but it has happened to dozens of my constituents. I am sad to report that, tomorrow, it will be made public that a further 77&nbsp;employees have been told that they are surplus to requirements. Many of them have already been juggled between one agency to another. That is hardly the way to handle change management, in either the public sector or the private sector. It is certainly not the way to treat civil servants

<br>&nbsp;<br>who have served the Department well, and who have handled many changes under this Government and the previous Conservative Government. The Government owe them a duty to ensure that this change is managed.

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_406">My last visit to the Norcross site was quite disturbing. The morale of the work force is extremely low and people do not know their future or what is around the corner. Indeed, many of the senior management are a long way off site. For example, the director of human resources is based in Sheffield. All those agencies feel left out and certainly do not feel that they are being communicated to properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_407">I hope that the Minister can give us some clear answers tonight and set out a strategy. While she might not have the full detail at her fingertips, I hope that she takes on board the concerns that the work force on the front line have expressed to me, and indeed to my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). I have said that she can contribute to the debate, because it is my view that as long as the cross-party consensus is there to communicate to the Minister the real feeling of the grass roots, she might take some swift and clear action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_408">The Gershon review in 2004&nbsp;embarked on a strong and clear strategy at high level to reduce the massive number of civil servants, some of whom have been employed since 1997, and to improve efficiency. I am not here to debate the rights and wrongs of the Gershon review or to say whether there should be cuts, but I am here to ask the Minister to ensure that those cuts and those changes are properly managed and that the strategy is communicated to everyone on the ground.

 I am sorry, but I cannot give way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_409">I would like the Minister to communicate those changes because the axe fell significantly heavily on the Department for Work and Pensions, where the target is a 30,000&nbsp;reduction in personnel. After the last two years, the Government have made headline figures&#151;reducing Jobcentre Plus and reducing the Pension Service&#151;but little detail has been communicated either to us in the House or to the work force. I hope there is some element of correction tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_410">It is important that the Minister takes on board the low morale of the work force and the fact that they do not really know what is happening. It was sad that the Public and Commercial Services Union had to resort to a 48-hour strike last week. That came not out of greed or a desire for better pay and conditions, but out of a desire for some pay and conditions and for better communication to them. I have to say that I supported members of the union at the Norcross site in that action, if only because it was a cry for help. I hope that they get some answers and are able to sleep better in their beds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_411">The problem with the Gershon review, and indeed the changes, is that the drive for savings and reconfiguration has outpaced the plan for efficiency. Therefore, the cart has been put before the horse. Each agency, according to different timetables and different directorates, is putting in place its view. At the same time, the employees are trying to keep pace with the changes.

<a name="60130-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_412">I have only to point to the evidence given to the Work and Pensions Committee by Ms Strathie, the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus. She explained that the call centre debacle in the summer&#151;about 90&nbsp;per cent. of customers could not get an answer&#151;was due to the muddle between trained and temporary staff, staff off sick and redeployed staff, which affected the delivery of the service. We need to communicate the fact that if such changes are not properly made, planned in advance and communicated, there will be a hotch-potch of trained and experienced staff, as well as a pot-luck effect, that inevitably have a knock-on effect on the service received by my constituents and the whole UK. Therefore, it is vital that that be done.
</p>





<p><a name="st_685"><a name="60130-41_spnew4"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and I congratulate him on securing the debate. We all know what a trusty champion he is of his constituents and their interests. I pay tribute to the DWP staff on the Fylde coast. I have dealt with the disability and careers service on behalf of my constituents. It returned my call and replied to my letters. I am sad to hear that there is such distress at the proposed changes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_686"><a name="60130-41_spnew5"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, which shows that people who treat others well deserve to be treated well themselves. The Government have a duty of care to ensure that those people&#039;s valued service is rewarded, at least with clear strategy and communication.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_413">In closing, I ask that the Minister answer me at least three questions clearly and perhaps give me some undertaking. First, will she say whether the Department is considering offshoring any of the jobs or services currently being carried out by civil servants on the Fylde coast? There have been media reports to that effect, and she would go a long way towards setting people&#039;s minds at rest if she were to rule that out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_414">Secondly, will the Minister review the management process with the director of human resources, or whomever is appropriate, to ensure that employees on the Fylde coast, right down to the front line, understand what is in store and do not have to be faced with surprises every few weeks?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_415">Finally, will the Minister meet me or come with me to her site at Norcross and speak to the workers on the front line to understand their fears and concerns, so that we all know the future of Department for Work and Pensions jobs on the Fylde coast, that the service is delivered efficiently to my constituents as a priority, and that employees of her Department are given the due care, attention and communication that they deserve?

<p><a name="st_687"><a name="60130-41_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Joan Humble  (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) on securing this important debate, which concerns my constituents and his. I also thank him and the Minister for their kindness in allowing me to contribute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para11">
<a name="stpa_416">Until recently, the Fylde coast had about 10,000&nbsp;civil service jobs, which local people took pride in doing, whether they were in the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Health or the Veterans 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 142</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Agency, as Norcross is now the headquarters for war pensions administration. The Department for Work and Pensions is the principal employer. My constituents and those of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre take their jobs seriously. They do important work, helping often vulnerable and disadvantaged people get the benefits that they need and deserve. That job is important to them, to our local economy and to Members throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para12">
<a name="stpa_417">As has been said, Warbreck house in my constituency is the national headquarters for the disability living allowance and provides the national helpline. I visit it on a regular basis and sit alongside the staff manning that helpline who take calls from all over the country and deal with and help people who are often distressed. Now, however, they must face uncertainty about whether they will have a job next week, next month, next year or in two years&#039; time. They need to be part of the process of considering how the Department for Work and Pensions undertakes the job cuts required of it. Everybody, at every level, needs to be part of that discussion. Terry Moran, the chief executive of the Disability and Carers Service, is doing a good job trying to explain to staff who work at Warbreck house exactly what is required of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para13">
<a name="stpa_418">Warbreck house has already had about 700&nbsp;job cuts, but I have been assured in private as the local Member of Parliament and as a member of the Work and Pensions Committee that it will have no further head count reduction. In fact, Warbreck house has seen a transfer in of jobs from Sutton. We might be losing out under Gershon, but we are gaining under Lyons. Given the expertise of those on the Fylde coast who work for the civil service, surely if jobs are to be relocated, they should be relocated to Norcross, Warbreck house and the other establishments whose staff enjoy working for the civil service and the Department for Work and Pensions and do a very good job for it. I therefore hope that, as some jobs are lost and as new information technology systems and methods of working are introduced, the Minister will consider the opportunities for redeployment in those offices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para14">
<a name="stpa_419">Constituents of mine who work at Mexford house, which is part of the Pension Service, have recently raised concerns with me. Again, the irony is that jobs have been transferred from outside&#151;in this case, I think, from Wrexham&#151;to Mexford house. Again, we have well-trained staff doing a very good job; reassuring pensioners, explaining how they can claim pension credit, offering them advice and dealing with their problems. They are now wondering whether they will still be doing that job in two years&#039; time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para15">
<a name="stpa_420">I know that the Minister cannot give us all the answers. She cannot tell me now that all my constituents&#039; jobs will be there in two years&#039; time. I ask her, however, to consider the managerial process for administering the period of change. Because of the uncertainty and the impact on staff morale to which the hon. Gentleman referred, that process must be managed very carefully. The staff must be part of the process, and so must the Public and Commercial Services Union. I too have regular meetings with the union, and I advise the hon. Gentleman&#151;my neighbour&#151;to meet its representatives. They find it difficult to negotiate on behalf of their members, because at Norcross in particular there are so many different units on the site 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 143</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with no coherent overall management. When the union is trying to advise its members on opportunities for redeployment on the Fylde coast, it is not always easy to establish with whom they should be liaising. In the case of a complex site like Norcross, it is important for the DWP to advise the local union and staff on whom they should be talking to, in order to minimise the uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para16">
<a name="stpa_421">I shall not say a great deal more, because I want to hear what the Minister has to say. Let me make two more points, however. Blackpool council also takes the matter seriously, and at a recent meeting passed a resolution expressing its concern about civil service job losses. The council is trying to revitalise the town with large amounts of investment. There are hopes of regeneration, and of new jobs. Given the importance of civil service jobs and of DWP jobs in particular, the council wants some reassurances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-41_para17">
<a name="stpa_422">My final message to the Minister is that the staff who work for the DWP in my constituency and that of my neighbour are not cardboard cut-out bowler-hatted gentlemen; they are ordinary, decent, hard-working people. They are my constituents, and my neighbour&#039;s constituents. They want the Minister to listen, and they want to go on doing their job. They do an excellent job. I hope that the Minister will compliment them on their hard work in this vital area, that she will listen to their genuine concerns, that she will consult them, and that she will ensure that the management liaise with them and offer them reassurance to raise their morale, so that they can do their job even better than they are doing it now.

<p><a name="st_688"><a name="60130-42_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mrs. Anne McGuire): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) on securing the debate, and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) for her contribution. I appreciate that they both consider the issue important not just to those who work for the DWP at Norcross and on the Fylde coast, but to the whole community. My hon. Friend made that clear when she spoke of the local authority&#039;s concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para0">
<a name="stpa_423">I am pleased to have an opportunity to reassure both Members. I hope to present a wider picture of the Department&#039;s efficiency programme. We have a vision for the Department&#151;a vision of a modern organisation delivering a first-class service to clients throughout the community. I hope that both Members share that vision. Changes will be needed to make it a reality. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have invested a significant amount of public money in new information technology and infrastructure systems. We aim to centralise much of our benefit processing, streamline our delivery operations and cut wasteful bureaucracy in all parts of the Department. Again, I trust that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend will support that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_424">We are, in fact, transforming the way in which the Department does its business. It is not an easy challenge, but we are determined to succeed. The modern, more efficient organisation that we are putting in place will, by 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 144</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>design, need fewer staff. Indeed, our efficiency plans are based on a reduction of 30,000&nbsp;staff between March 2004&nbsp;and 2008. We are already almost halfway towards achieving that target. The reductions so far have been managed by controlling recruitment, redeploying surplus staff to vacancies, natural turnover and a limited number of managed voluntary releases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_425">To manage that major programme of change, and especially to handle properly its impact on people&#039;s lives, we have put in place a set of work force policies and processes and have established regional and national governance arrangements, managed by senior officials. The Department is playing a major role in initiatives put in place by the Cabinet Office to support the wider efficiency programme across Government, which, again, my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman would support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_426">Let me be clear: this programme is about establishing a service fit for the 21st century, not about cutting jobs for the sake of it. It is about refocusing our efforts on our clients&#039; needs, not on managing wasteful and outdated processes and systems. We have, under our Gershon efficiency plans, a target of moving 10,000&nbsp;people to front-line activity by 2008, and I am pleased to report that we have already made progress in moving more than 4,000&nbsp;people to customer-facing work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_427">Of course, I understand that at times of major change staff will be concerned about jobs and their career prospects. We all accept that that is a natural reaction to change. However, our current plans still forecast departmental staffing of around 100,000&nbsp;people nationwide. The Department is, and will continue to be, a major employer, offering good and worthwhile jobs to its staff.
</p>





<p><a name="st_689"><a name="60130-42_spnew0"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_690"><a name="60130-42_spnew1"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 I was just about to come specifically to the Fylde area, but felt it important to put the subject in its wider context. I shall turn now to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s specific questions, and those of my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_428">The Department and its predecessors has been a major employer in the Fylde area for more than 50&nbsp;years. We depend heavily on the skills, knowledge and hard work of staff from across the area and from further afield across north-west England. We employ more than 6,000&nbsp;staff in the area, who are engaged in a vast range of work at a number of sites. More than a fifth of the Department&#039;s staff are based in the north-west region&#151;well over 20,000&nbsp;staff in all. In addition to our direct, customer-facing outlets, such as jobcentres, the Fylde area is a strategic centre for the Department, from which we run many key operations, including the Disability and Carers Service units at Norcross and Warbreck Hill, where the agency employs around 3,000&nbsp;staff&#151;about 50&nbsp;per cent. of its total staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_429">We also operate a major Jobcentre Plus contact centre at Blackpool. Many of the Department&#039;s essential corporate financial service functions are also managed from sites in the Fylde area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_430">The scale and size of our operation in the area and our determination to improve efficiency across all our operations are bound to have some impact on staffing levels. I can, however, categorically reassure the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 145</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood that stories in the local press of mass redundancies and wholesale closures are wholly misleading. Furthermore, I must say that the stories have caused unnecessary worry to our staff and the wider community. Likewise, speculation in the media about the Department moving work overseas has no basis in reality. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman. The Department has absolutely no plans to move jobs overseas, and I am pleased to be able to put that on record. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will, like me, want to deal with facts, not rumours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_431">At times of change, it is more important than ever to be straight and open with staff as plans are developed, as both hon. Members who have contributed tonight have said. Let me reiterate that the Department is a major employer in Fylde and plans to be so in the future, with a significant proportion of our work force based in the area. Indeed, as my hon. Friend remarked, we have recently moved 260&nbsp;additional posts into the Disability and Carers Service at Warbreck house from Sutton in London, as part of our plans for relocating work from London and the south-east under the Lyons review. I am sure that hon. Members, especially the hon. Gentleman, will welcome that move as much as I do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_432">The Disability and Carers Service employed more staff in Fylde by the end of December last year than it did in April. Standards are improving, as was shown by the fact that in September the DCS helpline received external accreditation to the Contact Centre Association, the professional body for assessing standards of excellence. It was therefore a serious disappointment to see a headline in the local newspaper suggesting that 93&nbsp;per cent. of calls went unanswered. That was not the reality of the service that we provided. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend will want to congratulate the staff on achieving that accreditation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_433">We are also running a number of voluntary early retirement and early severance schemes across the country, where they can be shown to offer value for money. So far, some 90&nbsp;staff have left our Fylde offices under the schemes, with some 250&nbsp;further releases planned over the next few months. It is important to point out that, although we are well into delivering on our efficiency challenge, we have avoided any compulsory redundancies in the Fylde area, which demonstrates our commitment to staff. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that we will take every action necessary to avoid compulsory redundancies in the future.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>30 Jan 2006 : Column 146</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_434">It is not just in staffing where we are looking to modernise. Our estate has grown organically&#151;as the hon. Gentleman highlighted&#151;often as a result of the machinery of government changes and restructuring within the Department&#039;s predecessor organisations. We cannot expect to make the degree of change we have to make without ensuring that our estate meets requirements. That would risk wasting taxpayers&#039; money on buildings that we do not need. We are therefore looking closely at our future estate strategy to ensure that we are running our end-to-end operations efficiently. It is singularly unhelpful to link issues of sensible estate rationalisation with the number of redundancies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_435">We shall need to consider a range of options for where work is done and the best type of estate to use. However, before we introduce any changes, we will talk to our staff and their trade unions. In spite of the comments made during the debate, our managers have a good record in managing change, and in dealing sensitively with the legitimate and understandable concerns of staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_436">We are managing the transformation programme in a joined-up way across all the Department&#039;s businesses. Our business managers are working closely together to ensure that as many staff as possible who become surplus in one unit can be redeployed in new work in another. Indeed, we have redeployed more than 225&nbsp;staff over the past 18&nbsp;months who had become surplus at our main Fylde sites, including Norcross, Peel Park and Warbreck house at Blackpool and Lytham St. Annes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para14">
<a name="stpa_437">The Government&#039;s aim is to bring about a leaner, more focused organisation that delivers the services people need. Our staff are key in delivering that change; they deal with the most disadvantaged people in our community, often at particularly stressful times of life&#151;unemployment, sickness or bereavement. It is through their hard work at places such as Fylde and elsewhere that we will achieve the ambitious aims that we have set ourselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60130-42_para15">
<a name="stpa_438">I regret that the unfounded speculation about our cutting 2,000&nbsp;jobs in the area has caused so much anxiety and concern to our excellent staff in the area, and I hope that I have reassured both the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood.
