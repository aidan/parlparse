 Since 2000, the frequency of juvenile reoffending has dropped by more than 20 per cent.-the trend is significantly downwards. The number of first-time offenders coming into the criminal justice system is also down. Our approach to reducing reoffending still further is detailed in the youth crime action plan, which is backed by Â£100 million of funding. The plan focuses on a triple-track approach of tough enforcement, non-negotiable support and prevention.</p>

 Yes.

 I know that legal aid is understandably a matter of concern, but it must be said that the legal aid system in England and Wales, both for civil and criminal legal aid, is by far and away the most generous system in the western world. It compares by a factor of about three with systems in comparable common law jurisdictions, such as Australia and New Zealand. Part of the problem concerning the burden on the civil legal aid fund and the public purse from, for example, actions for medical negligence are the costs of litigation. Those are in nobody's interest, except those who directly benefit. Lord Justice Jackson has made specific proposals for conditional fee arrangements: he proposed that they should be abolished and replaced by an alternative of contingency fees, under which the litigant, applicant or plaintiff would pay his or her side's own costs out of any damages recovered, and that there be a 10 per cent. uplift in damages. That is a central recommendation of Lord Justice Jackson's review, which, as I have already made clear, we are examining with great care.</p>

 Ending re-registration altogether would create inaccuracies in the register. However, the Government recognise the need to respond to the special circumstances of service voters. That is why we have laid before Parliament an order that extends the declaration period for service voters from three to five years, and why we are taking forward further measures to help service voters to register to vote and, indeed, to vote.</p>

 Before the last general election I took this matter up because I discovered that there were shamefully low levels of service voter registration. I welcome what the Government have said. I last had a meeting with the Electoral Commission in, I think, October, when we discussed this. I am sure that, like me, the Minister wishes to make it as easy as possible for people fighting-and possibly dying-in places such as Afghanistan to be able to vote. May I therefore urge him to reconsider so that perhaps people could register as service voters when they join the forces, as I did, and then de-register when they leave? That would be very easy: it worked in those days, and I managed to vote Conservative throughout those days as well.</p>

I agree with him entirely: it is crucial that those who are prepared to make such sacrifices for their country should be able to have that important say in the future of their country. There is no question about that. I will of course take into consideration what he has said. We have set up a working party, with Ministry of Defence officials, Ministry of Justice officials, and representatives of the families and the armed services, to see how we can achieve long-term solutions to what is a difficult problem.</p>

However, I can reassure him that we are making efforts to ensure that our servicemen in Afghanistan in particular are enabled to register to vote in the forthcoming election, and then able to vote. The proxy vote system is available to everybody. We are trying to expedite postal voting for service personnel as well, and we will be announcing measures to that end shortly.</p>

 I am disappointed, although not surprised, that the Minister responded to the original question by saying that the Government do not collect this information at all. About a year ago, they said it would serve no useful purpose to collect it. Does she not recognise that there is a useful purpose? When prisoners maintain their innocence, it can often lead to their being held in prison for longer, perhaps because they are held not to have completed various courses. Do the Government not see that there would be a purpose in making a study of cases such as those?</p>

 When someone is convicted, it is only right that the system accepts that the court's decision is right and, if they are sent to prison, the prison system should accept the decision on that basis. The person has an opportunity to appeal, and if the appeal is unsuccessful, they also have an opportunity to refer the case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that people who maintain their innocence might not get parole or be considered appropriately. It would not be lawful for the Parole Board to exclude someone from an opportunity for parole simply because they maintained their innocence. There are some courses that it would be inappropriate for such people to attend, such as sex offending treatment, simply because if they could not admit their offence, it would be difficult to discuss with them how they were going to progress from it.</p>

 About half of all incidents of self-harm across the entire prison estate are perpetrated by women, who comprise only 5 per cent. of the prison population. Levels of self-harm in women's prisons are broadly stable, although they are high. The number of self-inflicted deaths, however, has gone down to a three-year average of 60, which is a significant improvement on the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="10020974000089"><a name="100209-0002.htm_spnew8"><a name="10020974001003"><b>Mr. Illsley:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that response. On a recent visit to New Hall women's prison, I was shocked to see the levels of self-harm among very vulnerable females. Some of the women are serving jail sentences for offences such as the non-payment of their television licence fee. Is there more that the Government can do to reduce the serious level of self-harm in women's prisons?</p>

 We are taking steps to try to deal with serious self-harm in all our prisons. One of the best ways of preventing vulnerable women from self-harming is to try to provide alternatives to custody for petty offences. This enables the women to remain in the community while tackling their offending behaviour. In that respect, using the Â£15.5 million of extra resources that we have made available to divert women from custody is probably the best way of tackling this issue.</p>

 Given what the Minister has just said and given the overwhelming evidence recently provided in the Corston and other reports, it is clear that far too many women in prison should not be there.

 I am doing my best to do that. The hon. Gentleman's analysis that some women in prisons should not be there may well be correct, but it is sentencers who send people to prison and we have to provide places for them. We have to find alternatives in the community for many of these vulnerable women that command the respect and support of sentencers. That is what some of the money in the diversion projects I mentioned is being used to do. It shows some progress that there has been a 4.2 per cent fall in the number of women in prison over the last year during which these projects have been working, while at the same time the male prison population has increased by 2 per cent.</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct: about 50 or so Welsh women are serving their prison sentences in English jails, as there are no women's prisons in Wales. We do not intend to build one, but we are providing support both in south and north Wales for diversionary projects that might enable sentencers not to impose short prison sentences for those who really would do better with community sentences.</p>

 In response to a question from the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), said that overseas voters were subject to the same registration requirements as domestic voters. If he is not aware that overseas voters have to re-register annually-whereas here, of course, only households have to register-perhaps it is no surprise that he has taken such small steps to increase overseas participation. What is he going to do about it?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is well aware that we are introducing individual registration in this country. That is welcomed by his Front-Bench team, and I hope that he will welcome it too. We are doing a great deal to try to increase registration rates among overseas voters, and we have changed the requirements in all sorts of ways. He well knows that we are looking at how we can make attestation an easier process for overseas voters. We are not negligent about these matters. We are trying to do our best but, as I pointed out to my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), it is sometimes difficult when people choose to live overseas. They do not register their presence with our missions overseas, and so they can sometimes be very difficult to trace. That is the fundamental problem, as the hon. Gentleman ought to know.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about out-of-hours primary care following the conclusion of the coroner's inquest last week into the care of Mr. David Gray, who died on 16 February 2008. First, and I am sure that I will be joined by the whole House in this, I should like to extend my sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Gray. This was a tragic case, and I am deeply sorry for their loss. I understand that litigation has arisen out of this issue and I shall therefore direct my remarks primarily to the wider policy issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10020974000191">Concerns about out-of-hours primary care were raised with me last summer. I then met primary care professionals to understand the issues in greater detail and to consider what action we might take to improve out-of-hours services for patients. The Care Quality Commission's interim report on out-of-hours care in Cambridgeshire, published on 1 October 2009, also expressed concerns over the quality of care provided. By that time, on 23 September, following discussions with them, I had formally asked Dr. David Colin-ThomÃ©, the national director for primary care at the Department of Health, and Professor Steve Field, chairman of the council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, to lead jointly a review of the current arrangements for the local commissioning and provision of out-of-hours services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10020974000192">The report, which I published last Thursday, considered the commissioning and performance management of out-of-hours services, the selection, induction, training and use of out-of-hours clinicians, and the management and operation of the medical performers lists on which doctors must register in order to practise in England. The report acknowledges the fact that there is an unacceptable variation in the quality of out-of- hours services across the country, and it sets out 24 recommendations, including that primary care trusts should review the performance management arrangements that they have in place for their out-of-hours services, to ensure that they are robust and fit for purpose; that the Department of Health should issue guidance to PCTs to help them decide whether a doctor has the necessary level of English to be added to their medical performers list; that the Department of Health should develop and introduce an improvement programme for PCTs to support the commissioning and performance management of out-of-hours services; that out-of-hours providers should consider their recruitment and selection processes for clinical staff to ensure that they are robust and follow best practice; and that strategic health authorities should monitor the actions taken by PCTs in response to the report and in carrying out appropriate performance management of out-of-hours providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10020974000193">The report's recommendations are an important reminder, to PCTs and providers, of their pre-existing obligations to provide patients with safe and effective out-of-hours services. We have accepted the recommendations in full, and we intend to go further still. I have announced additional improvements to out-of-hours GP services. We will review the existing national quality requirements, and introduce and mandate national minimum standards that all out-of-hours providers will be required to meet.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 760</b><br>
We will introduce a model contract based on these national minimum standards for out-of-hours provision that PCTs and the providers of out-of-hours services must use. The Department will work with national medical organisations to develop a national database and consider what data should be placed on it. We will tighten existing controls to ensure that PCTs meet their legal obligations and that providers employ competent clinicians to practise as out-of-hours GPs. SHAs must ensure that PCTs are meeting their obligations and we will, in turn, hold SHAs to account for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10020974000194">There is already a clear legal requirement under the National Health Service (Performers Lists) Regulations 2004 for PCTs to refuse a doctor's inclusion on their performers list if they are not satisfied with their level of English. We will direct PCTs to review their procedures and to make certain that they have a clear policy in place for assessing the English language skills of everyone applying to be added to their local performers list. Finally, we will require PCTs to involve local GPs in the design of out-of-hours services through local medical committees, RCGP groups and faculties, clinical executive groups and practice-based commissioning consortiums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10020974000195">Officials in the Department of Health will continue to work with the NHS to implement these measures. The NHS chief executive, Sir David Nicholson, wrote to all NHS organisations last Thursday to bring Dr. Colin-ThomÃ©'s and Professor Field's report to their attention. He sought assurances that they are meeting their obligations as highlighted in the report. Along with Sir David Nicholson's letter, the Department of Health has issued new interim guidance to PCTs to assist them in complying with their obligations to ensure that all doctors admitted to their performers list have the necessary English language skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10020974000196">It is clear that in some areas out-of-hours services are not as good as they could or should be. However, as Professor Field's and Dr. Colin-ThomÃ©'s report acknowledges, even when GPs were responsible for the care of their patients 24 hours a day, only 5 per cent. of them actually provided out-of-hours care for their own patients. Those GPs that did so were often left dangerously tired and exhausted. The system was unsafe. In fact, by early 2000, the level of complaints from the public was so great that the Government asked Dr. David Carson to conduct a comprehensive review of out-of-hours services in England. His recommendations formed the basis of our 2004 reforms, which have led to significant and independently verified improvements in out-of-hours care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10020974000197">Most of our out-of-hours care is today provided by local GPs working on rotas for co-operatives or companies and, the case of Dr. Ubani notwithstanding, most of the service is good. A 2006 review of out-of-hours care by the National Audit Office said:</p>
<a name="100209-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="10020974000925"><ul><p class="tabletext">"England is at the forefront of thinking internationally"</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10020974000198">on out-of-hours care. In 2008, a Healthcare Commission report on urgent and emergency care added:</p>
<a name="100209-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="10020974000926"><ul><p class="tabletext">"There have been significant improvements over recent years in the...number of out-of-hours GP services meeting national quality requirements."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10020974000199">While it is clear that the quality of out-of-hours care for most people is better than it was in 2004, it is still not good enough. I hope that the recommendations set out in the report by Dr. Colin-ThomÃ© and Professor  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10020974000202">It needs to be said that good out-of-hours care is being provided in some parts of the country, but it is clear from the coroner's report into the terrible tragedy of David Gray in February last year, and from the additional report by Dr. Colin-ThomÃ© and Professor Field released last Thursday, that there are significant failings in the provision of out-of-hours care in some parts of England, providing unsatisfactory levels of patient care and, ultimately, putting patients' lives at risk. There have been several tragic deaths, and we must all do everything we can to ensure that that never happens again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10020974000203">The Government's decision to allow almost all GPs to opt out of involvement in out-of-hours care in 2004 was a significant and serious mistake. The current structure of out-of-hours care is at best patchy and has been described by the Public Accounts Committee as "shambolic". The Government were consistently warned that there were ongoing failures in the system, with reports not only by the PAC but by the National Audit Office and by the Select Committee on Health, twice, highlighting serious concerns and failings, yet no effective action was taken. All those reports, and the two released last Thursday, are critical of the patchy provision of out-of-hours care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10020974000204">The list of defects and non-performance is extensive: increasing numbers of complaints about out-of hours care; primary care trusts failing to monitor the quality of care and not reviewing or assessing contracts; inadequate performance measurements; strategic health authorities not monitoring PCT performance, and in some cases not engaging in the process at all; out-of-hours care used too often as a holding bay; insufficient skills for commissioning out-of-hours services; some PCTs ignoring and shunning GPs' involvement and advice; a lack of clarity on responsibility between commissioners and providers; significant additional pressure and attendance at accident and emergency and pressure on ambulance services; little or no integration of out-of-hours care with urgent care; non-implementation of selection, induction and training of foreign doctors; very poor response times; and a lack of a coherent and consistent approach to the inclusion of doctors on the performers list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="100209-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10020974000205">It is clear that there were failures at SHA, PCT and provider level. There were failures to assess foreign doctors' language, communication and formulary skills, to involve GPs in the commissioning of services, to monitor, review and assess out-of-hours care, and to assess and learn from patient experience. In some parts of the country, that litany of failures has been detrimental not only to patient care but to patient safety, culminating in the shocking death of David Gray.</p>

 I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must ensure that we do all we possibly can so that this sort of incident never happens again. That is why we responded to a series of reports and ensured that after the Carson review on out-of-hours services, we changed things-it was clear that the system that existed before 2004 was unsafe; therefore, changes were put in place.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para4"><a name="10020974000214">We need to ensure that we deal with some of the issues that exist in the current system. I think we all, as parliamentarians, need to confront the issue of decentralisation of power. We have been pushing down responsibilities to PCTs. That is all very good, and there is a broad consensus in the House that that should happen-the closer to the patient the better-except some PCTs are more capable than others of doing a good job. That presents us with the question how best to manage that. We have taken the view that we need to bring about two changes. First, we need much more central involvement by the Department of Health in ensuring that PCTs have minimum standards, through a model contract. All PCTs must ensure that providers comply with that contract. Secondly, we need to get local GPs more involved-that does not mean giving responsibility back-so that they can monitor the quality of the out-of-hours service that is being delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para5"><a name="10020974000215">The hon. Gentleman set out the concerns expressed in the report by Dr. Colin-ThomÃ© and Professor Field. I remind him that that report was commissioned not after the coroner's report last week, but on 23 September last year. Indeed, discussions on it took place with those involved before that time, because we knew that we needed to ensure that we improved out-of-hours care. I want to have further discussions with the doctors' organisations on some of the coroner's recommendations, but in a broad sense, we accept them. We must go through some of the detail with the doctors' organisations on how that will be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para6"><a name="10020974000216">When can we put those changes in place? I have said very clearly to officials that I want it done by the end of the year. I want to be sure that we have got the system right by then at least. I was asked how that would be monitored. For the next six months PCTs will be required to have on the agenda of every board meeting, at least once a month, the quality of out-of-hours care and its improvement. That will be monitored by the SHA. Thereafter, PCTs need to take a higher level of responsibility for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para7"><a name="10020974000217">There are three checks on foreign doctors from the EEA. First, the GMC checks their medical qualifications. Secondly, since 2004 the PCT is responsible for checking that they speak English and that nothing is known about them that undermines their medical capability. Thirdly, the employers are responsible for ensuring that the GPs whom they employ not only speak English, but are clinically competent. In some cases it is clear that some of the PCTs have been a weak link. Some have not always complied with their responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para8"><a name="10020974000218">The GMC, as was pointed out, has indicated that it would like to do some tests on GPs who do out-of-hours work. It was clear from the Medical Act 1983 that the GMC could not carry out such tests, and it cannot do so under the directive which has been renewed but predates that. In 2004, therefore, the responsibility for ensuring that English was spoken was given to the PCTs. Most of them have delivered on that. Some have not, and that is what we need to change.</p>

 Certainly I want to ensure that we learn all the lessons from this, but may I deal with the legal issue last? On the performers list, a report was published last March and officials have been consulting on how all that will be put in place. Where regulations need to be put in place, that will be done shortly, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that consultation with the relevant organisations needed to occur and that we wish to move forward with this as quickly as we reasonably can.</p>

The main thing is that we get the system right; that we ensure that those who have failed will no longer be in a situation where failures can take place again; that we are able to examine how the system operates; and that the checks that will protect patients are the ones that occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100209-0005.htm_para16"><a name="10020974000228">I am not convinced about imposing a criminal offence on a PCT. I am not sure who in the PCT the hon. Gentleman wants this to be imposed on-is it the PCT's chairman or its chief executives? I am also unsure as to what the penalty would be. We are talking about a criminal conviction, so does he want these people to be sent to prison? Does he want to fine them? Why would he convict them? These are people who have been employed to do a job, and appropriate disciplinary procedures are in place to deal with them if they do not carry out their job adequately. Boards can be dismissed, and chairmen and chief executives can be removed, so I am still to be convinced about his suggestion that a criminal penalty for these people is the best way of changing behaviour. I am also a bit cautious because we do not want to get into a situation with criminal law, which tends to be absolute in its implications, where people are reluctant to come forward and say that there is a problem in their system that needs addressing because they fear that they might get prosecuted if they were to do so.

That is why we put in place the requirement on PCTs to ensure that English was spoken-that is something that PCTs must do. There may be ways in which PCTs can work with the GMC to ensure that it can be satisfied that people are not only able to speak English, but competent. However, that needs some further discussion between the GMC and the PCTs. In other words, the GMC could act as an agent of the PCTs, but I wish to examine that. My main concern is to ensure that the checks are done-I am less concerned about who does them. I just want them done, because patients deserve safety.</p>

It is indeed the case that an arrest warrant was issued. Unfortunately, it appears that the arrest warrant was issued on 12 March 2009 but the German authorities refused it on 24 March 2009 on the basis that they were already prosecuting the case. I cannot quite work out why they were doing that. It has been suggested that Dr. Ubani asked the German authorities to prosecute him first, so he could avoid extradition on grounds of double jeopardy. The CPS was concerned about that, because it wanted to prosecute him, and contacted Eurojust to query that on 26 March. On 21 April, Dr. Ubani was convicted, received a four-month suspended sentence and made a payment, although it is disputed whether it was a cost or a fine. I hope that that deals with some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but we are concerned to engage further with the German authorities on this issue.</p>

 Does not the Minister agree that, in the issuing of some contracts during the previous round, PCTs seemed to decide that they wanted to drive down costs above all other considerations for out-of-hours contracts?

 Funding for out-of-hours contracts has risen significantly in recent years. The spend by PCTs has risen from Â£209 million in 2004 to Â£378 million in 2008-09, so considerable funding has been put into it. However, the hon.

 May I extend my condolences to the family of Marjorie Alderson? As for attracting doctors, the hon.

That is one of the points to come out of the report by Dr. Colin-ThomÃ© and Professor Field, as well as my discussions with those in some out-of-hours services. I am not entirely clear, in that the issue does not seem to be funding or how much the GPs are paid. Rather, there seems to be a reluctance among GPs in some areas to get involved in out-of-hours services, whereas in other areas they are anxious to get involved. It is important to get to the bottom of that and identify exactly why the problem that the hon. Lady has identified is occurring.</p>

Defence pays? In one case it pays Â£20,000 a year for 17,000 soldiers, but in another it pays Â£278,000 for 20,000 soldiers, which is considerably more.

 The Ministry of Defence wants to ensure that particular facilities are available to it. Therefore, some want to fund those facilities themselves. That is, in a sense, a matter for the MOD. As for variations in cost between PCTs, that is an issue that we need to look into with care. I am satisfied that the broad run of PCTs is trying to get both value for money and a good quality of service, and that those PCTs are indeed delivering that. However, one or two PCTs are looking more at cost than at patient safety.</p>

 To bring the Minister back to rural areas, is not another factor the availability and accessibility of accident and emergency units? My constituency covers 900 square miles.

 The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of issues. As for provision in his local area, the issue that we have faced over a number of decades is that power is being devolved. That means that we are very reliant on local PCTs to make local decisions. We can have minimum standards, but we cannot rewrite the entire framework in which PCTs operate-in other words, take away their flexibility to respond to local need. Getting the balance right is quite tricky, but it is important that we work on getting it precisely right.</p>

 I should declare an interest: my brother works for the out-of-hours service in North Yorkshire, although we have not discussed the issue. Is not the heart of the matter the fact that only in the UK has the system of family doctors and GP services developed to the extent that it has developed here? No one else is in quite the same position-or, possibly, no one else is better qualified-to judge that the PCT is not qualified to judge whether a GP here, or a medically qualified doctor in Germany or another EEA country, is fit to operate our out-of-hours service. I am not sure that what the Minister has told the House today fundamentally addresses that point.</p>

 We need to ensure that doctors are properly qualified. It is a requirement that PCTs should not allow anything that might mean that the GPs they employ are not capable of being GPs. Therefore, we need to ensure that we have proper induction and proper training. We must ensure that GPs are capable of doing the work that they are employed to do.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I know how much importance you place on timely answers being provided to questions posed by Members of the House. Could you give me some advice on how I might ensure that the Department for Work and Pensions does a little better at answering its questions? I have tabled 30 questions that have now passed their due date without being answered. To be fair, most of them are due to be answered in February, but the worst instance dates back to 30 November last year. The most embarrassing example is from 14 December, when I asked the Secretary of State how many and what percentage of questions tabled for written answer on a named day had had a substantive answer. Every other Department has managed to answer that question in a timely manner, but I suspect, given that I have not had an answer from the DWP, that its response will be "Not very many". What can I do to get more timely answers?</p>

He is right to say that I attach a premium to prompt and informative answers from Ministers to questions from hon. Members, whether those questions are written or oral. He is a keen student of these matters and a regular and substantial tabler of questions, and he will also be aware of the developing system of transparency, whereby it can readily be seen at a glance whether a question has been answered or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para7"><a name="10020974000278">The Government have taken tough action to tackle fly-tipping. Much has been done to increase the powers available to local authorities in taking action against fly-tippers. We have substantially increased the penalties available to courts to punish those convicted of fly-tipping, but for too many people in too many places, fly-tipping still scars our communities and the extent of the problem is shocking, if not-sadly- entirely unsurprising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para8"><a name="10020974000279">Last year, there were more than a million incidents of fly-tipping-1.16 million to be exact, and the clean-up costs come in at somewhere between Â£100 million and Â£150 million. Even those figures, however, are likely significantly to underestimate the true extent of the problem. For one thing, they include only the reported cases of fly-tipping, while many incidents go unreported. For another, only fly-tipping on public land is counted so the figures do not include incidents of fly-tipping on private land, which is the responsibility of the owner of the site. The conclusion, though, is clear: fly-tipping is a widespread and serious problem-one that degrades our environment, costs our economy and damages our community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para9"><a name="10020974000280">Enfield suffers from particularly high levels of fly-tipping. The average local authority deals with about 250 incidents of fly-tipping a month. In Enfield, in November 2009 alone, there were nearly 1,400 reported cases of fly-tipping; and over the course of a year, we face not far off 10,000 reported incidents of fly-tipping. That gives us a sense of the scale of the problem we face with fly-tipping in Enfield. Open spaces, alleyways and even beauty spots are often disfigured by rotting black sacks, discarded tyres and a mixture of almost every conceivable household item. The need for further action, then, is obvious.</p>

The residents I meet in Enfield are not really interested in the type of mattresses that have been dumped down their street or the number of black sacks that block their drive.

Enfield-so we need to make local authorities more responsive to local residents. We need to encourage them to tackle the scourge of fly-tipping with the urgency it deserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para12"><a name="10020974000283">I believe that making local authorities publish their response times, as my Bill seeks to do, would reduce the time it takes them to remove fly-tipping. Every local authority would be able to see how well they performed and how much better they could do. No local authority would want the dubious title of "the slowest council in Britain to deal with fly-tipping", and no voter would tolerate a council that dragged its heels in removing rubbish. Just as we ask schools to publish their exam results and hospitals to disclose their waiting lists, and just as we require train-operating companies to report the number of delays and cancellations, so, too, we should ask local authorities to publish their response time to incidents of fly-tipping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para13"><a name="10020974000284">Since 2004, local authorities have been required to report the number of incidents of fly-tipping and their enforcement actions-and rightly so, in my view, as since this requirement was introduced, councils have taken tougher action to combat fly-tipping. As a result, the amount of fly-tipping across the country has gone down and the number of enforcement actions, fines and prosecutions has gone up. In the last year alone, there has been a 9 per cent. decrease in fly-tipping throughout the country. Sadly that is not the case in Enfield, where since the closure of the Carterhatch recycling centre in 2006-against which I campaigned, along with thousands of local residents-fly-tipping has increased threefold, just as we said it would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para14"><a name="10020974000285">If making local authorities publish information about fly-tipping has encouraged them to take tougher action, we might assume that making them publish the time that it takes to respond to reports of fly-tipping would make them quicker at cleaning up the results. Publishing response times is not just about getting councils to remove rubbish more quickly, important though that is; it is also about reducing the amount of fly-tipping in the first place. Removing rubbish quickly would also act as a deterrent to fly-tippers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para15"><a name="10020974000286">It is easy to see what happens. One black bag that is not removed quickly attracts another. I observe that for myself when I am out and about in my constituency, and I am sure that the same applies to other Members. The three black bags dumped at the end of a row of houses become four the next day, and five the day after that. Not removing fly-tipped rubbish sends others the message that fly-tipping is tolerated, that rubbish can be dumped, and that no one cares about the area. It also has a snowball effect: small acts of fly-tipping encourage more fly-tipping and larger amounts of rubbish, which attract vermin and become a public health hazard. The more rubbish is dumped and the longer it is left, the more likely are acts of vandalism and graffiti, which in  <br>

Authorities are already required to provide the Environment Agency with extensive information about fly-tipping in their areas. They must tell the agency how much fly-tipping takes place, how they deal with it, and how much it costs to clear it up. My Bill would simply ask them to submit information on their response times to the agency, alongside the data that they are already obliged to give it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="100209-0006.htm_para17"><a name="10020974000288">It is inconceivable that local authorities do not already maintain records of some kind or other of their response times. This is, after all, what residents are most concerned about. Surely local authorities must already log the time when a report of fly-tipping is received, and when some sort of action is taken. If they did not, how would they know whether they had dealt with a particular case? If they already have that information on file, why can it not be given to the Environment Agency at the time when all the other fly-tipping data are supplied?</p>

 I rise to oppose this money resolution on several grounds. First, it meets no perceived need. It has no justification, and it would also involve a wanton waste of public money. It is an election gimmick thought up by a discredited Prime Minister hoping to extend his days in office by some shady deal with the Liberal Democrats-and he should remember that although he can hire a Liberal Democrat, he cannot rely upon him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para0"><a name="10020974000301">In addressing the money resolution, the House should consider the following facts. The Prime Minister has now been in office, either as Prime Minister or Chancellor, for 12 years, and at no time has he shown the slightest interest in electoral reform. Indeed, the Ashdown diaries, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) mentioned a few weeks ago, make it absolutely plain that the Prime Minister opposed the deal on electoral reform when Tony Blair and Lord Ashdown discussed that, so what we are dealing with here is an act of pure political cynicism. The Prime Minister refused to fund a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, although he had promised that, but he now wants us to fund a referendum on a change that he has always opposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para1"><a name="10020974000302">This money resolution also illustrates the profligacy of the Prime Minister. He wants us to spend public money on something we do not want, even though that money is not readily available, thus ratcheting up debt and taxation, and his sole motive is personal ambition cloaked in the language of moral purpose. This House has heard too much about the moral compass to be readily deceived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para2"><a name="10020974000303">We should also consider the intellectual dishonesty involved. We are being asked to spend public money on the alternative vote, but there are many other ways of electing a Parliament, of course. Some of them appear on the amendment paper. The Liberal Democrats favour the single transferable vote, as spelled out in amendment (b) to new clause 88. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) favours the "two-round runoff system" in amendment (j) to that new clause, while the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) refers to the top-up system in amendments (m) and (p). In common, I suspect, with most Conservative Members, I prefer first past the post, but the Prime Minister, without proper consultation-indeed, without any consultation at all-wants to spend public money to promote not a broad debate on the merits of electoral reform, but a narrow proposal, which in the dark watches of the night, if not the dark watches of his soul, he thinks might favour his electoral prospects.</p>

 I am sure my right hon. and learned Friend has thought about this himself in the dark watches of the night, but am I not right in saying that AV has been chosen because it is the only system that, had it been in force in the last election, would have produced an even more unfair-if that is the right word-result than the system we have?</p>

 Yes, indeed. It has the curious property of producing not the most popular representative, but the least popular. That is its curious characteristic. The House should note, too, how the question will be framed-not after full debate in this House on an amendable motion, where all the options can be canvassed and included, but through an unamendable order, almost certainly debated in quick time and subject to intensive whipping. That is what this money resolution seeks to propose. Thus the Prime Minister proposes to dispose of a system of election that has carried this country through war and tribulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para3"><a name="10020974000310">I want to conclude with the following observation. The Prime Minister wants to spend public money on a venture for which there is neither justification nor public demand. It is true that politicians, politics and Parliament have sunk low in public esteem-I recognise that fact-but a change in the voting system, funded by the money resolution before us, will not address that. I believe that the principal reason that we are so disliked is that the public have come to realise what most of us know: namely, that we are not doing the job that we ought to be doing. We are failing to hold the Executive to account. We are failing to scrutinise legislation in the way in which it ought to be scrutinised. We have allowed the powers of this House to be usurped by Government and we have created the elected dictatorship.</p>

 Order. Before the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) responds to that intervention, may I remind him and the House that we are debating quite a narrowly drawn money resolution at the moment? There will be ample opportunity to consider the other merits of the matters when we move into Committee.</p>

 I was rather minded of that before you intervened, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Let me make this response, if I might, to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling). I have always and often criticised the Whips in this place-that is true-but I do not believe that they are the fundamental problem. I believe that the cowardice of Members is the ultimate problem. I do not believe that we will solve this issue unless we have true separation of powers, but I recognise that that is extraordinarily difficult to achieve.</p>

 I follow my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) with great pleasure. This morning, after I had struggled into the House through the tumbleweed on the floor, the gales blowing through and the emptiness of our proceedings, I noticed that a money resolution was, unusually, tabled for debate before the business that we are to discuss. Given that it was not, as my right hon. and learned Friend has rightly pointed out, on the Lisbon treaty or anything like that, I read what it was about. I note that it shows the fatuity of the Bill, which produces babies every time we do anything on it. We are debating money resolution No. 3; each such resolution charts a special little sub-Bill that is stuck into the midst of it. So, as we continue our proceedings on the Bill, we are now tacking on another Bill-as that is what it is. The money resolution represents what should be a separate Bill in its own right. As my right hon. and learned Friend has indicated, if it were a Bill, we would be able to explore all the arguments on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para5"><a name="10020974000316">I know that the Prime Minister has abolished boom and bust, and I now know that he wants to reform our voting system, but let me make an observation. The first-past-the-post voting system goes back to before time almost. It was the way by which, in ancient societies, in a one-vote system, the individual who had the most votes came first. It was the most simple rubric for determining who should be elected. That is how things were, but there has been a reversion. I am told that the Liberal Democrats support the money resolution and the purposes behind it. They have forgotten the advice of Lord Jenkins in his commission's report. The system that we are debating cannot be said to be an equal or  <br>

proportionate system any more than the first-past-the-post system can. It therefore means that the least-objectionable candidate is elected. I note that the Jenkins report talked about seeking not consent but acquiescence. There is no sense of consent regarding the motion, certainly on the Conservative side, and the best that the Government can seek is acquiescence to it. I do not acquiesce to the money resolution; I note simply that it is a distraction.</p>

 That is the point that I want to emphasise. If we defeat the money resolution, we will not have dealt with the rest of the debate, but there will be no money to fulfil the expectations that come from it. That is why I urge the House to reject the motion. If it genuinely believes that there is merit in the resolution, there should be a full and proper Bill that will enable us to debate the views of the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives and other varied views across the House. No costing is associated with this matter. In a time of economic crisis, the resolution is a wild distraction that emphasises the futility of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, with all its add-ons.</p>

For those reasons, I oppose the money resolution. I believe that in the dying days of this dying Parliament we should show some resolution along the lines that I have described. This House itself is dying. Parliament's purpose is to hold Governments to account on the expenditure of money. That is essential, as are the processes by which we look at that expenditure and the balance of the arguments that are put, yet today we have only 45 minutes for debate-and on most money resolutions we do not even get that.</p>

The sooner that we tell the Government that there is no business worth considering, the better. The people must determine the fate of every one of us here. We must give up absurd gestures such as this referendum proposal, which has been dreamed up and put on the Order Paper inside a week. The Government tell us that it is a serious constitutional measure that must be debated, even though there is no possibility of an outcome.</p>

 Earlier today we had a discussion about out-of-hours GP provision. In my constituency and the whole of Suffolk, including your constituency, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we do not have enough money for more than three doctors to provide an out-of-hours service. We have no money for a whole series of important things; the leaders of both major political parties admit that we have to cut the crucial things that service our constituents; and the Government have proposed that we spend Â£80 million or thereabouts-they have not worked out how much-on a question that very few people in this House think suitable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para11"><a name="10020974000339">This debate is about the money resolution, but the previous contribution was a revealing statement of Liberal party economics. It showed that the Liberal party does not believe that one discusses the money in any connection with the purpose for which it might be used. As for "ideas are not responsible for their authors," that is about as elliptical and confused a concept as the average Liberal Democrat party political broadcast; it is, indeed, typical Liberal confusion. There is nothing more confused than the Liberal Democrat party except the proposition that the Government have put before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="100209-0007.htm_para12"><a name="10020974000340">The money resolution is, frankly, a scandal. My constituents do not have the wherewithal to keep our current systems going, because the Government have taken money from the national health service and local government and spread it elsewhere in order to distribute it to their heartlands. It is therefore a scandal to talk to my constituents about Â£80 million, and they will not forget it at the election. More importantly, the neighbouring constituencies, which are very marginal, will certainly not forget it. They will return to this House people more willing to care for the public finances.</p>

The original purpose of this House was to ensure that the Executive did not spend money unwisely; did not spend money without due concern; did not spend money without exact accounting; and did not spend money in a way that the public felt unnecessary. That is why we are here.</p>

We are invited to do so also before we have discussed the matter, and that is wholly contrary to the way in which the money resolution is normally placed.</p>

 In the old days, which the right hon.

 That reminds us why this is such an outrage and such a scandal. The reason why the House is not keeping the Government under control is that the Government took advantage of a point at which large numbers of hon. Members were new to say that they were modernising the system in the House, when in fact they were taking powers away from the House and depositing them in their own pocket. That is what they did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="100209-0008.htm_para1"><a name="10020974000347">The Government also did two other things. They introduced a system of guillotines, which is entirely foreign to this country and stops the proper debate and discussion of motions such as this. Secondly, they changed the system on money, so that we were gulled into a position in which the House was able to vote for money on subjects that it did not want for sums that it did not compute. For that reason, of all the issues that we have had before the House, this motion is more redolent of the smell at the heart of this Government-the disgracefully decaying Government who are before us-and the stench of a Prime Minister who puts his own future before that of this nation.</p>

It is utterly irrelevant to our constituents' interests and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) has just illustrated, it proposes the expenditure of Â£80 million.

They are thrashing around like a dying tyrant, seeking to use their majority to take the public eye off the things that really matter and, perhaps, to save their skins in what they think might become a deal in the future-we remember the Lib-Lab pact, Mr. Deputy Speaker-with those who might come to their aid and succour.</p>

 When the Government came up with these proposals, they could not, when asked, provide costings on how much they would have to spend in order to allow this referendum to take place. Only bit by bit has the figure of Â£80 million gradually been extracted as the economic cost of carrying it out, and even that-I wait to hear from the Secretary of State in a few minutes-appears to be far from clear. That is Â£80 million for a gimmick that the Government wish to foist on the electorate, and at a time when they keep pointing out to us that savings are going to have to be made and that every pound matters.</p>

All those things could be done, and I have to say to him that that would be money much better spent.</p>

information about the cost had to be extracted from us. That is not so: we have answered a whole series of parliamentary questions on this. The cost of a referendum is hardly a surprise. Given that it involves all the electors of the United Kingdom and similar provisions for Freepost and so on, it comes to about the same as the cost of a general election, which is indeed about Â£80 million. Which Department will the money come from? It will come from the Consolidated Fund, as all electoral expenditure does. Of course it is Â£80 million, but it is Â£80 million as a single piece of expenditure in a single year. Why is there no direct parallel with, for example, the cost of providing additional prison places? Because, as the hon. Gentleman will discover if he ever ends up in the position of having to negotiate with the Treasury for a departmental budget, there is a world of difference between single, one-off expenditure and continuing expenditure that involves costs every year.</p>

Conservative party elected the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) as its leader not by first past the post but by the alternative vote. [Hon. Members: "Gimmick!"] Well, we know that.

It will be within the recollection of the House that just two weeks ago we had a great debate about whether we should end by-elections for hereditary peers.

 I was seeking to make the case for why this expenditure represents value for money, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is Â£1.20 per elector in the country. It is not correct to say that the issue has not been the subject of great consideration over many decades, as I will point out in my speech on new clause 88 in a moment. The truth is that a system of eliminating ballots is used by the Conservative party under its constitution, and it amounts to an extended form of the alternative vote. It is also used for the election of hereditary peers-a system that the Conservatives sought to defend less than two weeks ago. [Hon. Members: "You set it up!"] No, the House of Lords set up the system of elections, and the Conservatives have actively supported it. I have checked and checked again, and never once have the Conservatives at the other end of the corridor suggested that the first-past-the-post system should be used for the election of hereditary peers.</p>

That is the same system, in conception, as eliminating ballots.

Sometimes elimination rounds are used. The Conservative party conducts sequential votes when there are more than two candidates, until the final two candidates are put to the membership. The Liberal Democrats use the single transferable vote, which amounts to the alternative vote when there is only a single post to be filled. The Labour party has long used the alternative vote for the election of its leader and deputy leader. It used to have lengthy eliminating ballots for local selections, but has now generally moved to the alternative vote system.</p>

 What I have long been a supporter of is-[Hon. Members: "Answer!"]-I am going to answer: majoritarian systems. If the hon. Gentleman, who is very assiduous, had bothered to read a very fine pamphlet written in 1986 by my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), "Proportional misrepresentation: the case against PR in Britain", he would have seen that I gave support to the alternative vote. I am on record as having supported for getting on for a quarter of a century the alternative vote system for parliamentary elections. My passion is for majoritarian systems, as opposed to proportional representation, for all the reasons that are generally shared throughout the House. I must also tell the Committee that the new hardback copy of my right hon. Friend's important work is in such demand that, according to Amazon, a new copy will cost $600, although second-hand editions can still be had for four quid.</p>

 I was a bit puzzled to hear the right hon. Gentleman praying in aid the Labour party's election system because, apart from the fact that the Prime Minister was not subjected to it, I seem to recollect that, under that system, one third of the vote is reserved for the union paymasters. I hope that the Justice Secretary is not about to offer that to the Committee as an example.</p>

 That shows how little the hon. and learned Gentleman knows about the Labour party's system, which provides an opportunity for millions of individual members of trade unions to vote in a postal ballot for the candidates of their choice. The idea that the system is in the hands of a few trade union paymasters is completely incorrect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="100209-0010.htm_para0"><a name="10020983000062">I should also like to remind Conservative Members of something that they learned only half an hour ago, and that might have come as a great surprise to them. The system of election for hereditary peers, which they are so passionate in supporting, and which they voted to continue just two weeks ago is-guess what-not a first-past-the-post system but an alternative vote system.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says that it is our system, but, while the law provides that there has to be a system-this House agreed that-it was the other place that provided that system. Conservative peers could have objected to the use of the alternative vote at any stage over the past 10 years, but they have never done so. I therefore hope that we will hear no more about the idea that the alternative vote, or eliminating ballots, which are used by the Conservative party for the election of hereditary peers, have some fundamental flaw that is so dangerous that a choice between the alternative vote and first-past-the-post should not even be put to the electorate.</p>

 My hon. Friend will remember the debates that took place on the Jenkins commission when it reported to the House when I was Home Secretary, towards the end of 1999. It rapidly became clear that there was no consensus around it. What is more, with the passage of time, concern has been expressed about dual systems of membership, particularly in Scotland and Wales. Speaking personally, I happen to believe that the system of single-Member constituencies, in which one Member alone has the duty to represent everyone in that constituency or community, is fundamental to the workings of our democracy. That system gives a directness and authority to the relationship which does not exist in the same way under multi-Member constituency systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="100209-0010.htm_para1"><a name="10020983000067">Furthermore, I support majoritarian systems because majority Governments are far preferable to the weaker minority and coalition Governments that are almost invariably the consequence of systems of proportional representation. I thought that before I first came into the House; I thought it throughout the 18 years I spent on the Opposition Benches; and nothing I have seen of other countries' systems of proportional representation has convinced me that they have better alternatives.</p>

 I am glad that my hon. Friend acknowledges the importance of giving the British people a choice. We have to make a judgment about the alternatives to put before the British people-we have to make it; nobody else can, as it has to become law.

Friend's concern; he and I have discussed on many occasions the dual-Member system in Scotland and the concerns expressed about it, but the fact that we are to have a referendum on this issue does not necessarily rule out the possibility in due course of having a referendum on the issue that my hon.

 My right hon.

He will know that the strong recommendation made in that report was that two elections using different systems should not be held on the same day. Does he accept that if we move towards the AV system for the elections to this House, we can never again hold a general election on the same day as local authority elections?</p>

 I am afraid that I do not. I remember the Gould report and the circumstances that led up to it. I thought it made some important recommendations, but I do not believe that the fundamental problem that the Scottish system faced at that time was conducting two different elections on the same day. Within the whole of the UK, we regularly have two sets of elections using different systems. For example, European and local elections often take place on the same day and provided that those systems are properly explained to voters-this was the problem in Scotland when there were two sets of ballots on the same ballot paper-I believe that it is perfectly satisfactory to go ahead on the same day.</p>

What share of the vote would he be prepared to regard as too low, either under first past the post or under the alternative vote when it came to first preferences?

 I agree with the Secretary of State about single-Member constituencies.

 I know that Conservative Members have suggested that earlier elections could have produced this or that result. The answer to the right hon.

It will be for the British people, in whom I suggest Conservative Members have a bit of faith, to listen to the argument over a 20-month period, and to listen particularly intensely during the last six months of a campaign.

The question of whether there should be a change is nothing new-as I shall make clear, it has been debated on a number of occasions-but of course some hon. Members will ask why we need to make the change now. The answer is that in the past 12 months, as everyone knows-it has affected hon. Members in all parts of the House in the same way-we have seen a crisis of confidence in our political system and our politicians on a scale that none of us has witnessed before in our political lifetime. Trust has been profoundly damaged. [Hon. Members: "That has nothing to do with it."] It has everything to do with it.</p>

Those are important initiatives, which show that we mean to put our own house in order in due course, but all of us here must do all that we can to restore trust in politics, and it is axiomatic that part of that process must involve consideration of which electoral system can best serve the people of this country and asking them to make a decision.

For the three elections between 1951 and 1959 the share was over 90 per cent., and the share of the third party was less than 6 per cent. However, as I have said, that period was atypical of British politics in the 20th and 21st centuries. Every contest now involves at least three candidates; in Scotland and Northern Ireland there are at least four, and, given the involvement of newer parties, often more.

 Can my right hon. Friend not see that there is a flaw in his argument when he compares national elections with the electoral system within parties, where we decide on our candidates and leaders in such a way as to choose the least unpopular, rather than the most popular? Under the alternative vote system in national elections, it is likely that there would have been even more Conservative MPs after the 1983 general election and more Labour MPs after 1997. How is that fair, and how is that going to raise confidence among the electorate?</p>

 I would make two points in response to that. First, these so-called extrapolations cannot take into account how voter behaviour would change under a different system, but I profoundly believe it would do so-that must be the case. The late, excellent, noble Lord Alexander of Weedon made a good point in his dissenting note to the 1999 Jenkins report about what happened in '83 and '97. I have never believed that voters would react in the way that was proposed, however. Moreover, what we are debating now is not whether the House should decide on the alternative vote, but simply whether we give the British people an opportunity to have a debate about the matter.</p>

The reason why all major parties have an eliminating ballot system is so that the person who is elected leader has legitimacy and a broad consensus of support.

People sense, however, that we need to make changes. They sense the need for greater legitimacy in our system.

First, as ever with Winston Churchill, he changed his mind more than once-and he supported AV in 1917. Secondly, his first preference was not for first past the post, but for proportional representation, and his "next best method" was "the second ballot", which is simply a longer, more expensive form of AV.</p>

I do not dismiss the case for PR out of hand, and I know that it has some adherents on the Labour Benches. Where elections are to a body that has a representative, not an Executive, function, I have always accepted that the case for PR is much stronger.

Over most of the past 13 years, I have been the Secretary of State with responsibility for coming to the House with various pieces of constitutional change. Some of them have been controversial at the beginning, but on every occasion I and the Government have sought to reach a consensus across the Floor of the House, as we did in respect of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and the provisions on party funding in 2000 and 2009, and also in respect of devolution, when the proposals were put to a referendum. I believe it is essential that changes to our electoral system-big changes, such as to the number of MPs, which I shall come on to-must be the subject of some kind of cross-party endorsement or referendum, and cannot be seen as partisan tools in the hands of an individual party.</p>

I must also say that the Conservatives would be willing to take part in that approach. However, let us compare what we propose, which is to ask the British people whether they wish to change the electoral system, with the Conservative party's alternative to restore trust, which is for a 10 per cent. cut in the number of Members of Parliament, without testing the will of the people in a referendum or any effort being made-</p>

 I do not withdraw that allegation, because it happens to have the merit of being true. What is more, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, the proposal would disproportionately hit urban areas, where there are fewer Conservative Members-although there are still some-and more Labour and Liberal Democrat Members, because of the under-representation on the electoral register of millions of voters in those areas. The hon. and learned Gentleman also fails to take account of the need for natural communities to be represented in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100209-0011.htm_para12"><a name="10020992000072">Another point makes the Conservative proposal completely bogus. There is a suggestion that the size of this House has somehow increased exponentially. That is not true. The size of this House has increased by 3 per cent.-21 Members-since 1950. The size of our constituencies has increased by 25 per cent. over that period. The work load from constituencies of Members of Parliament, even in this time that I have been in the House, has dramatically increased. The consequence of the Conservative proposals would be to gerrymander boundaries, detach Members of Parliament from their constituencies and, where Members of Parliament exist, add considerably to their work load. That can only mean that the level of service to constituents would be less good, at a time when we should be increasing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="100209-0011.htm_para13"><a name="10020992000073">Let me briefly run through the amendments and new clauses. Amendment 136 provides for a number of provisions in the Bill to come into force when it receives Royal Assent. New clause 88 makes provision for the date of the referendum and the detail of the question to be set by secondary legislation after consultation with the Electoral Commission, defines the alternative vote system that would be the subject of the referendum and defines that it will be a binary choice. New clause 89 defines the franchise, new clause 90 defines the referendum period, new clause 91 relates to the role of the Electoral Commission, new clause 92 provides for funds to be made available, new clause 93 provides a mechanism for settling accounts for expenditure, new clause 94 relates to challenges to the referendum result and new clauses 95 and 96 make minor amendments to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Amendment 137 amends the long title of the Bill. Let me remind the House that the 2000 Act contains detailed regulation to ensure fair play, including fair money, for both sides of a referendum campaign. This is an important debate. Its subject is a fundamental plank of our democracy and it comes at a time when this House is held in dangerously low regard. The Government have tabled these new clauses after considerable study and consideration.</p>

Perhaps we should not be surprised to learn, particularly from a left-of-centre blog, that the vast majority of the remainder want such disparate things that it is impossible to assess what they desire.

Let us remember what Lord Jenkins thought of AV, which the Liberal Democrats will support, I assume, if they cannot get their amendment through. He said that it is "even less proportional" than the first-past-the-post system, "disturbingly unpredictable", and "unfair" to the Conservative party-not that that has ever affected Liberal Democrat and Labour thinking very much.

 While the hon. and learned Gentleman is extolling the virtues of the first-past-the-post system, will he answer the question that the Justice Secretary refused to answer?

 It seems to me that it is a legitimate system whatever the percentage, because the electorate are asked a perfectly straightforward question-who do they wish to represent them? It gives the majority view on a single person. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman cannot see that. The system is straightforward, simple and requires people to make sensible choices about who is likely to be elected and who they might therefore wish to support. For those reasons, I think that the system is extremely clear and commands widespread support.</p>

In 2005, Labour announced that it was conducting a review, and in 2007 he said that he was going to publish it. This is a key issue because he did not make any attempt to hide the fact that the report had already been written. In fact, it was effectively locked in the Justice Secretary's bottom drawer. There was a problem with the 2005 review because even though its terms of reference were to look at the voting systems that were used, someone, in conducting the review for the Labour party, seemed to have asked the team to look at the alternative vote as well. The conclusion that the review came to was that the AV was capable of producing even more disproportionate outcomes nationally than the first-past-the-post system.</p>

However, anyone bothered to read the detail would see that the review provides a snapshot of what would have happened at the 2005 general election, had it been run under a variety of voting systems. Helpfully for the Prime Minister, on page 130 it also provides a useful ready reckoner. It considers in depth the d'Hondt method, the least-squares proportionality system and Arrow's paradox, but what was plumped for was the only system that would have given Labour even more seats than first-past-the-post at the 2005 election. I might add that the same system was the only one that would have given the Conservative party fewer seats than in 2005-even though, in England, we gained a majority of the votes cast.</p>

 From the many debates that we have had on Scotland, the hon. Gentleman knows that we are respecters of the devolution settlement. I am happy to debate reform of the first-past-the-post system there, and indeed the Secretary of State has tried to debate that too, but our respect for devolution means that, notwithstanding our support for reform, we would not impose a new system. That is something that must be determined by the Scottish Government and electorate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="100209-0012.htm_para5"><a name="10020999000041">However, I do share the view of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe) in one respect. When I visit Scotland, the people to whom I speak are not, on the whole, Conservative party supporters. My experience is that there seems to be a great deal of dissatisfaction with the electoral system that has been foisted on the Scottish electorate, who appear to be deeply unhappy with it. For those reasons, I believe that the Scottish system is something that the House ought to heed, as it does not offer a good reason why we should go down the same road.</p>

 Yes, it is fair. I have no difficulty with the first-past-the-post system for Westminster elections, as I have made clear.

If we cannot, we will continue to have very poor levels of representation-simple as that.</p>

 I understood the Secretary of State to say that he assumed that people would vote differently.

 Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives seem keen to say that we use the alternative vote system for our internal party elections, but we do not. The system used for our leadership election is the progressive rounds model, under which one candidate drops out at each stage, with everyone being given a vote on the remaining candidates.

 There is no perfect system, although I am bound to say-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> No, there is not: there is no perfect system, and I defy the Liberal Democrats to argue that there is. I do not put it past them to try to run such an argument, which I look forward to, but I am singularly unconvinced by it. First past the post delivers clarity; it is well established in this country; and it enables electorates to get rid of Members whom they do not want and express a clear choice. The alternative vote system, with which the Liberal Democrats are being seduced, skews the result towards far greater unfairness than anything that first past the post could ever achieve.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman says that the existing system allows people to get rid of MPs whom they do not like, but they can do so only if they are prepared to change their party allegiance. Many people are not prepared to do so, and only the Irish system-the single transferable vote system-allows people to choose the party and the person. Indeed, one third of people who lose their seats in the Irish system lose it to members of their own party. That is discipline; that would get rid of safe seats; and that would ensure that voters' choice really did count.</p>

 Voters can make up their own mind, and I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Voters are offered a clear series of choices to make, including whether they wish to vote tactically-something that Liberal Democrats specialise in. On the whole, that is not a major problem and, indeed, they benefit from tactical voting, as they readily admit. Their by-election literature is all about tactical voting. How often have I seen "Only the Liberal Democrats can win here" on election literature. The hon. Gentleman's argument therefore has no basis whatever.</p>

There is a terrible illogicality in having a system in which a candidate can have a clear lead in the first-preference votes, but in which the second or third-preference votes become equal to the first-preference votes in further stages of the counting. Clearly, those other votes are not equal to the first-preference votes; if they had been, people would have voted differently in the first place.</p>

 If that is my hon. Friend's thinking, I hope that I will persuade him of the merits of my amendment. I do not want anyone to think that I am not concerned about the fact that votes are not equal between constituencies. If we go back in history, one of the demands-it was not just a radical plea of the Chartists, but one that was picked up on the other side-was to have single votes and equal votes. It is clearly very different if we look at the numbers by which Labour Members and Conservative Members are elected. Unfairest of all is how many votes the Liberal Democrats have to receive to get a single Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="100209-0014.htm_para0"><a name="100209105000036">In my amendment, I propose the French system, whereby people have a vote whereby they are free to nominate any number of candidates that they wish, and they have a first preference vote. In constituencies where the candidate gets 50 per cent. plus one, they are declared elected. In all the other constituencies where a majority of the voters who turn out have not elected a member, during the following week the top two candidates are put back on to the ballot paper. In those circumstances, there is no need to guess, because everybody has first preference votes again. It is true, of course, that that system might be more expensive, but given what we spend money on now, might not the electorate prefer it? Interestingly, it is consistently the case in France that turnout on the second day of polling is significantly higher than on the first day.</p>

 I am following my right hon. Friend's remarks with care. I wonder whether he has studied some of the analysis by the Electoral Reform Society. When it conducted a survey of different sorts of preferential voting systems a couple of years ago and looked at the French experience, particularly in the presidential election, it found that there was precisely the kind of tactical voting that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) has mentioned. In particular, supporters of Chirac lent their votes to Le Pen to ensure that the run-off was between Le Pen and Chirac. That was a rather strange situation that did not really represent what was going on elsewhere. There is evidence of similar things happening in the presidential elections in Cyprus.

 I am not putting this proposal forward as the silver bullet to solve all the problems. I welcome the fact that the Government, even late in the day, are opening up the whole debate on parliamentary reform. It is crucial that we constantly strive to improve the form of representation that we have in this country. I do not think for one moment that it would guarantee that we did not get such results, although such voting is dominant mainly in elections of the French Parliament, not the French President. Given those circumstances, I hope that we will look seriously not only at the one option that is being put forward today but at a series of alternatives in the form of a debate rather than moving to a resolution this evening.</p>

 I am sorry that I do not agree with either of the points that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) made. That is unusual for me, because usually I agree with his points. The first was that under preferential voting systems, people effectively have more than one vote. That is not the case, because as the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) pointed out, they have one vote but are effectively asked what they would do with it if their first-preference candidate were not standing. That is called tactical voting, which happens all over the country in every general election, but in a preferential voting system it is done more formally and rationally, and people do not have to guess.</p>

I am sorry that I cannot follow him on that either, even though, unlike the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), I am generally a great admirer of all things French. The electoral system in France has had an unfortunate effect not just on its politics but on its culture and way of life, because it has split the whole country into two large camps of left and right. France suffers constantly from that, and we should not go down that route. It would have the effect-perhaps many Members would welcome this-of taking us back to a bipolar system that is very difficult to break into. It is very difficult for new views to come through in such a system.</p>

It was that he was against AV because it could be less proportional than first past the post, which is true. If he accepts that argument, he should therefore accept that as the single transferrable vote system, for example, is more proportional than first past the post, it is better and fairer according to his own argument. The Conservative case therefore seems self-contradictory.</p>

 Does the hon.

It is perfectly possible to argue that proportion is the only reason why one might want a change, and that this is the one disproportionate way of changing the system. It is therefore utterly barmy. To have a choice between first past the post and some sensible, proportional system, so that people could make a reasonable decision as to whether the advantages of one system outweighed its disadvantages, would be perfectly reasonable.

cannot answer that question, because preferential voting is like tactical voting but carried on in a different, more organised way. If tactical voting is unwound and people start to vote for their first preference, they will be voting in a way that they do not now. That is why it is perfectly reasonable to say that we do not know what the effect of the AV system would be.</p>

 Those of us who feel that we ought to move to a more proportional system cannot support the Liberal Democrat proposal, because it would break the link between the Member and the constituency. I would find it absolutely onerous to be a Member of Parliament representing the whole of Birmingham, for example, along with other Members. Why are the Liberal Democrats not supporting the proposal put forward by the royal commission, which is well thought out? It would move towards proportionality but by and large keep the link between even the additional Members and their constituents.</p>

 There are two points to consider in the hon. Lady's question. The first is whether the single transferrable vote would break the constituency link, which it would not. It would just mean that there were more Members per constituency. It would break the one Member, one constituency link. For 17 years I was a local councillor and there were three members in my ward, but I did not feel that that meant I represented the people in my ward less. In fact, when a member of another party represented the ward for a few years, it increased competition between the parties in the ward and made us all better representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="100209-0014.htm_para5"><a name="100209113000009">The hon. Lady's second point was about the Jenkins commission's proposal, which was a political compromise but not one that we have to stay with for ever. It has a great number of disadvantages. First, it would set up two entirely different sorts of Member-the constituency Member and the list Member. There would be an overlap of responsibility between the two, but they would have very different mandates, which would lead to difficulties. Secondly, because the county seats would be so small-the lists would not be national; they would relate to very small regions by the standards of most regional list systems-the proposal would create the most extraordinary conflict of interest between AV-elected Members and county list Members. It would be in the interests of a list Member if his or her party colleagues lost in the constituency seat, which does not seem particularly sensible from the point of view of political parties or coherent government.</p>

 I concede that it is a better system than first past the post, but a lot of the problems are about how big or small the electoral regions are. The larger they are, the less problem there is with the overlap between the jobs of the two sorts of Member, and the less it is in the interests of list Members that people on their own side are defeated in the constituency elections.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman said earlier that the STV system does away with the single-Member, single-constituency link, but that is not quite true. The Liberal Democrats have tabled new schedule 3, which proposes new multi-Member constituencies. For instance, under that proposal, my seat would be subsumed into a seven-Member Glasgow seat with an electorate of 500,000. Some of those Members would, of course, be from minority parties. However, Argyll and Bute, with an electorate of 68,000, would remain a single-Member constituency, as would Orkney and Shetland, with an electorate of 35,000.

 Our proposal would do the same for the Western Isles, which is held by the Scottish National party. In any circumstances, there are certain geographical limits to the size of a seat. That is why, in any preferential system, there must be a range in the sizes of constituencies. One can have bigger seats in urban areas while retaining a sense of representing a geographical area than one can in rural areas, especially the thinly populated marine areas of the sort the hon. Gentleman mentioned. On the whole, the proportionality of the STV system comes from urban areas, because there are larger numbers of Members in those seats. That has always been the case. The proposal in 1916 was precisely that there should be STV in the cities and AV in the countryside, so it is not new.</p>

 In a second. Why have the Government come to propose such reform so late in the day? It looks like a manoeuvre to me-a death-bed conversion. In Cambridge in 1997, I was obviously identified by the Labour party as a Lib Dem voter-I was a Lib Dem councillor, so I suppose I was rather easy to spot.

 After all these years of going on "Question Time" and other programmes saying that the Liberal Democrats want proportional representation, does it not feel a bit odd to the hon.

 We will vote for amendment (b) to Government new clause 88 so that the referendum is between first past the post and a proportional system. What will we do if that is defeated? Although the new clause is a very small step in the right direction, there are two truths. First, changing the electoral system is on the political agenda, which is a big and important point for us. Secondly, AV is a preferential system, which we are in favour of. The system we support-STV-is a preferential system, but it just happens to be proportional as well.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will put the answer to my question on the record once again, because he may have made a slip of the tongue, and I want to be fair to him-I am always fair, even to Liberal Democrats. Is he making it clear tonight that the critical thing for Liberal Democrats is that the system is preferential and that he is not so concerned about proportionality? We have heard from the Liberals for years about proportionality, but in the end, when push comes to shove, is proportionality less important to them than a preferential system?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman exaggerates the extent to which AV is disproportionate or worse than first past the post-sometimes it is, but not always. As I said a few moments ago, it is very difficult to predict the effects of AV, because first-preference votes will change. For us, it looks like progress, even if it is a small amount of progress, because it is precisely what the hon. Gentleman says: a preferential system. That is a small gain, but one worth having.</p>

 I note the hon. Gentleman's pain and his great concerns about voting with the Government for new clause 88. I share that pain-my party will also very reluctantly support the measure. In Scotland the hon. Gentleman's party is also reluctant to support a referendum on Scottish independence, even though that has majority support in Scotland. The proposed referendum on electoral reform has no public support whatever. Why is he against a referendum in Scotland and why will he not allow the Scottish people a choice, yet he is prepared to support a measure that nobody wants and a referendum in which no one has shown any interest in voting?</p>

 I fear, Sir Alan, that if I stray into that debate, I will be brought up short very quickly. The holding of a referendum is not in itself a particularly massive gain. I do not remember there being a referendum to bring in first past the post-it is the starting point simply because it is the status quo. There is a bias in favour of it simply because it is there.</p>

I heard what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield said about the Prime Minister's previous views on electoral reform and I agree with the former's position. That is another reason why I suspect the proposal is a manoeuvre. The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the diaries of Lord Ashdown. I appear in those diaries, especially in volume 2, with a degree of accuracy for which I would not entirely vouch. Nevertheless, it was true at that time that the Prime Minister was seen as a fundamental block to reform. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) pointed out in the debate on the money resolution, the question before us is not whether the proposal comes from a cynical or a bad source, it is whether the idea itself is worth supporting.</p>

It can be less proportionate, but proportionality is, for us, an important measure. It does not seem to be an important measure for the Conservatives when they support first past the post, and I am glad to welcome them to the camp of those who believe that proportionality is an important aspect of fairness in an electoral system.</p>

In the end, however, there is one advantage to AV, which is that it ends tactical voting. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris) was of the view that Liberal Democrats are the main beneficiaries of tactical voting-<i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that AV formalises tactical voting. What it does is end the need for tactical voting because people can vote in their real order of preference and do not have to guess about a situation in which they are voting for their fourth choice in order to keep out their fifth choice. That is an enormous advance for the legitimacy of the electoral system, because people are expressing their real political views in a way that they have not done for many decades.</p>

Those, for us, are major disadvantages. STV, the system that we propose in amendment (b), solves all those problems. STV is simply AV in multi-member constituencies, but it is far more proportionate. The results overall from Northern Ireland, for example, show a very high degree of proportionality, even in seats with four or five members. The Scottish local government version is less proportionate. That is because it uses smaller seats with smaller numbers of members. In practice, across the whole country, if there were constituencies with between one and six members, the result would be a very high degree of proportionality.</p>

That is why the Secretary of State was right to mention legitimacy. It is not a peripheral issue. The real problem with our politics is that this place is politically unrepresentative. It is so unlike the politics of the country that people do not recognise it. People here do not think so, but they wouldn't, would they?</p>

there can be endless debates about our system, which he considers to be illegitimate, where is that agitation in the country? I support the amendment proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but to compare the situation around 1830 to bring about change with the current situation is farcical. There is no overwhelming wish for a change among the electorate. They may wish it, but it has not expressed itself in any way, and it is doubtful whether many letters are received by the hon. Gentleman on that matter.</p>

 The sentiment is expressed through a disaffection with politics and a hatred of politicians. To see the effects of that, we must go back to what happened after the start of the Iraq war. Millions marched and then said, "But the politicians paid no attention to us." That is where the danger is for our politics as it is currently set up.</p>

 Is not the crucial change this: that in the 1950s the combined Labour-Conservative vote rose as high as 97 or 98 per cent. of the electorate. In those circumstances, one can see that a system designed for two parties may give an outcome that broadly reflects public opinion. At the last general election, the combined Labour-Conservative vote fell below 70 per cent. for the first time since the second world war. In the European elections last year, admittedly on a different electoral system, the combined Labour-Conservative vote for the first time fell below 50 per cent. In other words, more people did not vote for what used to be called the main parties than did. Under those circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult for either Labour or Conservative MPs to make a compelling case for an electoral system that rewards with absolute power parties that can command the support of only about a third of the electorate.</p>

 With respect, it is not a good point at all. The first-past-the-post system was not good at representing the view of the electorate. In 1951 the Labour party received the votes of a higher proportion of the electorate than it ever had, yet we lost the election to the Conservatives. The system was not fair even in those days.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. First past the post did not work even in its own terms. The one thing that is said about it is that it allows electorates to throw Governments out. One often hears that argument, but even that is not true. In the last eight elections since October 1974, on six occasions the majority of those voting have voted to kick the Government out, yet found on the day after the election that the same Government were still in office. A proportional system cannot have a worse record than that.</p>

I can give the example of February 1974, when Ted Heath went to the country and said, "Back me or sack me." Under the terms of the first-past-the-post system, more of the electorate voted for him than for any other party, but he still ended up sacked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="100209-0015.htm_para7"><a name="100209113000052">The Secretary of State made an important and serious point about the function of general elections. It is a point that I should deal with before concluding. He said that in elections for electing an Executive, it was important to have a decisive system, whereas in elections for a more representative body which was not involved in Executive decisions, a less decisive, more proportional system was appropriate. That is the heart of the problem-we cannot carry on with the myth that a general election is about electing a Government from parties competing on the basis of their manifestos and then claiming a mandate to govern. That is fine when the winning party has 45 or 50 per cent. of the vote, but it makes little sense to anyone when the winning party has 35 per cent. of the vote. That is even laying aside the fact-obvious to everyone in politics-that no one outside the political bubble reads manifestos. There is no mandate. The mandate to govern that the current Government claim, on the basis of their majority in this House, is illusory, and the public know that.</p>

 Why is the current system so much less democratic than a proportional system in which, as soon as the polls close, the parties meet behind closed doors and start trading off the manifesto commitments on which their parties have just won the election?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman demonstrates the obvious fault that I mentioned-the parties did not win the support of the public on the basis of their manifestos, because no one reads the manifestos in the first place. It is a myth. What happens in countries with proportional systems is that, yes, the parties get together to try to create a Government with majority support-and that has some chance of having the moral authority to govern. We do not have Governments with that moral authority now.</p>

 I wish that I could give that assurance. Manifestos are mainly for internal consumption-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> That is the reality that people do not seem to be willing to accept. Manifestos also lay out for the civil service the likely programme of a party. However, we must get away from these myths if we are to win back the trust of the public.</p>

 I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and agreeing with much of what he says, but is not the fundamental point that unless we decide what the electoral system is for-and different societies make it for different things-we will never agree on which form is right? If we want a rough and ready way to find a representative or to see a Government emerge, we will probably think that first past the post or an AV gloss is all right. If we think that its function is to match votes to representatives, we will prefer a proportional approach. Until we decide the fundamental question of what we want our electoral system to do, we will just go on reciting our favourite nostrums.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that the debate here is often extraordinarily parochial. The idea that one can point to individual countries-Italy versus Germany, for example-to prove one way or the other that a system does not work is very simplistic. Looked at more broadly, no obvious objection to a more proportional system can be drawn from international comparisons.

The other set of amendments comes under the rubric of amendment (b), which is all about the topic that we have been discussing so far-whether the referendum should be between AV and first past the post or STV and first past the post. Amendment (b) proposes STV instead of AV. It is an argument for an STV referendum that those of us who are prepared to vote for an AV referendum tonight are not entirely enthusiastic about it. Would it not be better to have a referendum between first past the post, which has some enthusiasts here, and a different electoral system, which has many enthusiasts here? A referendum between two competing views that have enthusiasm behind them is likely to have a higher turnout and engage the public more than a referendum in which that is not the case.</p>

Members have implied, simply an exercise in gesture politics or even a case of setting up an opportunity to send out target letters. If the Government were really serious about the proposal, they would be setting it up so that an incoming Conservative Government could only reverse the duty to have a referendum by a full Act of Parliament. New clause 88 means that it will be possible for an incoming Government simply to propose the necessary statutory instrument and then defeat it using their majority. At that point, the entire duty to hold a referendum disappears.</p>

The effect of amendment (a) would be to change the date by which there must be a referendum to May next year, so that, because of how the Parliament Act works, inevitably it would be less than 13 months from the Second Reading of any repeal Bill.

There are clear differences of view on that. However, amendment (a) is about a different issue, on which I would also like to divide the Committee, if the opportunity arises. It is about whether the Government really are serious about this or just playing games. I very much hope that they are not playing games and that this is a serious proposal.</p>

After all, there has not been a change in the voting system for more than 100 years. Like a tractor stuck in the mud, it requires a huge effort to move it just a few inches, because we have to overcome the forces of inertia, which we have heard plenty of tonight. I therefore thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon.

Often when I hear them barracking Labour Members, I know that they do not have any rational arguments. Their motto seems to be, "When in doubt, shout." The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), who has left his seat, has tabled an amendment entitled, "Simple majority voting". First past the post might sometimes be called the majoritarian system, but it is the system that we are now trying to introduce-the AV system-that is the true majoritarian system, under which the winner must have majority support. What can be wrong with that?</p>

That is why it usually works for presidential elections in the States, where there are rules that make it very hard to have a third candidate on the ballot paper. Arguably, it worked reasonably well in this country until about 100 years ago, when there were usually two candidates per seat, but the moment there are three candidates, it becomes a lottery. We need only look at a classic example in Northern Ireland that I was discussing with my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). In seats where the Unionists and nationalists are evenly divided, if two Unionists and one nationalist stand, the nationalist is elected, and if two nationalists and one Unionist stand, the Unionist gets in. It is not how people vote, but who stands, that decides the result.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman, who is advancing his case for AV, recall that I made the following point to the Justice Secretary, which he did not seem to understand? Under the AV system, where a majority of 50 per cent. is the criterion for deciding whether a person gets a seat, it does not necessarily follow, as all the constitutional authorities state, that it will translate into an overall majority in the House of Commons. The crucial point about changing the electoral system is that, if the 50 per cent. rule were to apply, it should apply not only to seats, but to Parliament and therefore Government. That at least would make some kind of sense.</p>

However, it is a more proportional system than first past the post. There have been elections in which it has been less proportional, but all the studies have shown that overall it is more proportional. Most of all, however, proportionality is the wrong yardstick, because AV does not claim to be proportional to people's first preference; it claims to be proportional to people's first, second and other preferences. As an expression of what people want, it is far more accurate than first past the post.</p>

I do not know whether there is any truth in the apocryphal story of candidates being kneecapped on their way to present their nomination papers, but it makes sense, because of the distortion that first past the post brings to the system. Of course, that happens in Britain too. We have often heard the Conservatives blaming the UK Independence party for splitting their vote, and of course I believe that Labour would have been in power for most of the previous century if it had not been for the Liberals splitting the progressive vote.[Hon. Members: "You split our vote!"] I was expecting that retort.</p>

People are already using their own alternative vote, therefore, only they have to do it by guess work. The Leader of the official Opposition reacted to our proposals with what, to my mind, was sheer bluster. He called AV a crazy and ridiculous system, omitting to mention that it was the system that his party used to elect him, the system that every party uses to elect their leaders, candidates and committees, the system that elected Boris Johnson Mayor of London-with the minor difference that voters had only a first and second choice-and the system used to elect every other mayor. We have never heard any complaints about it before. It is also the system used in Australia and France, although there, of course, they do it over two rounds, and as the newly elected Glasgow MP, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-East (Mr. Bain), pointed out, the system is used in precisely this form in Scottish council by-elections.</p>

 Of course, that could also be true under first past the post, but with one difference. I can think of a first-past-the-post election, although not in this country, in which somebody was elected with less than 6 per cent.

 I am more than happy to explain for the hon. Gentleman's sake. We have never had any MP elected on 6 per cent. in this country, but plenty of Members of the current House of Commons were elected on less than a third of the vote, and one was elected not so long ago on just over a quarter.

AV is not proportional representation; it is just 1-2-3 voting. It keeps the constituency link, it is no more likely to lead to hung Parliaments and it makes it even more difficult for extreme parties to get elected, because they need majority support. AV is also proportional to what voters want, because it looks at their first and second choices, and it does not lead to the danger of having MPs elected with only a third or a quarter of the vote.</p>

On the contrary, the public seem to love it. For instance, "The X Factor" is a long, drawn-out version, over several weeks and several rounds, of a preferential system. Indeed, if "The X Factor" had been run on first past the post, the Jedward twins would have won, because they came top in the first round, albeit admittedly with only 10 per cent. That would have been a travesty-not only a musical travesty, but a democratic travesty, because they got only 10 per cent. of the vote.</p>

We are not just asking, "Will AV be good for the voter or fairer?"; we are asking, "Will AV help me?" I should point out that there are two very different ways of calculating what would happen under a different voting system. First, there is the static analysis, whereby past elections are rerun, assuming that people would vote the same way, even with a different system of toting up their votes. I am sure that we have all seen those analyses. However, I shall not rehearse them here, because they do not help us at all.</p>

Members very much against believing the static analysis of what would happen. AV is a different ball game, and how people would vote would change quite a bit. Candidates with a strong tactical vote could find their first-choice vote unravelling, because there is no point in voting tactically under AV.</p>

What we should look at is the dynamic analysis. Let us look at the elections held under AV-mayoral elections, Australian or French elections, or Scottish council by-elections. In all those elections, it is impossible to see any particular advantage to any party. The only clear advantage is to the voter, who gets a clearer choice. What happens in AV elections is that candidates and parties act in a slightly different way, paying more attention to the other people's second choices, and that is surely no bad thing. Under AV, it is no good being a Marmite candidate-one whom the minority loves, but the majority hates. Candidates need more of a rainbow appeal. Frankly, when we look at the history of British elections over the past 20 years, is that not the lesson that we should learn from our electoral system?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman said that the only people who had an advantage under an AV system were the voters. That is not strictly true, is it?

 If that is a virtue of the first-past-the-post system, it must be an even greater virtue of the alternative vote system, because small, extreme parties would need to have the support of a majority of a constituency-albeit on second or third preferences-which would make it more difficult for them to be elected.

 The other people who would benefit from AV are all the Members of this House. Everyone would then be able to say, "I have the conditional or actual support of more than 50 per cent. of my electorate, and that gives me greater authority."

 Indeed. As they were speaking earlier, I looked up many of the Members taking part in this evening's debate, and I found that, with some notable exceptions, very few of them have more than 50 per cent. However, new clause 88 is important not just because a 2015 election might be fought on AV, but because the 2010 election might be fought at least partly on that issue. I want to be able to tell the voters who support change in the voting system-there are a lot in my constituency, even if there are not many in those of some other Members present-that I will vote for a referendum, and that I will vote for change in that referendum.</p>

 That is true. Although it would not have the same effect as a totally proportional system, AV would push elections in the direction of being more sensitive not just to the core voters of a particular party, but to the electorate in each constituency. That would focus politicians' minds on winning over the second preferences from other parties. That is a good discipline, and one that, at this moment in Parliament's history, would not go amiss.</p>

If a Conservative voter went to the polls and found that the Conservative candidate was not in the first two, there would be time for that voter to reflect on the track record of those who remained, on their affinity with the local community, and on their views on issues that were perhaps not political but moral in nature. The voter could weigh up all those factors and cast their vote accordingly for one of the two candidates and, at the end of the day, one candidate would emerge with over 50 per cent. of the vote.

AV, a voter may cast a single vote for one candidate. Their vote would not be invalid if they did not mark the rest of their ballot paper with second, third, fourth or fifth preferences.</p>

 I concede that point. One does not have to express further preferences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para0"><a name="100209127000012">My other point is still valid, however. The Government have introduced this measure for rather shabby reasons, which were brilliantly exposed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) in his very entertaining opening speech. I do not believe that the hearts of the Lord High Chancellor and the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, the right hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)-an effective and agreeable Minister who, sadly, is not standing again-are in this. They are going through the motions because they feel obliged to do so. They are doing this with a reasonable degree of compliance because they know that, at the end of the day, these measures are not going to become law. The timetable makes that impossible. We were originally going to have four days in which to discuss the Bill; we are now on the sixth, and there will be at least one more. Then, it will have to go to another place, and because certain parts of the Bill have not been debated at all in this place, there will be a need for further thorough scrutiny and debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para1"><a name="100209127000013">This is therefore a cynical exercise, which is taking Parliament's eye off the ball on which it should be focused-namely, the great national and international affairs of the day. As I said when we debated the money resolution earlier, this is another example of the Government treating this place with contempt and pretending to be the servant of democracy. They are not. There is no perfect system, but the one that we have at the moment is infinitely better than the one that is being proposed. The only other system worthy of consideration is the one that is the subject of the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead.</p>

 Although this is hardly the dominant issue on the doorstep or in the pubs and clubs, I welcome the Government's commitment to holding a referendum on the alternative vote system. I have no problem with the concept of referendums. We had one on EU membership in the 1970s, one in Scotland on the setting up of the Scottish Parliament, and one in Wales on the setting up of the Welsh Assembly. We should also have had one on the Lisbon treaty, and I voted for such a referendum in the House, unlike my friends on the Liberal Benches who were split three ways: some were for, some were against, and some did not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para2"><a name="100209127000015">I am not in favour of the concept of proportional representation, because it results in minority parties being able to determine who will govern, and extracting their price accordingly. We have only to look at the most purist example of PR-the Israeli Parliament-to see the consequences of purist PR. I have always supported the alternative vote system because it is not PR but an improved version of the first-past-the-post system. I am somewhat surprised that those who argue strongly for the first-past-the-post system-of which I am also a supporter-cannot see that AV represents an improvement on it while retaining the constituency link.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para3"><a name="100209127000016">The essence of the alternative vote system is that the winning candidate has to get 50 per cent. plus one vote. As a number of Members have said, what can be wrong with that, when only a third of right hon. and hon. Members were elected by more than 50 per cent. of the electors in their constituencies? It also means that electors who support minority parties, particularly in so-called safe seats, can exercise their choice without feeling that their votes are wasted. As I said to my good friend, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), it allows them to have a second, third or fourth choice-depending on how many candidates there are on the ballot paper. What it does not do is force people to vote more than once. If people wish to cast only one vote for one candidate, they can do so and their vote is not invalidated. If they choose to vote for a minority candidate-as some would say, to vote with their hearts first of all-they will also have a second choice to vote with their heads afterwards.</p>

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that point, which was rejected in my earlier intervention. He is right that black-hearted supporters of small parties would have at least greater influence, if not greater power. Surely, he would recognise that that is a bad thing, not a good thing, for our democracy.</p>

 Somebody once said that democracy is a very bad form of government, but all the others are so much worse. Democracy means that the elector has the right to choose whatever candidate they want to vote for. The party they vote for is their choice. In a democratic society, unless a party is not proscribed from standing, candidates belonging to that party are entitled to have their names on the ballot paper so that people can vote for them. That is called democracy.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman concede that AV actually works against smaller parties? It is almost impossible for a UKIP or, say, a Green candidate to secure 50 per cent. of the vote in an individual constituency, but they might just sneak in with 27 or 28 per cent. in a normal first-past-the-post election. AV is not going to help smaller parties to get parliamentary representation in any way.</p>

 I did not suggest that it did. I was arguing for the virtues of an alternative vote system as an improved version of first-past-the-post. My good friend is arguing for a totally different system, which he is perfectly entitled to do, that he feels is more favourable to smaller parties. I understand his argument, but I am arguing for the alternative vote system because I believe it embodies the best aspects of first past the post, but also builds on and improves it. That is why I intend to support what I believe will be a sensible change.</p>

It has been said tonight in rather reverential terms, as though the departed Lord Jenkins was a totally unbiased and disinterested individual with no vested interests whatever in the single transferable vote top-up system that he proposed. It needs to be put on the record that Lord Jenkins was an outstanding and distinguished parliamentarian: he was Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1960s Labour Government; he was Home Secretary in the 1974 Labour Government; he was the Labour  <br>

 Before my hon. Friend goes too far in suggesting that the Jenkins commission was a personal exercise by Lord Jenkins who put forward nothing but his own interest, I am sure that he would accept that it was a commission of all parties, including Baroness Gould, who was a Labour party organiser herself. I do not think that one should suggest that this was a Jenkins-only commission; it was a broad-based commission receiving broad support, as reflected in the submissions made to it.</p>

 I hear what my hon. Friend says, but the fact of the matter is that this is always cited as "the Jenkins report" and Lord Jenkins was the father of it as chairman of the commission.

It has reflected the majority viewpoint of the Australian electorate ever since it was introduced.

Lord Turnbull said, it has nothing to do with the "merits" of the case as its only purpose is to "set a trap" for the Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para9"><a name="100209132000005">Let me turn to the merits. When it comes to electoral systems, a clear choice is available. On the one hand, we can choose a system that conforms to some abstract notion of "fairness"-a concept that should perhaps be placed in inverted commas in this context, because of its many disadvantages. On the other hand, we can choose a system that is likely to deliver effective government provided by a single majority party. We cannot have both and we cannot have perfection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para10"><a name="100209132000006">It is possible to have a system that is perfectly proportional-a system that gives parties a proportion of seats in Parliament that corresponds exactly to the proportion of votes that they obtained at the preceding election. Thirty per cent. of the votes will give a party 30 per cent. of the seats; 5 per cent. of the votes will give it 5 per cent. of the seats, and so on. That is the system that is closest to the abstract notion of fairness that I described earlier, and it is the system that corresponds most closely to the needs of proportionality, which the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) has said is at the heart of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para11"><a name="100209132000007">Here are some of the disadvantages of that system. First, it is completely inconsistent with any kind of constituency link-it is impossible to combine a constituency link with perfect proportional representation. Secondly, every Member elected under such a system must be elected on the basis of a party nomination, so the influence of the party at the expense of the individual Member of Parliament is immeasurably increased. That is not a consequence that would necessarily gain unanimous or even majority support in the House of Commons or beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="100209-0017.htm_para12"><a name="100209132000008">Thirdly, when such a system is in force, it tends to give wholly disproportionate influence to small, often extremist parties. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff) has pointed out, the state of Israel has exactly that system. Its Government, throughout their existence, have been bedevilled by the influence of small and extremist parties, and I do not think it an example that we should follow.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman has rightly pointed out that all the arguments in favour of AV, or moving from AV to proportional representation, are about fairness. However, we in Northern Ireland know that when such a system is used not only for electing people but subsequently for forming a Government, we are left with a Government who are divided and indecisive.

does not, of course, comply with the abstract notion of fairness that I have previously described. Indeed, it can be very unfair. At the last general election, for example, although the Conservative party obtained more votes than Labour in England, we got 92 fewer seats in England. That extreme unfairness would be remedied to some extent by the proposals in new clause 99, which I welcome, but those proposals would not extinguish that unfairness completely. I believe, however, that that is the price that has to be paid in order to obtain the advantages of first past the post.</p>

It delivers neither fairness nor the advantages of first past the post. It gives wholly disproportionate power and influence to those whose first preference is for the least popular and least representative option before them. I do not believe that we should introduce a system that gives disproportionate influence and power to people who have those views. They are perfectly entitled to have those views, and they are perfectly entitled to vote for parties that represent those views, but I do not see any reason why we should give them disproportionate influence and power by giving them the opportunity to vote again and again and to have, perhaps, the decisive influence in the decision as to which candidate should represent their constituency.

 My starting point for this discussion is as somebody who has supported proportional representation for more than 20 years. I support it simply because it is a fairer, more democratic system. It is neither fair nor democratic for us to have a system under which a party with a relatively small minority of votes can be rewarded with a clear majority of seats. That is unfair for both the parties involved and the electorate, whose wishes are therefore not accurately reflected in the make-up of Parliament. No system is perfect or perfectly fair, but I have long believed that we should move to a fairer and more democratic system. That is what we should be seeking to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="100209-0018.htm_para0"><a name="100209132000028">The alternative vote system is not a proportional system, of course, but although it can in some circumstances distort results more than a first-past-the-post system, it also has some advantages. As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) has pointed out, under it every MP could say that they had the positive support of half the electorate in their constituency, which most MPs cannot say at present. Also, although it is not a proportional system, when electoral support is evenly balanced between parties, the AV system is likely to stop one party having an overall majority when the votes do not justify that. I accept that when one party is particularly popular or unpopular, it can exaggerate the effect, but overall I would argue that the alternative vote system in more likely to lead to a result that reflects voters' wishes. That is certainly the case when the parties are more evenly balanced.

 I sought to express-perhaps not clearly enough for the hon. Gentleman-that I think that the proposal has some advantages. I also believe that overall it would be more likely to lead to a fairer result. It means, as I have said, that MPs would have a stronger mandate in their constituencies, which is important. I also support a move towards an AV system, because, bluntly, I feel that if we move towards that system, we will in due course move further. I think that we will move to an AV-plus system once we have opened the door and had the debate. I believe that we will move in due course to a more genuinely proportional system, which I would welcome and would like to see introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="100209-0018.htm_para3"><a name="100209132000035">Of course, another amendment will be voted on, which is that proposed by the Liberal Democrats. It would introduce a single transferable vote system. That is a position that has some attractions for those who want to move towards a proportional system, if AV-plus is not on the agenda. However, my experience of the way in which STV has worked in local government in Scotland leads me to believe that it would have many drawbacks as a system, if it were to apply here in the UK. It does not lead to the rather idyllic picture that we have of voters choosing between the candidates of different parties-voting in a primary, as it were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100209-0018.htm_para4"><a name="100209132000036">The Scottish situation shows us that in most cases in local government, one of two things has happened. First, when one party is able to get more than two members elected under the STV system in a local government ward, the strongest argument in a candidate's favour is not how they behave as a member but whether they are called Anderson or Young. In 90 per cent. of the cases in which two members were put up by the same party but only one was elected, it was the one whose name began with the letter that came earlier in the alphabet who was elected rather than the one whose name came lower down the alphabet.</p>

 Indeed, but the effects would be much smaller in a first-past-the-post, or first two-past-the-post, system than in an STV system, as I think the hon. Gentleman would accept if he examined the way in which that system works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100209-0018.htm_para5"><a name="100209132000039">Another situation applies in Scotland that is relevant with a three-party system, which we have in most parts of the country, and with a four, five or even six-party system, which we have in some places. Instead of putting forward two candidates to give voters a choice, political parties put forward only one because they know that they will get only one in, and they do not want to risk neither candidate getting in because of some accident in the voting system. As a result, most members' seats are safer under the STV system than under the previous system. Let me give an example. My local government ward in Edinburgh has four councillors-in order of votes, a Labour member, a Scottish National party member, a Liberal Democrat and a Green. If either the Conservatives or Labour were doing particularly well, they might displace the Green and get the last seat, but  <br>

They will find that it does not bring the democratic advantages that they think it does. For that reason, I will not support the proposal for an STV system today. I hope that the proposal for AV goes forward today and that that will be a move towards a fairer and genuinely democratic system-a true system of proportional representation for election to this House.</p>

 I rise not just to support this modest measure, but to mock and disparage it. Of all the electoral reforms that this Government could have brought forward, these are about as modest and timorous as any Government could propose. Let me be clear: as we have heard in many fine contributions to the debate tonight, the proposals would do nothing to improve proportionality and would not bring us any closer to delivering or securing fairer votes. As I said in my intervention on the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff), who is no longer present, the proposals would instead act against smaller parties. There is very little chance of smaller parties such as the Greens or the UK Independence party securing anything like 50 per cent. of the vote, so an AV system would not be in their interests, but they might sneak into a constituency at the next general election with 25 or 26 per cent. of the vote in a first-past-the-post system. There is no way that they will get more than 50 per cent. of the vote, so AV will in no way practically assist smaller parties.</p>

It will empower them that little bit more and will allow them to make positive choices about how they vote, and we will support them in all of that. We will also support the measure because it gives the-perhaps misguided-impression that this is one of the first steps along a road of greater electoral reform. I note that some Labour Back Benchers-not many have contributed to the debate, although many have commented in the press-have said that they believe this change to be a start on the slippery slope to full PR and constitutional reform.

It has been able to say-consistently and probably with some justification-that it can influence some of the Scottish Government's actions and decisions. That is how minority government works. It is a good and positive thing. It should be embraced. All the claims about majoritarianism and the need for absolute majorities in Parliament ignore the positive influence that smaller parties can secure, which can be a good thing. The argument is always about how we must have overwhelming majorities in this House, yet that is what we have had for 13 years and what has been the result?

The Irish people mandated that system for us when they voted for the Good Friday agreement, which promised that the Northern Ireland Assembly would be elected on the basis of STV for the very good reason that people wanted it to be fair, inclusive and proportionate.

Parliament voted for an Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and received the Kelly report, but now there is confusion about which measure stands, which will be revised and which will not.

My party suffered as a result of that principle, because the instinct was, "We have Unionist MPs in a number of constituencies in the west of Northern Ireland who represent only a minority of the electorate." That fact was deeply resented and led to people saying to us, "If you're not going to stand out of the way, sorry but we are going to bypass you and vote for Sinn Fein so that we can take the seats."

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point, but I do not accept it. Our experiences in Northern Ireland so far have been in multi-seat elections where people generally transfer to various other candidates whom they think might stand a chance of winning. In elections to a single seat, transfers cross party lines much more; and we increasingly find in elections generally that there is a bit more transferring across the lines. However, electing an MP on the single-Member constituency model involves a significantly different relationship.</p>

That would be to the good of politics in Northern Ireland, and it might add to the weight and credibility that MPs from Northern Ireland have in this House, instead of our just being seen according to the colour of our political faction with no other agenda or mandate behind us other than that we were lucky enough to scrape through because of how things worked out in our constituencies according to first past the post.</p>

I cannot dissuade anybody from feeling scepticism or cynicism about the motivation behind proposing it now, but I see very positive opportunities in it. I hope that the Committee will vote tonight to show confidence in the electorate. If people are confident enough to trust the electorate with the first-past-the-post system, why do they not trust them with a referendum that would allow them to make a choice between that system and one that ensures that they have more control over electoral mandates, and where it is less to do with the luck-almost the electoral scratchcard-of first past the post?</p>

 One could start by saying that there is a distinction between offering the public a choice and offering them a proper choice. I agree with the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) that one should trust the public. Our complaint about the proposal is that it is a fraud, because it does not offer a choice that is in any way informed by a study, a concern, or a search for an alternative, but simply a choice between first past the post and AV. AV has never been adduced as a sensible alternative to first past the post in any independent  <br>

inquiry that has been held, so there must be another reason for offering this particular choice. I do not always disagree with the hon. Gentleman's views, as he well knows, but it is not trusting the people to present them with a fake choice. This choice is being offered simply because it is convenient to the Government, not because it is something that the public want or can exercise.</p>

I might have had some sympathy with the Government if I did not know that they are not prepared to allow the House a proper consideration of the Wright committee's report. If they were in the course of coming to the House to make real decisions about giving Back Benchers the opportunity to control the Executive in the way that we once did and could again, they would be able also to suggest that the electoral system might be improved. However, as they have consistently diminished the power of the House over 12 or 13 years, they cannot be taken seriously if, in their dying days, they suggest that we should have a different system of election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="100209-0019.htm_para4"><a name="100209134000003">This Government are the reason for much of the disillusionment in the nation. Under the word "modernisation", they conned a new generation of Members of Parliament into giving away the very mechanisms that enabled the House to keep the Executive under control, at least to some extent. That started with the guillotine-the demand that we should at all times ensure that every Bill was controlled by the Government. That has been serious, because it has meant that no Bill has been properly debated in this House since. Without the unelected second House, there would not have been proper consideration of a whole Bill in any circumstance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="100209-0019.htm_para5"><a name="100209134000004">In addition to that, the Government have insisted that we should have a system that not only has a guillotine but that increasingly uses secondary legislation as a mechanism of avoiding discussion in the House. If we changed that, which the Wright Committee has suggested ways of doing, we would be much more in touch with what the public want than we are in any discussion about electoral reform.</p>

I oppose referendums in any circumstance except this one. A referendum is an unsuitable way of making any decision in a parliamentary democracy. I have voted against it, and I believe my party is foolish to have taken it up. It seems to me to be a mechanism that is both foreign in invention and foreign to our system, but it has always been said that if we want to change the electoral system itself, there has to be a mechanism by which we return to the public. I therefore do not object to the referendum as a concept in this case, but I do object to conning the public. What do I say to them? I say, "You are going to have a choice not between proportional representation of one sort or another and first past the post, but between the disproportional first past the post and the more disproportional AV." That is not a choice; it is a ridiculous offering that could be given only by a Government who are cynical in the extreme.</p>

That is what this is about, and we know it. The Minister may smile happily, and he is a genuine and decent man, but if he thinks he can find more than five independent people outside here who have not sussed that out, he will be lucky. Nobody in the country believes that this suggestion has been made for other than mere cynical political reasons. That is the fact.

The first-past-the-post system has a huge advantage, because it means that there are coalitions before, rather than after, elections. I therefore believe that that system is more democratic than any system of proportional representation, because voters know precisely what they are getting.</p>

Liberal Democrat voters have no idea what they are voting for-and they are the sort of people who do not mind that. I have therefore always thought that the Liberal Democrats are the one party that have no right to talk about the electoral system, because what they propose is determined by where in the country one lives.</p>

 Indeed it is. Liberal Democrat voters in my constituency vote for a totally different policy from Liberal Democrat voters in the constituency next door. People know perfectly well that the policy will be dictated by how many people they think they can get to vote on any subject.

As a friend of mine said to me on the doorstep, "The choice here is between Conservative and Liberal Democrat. If God had been a Liberal Democrat, He would have offered us the ten suggestions."

I raised with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), the former leader of the Conservative party, the question of the German system. In Germany, the Free Democratic party has an almost perpetual lien on being Foreign Secretary. That is an arrangement. Herr Genscher was Foreign Secretary for so long that he could not remember whether the world was different when he started from the way it was when he finished, because it had been such a long time.

The trouble with the AV system, as with many others, is that it means that those who vote for a minority party have, in effect, two votes. It is no good saying that they do not. If I vote for a majority party, I have only one go at it. The person who votes first for ridiculous parties such as UKIP has another vote, and no doubt votes for the Liberal Democrats. I understand that if Liberal Democrat voters are polled, there are proportionally more anti-Europeans among them than in any other of the major parties. Suppose the person votes for the Liberal Democrats. They do not win, so the voter still has a chance to vote Conservative or Labour.</p>

This is a serious point. If there were an eliminating ballot, of the kind that all the parties have used, and the right hon. Gentleman were lucky enough to get a plurality of the first preferences whereas Straw was knocked out, on the second ballot Straw supporters would have to decide who to vote for.

system, because the present system does not do them the justice that they feel they should have. They would even move from first past the post to a less fair system so that they get more votes. What kind of principle is that?</p>

I have heard no principle from those who support these new clauses. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will consider four points. First, there is a fundamental difference between reform and change. The Secretary of State has been talking about change as if it were reform. If he were bringing this change forward alongside the Wright Committee recommendations in a manner that enabled the House to discuss and vote on them properly, we might believe in the reform agenda, but there is no motion before us to stop automatic guillotines, for example, or to provide that we will sit for as long as it takes properly to discuss issues. There is no motion to require 100 hours in Committee before a guillotine. All those suggestions would keep the Executive under closer control.

It would be good if we had a more common approach. However, none of them has a system that I would swap for ours. The disadvantages in every other country are clear, and I shall give one example. If anyone knows a Dutch MP, they will know that he is elected under a perfectly proportional system, but has no interest in a constituency, because in order to be perfectly proportional the system can never be constituency-based.</p>

Did they give the nascent Labour party the opportunity to have a proper reflection of the number of votes it won? No, they did not. While they had power under the first-past-the-post system, not a word of such a reform passed any of their lips. This question only comes up in the House when a party thinks that it can get something out of it, and if anybody thinks that that is reform, rather than change, they should think again.</p>

The first will be on the trust that the public have in us, as Members, and in the House and Parliament as institutions. Secondly, they will be interested in accountability-how they, as the public, can make Members of Parliament, especially those in safe seats, more accountable to the electorate. That is why the public are pressing for things such as primaries to select candidates, the recall of Members, greater transparency through the publication of expenses and Members' commercial interests.</p>

ago, I would have favoured that system, but I do not think that it has worked particularly well because it has broken the constituency link and encourages bickering between parties. For example, there might be two MSPs from different parties claiming different mandates from the same group of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="100209-0020.htm_para3"><a name="100209134000043">The party list system, which the House approved for the European Parliament, like STV, which the Liberal Democrats support, uses multi-Member constituencies that are so big that they break the link between the constituent and the Member of Parliament, leave the public unclear about who represents them and, as we saw at the last election, allow extremists, such as the British National party, to be elected when they have nothing like the support of a majority of members of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="100209-0020.htm_para4"><a name="100209134000044">The London Mayor-I say this nervously, with my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) sitting behind me-is elected by a modified form of the alternative vote. That system has worked quite well. Over three elections, we have had three changes. We had an independent Labour Mayor elected, a Labour Mayor elected and a Conservative Mayor elected. That shows that the alternative vote does not lock in an unfair advantage to the left or the right, or to the two largest parties at the expense of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="100209-0020.htm_para5"><a name="100209134000045">Opponents of electoral reform ask, "Why bring the proposals forward now? What has changed?" Three things have changed. First, there is greater public mistrust in the system than ever before. Secondly, there has been a fragmentation of the vote. In 1951, 582 MPs-94 per cent. of the total-won with an absolute majority, with more than 50 per cent. of the votes in their constituencies. By 1979, when Margaret Thatcher came to power, the proportion was down to 68 per cent. By 1997, in Blair's landslide, the figure was down to 53 per cent., and at the last election it was down to 34 per cent. Barely one third of the Members of this House enjoy the support of a majority of their voters, let alone a majority of those living and entitled to vote in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="100209-0020.htm_para6"><a name="100209134000046">The first-past-the-post system works fairly well in a two-party race and reasonably fairly in a broadly two-party system, but the United Kingdom no longer has a two-party system. We have three broadly left-of-centre parties: the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party. In addition, we have two broadly right-of-centre parties-the Tories and the UK Independence party-and some other parties too, which are represented in the Chamber this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="100209-0020.htm_para7"><a name="100209134000047">In York in 1987, which was the first time I stood, there were four candidates. In the last election there were eight candidates. There has been a fragmentation of the political parties, too. In 1987, I lost the election by 147 votes. The Green party took 637 votes. The Liberal Democrats, who had a particularly strong candidate-a Social Democratic party candidate, as he was in those days-in the form of the person who is now the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), took 9,898 votes. I would not be human if I did not wonder whether I might just have scraped ahead if those votes had been redistributable to other candidates. The same question occurs to Conservatives who lose by a whisker because their vote is split by UKIP or some other right-of-centre party.</p>

 This right-wing rump-for a variety of reasons that I have no time to develop-now stands on the brink of power, but they would never have been in power again if Jenkins had been listened to and electoral reform had been implemented. Do the maths; look at any opinion poll; add up the Labour and the Liberal and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists and Respect and other parties, and it is easy to see that there is a very clear centre-left majority in this country.

We have cleaned up the scandal of parliamentary expenses so the abuses that took place can never take place again. We are committed to giving Parliament more power, and many of the measures in this Bill advance that. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Order. I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but the private conversations of Members who have recently arrived in the Chamber are far too loud. Those who have been here for this debate, as well as myself, would like to hear the Minister's reply.</p>

 Thank you, Mrs. Heal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100209-0021.htm_para5"><a name="100209136000042">We are rightly putting forward through this Bill many measures to give Parliament more power. We set up the Wright Committee, and we will see through its recommendations. We are committed to bringing in recall of MPs. We are pioneering new ways of involving the public directly in policy making. This commitment to constitutional renewal is the context for these measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100209-0021.htm_para6"><a name="100209136000043">We all need to do everything we can in every area to enhance the legitimacy of our democracy with the people we all serve. The legitimacy of the electoral system is fundamental to that. There is clearly a case for enhancing that legitimacy and, as many Members have explained this evening, the alternative vote can do that by ensuring that every Member of Parliament comes to this place with the support, in some form, of a majority of voters. These Government proposals give the British people a choice as to how they want to elect their Members of Parliament. We should give them that choice and support these proposals.</p>

 The Sunbeds (Regulation) Bill was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), and the Bill has received a Second Reading and is due to be considered in a Public Bill Committee tomorrow. The provisions in the Bill make new powers available to local authorities in England, and accordingly a money resolution is required in order that the Bill can be debated in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100209-0023.htm_para15"><a name="10021030001166">As I made clear on Second Reading, I believe that the Bill provides the first legislative opportunity to tackle an urgent problem. It is supported by evidence from a range of sources, including findings of the World Health Organisation, the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment, and surveys carried out by Cancer Research UK on behalf of the Department of Health. The evidence supports the view that informs this Bill: that sunbeds are a health risk, that use of sunbeds by under-18s is growing, that there is a clear link between sunbed use and skin cancer, and that voluntary regulation by industry has not been enough to protect young people. The Bill addresses those problems directly, which is why the Government fully support it. The provision of funding for local enforcement is necessary if the aims of the Bill are to be achieved. That is why I commend the resolution to the House.</p>

 We, on the Conservative Benches, are supportive of the Bill, and we supported its contents on Second Reading. There is clear clinical evidence to support the banning of under-18s from using sunbeds, and we wish to see the Bill progress. As the Minister rightly said, the Committee stage is tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="100209-0023.htm_para16"><a name="10021030001168">However, I have one query for the Minister about the money resolution. It is a query that I raised on Second Reading, but one that I did not get a response to. In the impact assessment, the annual cost of the implementation and enforcement of the Bill is estimated at Â£88,000-approximately Â£100,000-which is based on the questionable assumption that 5 per cent. of sunbed salons would continue to allow under-18s to use their sunbeds, and that that would be identified only through public complaint. Is the Minister confident that the detail in the impact assessment is correct? It does not appear to have been strongly or forensically analysed, and that figure could be a gross underestimate of the possible costs to local authorities. Will she therefore confirm that the total cost allowed under this money resolution is Â£88,000, as detailed in the impact assessment?</p>

 It will not have escaped the notice of hon. Members that the Minister has not put any figures whatever on her assessment of the costs of the provision. My hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds), speaking from the Front Bench, has rightly drawn attention to the figure of Â£88,000. It will not have escaped your notice, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we are in an age of austerity. Surely we should be considering affordability. In my submission, therefore, it is incumbent on the Minister, before asking us to accept this money resolution, to give us an indication of the likely costs, because surely we cannot be in the business of providing the Government with blank cheques.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an assertion. What I am interested in is evidence. I look to the Minister to provide some evidence that the provision will be proportionate, and that it will not offend against the principle of affordability. I also want to ensure that she will take into account the information that came to me earlier this evening, which is that many users of sunbeds who are under 18 are employed in our armed forces. The impact on their morale could be substantial if they cannot continue to use sunbeds. I should be grateful if the Minister could address those points in responding to this brief debate.</p>

 I am grateful for the support across the House. I should be happy to clarify this further, but just to make it clear, Â£88,000 is what we believe will be required to ensure proper enforcement of the ban for under-18s. That is based on information provided to us by the Local Government Association. If we chose to exercise the regulation-making powers, we would of course conduct further impact assessments.

 I am grateful for the opportunity that this debate provides to raise my concerns about the impacts of climate change on Bangladesh and to say how we should respond to them. In large part, the debate arises out of a joint report published by the all-party climate change groups in the UK and the Bangladeshi Parliaments. The report is called "Climate change equity: is it a plan, an aspiration or a fashion statement?"</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para4"><a name="10021027000011">I want to take this opportunity, as chair of the UK all-party group on climate change, to praise the work of my counterpart in Bangladesh, Saber Chowdhury MP, who has shown great leadership on this issue. I also want to praise the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which has taken a leading role in bringing together parliamentarians from around the Commonwealth to discuss the impacts of climate change. As we know, many Commonwealth member states are highly vulnerable to climate change, and it is my belief that, as MPs, we have a considerable task ahead in promoting climate change policies and proactively ensuring that climate change finance is properly utilised. I will return to that subject later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para5"><a name="10021027000012">As we know, Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to climate change. Even a 1 metre sea-level rise would displace 30 million people, and although that prospect may be some time off, many problems are likely to happen in the meantime due to more intense storms, increasing salinity in drinking water supplies and so forth. I suspect that the prospect of tens of millions of displaced people is one reason why India, which shares most of Bangladesh's border, is building a security fence all along that border. With a land mass the size of England and Wales and a population of around 150 million, the pressures on Bangladesh are immense. Clearly, another consequence of climate change could be the raising of regional tensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para6"><a name="10021027000013">Help from the UK is immensely important to the people of Bangladesh. About Â£1 billion a year is committed, making us Bangladesh's largest donor. Nearly Â£140 million comes through the Department for International Development. Clearly, the money is devoted to the twin aims of developing Bangladesh's economy and accomplishing the millennium development goals. Equally clearly, these goals and Bangladesh's escape from poverty are threatened by climate change. It is vital to reassess our support in the light of the changing climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para7"><a name="10021027000014">We also need to ensure that more money is forthcoming. It would be interesting to learn how much of the $30 billion of early climate change finance proposed by the Copenhagen accord will find its way to Bangladesh. As the Prime Minister has acknowledged, we need to ensure that we are talking about new money-not just taking it from existing development budgets. As we know, some countries have reduced their official development assistance budgets in the wake of the recession. The UK has pledged to increase our official development assistance to the 0.7 per cent. level called for by the United Nations way back in 1970. We need assurances that this increase will be largely separate from climate change finance. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para8"><a name="10021027000015">I support the commitment we have made that no more than 10 per cent. of our ODA budgets will be spent on tackling climate change, but I think that we should match that commitment with another and insist that that 10 per cent. never becomes more than 10 per cent. of our climate change assistance. We have to be open and transparent about this; we must not count the new money twice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para9"><a name="10021027000016">As Copenhagen showed, there is a commitment among developed countries to commit new finance to tackling climate change, but it is not at all clear that the figures mentioned, including the mid-term goal of $100 billion a year by 2020, relate to actual need. One wonders how we arrived at a figure of Â£64 billion at today's exchange rate. One of the tasks of the two all-party groups' joint report was to see whether we could put a benchmark figure on what Bangladesh should receive from all sources if we had a global deal that really was equitable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para10"><a name="10021027000017">Global leaders emerging from their summits always like to talk about equity, but they never seem inclined to define it. The nearest they get to doing so is by reference to the United Nations framework convention on climate change statement that we all share "common but differentiated responsibilities". That sounds all well and good, but it is no more than a statement of the bleedin' obvious. What does it mean in practice? In our report, we try to flesh it out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para11"><a name="10021027000018">We have chosen to use a contraction and convergence-or C and C-model and apply it to the Department of Energy and Climate Change cost of carbon abatement figures. It should be noted that the C and C framework, which posits a contraction in global carbon emissions leading to a global per capita convergence point, is the working model used by our own Climate Change Act 2008, the Committee on Climate Change and many others in calculating what our effort should be. In short, the result of that somewhat inexact exercise as it appears in our report nevertheless shows that fair climate change financing for Bangladesh this year would approach Â£2 billion. This, let us not forget, is on top of the existing Â£1 billion from the UK and other international finance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o586"><a name="10021027000019"><a name="100209-0024.htm_spnew3"><a name="10021027000078"><b>Bob Spink (Castle Point) (Ind):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has shown great leadership on this issue. May I set it in context? Bangladesh's annual per capita carbon emissions are a quarter of a tonne, the United Kingdom's are approaching 10 tonnes, and those of the United States are about 28 tonnes. Bangladesh did not cause the problem, and it is not fuelling the problem now. We did and we are, so we must pay. That is the clear message.</p>

<p><a name="st_o587"><a name="10021027000020"><a name="100209-0024.htm_spnew4"><a name="10021027000079"><b>Colin Challen:</b>
 I agree. I shall say something about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para12"><a name="10021027000021">Substantial sums are involved, which is all the more reason why we must not pretend that they could be buried in normal ODA financing. I have no idea how Bangladesh will fare in securing a fair share of that help. It has not done very well so far. Let us consider, for example, what it has got out of the clean development mechanism. There seems to be an unwritten rule that the poorer a country is, the less it can earn from CDMs. In other words, if a country is too poor to emit much carbon dioxide in the first place, it cannot expect to receive much help to avoid emitting carbon in the future. If a country cannot enter a carbon market, its  <br>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 887</b><br>
costs in tackling climate change will go up. As the carbon price forecasts of the Department of Energy and Climate Change illustrate, in the medium term at least, official assistance is considered to be twice as expensive as market-driven finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para13"><a name="10021027000022">What is the basis of the 2020 figure of Â£64 billion, and what is the basis of the short-term figure of Â£19.2 billion? Those are the Copenhagen accord figures translated into sterling. Have we begun to identify what the money will be spent on? When do we expect to see it spent? Who will be in charge of it? Those questions urgently need answers. The Copenhagen accord was so lacking in ambition-ambition, that is, to provide a rational and coherent solution to the challenge of climate change-that we should be impatient with any delay or obfuscation over the few promises that were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para14"><a name="10021027000023">Another question that our joint report asks about climate change finance is whether we need better governance at international and domestic levels. In Copenhagen last December, I gained the impression that many developing countries were dissatisfied with the way in which climate change is currently handled. It is felt that local voices tend to be excluded from the process. In my view, we should do more-much more-to ensure that local people are in the driving seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para15"><a name="10021027000024">In that context, our two all-party groups would like parliamentarians to have a greater role in monitoring the way in which money is spent, and more power to call Governments and international bodies to account. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association could have an enhanced role in the Commonwealth. If Members of Parliament from developed and developing countries had a regular channel through which to share their experiences, we could help to ensure that moneys were spent properly. Such channels could be established by the creation of bilateral Select Committees or a formal inter-parliamentary forum. Saber Chowdhury and I urge both our Governments to consider supporting the establishment of such a parliamentary forum between the United Kingdom and Bangladesh. Our existing links, through the CPA and the fact that we are Bangladesh's largest donor, suggest that a cross-party bilateral arrangement could have a significant role to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para16"><a name="10021027000025">Underpinning such an arrangement should be a recognition that equity is not just about money-in which context the donor is too often perceived to have the upper hand-but about ownership. We need to recognise that while we may see ourselves in the United Kingdom as benefactors, we are actually debtors. As is so often said-and as has been said this evening-the developed world created the problem, but it is the developing world that will feel the impact of climate change first. Equity means understanding that countries such as Bangladesh are our creditors, and that it is therefore not for us to demand a dominant say in what we think is best. We must be equal partners, and who better to ensure that we realise that vision than the elected representatives of civil society?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para17"><a name="10021027000026">Another major aspect of our report is the way in which it addresses the impact of climate change on human rights. It argues strongly for a human rights-based approach to climate change, since many of the rights that we cherish can so easily be destroyed by it. The report notes that there are currently four pillars to the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 888</b><br>
climate change negotiations: mitigation, adaptation, financing and technology transfer. We call for the addition of a fifth pillar, that of human rights. In practice that could mean, for example, greater attention being paid to environmental refugees. It may mean that such refugees receive official recognition and status. Obviously, this is a live issue in Bangladesh, for if those 30 million displaced people cannot be accommodated in an already overcrowded country, and are hemmed in by a security fence, what is to become of them? For that matter, what is to become of people whose very nations may disappear, as could be the case for Commonwealth countries such as Vanuatu or Kiribati?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para18"><a name="10021027000027">The UK Government are well placed to launch an initiative to explore the legalities of these matters, and to ensure that the United Nations framework convention on climate change urgently addresses the issue. This work must be done before the crisis deepens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para19"><a name="10021027000028">The Department for International Development has been one of the outstanding successes of this Labour Government, but the challenges ahead are multiplying. It is good that we are making it a legal responsibility to reach the 0.7 per cent. ODA goal. For 40 years, the UN's ambition was merely voluntary, which is why so many countries have failed to achieve it, but let us not forget that the 0.7 per cent. goal was in no way scientifically arrived at. Even in 1970, it did not relate to actual need. Now, at a time when Nick Stern has suggested that 2 per cent. of GDP will have to be spent tackling climate change, one hopes that we will not be waiting another 40 years before we commit to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para20"><a name="10021027000029">I hope that we hear a very positive response from my hon. Friend the Minister this evening, as next week I and colleagues in the CPA will be visiting Bangladesh, and climate change will be at the top of our agenda.</p>

 May I begin by thanking my hon.

May I also say how pleased I am that more Members than I had anticipated are present for the debate, especially at such a late hour? My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para21"><a name="10021027000031">By now, it is well documented-although, perhaps, not yet as well understood as we might wish-that the impacts of climate change will be most keenly felt by the developing world. Countries such as Bangladesh that are already vulnerable to rising sea levels and changing weather patterns are particularly susceptible. In Bangladesh, climate change is not a future threat, but a current reality. The country is well used to floods and cyclones, and its people are resilient and adaptable, but the pace and severity of the climate changes that the world is now facing could have disastrous consequences for Bangladesh.</p>

people affected by floods each year, 8 million affected by droughts, and up to 8 per cent. of low-lying land under water owing to rising sea levels. Associated with that will be the saline pollution of rice-growing paddy fields. All of that could happen within the lifetime of our children. Looking even further ahead, by the end of the century, half of Bangladesh's coastal embankments could be breached by rising sea levels. Should sea levels rise by just 1 metre, as my hon. Friend suggested, a fifth of Bangladesh could be flooded. In other words, an area 18 times the size of Greater London would be under water-land that people depend on for shelter and for their livelihoods.

The UK and Bangladesh enjoy strong historical links and we have been working with Bangladesh for many years, supporting development across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="100209-0024.htm_para26"><a name="10021027000038">That support includes Â£100 million allocated over the next eight years to help the people living in the areas that are most affected by climate change. In September 2008, we hosted an international conference on the impact of climate change in Bangladesh. At that event, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced a further Â£75 million to support the Government of Bangladesh's strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Of that Â£75 million, Â£60 million will be channelled through a pooled fund to be controlled by the Government of Bangladesh.</p>

Government of Bangladesh to decide how the money is spent. I also want to stress that all UK bilateral development assistance to Bangladesh, including the Â£60 million contribution to the pooled fund for climate change, is made in the form of grants rather than loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="100209-0025.htm_para1"><a name="10021027000040">The UK has pledged Â£1.5 billion towards fast-start financing agreed at Copenhagen. That funding will kick-start measures aimed at cutting emissions and will help developing countries to adapt to climate change. Clearly, some of that money will be spent in Bangladesh.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="100209-0025.htm_para2"><a name="10021027000041">Climate change has particular consequences for those living near the sea, and I mentioned some of the potential risks earlier. Although at this stage we cannot be sure of the exact impact, we should be in no doubt that millions of people, especially those living in coastal regions, might be forced to relocate if adaptation measures prove inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="100209-0025.htm_para3"><a name="10021027000042">Migration for environmental or climate reasons, as my hon. Friend has mentioned, is nothing new for Bangladesh. The country has suffered regularly from flooding and from cyclones. When such events occur, local people naturally look for better opportunities for themselves and their families. They often decide to move to cities and in doing so they move from the problems in one part of the country to different problems elsewhere-perhaps living in overcrowded slums, putting further pressure on services in Bangladesh. The Government and their development partners are working together to help cities to cope with their growing populations. The UK, for example, is investing Â£60 million through a United Nations programme to improve infrastructure and services for some 3 million very poor and vulnerable people in 23 towns and cities in Bangladesh.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="100209-0025.htm_para4"><a name="10021027000043">I had the privilege of visiting Bangladesh last year and I spent some time with people living on the chars-low-lying sand islands in the Jamuna river. I saw how UK aid had been used to raise homestead farms above the level of the 1998 and 2007 floods. I saw what a difference that made to the people living there. What I saw made me realise the sheer scale of the challenge that climate change presents in Bangladesh.</p>

 Order. The half-hour Adjournment debate is essentially a Back-Bench occasion and it is not usual for Front-Bench spokesmen to intervene. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is not a Front-Bench spokesman on international development, but the fact that he and the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), are here may be seen as their demonstrating their interest. It is better that the debate is kept as a Back-Bench occasion, otherwise other precedents will be set.</p>

that my Department is doing on the chars before he visits Bangladesh, he could look on DFID's website under the chars livelihoods programme, where he would see some analysis of that project's work. If he were minded to look at YouTube, he could see a video blog that I did while I was on the char islands, which graphically brings home to people in the UK who have not had the privilege of visiting those parts of the world what is happening there. They can see for themselves exactly what we mean when we talk about raising homestead levels and allowing people to deal with climate change and development-all under the roof of one particular project.</p>
