The dedicated drugs courts have now been extended from the pilots in Leeds and west London to elsewhere in the country&#151;indeed, I visited one in Salford not very long ago. Specialist domestic violence courts are being rolled out across the country. We now have 122 such courts, which are successfully bringing together different agencies to deal with domestic violence. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently opened the mental health court, which will deal with mental health issues and crime. All those courts are part of our determined effort not just to bring offenders to justice but to ensure that when they have served their time they can be brought back into the community in a positive and useful way.</p>

 Why does the Secretary of State look surprised that he engenders so little confidence among the public and probation staff when he cannot run his budget? The director of probation has said that he wants the maximum level of underspending. Hundreds of expensively trained probation trainees are going straight on to the scrap heap. Hundreds more staff on full pay are in the so-called surplus employment pool, yet probation officers often have only a few minutes a week to supervise serious offenders. The property maintenance system is so bureaucratic that changing a light bulb in Birmingham requires a repairman to drive from Newmarket. As accountancy is not the Secretary of State&#146;s strong point, will he confess that public safety is very much in peril under his stewardship?</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman does nothing to enhance his case through gross exaggeration of the situation. As I have said, the simple fact is that probation spending has increased by 70 per cent. since 1997, compared, in real terms, with 35 per cent. for the Prison Service. Probation spending has gone up further and faster than the case load. It has gone up much faster than it ever would have done under a Conservative Government, and much faster that it ever would under a Conservative Government.</p>

 The &#163;100 million youth crime action plan, among other measures, has led to a 6.6 per cent. decrease in the proportion of young offenders who reoffend, and the rate at which they reoffended fell by more than 20 per cent. By introducing the youth rehabilitation order later this year, we plan to focus a more intense effort on tackling the young people with the most challenging behaviour, to assist them in turning their lives around.</p>

<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="09072161000067"><a name="90721-0001.htm_spnew21"><a name="09072161001684"><b>Mr. Crabb:</b>
 Studies by the Minister&#146;s own Department show that the odds of reoffending increase massively when a prisoner has no employment to go to on their release. Given that statistics show that youth unemployment has increased massively&#151;from 11 to 17 per cent.&#151;in the past 12 months, and that employment and training opportunities for young people are being decimated during this recession, what chance does the Minister give her aspiration for further progress on cutting reoffending rates of being realised in the current climate?</p>

 Of course the climate is a challenging one, but that is not a reason to give up. We believe that we could do far more to ensure that young people get every chance to turn away from the life of crime that they might have embarked on at an early age. We are providing more assistance, through interventions, to help them to do that, and to deal with the real risk factors such as a lack of accommodation, a lack of employment and a lack of support. The figures to which I referred earlier show that we are succeeding, and we intend to continue to do so.</p>

 My hon. Friend hits on an important point. Many young and slightly older people who end up in custody have problems with their educational attainment. The provisions in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is going through the other place at present, will make local education authorities responsible for the educational attainment of people in youth custody. That will make a big difference, because it will focus the attention of education authorities on outcomes for this most disadvantaged group, which has, until now, disappeared into the youth criminal justice system because local authorities, which are primarily responsible for education, have washed their hands of the outcomes for that group.</p>

 There is evidence that this type of disposal can assist the victim to gain some satisfaction by making an impact on the person who perpetrated the crime against them. It is also important in assisting the young person to realise the full consequences of their action. This disposal is available in the youth system and can be a useful part of intensive community activity to prevent young people from going into the criminal justice system in the first place and to ensure that they turn away from the temptation to commit crime. At the time the crimes are committed, they may seem to be victimless and consequence-free, but this type of disposal can help young people to understand that they are neither. It is thus a valuable part of what we can do to turn young people away from crime.</p>

 I accept that it is nothing to be proud of when serious further offences are committed by people on licence. However, the figures on serious further offences being committed and convicted show only 0.35 per cent., so while I do not wish to sound complacent in any way, we must bear in mind the overall context, which I think is important. Much tougher and better arrangements for public protection have developed over the last 12 years: through multi-agency protection, public protection arrangements, and arrangements for IPP prisoners&#151;those given an indeterminate sentence for public protection&#151;those who were previously released without any supervision are now supervised regularly and can be recalled to prison if their behaviour gives any cause for concern.

What happens&#151;I have seen this in operation&#151;is that the dispensing machines are put in by the health service to control the issue of methadone, so that only those prisoners who have been prescribed it medically, by a medical officer, can receive it.

meet Members of Parliament? Finally, given that more than 300 Members have signed the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on Equitable Life issues, will the Minister consider giving the House the opportunity for a debate in Government time and the opportunity to vote?</p>

<p><a name="st_o118"><a name="09072161000185"><a name="90721-0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="09072161001794"><b>Mr. Byrne:</b>
 Let me deal first with the central question about the difference between compensation schemes, as proposed by the ombudsman, and our conclusion that an ex gratia scheme would be more appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90721-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09072161000186">The ombudsman made 10 findings and went on to say that a number of injustices resulted. When we looked through those findings, we came to the conclusion that in nine out of the 10 findings, we could accept wholly or in part her conclusion that there was maladministration. In four of those areas, which I think were significant, we accepted that injustice followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90721-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09072161000187">Two consequences follow from that position. The first is that we departed from the ombudsman in her conclusion that a compensation scheme should be put in place, because we do not think the taxpayer should be the compensator of last resort. We think that would have perverse consequences, and it is a principle on which the House has voted in the past. Secondly, it would be irrational for the Government to propose a compensation scheme across the board for charges of maladministration or injustice that we did not accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90721-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09072161000188">I know that when the ombudsman came before the Public Administration Committee on 21 January&#151;my hon. Friends will correct me if I have the date slightly wrong&#151;she said that she would almost rather the Government accepted her recommendations and then did nothing to provide compensation. I do not think that that is the right approach. There are findings that we have accepted. There are charges of maladministration that we have accepted. Further, there are charges of injustice that we have accepted. We also believe there will be people who have suffered and are suffering hardship&#151;in some cases extreme hardship&#151;as a result of that. That is why it is essential for us to set up an ex gratia payment scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90721-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09072161000189">The ombudsman did not have the chance to go into the vital question of who lost what. That is the first piece of work that we have asked Sir John to consider. I do not think it is possible to get an ex gratia scheme in place and operating justly until we have understood who has lost what. Obviously, there are hundreds of thousands of policyholders&#151;</p>

issues to be addressed. Will the Minister tell us if this will cover all aspects of Sir John&#146;s terms of reference or just the issue of relative loss? For example, will it include his advice on which groups of policyholders have suffered the greatest impact because of the failure to regulate Equitable properly? Will it include how he will seek to apportion blame between the regulator and Equitable Life, or can we expect to see many more reports from Sir John delaying justice even longer?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90721-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09072161000193">Although there has been criticism of Sir John, fault for any delay rests with the Treasury, which has tried to kick the issue into the long grass. Have Ministers set a deadline by which Sir John will have completed his work? Will the Minister confirm that the Government will make a formal response to each of Sir John&#146;s recommendations as they are made, or will they seek to delay the process even longer by waiting until he has completed all his work? Once Sir John publishes his final report, how long will it take the Treasury to make payments to policyholders? All that we seem to get from Sir John is more questions and very few answers, and there has been no answer from the Treasury on the most important question&#151;when will policyholders receive the justice that they have been so long denied?</p>

Once the ombudsman concluded her investigation, and set out where she thought that injustice had been perpetrated, it was perfectly proper for us to reflect on what she said, then make the decision to put in place an ex gratia scheme to correct those injustices. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that to ensure that the maximum possible help is delivered to those who are in the hardest and most difficult financial position, it is vital to understand who has lost what. There are hundreds of thousands of policyholders, and every single bit of information associated with those policyholders has to be gone through first, which is why we have given Sir John Chadwick all the resources for which he has asked, and it is why we will continue to check that he has all the resources that he needs to conduct his task. We are absolutely committed to getting a scheme up and running as quickly as possible, and I hope that the hon.

Sir John Chadwick has been non-communicative with Members and others, but meanwhile policyholders are dying every day while the Government are still deciding to pick and choose the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations. The Minister may think that today represents some progress, but does he not share my concern that his statement was littered with equivocation, and talked of &#147;a further document&#148;, an &#147;interim report&#148;, a statement of his approach, and a  <br>

list of &#147;the specific issues&#148;. Will policyholders not be worried that that is further delay and prevarication? If the Government thought that the situation was as good as the Minister claimed, would he not, instead of sneaking it out in written form, have come to the House of his own volition and made a statement this afternoon?</p>

 There have been three debates on Equitable Life and the Government&#146;s response to the ombudsman this year, and we had a good debate during oral questions a week or two ago. I return to the basic argument that I have presented this afternoon: if we think an ex gratia scheme should be set up, to ensure that money under that scheme goes to the people who have been hardest hit, the first piece of work that we must do is to understand who has lost what. Until we do so, it is difficult to get up and running an ex gratia scheme that will operate justly. Surely, that must be the objective of right hon. and hon. Members. Sir John has an enormous amount of work to do to go through the information that has been passed to him by Equitable Life. A number of right hon. and hon. Members have made representations, and he is moving quickly. He is publishing reports in quick succession to make sure that the maximum amount of information is available to policyholders and so that they can see and comment on the direction in which his mind is moving.</p>

 I lost a small amount in the Equitable Life fiasco. May I urge my right hon. Friend not to be so stubborn and slow about this? Responsibility for these losses rests in three parts: first, with savers; secondly, with Equitable Life itself; and thirdly with the Government for what they themselves admit is maladministration. I urge my right hon. Friend to revisit the question of compensation: it would be much quicker, and they could put a cap on it, so that smaller savers would receive proportionately more. Will he revisit that issue?</p>

 No, I will not for the simple reason that, first, I do not believe that the Government should be the compensator of last resort when there has been regulatory failure; and secondly, I simply do not think that it would be rational or a good use of public money to provide compensation when there have been conclusions that we simply do not accept. However, I do not subscribe to the ombudsman&#146;s view, put forward on 23 January, that it would be better to accept all the recommendations and then do nothing to provide any compensation at all. It is important that an ex gratia scheme be set up, because there is injustice that we recognise. We must now ensure that public money goes to where it is most needed, and that is why we must understand, first, who has lost what.</p>

 That is an extremely reasonable point to which I am entirely sympathetic.

 I absolutely agree that it is time that the policyholders of Equitable Life had the justice that they deserve.

are the basis of the ex gratia scheme that will be set up. When it came to changes to retirement age, reserves for guaranteed annuity rates, the financial reinsurance in which Equitable Life tried to engage and the information that the Financial Services Authority provided in the post-closure period, the Government accepted in all those cases not only that there was maladministration, but that injustice had therefore followed. That will have a bearing on the breadth of the ex gratia scheme that is eventually recommended, but, as I said, until Sir John has studied who has lost what, it will be almost impossible to design an ex gratia scheme that operates justly.</p>

 That would be a question for the business managers of the House. I want to tease out two points. Yes, the Government did depart from many of the ombudsman&#146;s conclusions about maladministration. We set out cogent reasons for doing that, and they are subject to judicial review, commencing today. It would not be rational to propose a compensation or ex gratia scheme based on findings that we simply did not accept; that would not be a good use of public money. That said, we accept that injustice has resulted from maladministration in certain areas and we think that an ex gratia scheme is therefore required.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para0"><a name="09072161000219">The issue is important. The Government objected to the writ earlier, but should we fail to move it today, we might well condemn the people of Glasgow, North-East to having no Member of Parliament for the next five months. When the Government Chief Whip stood up&#151;in that magisterial way that he has&#151;and objected to my motion earlier, I was not sure whether I was watching a tragedy or a comedy. What I saw could have been tragic because the Government are treating the people of Glasgow, North-East with contempt. It could also have been comic; I imagined another Whip phoning the busload of Labour MPs who have gone off to campaign in the by-election in Norwich and making them come straight back to ensure a Government majority against democracy and a by-election in Glasgow. That is where this Government have got to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09072161000220">The issue is extraordinarily serious. Two months have passed since Michael Martin announced that he was standing down and it is a month today since he demitted office, yet Labour has failed to move the writ. As I understand it, the earliest possible date on which the by-election may now be held is Thursday 5 November, by which time the constituency will have been without an MP for 136 days. In contrast, Ian Gibson resigned his Norwich, North seat on 5 June, and that by-election will be held this Thursday, 48 days later. Last year, the by-election for the seat of Glasgow, East was held on 24 July, just 26 days after David Marshall stood down. So Labour has had every single opportunity to call this by-election, but in objecting to the writ, as it did earlier today, it is not only demonstrating contempt but running scared of the people of Glasgow, North-East. What that objection also did was to demonstrate that it is not only by convention that the moving of a writ lies in the hands of the governing party Whip, but that it is the practice as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09072161000221">We are reaching the end of this Session; we finish it today. Labour has had every opportunity to move the writ and to avoid people being left unrepresented, but it has failed to do so; that is why we felt compelled to move. The only practical reason not to move the writ would be that the by-election would clash with the Glasgow fair and the Glasgow holidays. Fair weekend was last weekend. The earliest date that the election could be held if the writ were moved today is 20 August, after which time the fair and the holidays will be over, and the children will be back at school on 17 August. There is therefore no practical reason why this cannot happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09072161000222">The long and short of it is that Labour has once again put party first and people second.

We have workers at the Diageo  <br>

Moving a writ now would mean a by-election in the middle of August. If we move the writ now, it would have to be held by Thursday 13 August, long after the Glasgow schools have broken up for the summer and before they return from the summer break. It would mean holding the whole campaign before the Glasgow schools come back on 17 August, which would disfranchise constituents. We do not think that the writ should be moved now for a by-election in the middle of August. We want to have the by-election when most people have the chance to vote, which means not holding it during the school holidays, when many families are still away on holiday. In any case, a new Member of Parliament, even when elected, could not take their seat until the House next meets on 12 October. When, as in this case, the vacancy arises when the House is sitting, the writ cannot be moved when the House is in recess, so we will move it as soon is possible after the House returns in October.

The Labour party knows that if it were held to account on that programme, it would be more likely to lose the by-election. Why is a by-election good enough for the people of Norwich, North?

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09072161000249">However, I also feel that this debate, which has resulted in fairly strong feelings expressed in all parts of the House, is entirely understandable, and it will be repeated time and again in the future, just as it has been repeated in the past. Where a Government refuse to issue a writ for the replacement of a Member, of course people will feel that the constituents of that constituency, wherever it is, are not being treated fairly and that matters are being manipulated for the benefit of the majority party. That encapsulates some of the problems in the House with our electoral arrangements, which are exactly analogous with the fact that we do not have fixed-term Parliaments, which therefore means that the Prime Minister of the day can manipulate the timing of a general election to the benefit of the majority party in the House. The issue also highlights the fact that the business is in the control of the Executive rather than Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para11"><a name="09072161000250">I am very much inclined to agree with what the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) said. In the same way that there is an automaticity about this issue in local government by statute, so there should be an automaticity about it in Parliament, either by statute or by our Standing Orders. The issuing of a writ should lie with the Speaker, and the writ should be placed before the House at the earliest opportunity. The only determining factor should be the convenience of the constituency returning officer, within very narrow parameters, as to when the election should be held. I hope that this matter will now be looked at, because the present arrangements are entirely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90721-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09072161000251">Notwithstanding that, we have conventions in this House about the way in which these matters are dealt with. However, conventions may be examined and, when necessary, removed. I believe that this convention is now overdue for removal. I entirely appreciate the arguments of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). I think it likely that the Government will have their way today and that we will move on to the next business, but the hon. Gentleman has done a service to the House by pointing out the difficulties that this situation poses for the good people of Glasgow, who are currently unrepresented, and, more importantly, for the House, which again does not have the self-confidence to do its own work.</p>

 The synthetic tears of the separatists must be exposed. First, their party claims that the people of Glasgow, North-East will be without an MP for a matter of months. This is the same party whose leader, the First Minister, has almost the worst voting and attendance record in this House&#151;second only to the Sinn Fein Members. The SNP has the cheek to complain that the people of Glasgow North-East do not have an MP, but where is the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90721-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09072161000253">Secondly, the SNP has made a point about school closures, but may I remind it that education is a devolved issue? The local council will deal with school closures, as will the Scottish Parliament. The constituency still has an MSP. Thirdly, the last time we went down this road, the SNP was the party that complained. It is absolute hypocrisy.</p>

 May I help the House by relating some personal experience? I have contested two by-elections. The first was in 1969, when I contested Newcastle-under-Lyme. The Labour Member, the much-respected Stephen Swingler, had died, and I have to say that, on that occasion, the Labour party delayed holding the by-election for virtually nine months. I believe that that was unacceptable. In my constituency of Macclesfield, I had to wait almost six months for the by-election after my predecessor, Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey, was elevated to the upper House as Lord Harvey of Prestbury. So, to an extent, both major parties use the holding of a by-election for political purposes. They make a judgment on how well or badly they are likely to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90721-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09072161000255">I will support the motion that has been moved by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), because I believe that holding a seat vacant for virtually six months in this day and age is unacceptable. I do not go along with my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), who said that a by-election should be held within 28, or perhaps 40, days. However, I would certainly support another of his proposals: I hope that you will convene a conference on this matter, Mr. Speaker. I believe that a by-election should be held within three months, and I regret that, at this very difficult time for the country, the honourable and decent people of Glasgow, North-East are going to have to wait to have a representative. Even if Parliament is not sitting, they should still have a Member of Parliament to represent their best interests.</p>

 Order. I am sorry that the House was deprived of the services of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) for a period of six months, and I think that that sentiment will be widely shared. May I also tell him that, on the strength of the contributions that have been made to the debate thus far, it is clear that there are a number of willing applicants for service on any future Speaker&#146;s Conference, where there to be such on this matter?</p>

 I understand that if the writ were to be moved today, the by-election would be on 13 August. Will the Leader of the House advise me of the last date on which anyone resident in Glasgow, North-East who was not on the electoral register could apply to be put on to the register, were the writ to be moved today? Secondly, what would be the last date on which a resident of Glasgow, North-East who was on the register could apply for a postal vote, were the by-election to be held on 13 August?</p>

 Speaking as someone who has fought two parliamentary by-elections&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] I know I look too young. In my experience, irrespective of summer holidays and when children go back to school, as soon as candidates are chosen for political parties, the campaign begins for them. In my estimation, waiting until the House resumes in October, then moving a writ and having the parliamentary by-election in November as we approach winter is an argument for not having it at that time either. As far as the interests of the people of the said constituency are concerned, the sooner the by-election is brought on, the better for everyone.</p>

 I beg to move amendment (a) to Lords amendment 1.</p>

<p><a name="st_o172"><a name="09072161001012"><a name="90721-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="09072161002578"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b>
 With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Lords amendments 2 to 31.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09072161001013">The Bill has received a great deal of attention for many reasons, but unfortunately the amendment that was passed in the House of Lords about the protection of the Bill of Rights, which goes to the heart of our proceedings in Parliament and therefore our sovereignty, right to free speech and a raft of other matters, does not achieve its objectives&#151;at least, it achieves the wrong objectives. I deeply regret the fact that the Attorney-General is not a Member of this House, because it is more appropriate to deal with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in this place so that we can ensure that we properly protect the privileges and rights of this House and of Members of Parliament, and that proper and fair procedures will apply that will not be overridden by an attempt to refer an issue to the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of Justice. We do not hold those rights for our own benefit: we hold them on behalf of the electorate. It is on that point that I make my main case.</p>

<p><a name="st_o173"><a name="09072161001014"><a name="90721-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="09072161002579"><b>Sir Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b>
 I do not for a minute dissent from what my hon. Friend is saying. He is moving an important amendment that certainly has my support. Does he agree that it is appalling that we have only one hour to consider a completely rewritten Bill? I readily acknowledge that it was substantially improved in the House of Lords, but we have only one hour to consider all the important Lords amendments, as well as my hon. Friend&#146;s very important amendment. Is this not a terrible way to treat the House on the last day before we rise?</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="09072161001015"><a name="90721-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="09072161002580"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. The entire proceedings on this Bill have been conducted in an extremely shabby manner. Indeed, some important statements have been made by some of the most distinguished officials in the House&#151;and in the other place&#151;and the reservations that have been expressed, for example by the House of Lords Constitution Committee, about the fast-tracking of this Bill are a matter of record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09072161001016">The problem is that because of the sovereignty of this House it is essential that we protect our supremacy with regard to the borderline between what we do here and what may be referred to the European Court of Justice or the European Court at Strasbourg. The wording that I originally proposed, and which was adopted by my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench a couple of weeks ago, contained the words that I now propose to reinsert.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>21 July 2009 : Column 771</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09072161001017">Unfortunately, the Bill was amended in the Lords so that the only words left were:</p>
<a name="90721-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09072161001605"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nothing in this Act shall be construed by any court in the United Kingdom as affecting Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09072161001018">The opening words were knocked out and excluded. I regard them as absolutely crucial to preserving the sovereignty of this House, and indeed of the electorate. They are as follows:</p>
<a name="90721-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09072161001606"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Notwithstanding any provision of the European Communities Act 1972, the European Convention of Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09072161001019">Having made that reservation, I concur with the wording of Lords amendment 1, as I have just set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09072161001020">Some distinguished lawyers took part in very learned discussions in the House of Lords. Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Lord Howe of Aberavon both made a number of brief comments but they did not go into the merits of the proposals to any extent. They simply averred their own opinions in a few sentences, whereas the Attorney-General gave a lengthy dissertation on the questions of privilege and other matters that relate to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09072161001021">The fundamental question is as follows: if a disgruntled or aggrieved person raised an issue that ultimately led to judicial review, would a reference to the ECJ&#151;or, to a slightly lesser extent, the European Court of Human Rights&#151;override the jurisdiction of this House? The Attorney-General ruled out that possibility. In contrast, Lord Mackay, a former Lord Chancellor, said that although he did not think such a situation likely to arise, he could not rule it out. I have conferred on this matter with a number of eminent constitutional authorities&#151;of such distinction that they are called on to give advice on matters in all the courts of law and in Parliament&#151;and they agree with me that it is important that we retain in the Bill the words that my amendment proposes to reinsert. They accept that it would not be possible to assume that neither the ECJ nor the ECHR would not get their hands on a particular matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o175"><a name="09072161001022"><a name="90721-0007.htm_spnew4"><a name="09072161002581"><b>Mr. Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b>
 I shall cheerfully support my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment if it is put to the vote, but I have one question for him. He mentioned the ECHR, but it does not have&#151;and never has had&#151;any jurisdiction over this or any other court in the land. It is the embodiment of a treaty obligation. It can rule that the proceedings of this House, for example, might be in breach of the European convention on human rights&#151;although it might be foolish of it to do so&#151;but that ruling cannot be binding. For that reason, the part of the amendment that he is presenting would not have any impact one way or another. The rest of it is of greater importance.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. I am not going to disagree with him on that point, but I am concerned to remove uncertainty in a matter of such importance as this. In passing, I want to pay tribute to Lord Jenkin of Roding for the extremely efficient way that he dealt with this matter in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09072161001024">I shall begin by setting out the problems posed by the European convention on human rights. There has been a great deal of comment, in the House of Lords and  <br>

elsewhere, about a case in 2003 known as A. <i> v.</i><i> </i>the United Kingdom. It is a lengthy judgment, and I do not have the slightest intention of going through all the detail, but it did not apply only to the UK. Other nations were concerned about possible intrusion into their privileges&#151;Italy, France, Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria played an active part in the case. It can fairly be said that the case did not settle the question of the application of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. I would go further and say the court concluded that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09072161001026">However, that was only with reference to that case, and there is no doubt whatever that the European Court did not exclude the possibility of difficulties in maintaining parliamentary privilege and that the court might in future need to take steps to override, effectively, what is done in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90721-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09072161001027">The Court continued:</p>

Because the question involves matters of such supreme importance, it is absolutely essential that we put it beyond any doubt. The Justice Secretary may say, &#147;Oh, we don&#146;t need to do this,&#148; but my response would be that in the course of the proceedings on clauses 9 and 10 I put it to him that the Clerk of the House and the Speaker&#146;s counsel had come up with certain issues and when I asked whether he thought they were wrong, he said, &#147;Oh no, they&#146;re not wrong&#148;, and then he just ploughed on. As it happens, the Government eventually had to give way, but in these circumstances it is essential that we act not merely with an abundance of caution but with prudence.

In shorthand, IPSA has now been cut out of that arrangement, so the Commissioner will now report directly to the Standards and Privileges Committee&#151;a much simpler process&#151;except where either the Commissioner judges that a complaint is ill-founded or he or she has reached an accommodation with the Member concerned.</p>

 We are asked to consider the amendments made in another place. May I say at the outset, before I go through some of the detail, that we on the Conservative Benches broadly support the amendments that the Lords have made to the Bill? Most have been the subject of vigorous debate and negotiation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09072161001086">Just over a week ago, the Bill arrived in the House in a state of some confusion. It was immediately clear that the Government were trying to do too much in too short a space of time. As I explained in my Second Reading speech, which I will not rehearse again now, it was obvious that Ministers had been required, at very short notice, to create a Bill that had&#151;initially, at least&#151;to match the Prime Minister&#146;s press release, no matter what the consequences. It quickly became apparent that those consequences would have had a devastating impact on the House and the ability of its Members to go about their business freely and without being trammelled by the judgment of the courts. That was not just our opinion, but that of the Justice Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Clerk of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09072161001087">So we are pleased that the Government have made some significant concessions, both in this House and another place, that have ensured that we have, in large part at least, avoided a full-on constitutional collision with the judiciary. We have now achieved most of what it was ever necessary to achieve in the interim, before Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s committee reports in October&#151;that is, the establishment of an independent fees office that will set and administer our allowances and expenses and provide an independent mechanism to investigate any alleged misuse of those allowances and expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09072161001088">I now turn to the amendment to Lords amendment 1 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). We appreciate what my hon. Friend is trying to do. The House will note that a stipulation is already laid down in Lords amendment 1, which explicitly states that the issue of parliamentary privilege will remain unchanged by the Bill. The House will also note the powerful points made by the Attorney-General in her letter to their lordships and her speech to the upper House on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09072161001089">It would be impossible to exclude the European Court of Human Rights from the Bill, because we have an international treaty obligation not to do so. However, an ECHR judgment has no real power in this country because, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has consistently pointed out, it is not enforceable as such in our courts. If the Government felt obliged to adhere to whatever judgment the ECHR had made, they would have to go through the painful route of introducing primary legislation. I should register my doubt that amending the Bill to exclude the Human Rights Act would have any effect at all, given Lords amendment 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09072161001090">However, despite all that, the intention behind the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone is completely clear. It is reasonable, given the  <br>

concern registered and the number of colleagues who signed up to the amendment, that Conservative Front Benchers should support it. As this final concession will not have any negative impact on the Bill, I urge the Government to give it to us and join us in the Lobby.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend recall the words of the Justice Secretary? He said that he was prepared to wager that nothing arising from the Bill would go in front of the European Court of Justice.

The original Bill would have succeeded in unravelling, in just a few days, fundamental rights that have been at the foundation of our democracy for centuries. Although the Justice Secretary held to a remarkably calm and sanguine view of the impact that the Bill would have had on the proceedings of Parliament, great anxiety&#151;even alarm&#151;was expressed by the Clerk of the House, by two Select Committees of this House and by many hon. Members on the Floor of this House, as well as by a great number of Lords and Ladies, and their Committee in another place, who thought it best, given the nature of this concern, to ensure that there was an explicit warning to the courts that there was nothing here for them. We agree, and we are glad that the Government have acquiesced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09072161001094">On Lords amendment 2, we are pleased that the Government have agreed that nothing in the Bill should affect the House of Lords. We entirely support the intention behind the amendment to ensure that if the House of Lords wishes to establish a similar body it can do so, perhaps with the wisdom of our experience behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para21"><a name="09072161001095">As regards IPSA and the commissioner, I will not go through every amendment in detail, but I will touch on each clause to see exactly where we have ended up. There have been very few changes to the fundamental restructuring established by the Bill, for under clauses 1 to 4 IPSA will essentially set the allowances regime, pay salaries and allowances, design our code of conduct on financial interests, administer the register of financial interests and establish procedures for investigations. The Lords have also untangled the dual roles of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations. The Government have made the commitment that the existing non-statutory role currently undertaken by John Lyon will remain, responsible to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, in addition to the new statutory Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para22"><a name="09072161001096">However, the commissioner&#146;s role will be separate from IPSA, so nothing the Bill suggests that the new body functions both as judge and jury, and that is surely a sensible approach. The commissioner will investigate complaints of any breaches or misuse of the expenses and allowances regime or the rules on the registration of interests. He will then refer his findings, as appropriate, to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, if the  <br>

matter has not already been settled by repayment. He will receive any relevant information from Members and report any non-co-operation to the Committee. He will also give Members the right to make representations, to be heard in person, and to call and examine witnesses. In addition, the Government have removed two offences: first, on the registration of financial interests; and secondly, on paid advocacy. Those are covered elsewhere in law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90721-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09072161001097">We are very pleased to have a sunset clause. Any legislation that is put through so quickly, and from a standing start, will benefit well from revision and reassessment at a set date in the future. On clauses 5 to 9, the Government have accepted our argument on the need for such a two-year sunset. We understood the argument that the Justice Secretary made to this House on the potential damage that an overall sunset clause would have had on IPSA&#146;s ability to get itself up and running and to recruit and retain staff.</p>

The Government have been forced to make it up as they go along. Even before the ink is dry it is not perceived, in the eyes of many, as a permanent solution. One of the great remaining problems is that the various elements that make up a Member&#146;s remuneration are assessed in an utterly fragmented way. The authority will consider only expenses and allowances. There is a pressing need for some structure or system that can examine pay, pensions, allowances and expenses as one, so that the House does not have to suffer being chewed in different places at different times, as we have been in the past few weeks.</p>

Far from being a great, lasting solution to a deep problem that has hit us all in the past few months, it now appears that we should be prepared for a substantial showdown between the new body that we are establishing to set and administer our expenses, and the old body that we set up to advise on them.</p>

In doing so, the Bill has stepped on the toes of parliamentary privilege to an unacceptable degree. That aspect has been improved by amendment in another place, but I very much regret the fact that we do not have a proper sunset clause, because it is right that Parliament should re-examine the legislation in the near future, for all the reasons that have been set out previously. That should be done on the Floor of the House, not in a Statutory Instrument Committee. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) said that his right hon.

I am in some difficultly, because there are already clear offences on the statute book covered by the Theft Act 1968, the Fraud Act 2006 and the common-law offence of misconduct in public office. I accept that they are all English laws and do not apply in Scotland, but they are the laws that should be applied. The difficulty with creating laws that are specific to Members of Parliament is that it reduces the scope of those offences and provides a lower tariff than would otherwise be the case. The one offence that is left in the Bill as a result of the amendments in another place provides for a much lower tariff than the cognate offences in the Theft Act and Fraud Act. The other difficulty is that the offence in question does not require proof of either dishonesty or material gain, so it is almost an arbitrary offence.</p>

To reduce that range of offences to a single offence that is clearly covered by other offences that carry a higher tariff poses some questions. However, that is something that we can re-examine when the provisions come back.</p>

United Kingdom of 2003&#151;it is clear that the Strasbourg Court very much had regard for article IX of the Bill of Rights, despite the fact that the Court is not bound by it, in the strong majority decision that was made. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which a British court would refer a matter to the European Court of Justice in this regard. If anyone could provide a clear case in which the measure might be appropriate, I would support the hon. Member for Stone&#146;s amendment.</p>

 I will be brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker. First, I would like to render the House&#146;s significant approbation for the work of the Clerk of the House, Dr. Malcolm Jack, and of Mr. Robert Rogers in dealing with the privilege question. They were aided and abetted by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and others. The Bill, with the amendments before us, will end the cosy relationship between the Fees Office and the Members of Parliament&#151;notwithstanding the sterling work that the staff of the Fees Office have done over the years. It should be placed on record that the Justice Secretary and the Deputy Leader of the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley), have shown extraordinary patience and forbearance in this matter, and started from scratch, as my right hon. Friend said.

<p><a name="st_o226"><a name="09072161001124"><a name="90721-0009.htm_spnew12"><a name="09072161002632"><b>Sir George Young:</b>
 In the very short time left, I want to have a final go at amending the Bill. I invite the Government not to press Lords amendment 12 to a vote. The amendment is a big mistake. It would remove the right of IPSA to refer a matter to the commissioner. The notes that the Government have circulated on the amendments state:</p>
<a name="90721-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="09072161001621"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is consequential on the IPSA ceasing to have a role in considering whether to give a direction or make a recommendation in consequence of an investigation by the Commissioner.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90721-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09072161001125">It is no such thing; this is an entirely free-standing proposal. The amendment represents a backward step. If we pass it, IPSA will be unable to pass any evidence of wrongdoing to the commissioner for investigation. It cannot be right for the House to proceed with Lords amendment 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90721-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09072161001126">There are other issues that I would have liked to explore, had more time been available. I want to protest that this is simply no way in which to handle constitutional legislation. When we debated the Bill before it went to the other place, we did not complete our consideration of all the clauses. It then had three days in the other place, but at least there were gaps between those three days, in which Members of the other place could reflect on the proposals and Ministers could make helpful suggestions. The Bill has now come back to us. The Lords did not mean us simply to take it or leave it, yet all these disparate amendments have been lumped together. Anyone who wants to vote against Lords amendment 12, as I do, will have no opportunity to do so, because of the way in which the motion has been framed.</p>

 Does not the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about Lords amendment 12 also apply to a number of the other amendments? Their net effect will be that we shall end up with an IPSA with less independence and less authority, and which will be concerned with fewer and lower standards.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) for interrupting him. This is such a parliamentary farce. We have had just one hour in which to discuss all these important issues, and my right hon. Friend has just touched on a very important one. Would you be kind enough, Sir, to discuss with Mr. Speaker the way in which this Bill has gone through the House? He told us all that he was anxious for Parliament to regain its sovereignty, so would you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, be kind enough to ask him to look at the statements that he made just four weeks ago and compare and contrast them with the way in which the Government have treated this House over this supremely important Bill?</p>

However, we are talking about closing a service in what is&#151;because of the great cities of Liverpool and Manchester&#151;the No. 2 crime hotspot. The proposal makes absolutely no sense. We have some of the leading forensic scientists. The university of Central Lancashire is second to none and has world-class status in forensic science degrees. We should be looking at the service being brought together between the university and the Forensic Science Service in the north-west. It should be the last facility that we should consider closing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09072161001515">It is a rather strange situation and I believe that common sense will prevail and that a review will show that it would be silly to close the facility. I have had an Adjournment debate on the subject and have made these points clearly. I met the Prime Minister to make sure that he was aware of the sensitivities of the matter and how crass that decision would be. We have quality people, solving crimes and working for many police forces, including Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Lancashire, Cumbria, North Wales and even Staffordshire. A huge service is being provided at Chorley and we cannot allow it to close, as that would be a further attack on our science base within the north-west. We have already seen the synchrotron go from Daresbury and we do not want to see any more closures or attacks on our scientific base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09072161001516">The other big issue facing the north-west is jobs and there is great concern about Jaguar Land Rover, which has announced over 300 redundancies at its plant at Liverpool. That is bad news. I want manufacturing to be put on the front foot and for it to receive more support from the Government. Manufacturing has had support but I would like to see even more. That could be done through the short time working subsidy. We have  <br>

seen that operating in France, Germany and even Wales. I would have thought it was time for the Government to bite the bullet. I do not believe that we should be subsidising people through the jobcentre to be unemployed when, for the same amount of money, we can support them within their job. That is why the subsidy would make a real difference to people within manufacturing and would keep those companies ticking over.</p>

We want to train people when they are in employment and make sure that they have a future. I cannot see a better way of doing that and we ought to back it up with a national jobs summit, at which we could bring together the employers, trade unions and bodies such as Federation of Small Businesses to make sure we deliver on the future of jobs. Following that, we could have regional jobs summits to bring people together. Manufacturing is the future of the country and should be its backbone. We should learn from previous Governments, and from this Government, who have wanted to believe in the service industry and the banking industry. We have learned a costly lesson that manufacturing is important and it ought to be No. 1 again.</p>

I believe that there is good news today and that Derian House will get that money back from Customs and Excise. Common sense has prevailed. We won the moral argument and we have now won the argument completely. That is good news in which all constituents throughout the north-west can share.</p>

There is an award-winning tax office there, and another in Hyndburn. The office in Chorley is in a purpose-built building. It was never down for closure. In fact, it was held to be an example of the best way to run a tax office: the staff were second to none, and, as I have said, the office was award winning and purpose built. Although it was not down for closure, guess what happened? The tax office in Blackburn was down for closure and so was the one in St. Helens. Suddenly, however, although we were not down for closure because we had an award-winning office, there appears to have been some interference. The office in Blackburn is no longer going to close and neither is the one in St. Helens, but those in Hyndburn and Chorley are going to close. How can that be right? Has there been political interference? If there has, that is unacceptable. I hope that the Treasury is listening, and that it will reopen this tax office and let common sense prevail, because although it is down for closure, it is not closed yet. We could bring in other work. As we know, increasingly people are applying for tax credits. We want to be able to ensure that they get their credits right. Why do we not bring that work into Chorley, and into the office in the constituency of my hon. Friend the  <br>

We are a farming area as well. We need the 2 per cent. escalator to be scrapped. All it will do is add to inflation and stop us coming out of recession early. I plead with the Government to listen to what we are saying about the fuel escalator. It must not go ahead in October. That would help to ensure that the recession ends sooner.</p>

I thought the question was very good, but the answers were somewhat lacking. If we are going to have an ombudsman service and if we want to encourage people to save, when the ombudsman highlights maladministration and a remedy is identified, the Government should look very carefully at that remedy, because if people are going to invest in future, they will need to have confidence that there will be proper regulation. The Government want to encourage greater saving, but that will not happen if regulators fail and then there is no compensation. People are not going to be encouraged to save if we do not have a system that gives them confidence that when things go wrong there will be compensation.</p>

recent entry that is about to go in the register is a visit to the carbon capture and storage pilot project in south-west France that was funded by Total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09072161001529">My real interest, however, is that of a constituency MP representing the concerns of many constituents whose livelihoods depend on the health of the oil and gas industry. That is an interest I have not just as a constituency MP; I am an MP for the north-east of Scotland, which has been fundamentally tied up with this industry for many decades. Moreover, this interest involves the whole country; it may be unheard of in the rest of the country, but what has been achieved in the North sea has involved a golden opportunity for the whole country. It has delivered many jobs&#151;between 350,000 and 400,000 at present. It has contributed massive revenues to the Chancellor&#151;a third of his corporation tax last year came from the North sea. It also made it possible for this country to meet its Kyoto commitments by the use of gas as a more environmentally friendly fuel than coal. The North sea has therefore delivered a lot for this country, including a period of great energy security when we were an exporter of energy. However, that is now changing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09072161001530">There are challenges facing the North sea now, which the Select Committee highlighted. The specific challenge is that facing any province reaching greater maturity: the big finds have long ago been identified, and now we have moved on to the smaller fields, but they have to compete for investment in a global financial market. They need to be competitive in that global financial market and they need the Government to recognise the challenges they face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09072161001531">As the Committee made clear, the industry is looking not for a subsidy, but for a fairer and more effective tax regime that takes less tax up front and thereby offers more incentives to invest, and in the long run brings in more tax to the Chancellor, because with that investment more oil and gas will be produced, which will earn more revenue for the Chancellor. Any oil and gas left in the ground produces no tax revenues. It belongs to the country, but we only get it out of the ground by engaging with the private sector. It is that sector&#146;s skills and expertise that get it out of the ground. We need a regime that encourages that future bold move to get more out of the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09072161001532">There is another North sea challenge in the current period. Many of the platforms are reaching an age when they might usually have been decommissioned: their maintenance is getting more expensive as they were not designed to last this long, but&#151;fortunately&#151;they were over-engineered so they are still in active use. The current pipelines and platforms are, however, crucial hubs to future exploration. The finds that are now being made are too small to justify stand-alone production. They need to be linked back to the existing platforms and pipelines in the North sea. Once those platforms and pipelines have gone, whole areas of the North sea will be sterilised from future investment and production. Timing is vital to maintain them, and to encourage those hubs to be there. The Select Committee felt the Government should go further in their tax incentives to bring in more activity on the existing platforms so that they continue to be economic and to be invested in and so that future developments can be tied back to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09072161001533">In a mature province such as the North sea, such smaller future developments are not attractive to the big global companies that have their own cash reserves  <br>

to invest. The tradition is that smaller and more nimble companies move in to take over that investment and that exciting exploration. However, those smaller and more nimble companies rely on the financial markets to unlock the investment, and the credit crunch and the recession have hit them as much as they have hit the rest of the economy. The Select Committee has therefore proposed to the Government that the tax relief that will come to these smaller companies when they get into production should be paid up front and then taken back later when the production comes in. That would assist their cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09072161001534">Another exciting prospect highlighted by the Committee is the future gas finds west of Shetland. There are still large fields there, but it is a very challenging environment in which to operate: it is very stormy and there are very deep waters. Again, we think the Government should incentivise activity in that whole west of Shetland province, because if some of those major fields west of Shetland are developed, that will provide a great psychological boost to the oil and gas community and will produce more excitement in the markets about the potential of the North sea. All this is about security of supply for our energy needs, future tax revenues from those fields and&#151;above all from a constituency point of view&#151;the jobs that come from that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90721-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09072161001535">The jewel in the crown of maintaining an efficient and vibrant home market is the growing export market that the UK has built up around the world. We are now world leaders in the frontiers of deep sea oil and gas exploration and production&#151;subsea engineering&#151;and we export our skills around the world. The fact that we still have a base in the UK means that that big manufacturing and industrial sector remains in the UK, bringing money back to the UK economy. For all those reasons, I urge the Government to respond boldly to the Select Committee&#146;s recommendations and create a brighter future for the North sea and for the security of this country&#146;s energy supplies.</p>

To this day, he refuses to answer the question on that. I, therefore, raised it with the Cabinet Secretary in the Select Committee in November 2007. Sir Gus O&#146;Donnell got back to me, saying that the Cabinet Office has no jurisdiction over either House of Parliament and he did not see a role for him on the issue of the undertaking, as it was really not a matter for him. On the other question of residency, he said that it was exempt information because it involved a conferring by the Crown of an honour or dignity&#151;that refers to Michael Ashcroft&#146;s peerage.

To this day, I do not know why there has been a huge delay of 16 months. I am asking only for two simple pieces of information. I do not want to know how much tax Lord Ashcroft is paying, but I want to know the answer to the following questions: to whom did Michael Ashcroft give that assurance and what form did that assurance take&#151;was it oral, in a letter or in an e-mail?

 The House should not rise for the summer recess without addressing and resolving a situation facing a small but significant number of citizens of the United Kingdom who are being denied their right to &#147;exportable benefits&#148; . In October 2007, the European Court of Justice determined that aspects of disability living allowance, attendance allowance and carer&#146;s allowance were sickness benefits, rather than &#147;special non-contributory benefits&#148; and were therefore exportable and payable to United Kingdom claimants living in other EU states and Switzerland. That decision has, potentially, a profound effect on the incomes and well-being of those who, having left the United Kingdom to take up residence in other EU states, had benefits to which they had previously been told they had an entitlement for life, summarily withdrawn in 1992.</p>

They have, throughout their working lives, paid UK taxes and national insurance contributions and have earned the right to those continuing benefits to which the ECJ says they are entitled. It would appear that there are about 2,000 to 3,000 such people and their moving abroad has probably saved the UK taxpayer significant sums in continuing health care costs.</p>

First, the Department has imposed a condition that claimants must have resided in the United Kingdom for 26 out of the previous 52 weeks before claiming&#151;inevitably, many people who moved abroad before the ECJ ruling have found their claims rejected on those grounds. Secondly, claimants are told that their applications for reinstatement fall because they did not appeal within the time limits set following the original decision to terminate benefits. Given that the ECJ ruling was not announced until October 2007, that is clearly a condition designed to facilitate the rejection of claims for reinstatement, rather than to facilitate them. Indeed, in a letter to me dated 14 April 2009 the relevant Work and Pensions Minister said:</p>

 There are several issues of importance to Plymouth that I could mention today, including how we could speed up  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 July 2009">

the connectivity of broadband; how we respond to the Walker review of water supplies, in view of the high water costs in the south-west region, and how some fairness could be brought into the charging system; or the need for further investment in transport, given our peripherality. However, in the past few weeks, one issue has been raised with me frequently by telephone and letter, and that is the problems with leasehold managing agents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09072161001562">In 2006-07, according to the English housing survey, more than 1.5 million households were owned leasehold, so about 11 per cent. of the total owner-occupied sector could be subject to management by a managing agent. Most leaseholders lead a problem-free existence and are happy with the way in which their properties are managed and their relationship with their freeholder. However, for a significant minority, this is not the case and most MPs will know from their casework in both the private rented and residential leasehold sector that people&#146;s lives can be made a misery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09072161001563">Typically, where a block of properties is owned leasehold, the freeholder appoints a managing agent to maintain the property, arrange building insurance and look after any communal areas. These managing agents will levy fees on the leaseholders for the provision of these services and should explain these charges&#151;but that does not always happen, as I will explain later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09072161001564">The managing agent sector is a multi-million pound industry, and one which is at the moment entirely without objective and independent scrutiny and regulation. In the last two months alone, I have had complaints about four separate managing agents. Many of the concerns raised have a common theme, and interestingly many of the properties affected in Plymouth are part of the portfolio that was sold off by the Ministry of Defence. The complex web of sales has been part of the problem for residential leaseholders, who have had difficulty tracking down their landlord and then the managing agent responsible for ensuring that works are carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09072161001565">For example, a company called Novograde bought a tranche of ex-MOD properties from Annington Homes in Barne Barton. Novograde employed a company called Labyrinth Properties Ltd to manage that property. The Shorepoint residents came to me because they were receiving bills from Labyrinth for work which they claimed had never been carried out, and when they tried to contact the managing agent seeking the details of the maintenance being done, nothing was forthcoming. I tried to make contact with Novograde to see if it would put pressure on its agents. I also contacted a company called Galliard Homes whose name cropped up, but whose role was unclear. I contacted Labyrinth, to try to get them to talk to the residents. Sadly, none had the decency to respond to my request for a meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09072161001566">Some progress now appears to have been made. Labyrinth has lost its contract to a company called TMS, and TMS has already been in touch with me and seems to be moving in a more positive direction. It has acknowledged that the area has been poorly managed and that the residents have not had the information to which they were entitled. Clearly the jury is still out, but I have encouraged TMS to engage with the residents and vice versa.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>21 July 2009 : Column 798</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09072161001567">In the case of the Shorepoint properties, one issue of concern was the common areas, including play areas, which were neglected and potentially a health hazard. The problem was that no one was taking responsibility for those areas. Residents are often, and understandably, concerned with their own individual properties and simply expect the private landlord to ensure that the grounds are maintained, as their contracts provide. Common area maintenance is not initially residents&#146; first priority. However, when the exterior becomes overgrown and when residents are being charged for maintenance and nothing is being done, they get more than a little irritated. Some managing agents and freeholders will try to delay action and dispute land ownership to avoid paying out for remedial action. This of course often then puts pressure on the local authority&#151;and the council tax payer&#151;when it has to be called in to inspect areas and serve notices, if appropriate, on the landlord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09072161001568">Leaseholders are often invoiced for works outside the legal timeframe, and invoices are sent out incorrectly&#151;either too soon or with the urgency of a final demand without prior warning. In Vicarage gardens, St. Budeaux, there is now an active group of residents&#151;lovely people&#151;who are in some cases very frightened because they have received court summons and final demands for sums that they believe they have been incorrectly charged. Pier Management, which oversees these properties, again proved elusive until very recently. It has at last responded to letters I sent on behalf of a resident&#151;an elderly woman&#151;who had been sent a court summons for moneys which, when broken down, she had either paid or were in fact not due for some time. The lady in question has at least been reimbursed and I now understand that progress is being made with other residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09072161001569">However, some questions remain unanswered. The residents have not been allowed to see the insurance cover which exists for their buildings. These are a series of mainly maisonettes which have four properties in them and which are wholly free-standing. The residents want to know why they cannot organise their own buildings insurance. The managing agents simply say that all the properties should be insured as a single portfolio. I would welcome the Minister&#146;s confirmation that that is in fact the case, and if it is, the issue should be revisited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09072161001570">In another part of my patch, a company called Solitaire is the managing agent; again, until very recently and following my involvement, its unwillingness to speak to or meet residents has led to a serious breakdown in relations. It has now met residents, and its regional director has taken away their concerns. The residents produced figures showing that the percentage increase in charges was astronomical with no obvious improvement in the service offered. They quite rightly felt that this was unacceptable. I am pleased to say that yet again there has been some progress. Errors have been found in the company&#146;s budget figures that make a considerable improvement in the charges levied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09072161001571">Why is it acceptable for these companies not to provide the service for which leaseholders pay not inconsiderable sums annually? They should not have to engage the support of the local MP. Leaseholders should be able to access their landlord and know where to contact them. The same applies to private tenants, and I am pleased that the Government appear to be making progress towards changes in this regard.</p>

 I want to speak about aeroplanes, tax and flowers&#151;a combination that probably has not been addressed by the House so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09072161001574">I shall speak first about planes. There has been much debate recently about Heathrow. I opposed the third runway there and I also oppose the development of the Thames estuary airport that is sometimes known as &#147;Heathrow-on-Sea&#148; or &#147;Boris Island&#148;. Whatever it is called, it is a rehash of the Maplin Sands proposal of the 1970s and it is wholly and totally inappropriate. However, I fully support the expansion of Southend airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09072161001575">That may appear contradictory, but the expansion of the current facilities at Southend airport would be very positive for the town and the surrounding area. The main expansion would involve lengthening the runway from 1,605 to 1,799 metres. That would make Southend a successful regional airport with the capacity to serve 1 million to 2 million passengers, and so similar to the very successful airport at Southampton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09072161001576">Southend&#146;s economy is heavily interwoven with tourism, and a fully functioning passenger airport would provide a major boost to the town. However, Southend cannot rely on tourism alone, as it also needs to rely heavily on the business sector. The airport plays an important part in that respect as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09072161001577">Hi-Tec is a big company with its headquarters in Southend, to which it relocated mainly because of the existence of the airport and the capacity that it offered for staff to get around Europe. A larger airport would offer more passenger flights, and both Southend and Rochford councils have made a strong commitment to develop a business park. The airport already employs 1,300 people: its expansion would create at least another 1,000 jobs, but my gut feeling is that there would be a great many more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09072161001578">There are always different views on airport expansion. I have received many letters and e-mails both supporting and opposing expansion. I conducted my own survey of local business people and 62 per cent. said that they supported expansion of the airport, with only 13 per cent. saying that they opposed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09072161001579">Politicians can disagree with each other as well. In our last recess Adjournment debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) set out some of his legitimate concerns about expansion, but the final decision rests with councillors in Southend and Rochford. I urge them to have some backbone: they should do what is right for the town and not worry about political point scoring. Some politicians in both towns have stepped up to the challenge, but not all. We should set aside party politics and do the right thing for Southend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09072161001580">The consultation on the joint area action plan closed on 15 May. It was a mistake for the councils in Southend and Rochford to request the airport not to get involved  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 July 2009">

<notus-date day="21" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>21 July 2009 : Column 800</b><br>
and to stay silent. It was also a mistake by the Stobart Group to acquiesce in that and not to get out and sell the benefits of the airport. Now that the consultation is closed, there should be much more aggressive selling of the benefits that an expansion of Southend airport could bring, especially as we approach 2012. Southend is closer to London than Stansted, with faster journey times to the capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para27"><a name="09072161001581">I turn now to the question of tax credits. I know that Mr. Speaker is keen to speed up responses to parliamentary questions, and I hope he will consider extending that to parliamentary correspondence as well. I have written to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury about my concerns about queries to the tax credits office and, given that over the next 10 days some of my constituents will fill in their tax credits renewal forms, that is a very appropriate matter to raise today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para28"><a name="09072161001582">Some families in my area have children leaving full-time education. If they do not notify the tax credits office of that, they could end up in receipt of an overpayment of tax credits and thus being fined more than &#163;300. The system is a mess, and the responses from the tax credits office are poor, untimely and sometimes not especially comprehensive. The result is that several clarifications have to be issued, and the extended correspondence can cause confusion. It is a great disincentive to people taking on the extra work and promotions that would be notifiable to the tax credits office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para29"><a name="09072161001583">I turn now to flowers. I have noticed that Members of Parliament sometimes get the bit between their teeth about really small issues. Given the bigger issues such as the recession and the economy, it may seem odd to speak about Southend hospital&#146;s decision to ban flowers, but things are sometimes symbolic. The ban on flowers is symbolic of a public institution that has lost touch with reality&#151;one that has lost the common touch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para30"><a name="09072161001584">Ministers have said that the flower ban is a matter for the local hospital trust, but I am sure that if they seriously thought that flowers were a risk to health they would issue national guidance on the matter. An article entitled &#147;The Evidence Base and Infection Risks from Flowers in a Clinical Setting&#148; was published in the <i> British Journal of Infection Control </i>in 2005, and I am sure that hon. Members of all parties will have read it in great detail. It states that there is no &#147;robust evidence&#148; that flowers cause a problem, and it goes on:</p>
<a name="90721-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="09072161001628"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Occasionally, new practices become part of clinical routines despite the lack of supporting evidence. Banning flowers from general hospital wards falls into this category.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para31"><a name="09072161001585">Another survey that I held found that more than 70 per cent. of people wanted to keep the display of flowers in hospital. The journalist Matthew Stanton spearheaded a campaign in the popular local newspaper the <i> Yellow Advertiser, </i>to which the majority of respondents<i> </i>also said that they wanted the hospital to allow flowers in the wards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90721-0011.htm_para32"><a name="09072161001586">Last week, I went to the hospital at quite short notice to see a friend, and I found it to be dirty, depressing and disorganised. The visit confirmed some of my worst fears, and the hospital&#146;s failure to see common sense on flowers is on the same level as the failures that have caused it to become dirty and have poor patient flows. Despite its multi-million pound budget, the chairs are crumbling and there is not a decent one to sit on. The ragged signs on the walls telling one where to go suggest that the operation there is not run in a professional way.  <br>

The symbolism of the ban on flowers represents a much greater problem at Southend hospital, and it is a problem that I hope the hospital addresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09072168000007">The Honduran junta has rightly been almost totally isolated. It has been rejected by the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Organisation of American States and the European Union, among others. It is rare that I pay tribute to Ministers, but I pay tribute to the newly installed Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), who has responsibility for Latin America. He responded very quickly and efficiently and made a statement to put on record Britain&#146;s opposition to the coup. It is also important that the EU yesterday suspended more than $90 million in aid to Honduras in the wake of the coup.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09072168000008">However, such opposition has so far been ineffectual in restoring Zelaya to government and stronger action is need. Obviously, that stronger action should come from America, because at the end of the day, it calls the shots in what is historically its back yard. There were hopes of real change with the election of President Obama, but we can see that there are tensions within the American Government. Clinton, the Secretary of State, is possibly somewhat enamoured of the new regime and does not want to take the action that others in America would like. If the US is to break with the past and work with people rather than against them, as President Obama told the conference of Latin American leaders it wants to, the steps that he must take are clear. The Honduran Government&#151;or rather, the supposed Government&#151;must be replaced and a democratically elected President must be installed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09072168000009">We hear lots about human rights in the media, but since the coup on 28 June that installed Roberto Micheletti, the regime has unleashed a wave of repression of human rights. Protesters and political activists have been killed, 1,300 people have been arrested, and there have been curfews, widespread media censorship and the violation of other civil liberties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09072168000010">That is important, because although we have joked in the past about banana republics and Governments being changed on a monthly or daily basis, most of Latin America has emerged from that darkness and the people have begun to take charge of their destiny. We have seen that throughout the Latin American continent, including central America. The military junta represents an attempt to turn the clock back to those dark, dark days. If those dark days return, it will mean real hardship for the millions of people in central and Latin America.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09072168000011">I hope that the deputy Leader of the House will re-confirm that the UK is absolutely and implacably opposed to the Honduran military regime, and that the UK will do all it can to restore the democratically elected regime.</p>

contacted me with news that Vestas was planning to close its operation on the Isle of Wight. Later I wrote to the First Secretary of State, Lord Mandelson, to ask for his support and advice. Vestas is a hugely profitable Danish company and has operations across the world. Until recently, it operated England&#146;s only wind turbine manufacturing facility, in my constituency. It was one of only two in Britain&#151;the other was a small Scottish Government-funded operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09072168000014">Following announcements that Vestas was to shut its Newport operation, several meetings were held. The Minister for the South East, the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw), visited my constituency when he was looking into the matter and ensured that help was given to people seeking new employment. I thank him for his time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09072168000015">I attended a private meeting with a delegation from the Isle of Wight TUC and others from the island, including the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate, Mark Chiverton. A public meeting was held and it attracted a wide audience from across the island and several people from the mainland. Needless to say, Vestas employees and my constituents generally were dismayed at the company&#146;s decision. Vestas announced record profits on the same day that it broke the news that it was closing its facility with the loss of 600 jobs. Vestas is not cutting jobs because of the recession or because of a need to downsize; it has decided that it will be more profitable to manufacture wind turbines in the United States and China, without a thought for the highly skilled workers that it leaves behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09072168000016">When it originally came to the island nine years ago it received a &#163;3.5 million Government subsidy, which contributed to the costs it incurred moving from the mainland. Less than a decade later it is leaving, despite that sizable taxpayer-funded financial support. That is why, when public money supports private companies, it is important for it to be directed to companies and businesses that are firmly rooted in the local economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09072168000017">Since writing to Lord Mandelson on the matter, I have received no reply. I find it disappointing that he could not find time to speak to me about this important issue, especially when I see him on television daily. However, I believe in giving credit where it is due. I thank the Ministers whom I mentioned for their efforts to convince Vestas to remain open on the island. I understand that all avenues were investigated&#151;even subsidies were offered&#151;but with no success. Subsidies, it seems, were not what Vestas was after.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09072168000018">Only last week Lord Mandelson was congratulating himself on the launch of the new low carbon industrial strategy. I hope that he considers Vestas to be a serious loss to the future of our low-carbon economy. Government plans state that around 7,000 wind turbines are to be installed across Britain in the coming years. It seems unfortunate that such green technology will have to be manufactured overseas and shipped here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09072168000019">The loss of those 600 jobs has been a body blow to the island&#146;s economy, especially during the recession. Since Monday evening, protesters against the closure of Vestas have been occupying the site. I understand their frustration and I am sympathetic to their concerns. Not only is Vestas leaving the workers high and dry, it is doing so with very poor redundancy packages. Those who have worked at the site for two years or more are entitled to only twice the statutory pay. Those who have worked for less time will receive less still. As I understand  <br>

it, there were no negotiations with workers on the redundancy packages. I find that totally unacceptable, and it reflects very poorly on a company as profitable as Vestas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09072168000020">The South East England Development Agency has arranged a series of open days for Vestas staff to help them to find suitable jobs.

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09072168000021">On another matter, I must ask why the Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property has failed to produce a full response to a letter from a constituent of mine concerning the Student Loans Company dated 22 April. In late June, via a parliamentary question, I asked when the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills planned to provide a substantive reply to my constituent&#146;s letters. Here we are in late July, and I still await a proper response to my letter. I received a brief reply on 5 July but it was in no way satisfactory. The matter is particularly pressing for the constituents concerned, and they cannot afford to wait any longer. I hope for a full response from the Minister as quickly as possible. The delay is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09072168000025">I want to lay before the House the difficulties I have experienced in pursuing an alleged case of fraud against the NHS. In September 2007 allegations were made to me that a local doctor was passing off his private patients as NHS patients in one of our local hospitals&#151;Arrowe Park, part of Wirral hospital trust. I wrote to the trust to ask for a meeting, which was held in November 2007, when I requested the information held by the trust about its investigation of the fraud. I suggested simple steps that the trust might take to find out whether the fraud was more widespread and involved other doctors. Both my request and my suggestion were refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90721-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09072168000026">In January 2008, under the Freedom of Information of Act 2000, I asked the trust for information about the inquiries that it said it had undertaken. After some delay, the trust refused to give the information. In July 2008 I applied to the Information Commissioner for a ruling that I should have access to the trust&#146;s surveys of that case of alleged fraud. Almost a year later&#151;to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle&#151;the commissioner turned down my request, so I wrote to the Information Tribunal disputing that decision. The tribunal replied that it would of course receive my application, and that of course there could be a hearing, but if I lost the case, all the costs of the inquiry and the tribunal costs would land on my doorstep.</p>

 I start by reflecting on the fact that in the county council elections this year, the Conservatives took control of Derbyshire county council for the first time in 28 years. I congratulate Andrew Lewer, the county councillor for Ashbourne, on becoming leader of the council. The last time we took control of Derbyshire county council was in 1977, which was followed by the famous election victory of my noble Friend the former Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher.

He wrote a letter to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, from which I shall quote:</p>
<a name="90721-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="09072168000110"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;From November 2010 any family hosting a child under the age of 18 must have one adult, considered to be primarily responsible, registered with the Independent Safeguarding Authority, i.e. a CRB check must be made. Aside from the cost, and we do not know who will pay, I wonder how many people will be willing to undergo this imposition. It is intended to ensure child safety yet there will be adults in every household who will not need to be checked.&#148;</p>

We have several times heard the Secretary of State say that he wants to encourage such exchanges, because he believes they are good for the development of individuals. I believe that too, but unless the Government take some action to change the regulations, they will lead to the ending of all those foreign exchanges. As with so much of the legislation we pass, good arguments were made about the measure, but when we see the reality of its coming into effect we wonder how we ever allowed it.</p>

A lot of people are suffering great hardship because the Government did not move faster to deal with the problems.

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09072168000042">The real issue is the Secretary of State&#146;s decision to overturn the Parole Board&#146;s recommendation that Mr. Biggs be released. That was an unreasonable and cruel decision, and there is some evidence that has been put forward by some lawyers that it was a misuse of power and, indeed, ultra vires. Clearly, Mr. Biggs had to spend his time in prison, but his 30-year sentence was excessive. I looked up the Dome diamond robbers, who I think are pretty comparable to those who took part in the great train robbery. Two of them got 18 years, two got 15 years and one got five years. Mr. Biggs would have been released if he had received such a sentence. His sentence was excessive in the first place. It is more comparable to the sentences passed on serious sex offenders and mass murderers, and was inappropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09072168000043">Mr. Biggs has now served 10 years after surrendering in 2001. He was eligible for parole and was recommended for parole. The reason given for not granting him that was that he was not repentant. I have a letter from Mr. Chris Pickard, who was the ghost writer behind Ron&#146;s autobiography, &#147;Odd Man Out&#148;. He states:</p>
<a name="90721-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="09072168000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I do, therefore, have to question who is advising and briefing Mr. Straw as most of what he has said about Ron in his ruling is simply factually wrong.&#148;</p>

Ron has always abhorred violence and has not committed a crime since escaping from HMP Wandsworth back in 1965, other than entering a number of countries on a false passport. Why after over 44 years would Ron, who may never now walk again, return to a life of crime and how would he pull it off in his current state of health?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09072168000045">To say that Mr. Biggs is unrepentant is plain wrong, and to say that he could benefit from crime is ludicrous. This is an ill man, who can hardly walk; I shall say a little about his ill health. He is not going on a speaking tour. He cannot earn from his crime&#151;that would be against the law. It is the media who are imposing themselves on him, not Ron imposing himself on them, and that will happen anyway when he is released, unless he dies in prison, as some officials in the Home Office seem to want. That is unreasonable.</p>

There is massive inconsistency. The Secretary of State will not intervene in cases of murderers who have received life sentences, but he says that he can in cases involving lower offences, such as that of Mr. Biggs. He says that he cannot intervene on future cases, because the law has been changed, but he can on past cases. That is wholly inconsistent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09072168000047">A case is being made by Mr. Biggs&#146;s son, Michael, that there was some political element to the decision. The day before, the Secretary of State made a decision in relation to Michael Shields, the Liverpool man who is in prison in Bulgaria. He decided not to let him go, which I think was the wrong decision, but once he had made that decision, he had to make a similar decision in respect of Ronnie Biggs. Both were unreasonable decisions, and the motivation in the Ronnie Biggs case was unreasonable.</p>

made his decision to keep Ronnie Biggs in prison in the public interest. What public interest is there in keeping a frail 80-year-old man, who has served 10 years, in prison? It is a cruel penal policy, which many organisations for the elderly and the Prison Reform Trust say it is wrong to inflict on the increasing number of people in their 70s and 80s in prison, despite the fact that the severity of the crimes involved has not increased. Why do we have such elderly people in prison, when they should be outside?</p>

He has suffered three strokes, cannot walk, cannot talk, cannot go to the toilet without a bag, has a nasal gastric feed, has broken his hip and his pelvis, has injured his spine, has acute pneumonia and is currently in Norwich general hospital. This is a man who is a threat to society, according to the Secretary of State for Justice. That is ridiculous. The decision should be reconsidered. It is not in the public interest to have an inhumane penal policy. We should have a humane policy, so I ask that it be reconsidered.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen). I hope he will forgive me for not following his line, as I intend to begin by speaking about a group of people whom I regard as more deserving of our sympathy and support&#151;the victims of the Equitable Life debacle. Today&#146;s statement by the Chief Secretary was extremely disappointing. It continues a saga that has gone on for almost 10 years, whereby the Government have delayed and ducked and weaved in order to try and avoid their responsibilities in relation to the victims of Equitable Life.</p>

Will the Deputy Leader of the House, as a business manager on duty tonight, tell the House tonight that as soon as Parliament returns in the autumn, the Government will table a substantive motion on Equitable Life? If she cannot give such an undertaking, will she explain why?</p>

I am sure that she can make a statement to confirm that, because the Government have not been able to do anything about this during the parliamentary Session until this stage in July, so they should not make an announcement when the House is not sitting. It is relevant that the South-West Regional Grand Committee is meeting in Exeter in 3 September, and it would be a pity if information on that regional spatial strategy was bounced on the Committee just before that date.

 Year 5 at St. Christopher&#146;s school in my constituency of Brent, North is not usually the final year for pupils. However, on 18 May 2009, parents were notified that St. Christopher&#146;s would not run a year 6 class from this September. Parents were given two months to plan their children&#146;s future before the end of the school year, which is in breach of the contract between parents and Happy Child Ltd, which runs St. Christopher&#146;s school&#151;some people may think that is a misnomer in the circumstances. I wrote at that point to Ms Tracey Storey, the managing director of Happy Child, asking her to clarify precisely when Happy Child began to consider that alternative provision for those children might be required, and to explain why absolutely no consultation with parents had taken place before 18 May to discuss their understandable concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09072168000063">I was extremely concerned&#151;and still am&#151;about the impact of Happy Child&#146;s decision on other parents and children in the school. Such a decision undermines the confidence of parents whose children are in year 4 and below and who expect their children to continue to be taught at the school until the end of year 6. I asked Ms Tracey Storey to clarify Happy Child&#146;s plans for year 6 teaching for the children currently in year 4 and below.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09072168000064">Changing school is a stressful experience at any time, and it is normal for children to take time to settle in and make new friends. Year 6 is a critical year for many of those children, as they sit SATs and other examinations in preparation for their secondary school education. Such a change in the lives of those children can only be detrimental to their educational attainment and their future success. The parents tell me that their children were looking forward to being in the top year of the school and having the chance to be elected to positions of responsibility&#151;being prefects and so on&#151;and they are concerned that their children will miss out on those opportunities if they are removed from St. Christopher&#146;s. There are other issues about which the parents are concerned, including the additional cost of having to purchase a new school uniform, which raises the wider issue of compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90721-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09072168000065">I therefore asked Ms Tracey Storey to confirm what she and Happy Child would do about issues such as compensation, as well as the fact that the school had failed to give the required notice, as set out in the contractual provisions between it and the parents.

Bailiffs are out of control in Brent, and the council is instructing them, even in cases in which it had entered into agreements with my constituents that they could pay their debts by instalment. We are all aware of the effects of the recession, and debt is likely to be on the rise. It is important that public institutions and bodies act appropriately. It is absolutely right that they should agree to make payment by instalment available to debtors who wish to enter into such agreements. Unfortunately, Brent council has not seen fit to do so in the case of Mr. and Mrs. J who, on 29 July 2008, received a council tax vetting form that stated:</p>
<a name="90721-0013.htm_brev8"><a name="09072168000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The customer is agreeing to pay for himself and his wife&#146;s share, equal to &#163;245.60 of &#163;739.06.

My constituents had to pawn some jewellery to pay that amount. The bailiffs then contacted them again, stating that they owed a further &#163;764.06, and Mr. J sent a letter to the council offering to pay the amount in five instalments. The council agreed to accept payment by instalments and, I am pleased to say, has now, after investigating the matter, agreed that it was mistaken to instruct the bailiffs.</p>

In Hawick in my constituency on Saturday, I joined many others from the town to celebrate the gathering there of the clan Turnbull, a very proud and historic family in the area. While I stood waiting for the pipe band as it marched along to the unveiling of a new sculpture, however, a lady appeared out of the crowd beside me. She was very angry, perturbed and keen to impress upon me the scale of the problems for members of her family who have lost their jobs in the past year.</p>

The people of Hawick, Galashiels, Selkirk, Innerleithen, which I used to represent, and other areas all contribute to a world-class industry, but in the past year the unemployment statistics, which have doubled in my part of the world, have been largely changed by the terrible experience of many in that sector. They have been losing those jobs, and that lady was very intent&#151;I assure the House that she made her point&#151;on getting across to me the human suffering of her children, her grandchildren, their friends and others in the town who have lost their jobs in recent months, and of those who fear greatly for the future of their jobs.</p>

Last week, I met the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), who has responsibility for manufacturing. Alongside me was Mr. Ken Pasternak, a gentleman from Denmark who, with some supporters, has invested a considerable portion of his wealth in Peter Scott and Co. in the town. Mr. Pasternak went along not just as a senior industrialist in his own right, but as the leader of the Scottish Cashmere Club, and he therefore spoke on behalf of the whole industry. I have met him and many others countless times, and with his colleagues he has been battering to get attention from the Scottish Government. So far, however, he has been very disappointed at the lack of practical measures offered by the powers that be in Edinburgh.</p>

credit insurance support arrangements, which have been put before the House and are now being implemented, because they are largely focused on the domestic trading of UK manufacturing. The cashmere sector is a huge export earner and needs support for its exports, but it has not been given any, so I hope that the Minister will re-think that policy.</p>

Many have growing order books but see their credit shrink before their eyes, and many do not get credit because they cannot get trade export insurance. We now own those banks, which are on the front line when it comes to lending decisions, so I urge the Minister and those in the Treasury to go into those banks, examine the decisions and understand why world-class businesses with good order books may be throttled because of the lack of available cash.</p>

Many in short-time working could be put into good, productive training if there were the support for it, so I hope that the Government will finally&#151;belatedly&#151;see sense.</p>

I hope that at last we will be able to reach a solution to the problem before too many jobs are lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09072168000085">My third issue is the east coast main line. As everybody will appreciate, following all the shenanigans that have gone on, the line is likely to be taken into public ownership later this year. That gives me cause for concern because National Express had promised to run a direct rail service between Grimsby and Cleethorpes and London King&#146;s Cross. We do not know now whether that will go ahead. It is important for there to be such improved transport links, to maintain the economy and encourage investment in the Grimsby and Cleethorpes area. During a Westminster Hall debate on the matter, a Minister confirmed that services from London King&#146;s Cross would be extended to Lincoln. But I want them to go the extra 50 miles or so to the coast, to Grimsby and Cleethorpes, so that our economy can benefit from those direct links.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09072168000086">I turn to the Humber bridge tolls. There was an inquiry into them in March this year. The bridge board wanted to put up the tolls, but local MPs are saying that we do not want that to happen and that the tolls are already far too high. The Minister has received the report from the inquiry. I want to say on behalf of all the business representatives, councils, other MPs and residents that we do not want the tolls to go up. We want Ministers to agree to have a year-long trial of reduced tolls, involving a token charge of about &#163;1 to cross the Humber bridge. That is the decision that we want from Ministers when we come back after the recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09072168000087">People would think that free school meals for all primary-aged children in North East Lincolnshire was a good-news story&#151;but, oh no, it is not. Our area was among those selected to bid to be a pilot project for free school meals for all primary-age children. However, the local authority said that it could not find enough match funding to put in a bid to go ahead with the policy. Yet that same local authority&#151;North East Lincolnshire council&#151;invested &#163;7 million of public money in Icelandic banks days before they collapsed. Every inquiry into the council&#146;s activities has criticised it, and there has been a vote of no confidence in its Liberal Democrat leader. Yet he continues to wend his merry way, saying that he is not resigning, that it had nothing to do with him anyway and that it was all the officers&#146; fault.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09072168000088">What strikes me as odd about the situation is that a Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition used to run the council. But the Conservatives are doing what I call &#147;a bit of a Dallas&#148;&#151;they have forgotten the past five years, when they were in coalition with the Lib Dems and all these things were going on, and they are saying, &#147;That&#146;s nothing to do with us either, guv.&#148; Frankly, they were all in the cabinet together and lost &#163;7 million of public money.

 I commence by paying tribute to our brave armed forces, who, while we sit in comfort, safety and security, are in the fields of Afghanistan defending our freedoms and ensuring that that nation does not return to being a failed state in which the Taliban can regroup and from which they could re-emerge on the streets of Europe, including this country. It is sad that today we have again lost one of our servicemen, from the joint service explosive ordnance disposal units. Our thoughts and prayers go to that man&#146;s family, and we salute his courage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09072168000092">When we send our forces into harm&#146;s way, it is incumbent on us all to think carefully about whether we should do so in a way that raises questions about the kit and equipment with which they are sent into battle. In the past few weeks, there has been a debate about helicopters; it may now have moved off the immediate front pages, but it is a fact that our armed forces need more helicopters. It is also a fact that our NATO allies are not providing the support that they could. I hope that more nations will look at their own helicopter support for allies on the ground, and for British troops in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09072168000093">However, the issue is about not only helicopters, but armoured vehicles. Although some of our armed forces prefer to use Snatch Land Rovers, weapons-mounted installation kit Land Rovers or other forms of lightly armoured vehicle, there is no doubt that there is a call for more heavily armoured, albeit mobile, vehicles as well. I hope that the Minister will give some assurance this evening that those issues are being taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09072168000094">Of course, there is also a need for more troops on the ground. If we win the space, we need to hold the space; if we do not hold the space, those who have lost their lives in winning the space might have died in vain. None of us would want that. The families of those who have died would certainly want the victories won on the ground to be sustained. They would want the space in which we have won victories to be enlarged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09072168000095">I also hope that the nations surrounding Afghanistan will do all they can to ensure that there is no increased threat to our personnel. For example, there have been reports that Chinese nationals have been found in Afghanistan. The Chinese Government need to ensure that the border with Afghanistan is secure and that any fundamentalist seeking to cross it is intercepted and dealt with appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09072168000096">Furthermore, this Government have the responsibility to ensure that any British nationals found to be shooting and targeting our armed forces personnel in Afghanistan are dealt with appropriately. If, for example, DNA profiles from improvised explosive devices or bomb fragments match known DNA profiles on the British database, it is only right that the Government should give an account of what action, if any, is taken to bring the relevant British subjects before the courts.</p>

He has dedicated most of his adult life to serving this country and Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. It is regrettable that some Ministers have been briefing against him; that does not assist our armed forces on the ground and it does nothing to help morale. The Prime Minister promised that such briefings from other people should be dealt with severely. I hope that if Ministers are caught briefing against any senior members of the military, they will be disciplined accordingly. Our armed forces on the ground want a Government and a senior military, yes, to engage in discussion, and yes, perhaps occasionally to disagree, but they certainly do not want Ministers briefing against the head of the Army while we are at war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09072168000098">Finally, I should like to touch on the defence training review&#151;the largest private finance initiative in British history. It was originally costed at &#163;12 billion; within the past 12 months, the cost has risen to &#163;13 billion. As I have said previously in the House, this is a privatisation too far. I am not against privatisation of some elements of support services for the military, but it needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis. It is clear that RAF St. Athan in Wales is not in a position to deliver the type of training that is currently delivered on other sites&#151;for example, at RAF Cosford in my constituency. It is no good the Government driving ahead with this project, the cost of which is increasing week by week, with &#163;100 million in direct and indirect subsidy even within the past nine months. Ministers need to look again at this project to ensure that they do not endanger Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces&#146; training for the future, particularly given that we are in a time of war.</p>

 May I associate myself with the tribute that the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) paid to our armed forces? Having spent a year with the armed forces parliamentary scheme, including a trip to Afghanistan, I was massively impressed by our young people in the armed forces here, and that was exceeded only by seeing them in action in Afghanistan, where the work that they are doing is in our national interest. All the lives that have sadly been lost there will have served to make the world a freer and a better place. I agree with the hon.

By the time we come back after the recess, the consultation will have been completed and decisions will have been taken, and plans that will shape my constituency, and those of my neighbours, for many years to come will practically be at the point of going off to the regional office. West Northamptonshire joint planning unit is drawing up proposals for many thousands of new houses and industrial units for Northampton, and it proposes to turn the town into a city. I have spoken to my neighbour, the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) about this, because  <br>

a number of the plans affect his constituency as much as, if not more than mine. We are both extremely concerned not only about the proposals but about how they are being dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09072168000102">I want to raise three concerns and ask three questions of my hon. Friend the Minister. First, the number of proposed units should be reviewed. The requirements need to be reviewed in the light of the recession and the fact that several sites already zoned for development have not been developed, while a large number of industrial and commercial sites in the town are empty. Secondly, infrastructure should be provided before new units are put in place, particularly schools, hospitals&#151;we very much need a new hospital&#151;and transport services. That subject was raised at a packed and lively meeting in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09072168000103">Thirdly, and most importantly, there should be proper consultation about the proposals. Usually, when a policy proposal is discussed, we are used to having three months&#146; consultation. Arguably, a major emerging plan will affect individual people much more than a general policy proposal, and yet there is to be only six weeks&#146; consultation. That would be bad enough, but the six-week period starts on 28 July. Most people would understand that residents&#146; associations, parish councils and all the other local groups that need to have meetings to consider these plans do not meet during August, and one cannot rely on their meeting in the first week of September. If the planning unit holds local meetings and asks people to go to them, many will be unable to do so because they are on holiday or tied up with children on school holidays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09072168000104">Although it is said that this an emerging plan that sets out only broad principles, many of the broad-brush proposals for where the developments should be sited are based on actual plans that property owners have put forward, and are therefore about more than broad principles. If the land allocations are agreed, fairly well-worked-up plans could come forward fairly quickly and people could see things change equally quickly. We are being told that the time limit for the consultation&#151;apparently six weeks is okay legally&#151;has been set on the basis that the plans have to get to the regional office by November. Unfortunately the planning unit, which has not been particularly competent in going about its work, has missed a number of deadlines and is now up against the buffers. It is completely wrong that people who will have to live with the consequences of this development should pay the price for the fact that the organisation producing the plans has not been able to get itself organised to produce them in time to have proper consultations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90721-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09072168000105">Will my hon. Friend the Minister relay to her colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government queries about revisiting some of the development proposals, numbers, and regional and local strategies in the light of the impact of the recession? Can we have some genuine assurances about the provision of infrastructure before any development takes place? Most importantly, will serious attention be given to the consultation so that local people have a chance to put their views, well before the decisions are taken, on developments that will affect them? The Liberal Democrats are driving the timetable on this, which is shocking. We should not  <br>

The last two are outside my current constituency, though in my prospective constituency. I have had the honour of representing the area for 20 years on the council and they are all areas that I know well. The homes are designated &#147;not decent&#148; by Hammersmith and Fulham council, which has, in the most disparaging terms, condemned not only the buildings and the areas but the residents.

Plans were held up because of the continued presence of Ken Livingstone as Mayor of London, but when Boris Johnson was elected last year, the council moved swiftly ahead, first by dropping all plans for new affordable housing, by accelerating small-scale demolitions, by designated sales and by handing back hundreds of affordable homes to developers, saying that they were unwanted.</p>

That has already been extensively reported in the <i> Evening Standard </i>and I am grateful to it for featuring the story as a double-page spread the week before last, to the <i> Daily Mirror</i>, which did an excellent editorial on the subject, and to <i> The Guardian </i>and other newspapers.</p>

For many tenants, the only option will be to move out of the borough&#151;Barking, Dagenham and Thamesmead have been mentioned as destinations for them. Many are elderly people, who have lived on the estates since the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s when they were built. The greatest irony is that those estates are already mixed communities. Half the flats on many estates are leasehold&#151;they contain many professional people and many people in employment on average wages or above.</p>

For 20 years of the redevelopment strategy, nobody will move on any other estate or RSL property in the borough. In the meantime, as the estates are developed&#151;it has happened elsewhere&#151;there will be complete neglect. Flats will be boarded up, there will be temporary housing and infestations, and only health and safety repairs will  <br>

We are not talking about just an attack or gerrymandering that goes far beyond anything that Shirley Porter tried in her time. We are talking about something that was designed by the leader of Hammersmith council, who is the head of the Tories&#146; local government innovation unit, as a blueprint for the rest of the country. How do we know that? We know it because he published a document earlier this year called &#147;Principles for Social Housing Reform&#148;. We also know it because, at the council&#146;s expense, he held a round-table discussion with Tory Front Benchers, other senior Tory politicians and, shamefully, local government officers on 3 March that agreed to the most extraordinary blueprint for the future. Market rents for all housing; no security of tenure; no right to buy; no duty to house the homeless; no capital investment at all in social housing&#151;is this really the future for housing under a Tory Government?</p>

More importantly in the long run, however, we are talking about the destruction of communities for political advantage and in the interests of warped social engineering of a kind I had hoped I would never see a mainstream party in this country support. It is now up to the Tory Front Benchers to dissociate themselves entirely from what is being done in Hammersmith and Fulham. If it really is a right-wing fringe taking such action, let them say so; but if they wish to endorse such appalling attacks on the lives and livelihoods of my constituents, let them say that also.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09072170000028">My concern is that the Government have not been as supportive as they should have to a children&#146;s hospice. I totally understand their argument that it would have been impossible for them to help all the charities and organisations that have lost money in Icelandic banks. I also understand that the Government have, quite rightly, been supporting compensation schemes for charities that have lost money. Bluntly, however, Naomi House has not been allowed to apply to those compensation schemes because it is regarded as having far too much money&#151;it has lost too much money and cannot make a claim under those schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09072170000029">The Government have also said that they would not bail out charities. In one debate, the Minister concerned said, &#147;Look, how do we decide which charities to support?&#148; For example, a lot of people say that the Government should support the Cats Protection league, given the money that it has lost. In my judgment, a children&#146;s hospice should be regarded as being in a different category from a cat lovers&#146; charity. The argument is compelling, and it is this. Charities that do the work of the Government should be seen in a different light. By many people&#146;s benchmark, hospices provide the kind of service that should be funded by Government money in the first place. In fact, Naomi House takes &#163;300,000 of Government money, so the Government recognise that they should be supporting it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09072170000030">I would ask the Minister to take the issue back to the Department of Health and to think carefully about the consequences of not supporting the hospice. Taking &#163;6 million out of that service will mean an enormous demand from sick children that will have to be met in the NHS, because Naomi House may not be able to fulfil its responsibilities. Surely it makes sense to support a children&#146;s hospice in some way. After all, it was not Naomi House&#146;s fault that it lost that money in the Icelandic bank concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09072170000031">The second issue that I want briefly to raise is the problem of so-called bogus universities. I understand that there have been grave concerns about the number of false universities being set up and the difficulties that they have caused with individuals coming to this country. However, one of the consequences of the Government&#146;s new scheme to crack down on bogus universities has been the number of student visas that can be issued under the new tier 4 proposals. I declare an interest: I lecture at Wroxton college, which has a number of American students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09072170000032">Students who come to this country are worth around &#163;6 billion a year to the economy. We do education well in this country, and many people want to come over to participate in it. However, the consequence of the new changes to try to crack down on the number of bogus university places has been to hit that industry to such an extent that applications from individuals who want to study in our universities and colleges are falling dramatically. Students are having their applications for places turned down because of the new regime. Indeed, I tabled a parliamentary question about that and discovered that of the applications from students received so far this year from India, 49 per cent. have been rejected. We are not seriously saying that almost half the applications from students from India are connected with terrorism, are we? The figure for American students is 21.3 per cent. Just over one fifth of American students who want to come to this country have had their visas refused under the new scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09072170000033">I understand the need to address bogus universities and tighten up the system. There have been problems, but those that we have created by putting in place the new scheme are having a very detrimental effect on an important industry in this country. The figures speak volumes. Under the new regime, we are in danger of turning away a lot of good students whom we would want to come here and study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09072170000034">The final issue that I wish to raise concerns the new guidelines on helping individuals with mild or moderate depression. Depression affects many people in this country, and it is welcome that we have at last recognised that we need to tackle it. However, to date, doctors have had little power to refer individuals to counselling, psychotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy, all of which are now recognised by the Government as useful tools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09072170000035">As we face the economic downturn, there is strong evidence that more people will suffer from mental health problems and depression as a result of what is taking place in the economy. The problem is that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines have made a judgment about which kind of support should be available for mental health problems. Again, I declare an interest, in that I am on the board of a mental health provider, Mental Health Matters. My concern is that the Government have narrowly said that the only form of support that should be available under the guidelines is cognitive behavioural therapy. Superb and excellent as such treatment is&#151;I declare an interest: I have seen a counsellor at times in my life and have received enormous support by undergoing that process&#151;the professionals argue that making CBT alone available is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09072170000036">Individual cases are very different, particularly those involving child abuse which need a much longer form of therapy. CBT teaches individuals how to deal with day-to-day pressure and how to cope with their depression, but it does not necessarily provide the kind of course and time needed to get to the underlying reasons. That needs to be done through professional psychotherapy, but at the moment the NICE guidelines do not allow that to be included. That is a great shame, so I would like to ask the Minister to report back to the Department of Health. If we are serious about tackling mental health issues, we need to allow the professionals the right form of support and not narrow it down to the one that is currently in the NICE guidelines.</p>

I strongly support that, and would like this country to get somewhere up to the European level. I would also like to see much wider access to universities, so that children whose parents did not have the opportunity to go to university, and who perhaps did not do so well in school themselves, have the chance to go into higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para29"><a name="09072170000039">My local university is London Metropolitan university, which has a good record on widening access to higher education, a wide variety of courses and high levels of student participation. However, it has got into enormous  <br>

funding problems because of a disagreement about the method of counting student numbers. As a consequence, the Higher Education Funding Council for England has ordered the university to repay &#163;39.5 million, which will obviously have a seriously devastating effect on its finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para30"><a name="09072170000040">In addition, the HEFCE has also told the university that its annual funding will to be cut, resulting in a loss of about 5,000 student places. As a result of all this, 550 jobs at the university are to go, through redundancy. The voluntary redundancy figures have not been met, so it is not clear what the university will do now. The situation is therefore grim. The university faces the possibility of the loss of more than 500 jobs, the closure of a number of courses and a reduction in student numbers in the long term. It cannot be the Government&#146;s intention that so many people should lose the opportunity of going to university or that so many experienced, effective teachers should lose their jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para31"><a name="09072170000041">I have raised this matter in an Adjournment debate, in parliamentary questions, in early-day motions and in correspondence with the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and with the relevant Ministers of State. They have all referred me back to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. How very convenient! Well, I am sorry, but that is just not acceptable. This House decides the annual Budget. It also holds Ministers to account, and we expect Ministers to intervene in a situation such as this to prevent jobs from being lost and to protect courses and student numbers. I would be grateful if the Deputy Leader of the House could assure me that she will quickly and firmly pass this matter on to the Secretary of State and ask him to look into the situation during the recess and intervene to protect those jobs, courses and student numbers. The future of higher education demands that that be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para32"><a name="09072170000042">There are two other items that I wish to raise. As the House knows, I represent Islington, North. That includes Finsbury Park station, which is one of the busiest underground stations outside central London. It is a transfer point between Network Rail, the Victoria line and the Piccadilly line. It is a very old and crowded station, and, crucially, it has no disability access whatever. After many years of argument and campaigning, moneys were found by the previous Mayor, Ken Livingstone, for the complete refurbishment of the station, including step-free access throughout. That was welcomed, and we looked forward to the rebuilding of the station so that we could, at last, get ourselves into the 21st century and people who use wheelchairs, people with pushchairs and those who have difficulty in walking could actually get on and off the trains, rather than having to descend a lengthy spiral staircase from the mainline platforms to the underground, which was obviously unsatisfactory and dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90721-0015.htm_para33"><a name="09072170000043">Then the new Mayor came along, re-examined all the funding priorities of the previous Mayor and decided that the step-free access at the station would be postponed&#151;until, I think, 2016. Network Rail, which is responsible for the mainline platforms and the mainline services running above the underground station, has decided that it will go ahead with its bit of step-free access, however. So we now have the ludicrous position in which a lift is being installed to connect the mainline platforms to the street, but not to the underground station underneath it, because that is someone else&#146;s responsibility. That is absurd beyond belief.</p>

It is unfortunate that the Government&#146;s stated aim of having step-free access to public transport so that it can be really and truly accessible for everybody is being frustrated by this ridiculous funding row. Again, I would be grateful if the Deputy Leader of the House could assure me that she will convey to the Secretary of State for Transport my extreme displeasure, as well as that of my constituents and&#151;more importantly&#151;that of the tens of thousands of people who use Finsbury Park station every day. They want an accessible, usable, efficient station; they do not want a lift that goes halfway. That is simply ridiculous. It is up to the political structures to ensure the right outcome.</p>

I am pleased that my Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) is present today, because we both have the great privilege and honour of representing two of the constituencies through which the famous Barking to Gospel Oak railway line runs. The line was earmarked for closure during the dark days of Mrs. Thatcher. Since then it has been reprieved, but some of us are determined that it should be electrified, so that freight transport running between the east and west coasts could use it, and so that it and the rest of the North London line could operate as one system using the same trains, all powered by electricity. If we electrify the Barking to Gospel Oak line, improve public transport and cut pollution, London will be an even better place than it already is.</p>

problem was first highlighted in March 2005, when the Water Fluoridation (Consultation) (England) Regulations 2005 were being debated in the upper House. Earl Howe, the shadow Health Minister, drew the House&#146;s attention to regulation 5, which was passed into law. It states:</p>
<a name="90721-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="09072170000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A Strategic Health Authority shall not proceed with any step regarding fluoridation arrangements that falls within section 89(2) of the Act unless, having regard to the extent of support for the proposal and the cogency of the arguments advanced, the Authority are satisfied that the health arguments in favour of proceeding with the proposal outweigh all arguments against proceeding.&#148;</p>

 It is an honour to follow the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), and the whole House will of course send its condolences to the Hickman family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09072170000057">I want to raise two issues of concern within my constituency that are linked to large-scale planning developments. One is, of course, Heathrow expansion&#151;the threat of the third runway and the sixth terminal, which, as Members will know, threaten the demolition of Sipson village, with 2,000 residents losing their homes, their school, their community centre and the entire village. The third runway also threatens Harmondsworth, Harlington, Cranford Cross and Longford villages, so people living there, too, will lose their homes, either through demolition or because they will have been rendered uninhabitable by air pollution and noise pollution. Those homes are already blighted. The families are unable to sell their properties if they wish to move, and mortgage companies will not lend to any purchasers. As a result, my constituency includes families with children who are trapped&#151;in some instances, in one-bedroom or studio properties&#151;and older people who are unable to sell their properties if they want to retire and live nearer to their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09072170000058">BAA introduced a bond scheme, which effectively means that BAA promises to buy the properties affected by Heathrow expansion, but the problems with the bond scheme are the cause of real anxiety. The scheme does not cover all the properties affected by the expansion, and the payment levels, based on valuations of the properties, do not reflect their true value. When people lose their home, there is no compensation within the scheme for the costs of moving or losing their whole community. The bond scheme, furthermore, does not commence until the planning application for Heathrow expansion is actually submitted. That could be years, given the current economic climate and the chaos within BAA and its owner, Grupo Ferrovial. As a result, people are trapped in blight, often in overcrowded and inappropriate accommodation, and unable to plan their lives while this uncertainty hangs over their heads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09072170000059">BAA promised to bring forward the implementation of the bond scheme within weeks&#151;but that was six months ago. I met its representatives, who argued that the problem lay with the individual airline companies, which had to guarantee the liabilities of the bond scheme. A number of them have refused to sign up, and BAA says it cannot secure their agreement. I asked those representatives whether they wanted the Government to intervene, and they said no. We cannot go on like this. It is damaging the lives of my constituents, so I urge the Government to set a deadline of no more than, say, two months, and if BAA does not adhere to its commitments and promises to my constituents to bring forward the start of the bond scheme, the Government must intervene to force them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09072170000060">The real solution is, of course, to scrap the third runway proposal once and for all. I do not believe that I know anyone&#151;other than the Prime Minister and the  <br>

chief executive of BAA&#151;who believes that the third runway proposal will go ahead. It is dead in the water, but what my constituents want are absolute commitments not only that the proposal is dead, but that it will never be revisited. My constituents want some safety and security for their homes, and they want the end of the threat to their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09072170000061">The second largest development in my area is the Southall gasworks site, which involves the largest planning application for housing development in west London&#151;on the site of a large gasworks. There will be 4,000 new properties, shops and a school. It is located in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Sharma), but it abuts my own constituency. The major road accessing the site will run through my constituency from the Hayes bypass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09072170000062">The development poses the threat of immense growth in traffic and associated air pollution in an area already designated as an air pollution management reserve. I have become increasingly aware of the potential dangers to my constituents from pollutants on this highly contaminated site. The developer&#146;s own report now confirms that the contamination includes oil and tar waste, which forms carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, cyanide and asbestos. The developers intend to excavate and treat those dangerous materials on site, but I am meeting members of the community who are extremely concerned about the risk that those materials will pollute the nearby Yeading brook and enter local water supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09072170000063">I am also extremely anxious about any attempts to transport those highly toxic materials through my constituency. The local Hillingdon council, I have to say, has done virtually nothing to explain the risks from the site development to the local community. The only public meetings on this planning application have been convened either by myself or by Friends of Minet country park, of which I am vice-chair. Not a single meeting open to the general public has been convened by the council to explain the potential risks of the development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09072170000064">I want to raise my concerns in the House, to draw attention to the risks and to urge the Government to maintain a close watch on that large-scale development and its environmental impact. I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to take the matter back to the relevant Ministers. We in the community are launching a campaign to ensure that my constituents are fully aware of the risks and are fully protected. We will submit our views to Hillingdon and Ealing councils to ensure that the proper inspections take place. Yes, we will urge those local authorities to ensure that conditions are attached to the application that protect my constituents from the increase in traffic and, more importantly, from the threat of pollutants from this contaminated site. If the application is to go ahead, I believe that every condition that could be applied should be applied, to protect the local community and the local environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09072170000065">This site is also close to Guru Nanak school, one of the most successful schools in the country, where the Government have invested large sums in the expansion of both the primary and secondary school. I want to ensure that that school and its pupils are fully protected and fully safe. I also want to ensure that Minet country park is protected from the damage that could be incurred as a result of the development. On that basis, I give notice to Hillingdon council and others that my community  <br>

 I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise what is an important and urgent issue in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09072170000067">The House has often debated, and dealt with questions about, Zimbabwe and the difficulties experienced in that country. Some 12 years ago my local church, Saltash Wesley Methodist church, established a twinning arrangement with a church in Mbare, a suburb of Harare. During the first few years of that arrangement, we enjoyed four annual reciprocal visits. One involved young people from Cornwall going to Zimbabwe to help build water tanks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09072170000068">That was a long time ago, and over the intervening nine years there have been no opportunities for the visits to continue. However, despite the great difficulty that arose, connections have continued through e-mail and letters between families, and support has been given to the people who are living in such desperate circumstances. In more recent times a number of members of the church have supplied funds for the education of Zimbabwean children, and nearly 100 have benefited. A great deal of moral support has also been provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09072170000069">Earlier this year, when there were signs that Zimbabwe might have a real opportunity to emerge from its darker times, the churches decided to try to re-establish the original relationship&#151;or friendship&#151;through reciprocal visits. It was decided that it might be possible to bring a number of leaders from the church in Mbare to Cornwall this year. That involved great difficulties relating not only to the funds that would have to be arranged, but to choosing the people and ensuring that the visit would be successful. It involved planning for the future, and re-establishing relationships that had been somewhat curtailed over the intervening period. However, as a result of all the planning over six or seven months, the money was raised, it wad decided who would come, and everyone was looking forward to a visit between 24 September and 7 October this year. The air tickets had to be purchased before the application for visas, but they were subsequently bought. The visas for the eight people who were to come here were applied for in Pretoria, which is now in charge of visa applications for Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09072170000070">It was a cause of huge disappointment and great regret that only a couple of weeks ago, with only a few weeks left before the visit, all the entry clearance visa applications were refused. We are talking about people who have provided leadership in Zimbabwe: ministers of the church, youth leaders and people who had worked on environmental projects. We are talking about people who had given dedicated service over a long period. They had met all the necessary requirements, and they were, of course, hoping to come to this country to re-establish a relationship that went back more than 12 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09072170000071">It seems to me that the entry clearance officer examined all the available information and decided that perhaps these people of honesty and integrity, who had clearly  <br>

served their communities in an excellent way, were not the sort of people who would come to this country and then willingly leave. He, or she, believed that those people intended to come here, stay here and not return to their home country. That was despite the fact that they would be leaving families and friends, and despite clear evidence from people in this country, including me and, indeed the superintendent minister of the church. We had given details of the programme in which they would be involved and the issues that they would discuss with us. We had also given an absolute assurance that they would not reside here or impose a burden, but would come to re-establish friendships and then return to the country with which we have maintained a twinning arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09072170000072">I plead with the Deputy Leader of the House to consult the Minister for Borders and Immigration. They must recognise that these issues will continue. If we are to support people in Zimbabwe, we must recognise the opportunities to re-establish relationships and friendships between organisations, churches, families and people. This is a great opportunity to bring eight very good people back into this country so that a relationship between two churches that has lasted for more than 12 years can be re-established, and so that&#151;hopefully&#151;a group of people from my church in Saltash will be able to visit them in Zimbabwe next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09072170000073">The twinning arrangement has been mutually beneficial. It is not a one-way exercise: great benefit has been gained from an arrangement that has been undergone through such difficult circumstances. However, after those people had done all that they could, after all their funding had been arranged, their tickets purchased and their accommodation fixed, they were told &#147;You cannot come here, because we think that you are coming purely in order to stay here.&#148; That is an insult to them, and it is a disaster in terms of this country&#146;s relationship with Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09072170000074">I very much hope that the Government will intervene. I hope that they will recognise that visits and relationships of this kind are worthy of support, and that those people will be able to come to Cornwall, enjoy their stay, and return to their country reinvigorated.</p>

 I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate. I wish to raise three substantive issues, but I shall begin by displaying the same level of indignation as my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90721-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09072170000076">I was promised a Jobcentre Plus facility in Dursley, in the south of my constituency, some six months ago. The jobcentre there had closed a couple of years ago. I had no angle on that, because there were reasons for the closure, but there was a need to open another centre, and the fact that that failed to happen is an indication of the Government&#146;s failure to address rural issues. I hope that my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House will convey my indignation to the Department for Work and Pensions, because there is an urgent need for the Department to act.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/debtext/90721-0017.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09072170000077">The first substantive issue that I shall raise relates to something very sad that happened last week. A certain Mr. Nick Griffin arrived in my constituency. That may or may not be something that Mr. Nick Griffin does regularly, but I should like to think that Members of the  <br>

European Parliament must give the same notice as Members of Parliament when they intend to visit constituents. I do not know why Mr. Griffin was wined and dined in Painswick, in my constituency, but he was. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09072170000078">It just so happens that one of my constituents took offence, and happened to spill some beer over Mr. Griffin. I know the young man concerned, and he is totally upstanding. Indeed, he is an outstanding individual, the sort of person with whom I am proud to be associated. As a result of that incident, he was taken outside and given one hell of a hiding. I am not prepared to accept that any politician should have a private army. I am not prepared to have the BNP anywhere near my constituency. In previous times we would have chased these individuals around but I hope that we will take action and look at the actions of the BNP. I do not know whether a court case is proceeding because the young man is too shocked, but it is indicative of what the BNP is like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09072170000079">My second issue is one that I raised in a previous debate before Easter and concerns school staff. I can now use their names; Roger Lock, the former head of Marling school in my constituency, and Mick Madden who was the head of care at Cam house, also in my constituency. I use the past tense because they have now been summarily dismissed and have lost their appeals. Roger served for 30 years at the school, as well as being the head for a period. Mick served for 27 years at Cam house. Both have lost their jobs. There is an employment tribunal pending in both cases so I shall be circumspect in what I say, but their cases are mentioned in the excellent report from the Children, Schools and Families Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09072170000080">A real issue arises in terms of how staff are removed. Most of the Select Committee report refers to pupil allegations; the cases in question did not involve pupil allegations, but did involve unfair practices. In the case of the second school&#146;s head, it is very unfair that allegations of bullying and harassment came suddenly to the surface after a new chairman of the governing body arrived. He became the presenting&#151;or dare I say the prosecuting&#151;officer. He chose the hearing committee. He chose the appeal committee, which involved a parent&#151;the school&#146;s internal arrangements make it clear that a parent is not the preferred person to be on such a body&#151;and two external representatives, which again was most peculiar. That case is deserving of proper investigation. A support group, the Friends of Marling School, is fighting on behalf of that head teacher. I wish the group well and will continue to raise the issue because wrong things have been done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09072170000081">Mick Madden, too, has lost his job. He was seen a something of a sacrificial lamb, given that the deputy head of that school resigned and the head teacher, after 18 months of being suspended, was then reinstated. It just so happens that in the last couple of weeks the head teacher has been dismissed. The three senior members of the school&#146;s staff have now lost their jobs. Mick is by the far the most innocent of those individuals and is fighting his corner. He subsequently got another job but, to put it mildly, powers were brought against him and that job was also taken away. There has been a degree of vindictiveness, which is more than unfair and is deserving of proper investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09072170000082">I finish by mentioning three Bills, two of which I have presented to the House and one of which, the Permissible Donors Bill, has been somewhat overtaken by events, I  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 July 2009">

<notus-date day="21" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>21 July 2009 : Column 832</b><br>
am pleased to say. I am glad that the Government have now come to their senses in terms of the Political Parties and Elections Bill and have seen that there is a need to restrict donor activity from outside. The first of my other two Bills was the Parliament (Disclosure of Information) Bill, which I hope in due course we will get a chance to talk about properly. The Bill demands financial disclosure, as in the United States where all representatives have to disclose three years&#146; of tax returns in advance of taking office. That is a perfectly reasonable thing to do and I hope that arrangement can come in here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09072170000083">Finally, the Media Owners (Residency Requirement) Bill would restrict ownership of media outlets to British individuals and British firms who pay full tax in this country. I could go on at length about what I have learned from others about those who have attacked us in this House. It would only be just and proper to look at the tax that they pay. Horrifyingly, many of those media outlets pay no tax at all. They are the key to tax avoidance and I hope that, in due course, we will get a chance to investigate those individuals, who they are and what they do.</p>

 I was very disturbed to hear the story about the constituent of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) who spilled some beer over Nick Griffin. I am vice-chairman of the all-party beer group. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) is the chairman of the Save the Pub group. All I can say is, &#147;What a dreadful waste of beer.&#148; I take on board the serious point made by the hon. Gentleman. If people were beaten up every time beer was spilled, there would be hardly any room in the accident and emergency department of any hospital in this country. I hope that the person concerned is able to pursue the matter.</p>

What happened to Mrs. Siddall there, and the repercussions since on Mr. Siddall, are of relevance to each and every Member of Parliament, particularly as we are now in the summer season and people are looking forward to their package holidays and generally to going abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09072170000086">Mr. and Mrs. Siddall were an ageing couple, and we should bear in mind that we now have an ageing population in this country. They went to Menorca to enjoy a holiday. Sadly, Mrs. Siddall was taken ill. Mr. Siddall did not know what to do about that in Menorca, so he contacted the hotel front desk and the hotel doctor was called. He had a look at Mrs. Siddall and decided she should be admitted to hospital. Instead of admitting her to the appropriate hospital, however, she was taken past the state hospital to a private hospital. Mr. Siddall was concerned about his wife and does not speak Spanish, and he did not know exactly what was happening in terms of the diagnosis of Mrs. Siddall during this period. Later, it became obvious to him that Mrs. Siddall was not getting any better in this private hospital. She was then finally moved to the state hospital, which had the right people with the right equipment. Sadly however, it was all too late and three days later she died.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09072170000087">On further investigation, we found that this problem affects a growing number of people in this country who holiday abroad. The last thing people think about doing when they are planning to go abroad is check out the local hospitals and the facilities available. They are going abroad to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09072170000088">There are suspicions about what has happened in this case. I have spoken to a number of people about it and I have visited the British medical emergency service forum, which deals with such situations on a daily basis, and I have learned that there is often a web of money involved in the choice of hospitals in certain countries. Spain is mentioned time and again, but so are Bulgaria, Greece and a few other countries. In terms of this web of money, I am not making accusations against the tour operator, but there are suspicions about some individuals. There might be suspicions that there is money in it for the doctor to send the patient to the private hospital. There might also be money in it for the receptionist and for a taxi driver. Many different people might be on the take to ensure that the person is put into the private hospital where the money is paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09072170000089">Last year in Spain, consular staff were involved in dealing with the deaths of 1,500 people. To put that in context, the figure for Germany was 75, in France it was 170, and in the United States of America it was just 121. Therefore, 1,500 is a huge number. We know that a lot of British people visit Spain and others live there, and people might go and stay with those ex-pats as well. I have talked to some emergency service experts, and they believe that in many cases people should be going to the state hospital, irrespective of the fact that they might have fantastic private health care cover. They are not going to know that the private hospital might not have the right facilities. They are not going to know that the medical staff in the private hospital might not be trained to the same level as those in the state hospital. They might also think that the private hospitals are jolly good, and they might have always dreamed of going to such a hospital and believe that that is the right place to go; but the fact is that it is not. The emergency service forum has speculated that perhaps as many as 400 people a year die because they get sent to the wrong place where they are misdiagnosed or are just dealt with inappropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09072170000090">We need action; I know that the emergency service forum wants action. It wants the tour operators to speak to the Government and the insurance companies to ensure that when people go abroad and something goes wrong, the tour operators follow a set procedure in order that people get to the right hospital. I am sure that the local tour operator will know the best restaurants, tourist activities and car rental companies. They should also know the right hospital to go to, so that if someone who is booked on a holiday with the company falls ill, they get taken to the right hospital. They must not get shipped off to a place where people are coining it at the expense of others. People must not become victims, becoming too ill and then sadly dying as a result of not being dealt with properly. Mr. Siddall has to carry this with him for the rest of his life, and he is doing so. We clearly want justice for him, but what he wants is to ensure that a procedure is put in place so that this never again happens to anybody going abroad on holiday. I  <br>

hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will refer to this in her winding-up speech and will ensure that the message gets out to the Foreign Office, the Department of Health and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that there is clearly a serious problem that needs to be addressed and that, at this holiday time, action is urgently needed and should be happening now.</p>

 I am pleased to take part in this debate. I wish to start by picking up on something said by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner). He wished us all well on our holidays, but I should make the point on behalf of all hon. Members that the recess is not a holiday and we shoot ourselves in the foot if ever we give the impression that it is. I will be working for a great proportion of that time, as I am sure most right hon. and hon. Members will be. I find that I am busier in September with constituency visits to schools, hospitals, homes and so on than I am when I am in this place. We must debunk the damaging myth that the recess is a holiday, because enough damage has been done already.</p>

 Would the hon. Gentleman like to say what he thinks about the 38 Degrees campaign? To my mind, it is the most simplistic campaign; the survey that I have been asked to fill in is highly dubious, because it assumes that I am on holiday. It is quite a wrong campaign, and I hope that he will be able to say a little on that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="09072170000093"><a name="90721-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="09072170000147"><b>Greg Mulholland:</b>
 I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. All hon. Members have a responsibility to be prepared to share broadly what they are doing. I will be spending some time in my constituency and some time here, and of course I will rightly be spending some time on holiday. It is important to get that balance across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09072170000094">I wish to raise, yet again, the problems of public transport in Leeds. People in the Yorkshire and the Humber region are sick of being bottom of the Government transport spending league table, and we are simply not prepared to be at the bottom of it year on year. We have just received another couple of blows, the first of which was the decision by First to scrap a number of bus routes in the Leeds area. Again, the decision was taken entirely in that company&#146;s own commercial interest and with little regard for the people who want to use those services. Metro, the passenger transport authority, has estimated that the decision will lead to approximately 14 per cent. of those people not bothering to use the bus network at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09072170000095">Even worse than that decision is the as yet unconfirmed report&#151;it is a disgrace that there has been no confirmation&#151;that the Department for Transport is going to reduce from 182 to 106 the number of additional carriages for the Northern Rail franchise. The figure of 106 is a little more than half the original commitment set out clearly in the rail White Paper, which was published in just 2007. The simple reality is that since the late 1990s the number of peak rail passengers in West Yorkshire has almost doubled, and is continuing to grow, yet Northern Rail has had no new carriages in the past five years&#151;during that period, commuter services in London and the south-east have had 580. That  <br>

discrepancy is simply not acceptable. We have not even been given confirmation of this reduction in the number of carriages&#151;it has simply been reported. Department for Transport Ministers have not come to this place to give us that announcement. I wrote to the Secretary of State today demanding that we find out as soon as possible whether this decision has been taken. I shall be critical of the Department if it makes a negative announcement during the recess, because that is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09072170000096">I am also keen to lead on the campaign for high-speed rail to Yorkshire and the Humber. Many of us who represent Yorkshire constituencies are very pleased to support the excellent fast track to Yorkshire campaign, which is running in the <i> Yorkshire Post</i>. A number of us from a cross-party group of MPs have this week written to councils up and down the Yorkshire and the Humber region asking them to support that excellent initiative. If we are serious about getting through this recession and kick-starting the economy again, we need foresighted investment; many regions in this country have been held back in that regard. It would be a welcome addition to the rather facile debate about cuts, if we were to talk about the real, long-term investment that this country so patently needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09072170000097">I also wish to touch on the issue of the Leeds arena and the &#147;Leeds needs an arena&#148; campaign running in the <i> Yorkshire Evening Post</i>. I am delighted that Yorkshire Forward has come forward with &#163;18 million of funding for this excellent initiative. As all who visit Leeds know, it is a cultural hub. We are proud of that and the city needs a first-class concert arena. It is frustrating that the Government have to rubberstamp this money, and it is disappointing that some Sheffield MPs are seeking to interfere in what we are doing in Leeds. I ask them to keep their noses out. The Government should allow these decisions to be taken in Leeds by Leeds city council and Yorkshire Forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09072170000098">I have also to bring to the attention of the House once again the appalling case of Dr. John Hubley, my constituent who died following complications at the Eccleshill independent sector treatment centre in Bradford. The first question is why Dr. Hubley was sent there when he wanted to have his procedure at the excellent Wharfedale hospital in my constituency. It was, of course, because Leeds PCT has a contract with the independent sector treatment centre that it has to fulfil. Dr. Hubley&#146;s death was described as unnecessary and the verdict was death by misadventure. The coroner said that the safety procedures at the facility were a &#147;recipe for disaster&#148; and &#147;Mickey Mouse&#148;. That is appalling, but the situation was made worse when Leeds NHS decided to put the matter in the hands of its solicitors, who gave Dr. Hubley&#146;s fianc&#233;e&#151;also my constituent&#151;10 days to respond to what was essentially a threat. She was told that she had to accept a frankly derisory offer of compensation to her and Dr. Hubley&#146;s two children and if the family did not accept, they would become liable for legal costs running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. This behaviour by Leeds NHS is despicable, considering what the family has already gone through. It was bullying and blackmail, and to do that to a family who had already suffered the loss of a loved one is scandalous and flies in the face of everything that the NHS is supposed to stand for. It is cowardly to have put the matter in the hands of solicitors, and Leeds NHS&#146;s apology rings hollow.</p>

The offer is on the table and has to be accepted or the family will lose all their money. Frankly, whoever made the decision to act in this way at Leeds NHS should resign, but it is difficult to discover the identity of that person, although I have requested it under the freedom of information legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09072170000100">The case shows the problem with independent sector treatment centres. The National Patient Safety Agency has warned that no surgery should be commissioned or delivered in facilities that lack systems or equipment to deal with emergencies, but the simple fact is that we do not know whether that is the case in independent sector treatment centres. Nor do we know exactly how many operations are being performed under the &#163;2.7 billion contract, because the Government will not tell us for reasons of commercial confidentiality. I have asked several times for a proper debate on this issue, because at the moment the Government are allowing the PCTs to play fast and loose with the NHS&#146;s guiding principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09072170000101">On a lighter note, I wish to thank all my colleagues in the &#147;Save the Pub&#148; parliamentary group.

 I wish to take part in this debate to raise several issues that have come out of my constituency mailbag and surgeries. The first of those issues came to my attention at my surgery last Saturday at Worcester Park library, when a couple of my constituents came to tell me about their niece who, at the age of 22, had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. She was given the necessary treatment: she had operations, and she also received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Before the treatments proceeded, she was offered the opportunity of a cycle of ovary stimulation and egg harvesting, which meant that her fertilised eggs could be safeguarded by being frozen and stored so that they could be used in the future. The treatment made her infertile but the storage of those harvested embryos meant that she had the chance to have children. Thanks to a surrogacy arrangement, she now has a child. So far, so good&#151;but, as was noted earlier in the debate, the law of unintended consequences sometimes operates when we in this place legislate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90721-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09072170000103">Back in 1990, this House passed an Act of Parliament dealing with the regulation and control of embryos that provided that embryos could be stored for up to five years. Just last year, in 2008, another Act was passed to change the framework and extend the storage period to up to 10 years. It also provided that new regulations could be made to allow for further extensions thereafter. The problem is that the five-year period under the old Act expires for my constituents&#146; niece before the new Act comes into force. Her embryos are therefore in limbo, between one Act of Parliament and another. As a result, even though the embryos were stored well within the 10-year period specified by the new legislation, they will have to be destroyed in September of this year. With them will go the hopes of there being any further children for that family.</p>

It has not been debated yet, although there has been a formal request that it should be. It is really important that people who find themselves in the limbo between the old Act and the new one should not be confronted with having their embryos destroyed before this House has had the opportunity to debate the matter. We need to persuade Ministers to change their minds and accept that, in this case, it is inappropriate for them to cite the wrongness of retrospection. This retrospection is about life and the opportunity for someone to have children.</p>

She told me that the long-awaited funding to pay for renovating and updating Sutton&#146;s council housing to the Decent Homes standard is to be delayed for several years. The Government aspire to raise homes to that standard, as I am sure do all hon. Members, but the decision means that the 800 box bathrooms installed in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) 40 years ago will not be replaced for years to come, even though they were fit for only 15 years in the first place. The problem is that those box bathrooms are coming away from the properties to which they were attached. They have asbestos in them, and they are a nightmare that needs to be brought to an end.</p>

There are outbreaks of disease&#151;chicken pox, hepatitis A and many others. That is not peace; it is war by another means. It is terror inflicted upon an innocent group of people who deserve better. It is time the Government did even more to ensure that as the gaze of the world has moved away from Sri Lanka since the firing ended, we focus very clearly on the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that they deliver a just peace and human rights for the country&#146;s Tamil population.</p>

He delivered a passionate and welcome speech on Afghanistan. I was privileged to visit Afghanistan last November and to meet some of our brave men and women, many of them very young. It is a matter of concern that they are not getting the full backing and resources they deserve when they are fighting for the interests of Afghanistan and the broader freedom of the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90721-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09072215000022">It is a disgrace that although we have some 500 helicopters, there are only 30 in Helmand province. Moreover, it is regrettable that the Prime Minister does not have the courage to admit his contribution to the lack of helicopters through his failure to allow the proper budget for them when he was Chancellor. May I say how disingenuous it is that he speaks of a 60 per cent. increase in the number of helicopters in the past two years? When he talks about the increase in troops, he mentions specific numbers, yet on the subject of helicopters he has to resort to playing with words and speaking of 60 per cent. By doing so, he demeans himself and the office that he holds.</p>

When he spoke of breast cancer in men, it reminded me of the occasion I tried to introduce a private Member&#146;s Bill to increase the breast cancer screening period for women. The Bill was talked out by the Government but, as is frequently the case, they were happy to take on board a good policy and rehash it as if it were their own. In his first conference speech to the Labour party, the Prime Minister said he thought it was a good idea to increase the screening period for breast cancer for women. I was pleased that he took on board my suggestion. Again, it is typical of the Prime Minister and the Government that they fail to give credit to the Opposition when they take our policies. Nevertheless, I am pleased that people will benefit from it.</p>

on Equitable Life. Earlier today, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that such a debate was a matter for the business managers. I asked her specifically whether she could give us an undertaking tonight that the Government would bring forward a substantive motion when we return in the autumn. In that way, we can test the will of the House in relation to the Government&#146;s policies on Equitable Life. Will she agree to do that?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot agree to do that at this moment. However, I reiterate the point that there will be a report from Sir John in August. After it comes out, we will see what the situation is and what is the appropriate thing to do.

 The hon. Lady skirts around an issue that raised its head in the past week. Some prominent authors have already said that they will not visit schools. Many Members of Parliament have work experience students, who are under the age of majority, working with them.

 I apologise to my hon. Friend for confusing her, and for being slightly late for her speech. I blame the dodgy telly in the Adjournment restaurant, rather than not wanting to hear the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman. However, I understand that the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) did not mention several of the contributions to the debate.

respect of people who have had life-saving medical treatment but, as a result, become infertile. However, they have made provision to store embryos prior to the treatment so that they are able to have biological children of their own. It cannot be right to force those in such circumstances&#151;those who have embryos stored under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990&#151;to destroy those embryos because there is a gap between that Act and the 2008 Act. A statutory instrument before the House at the moment will, I hope, be debated in October.

 I am delighted to have this debate, the last act of the Session. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Speaker, and wish you and your family a happy recess. I also welcome the Minister, the Whip and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09072215000183">This is an important debate and one that has reverberated for some months since the settlement issue was resolved. I have taken an active part in the matter, as the Minister will know. I have asked a number of parliamentary questions and I feature in the accompanying paper from the Library, which is a good backcloth to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09072215000184">Surprisingly, in some respects, I supported the Government over the settlement issue. I did so because I felt that the motion moved by the Liberal Democrats was opportunistic and did not take account of the full consequences of settlement, principally Gurkha pensions. I did not go gooey-eyed at the thought of having my photo taken with Joanna Lumley, but I took some stick in my local press from people who thought I was unwilling to take the side of the Gurkhas. I am trying to reverse that now by taking forward the argument on Gurkha pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09072215000185">This is an issue that leads to considerable emotion as I found when I met the Gurkha Welfare Society. I thought it was a useful meeting. I also went to see the Nepalese charg&#233; d&#146;affaires in London. There is another reason why I voted as I did. It involves a Member whom I shall not name as he is a good friend of mine who sits on the Opposition Benches. He is a former Gurkha officer and some years ago he expressed the concern to me that if we got this wrong by arbitrarily changing the conditions of service and Gurkha pensions, we could end up doing the very thing we did not want to do: undermine, and possibly destroy, the Gurkha relationship with the British armed forces, rather than sustain it. It was therefore important to find out whether that was likely, and what the repercussions were of the settlement vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09072215000186">Things have moved on and some sores have healed, but there is an ongoing worry and growing anger. It is felt that the pay and conditions, and principally the pensions, have to be resolved as a matter of urgency. That was the sentiment of the Nepalese Government representatives and the Gurkha Welfare Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09072215000187">I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister has, in a sense, got his retaliation in first as a letter has been sent to the Members who signed early-day motion 1726, which basically sets out the Government&#146;s position&#151;I am not going to pursue that argument now because I am sure the Minister will use his own opportunity to respond to my points. The Government position, if I have got this right, is that the arrangement whereby, pre-1997, the Gurkha pension scheme is the extant method by which people are paid, and post-1997, people move on to the regular armed forces pension scheme, should not be subject to retrospection. The Government feel that legal judgments support their view. They also feel that the pre-1997 rewards to those 36,000 Gurkha pensioners are sufficient because many of them are  <br>

living in Nepal, and that the process of moving from the old to the new scheme has been relatively painless. They believe that it is only right and proper that the differential is upheld.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09072215000188">I met the Gurkha Welfare Society, and Major Tikendradal Dewan in particular said to me that although they do not want any particular special favours, they want justice, and they feel that the pensions are not right. They refer back to the tripartite agreement between Britain, India and Nepal and the fact that Gurkhas who retired before 1997 are considerably worse off. The crux of the questions I have put to the Government are about the &#163;1.5 billion cost of not only the pensions but of the settlement, and its repercussions for pensions. That figure has been questioned. It is not a cheap option, and now we have gone along the settlement route, we must get the pensions right. I welcome this opportunity to debate the issue. The Gurkha Welfare Society asked me to put in some questions, which I have done, and to seek an Adjournment debate, which I have also now achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09072215000189">The notion is that there is still unfairness because of the 1997 break. Those Gurkhas who received a pension before 1997 receive a much lower pension than those awarded one post 1997, and they feel that that has got to be put right. At present, these 36,000 Gurkhas receive a monthly pension supplement of as little as a sixth, or even as low as an eighth, of that of a UK soldier whom they serve alongside. A Gurkha pension received today by those who retired prior 1997 is about &#163;172 per month for a rank below corporal, and &#163;351 for a lieutenant, which is way below the figures for someone on the armed forces pension scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09072215000190">I know that the argument that the Government advance is that, in the main, Gurkhas have served for less time and have retired earlier, even though these are very brave people who have served this country immeasurably in so many different ways. However, this sore has to be recognised and remedied. Gurkhas feel that it is a form of discrimination and make the point that one of the reasons why they retired earlier and served less time was because that was the expectation. The 15-year limitation was not of their making; it was what the scheme demanded. Many Gurkhas would have liked to have served for longer, but the scheme did not allow them to do so. In addition, many served much shorter times than that and so are particularly disadvantaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09072215000191">Contrary to what the Minister has said&#151;I know that he has been to Nepal and I am sure that he will talk about that&#151;former Gurkhas who have retired to Nepal do not have a life of luxury and many face deprivations. As they say&#151;this point has been made clearly to me&#151;one strong reason why so many have to seek alternative employment and take on dangerous jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan is that they do not see themselves having a well paid future in Nepal. They have, thus, sought to use their military expertise in some of the most dangerous parts of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para19"><a name="09072215000192">My final point on this element of my submission is that a penalty is implicitly involved for those who have converted from the Gurkha pension scheme to the armed forces pension scheme: a transfer rate of three to one; for every 15 years on the GPS someone gets only five years on the AFPS. That penalty is discriminatory and is where much of the hurt comes from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para20"><a name="09072215000193">I know that complex arguments are involved here, including those about where the Gurkhas were based. The Gurkha regiment was not necessarily based in this country, although at times in the 1960s there was a regiment here. There was a regiment in Hong Kong until July 1997, and so making comparisons is difficult. However, if we believe in justice and fairness&#151;we have now accepted the settlement issue&#151;we must move on the pension issue. If we do not, we will be penalising the very people who may wish to come to this country and who we are now encouraging to come to this country. They will be coming here on a pension that will not allow them to live in this country on anything other than poverty wages.</p>

<p><a name="st_o376"><a name="09072215000194"><a name="90721-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="09072215000341"><b>John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b>
 My constituency contains a large Gurkha community; the Hayes Nepalese association has now been formed and it contains at least 500 people. The old patterns of pension payment no longer reflect the pattern of settlement of Gurkhas, as families now want to reunite, even in this country. As a result, some are living on very low incomes.</p>

<p><a name="st_o377"><a name="09072215000195"><a name="90721-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="09072215000342"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 That is the case, which is why I am pleased to have secured this debate, even if it is at this late hour, at the very last moment of this Session. We have examined the settlements issue in terms of the closeness of ties, and we have now identified that that closeness is a strong reason why the settlement is allowed, but we must move further on the equality of treatment, particularly pension treatment. The comparison with India and those troops from the Indian part of the tripartite agreement is also worth dwelling on for a moment. The Gorkhas&#151;the Indian equivalent of the Gurkhas&#151;were similarly disadvantaged because there was, again, a break pre-1997. Interestingly, India has recognised that that break is wrong and I understand that it now treats those who retired before that date in the same way as it treats those who retired thereafter. That makes a significant difference, and there has always been an understanding that that is right in that case, so I ask the Minister why that does not apply to the Gurkhas. It is causing hurt among those who have retired as well as later generations, because Gurkha servicemen do not think, &#147;Oh, we&#146;re all right and our predecessors do not matter.&#148; This matters to one and all in the Gurkha community and to many others in Nepal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para21"><a name="09072215000196">I ask the Minister to look again at this issue. I am sure that he will say that the law is clear, and there have been judgments that would allow the Government to feel that the 1997 break is the right place for the differential to be imposed. But that is not the view of the Gurkha community, and it is certainly not the view of the Gurkha Welfare Society, which has raised this with me and other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para22"><a name="09072215000197">It is not only a question of money. There is an argument about what this would cost. If many Gurkhas came to settle in this country, fewer resources would be available for Nepal. The Nepalese Government representatives have made it clear that it is up to the individuals to make their minds up where they wish to reside. As long as they receive support when they are living in Nepal, the Nepalese Government will be satisfied, but if people choose to resettle in this country, they have to be compensated for the higher cost of living, and that can only be done if they have a decent pension.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on securing tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate on Gurkha pensions, which gives me an opportunity to explain what the Government are doing for Gurkha pension arrangements and explode some of the myths that surround them. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend has repeated some of those myths tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09072215000200">The Government recognise the debt of honour that we owe the Gurkhas, their bravery and the contribution that they have made not only in current operations but in the first and second world wars, as well as their proud tradition of contributing to the security and safety of our country. We need to recognise that the issue of Gurkha pensions cannot be taken in isolation from other pension arrangements for either the British armed forces or other public servants. Gurkha pensions are part of a wider package of terms and conditions of service that were designed to recognise and reward the dedication to which I have just referred. Many high-quality recruits come forward every year to enter the Gurkha regiment&#151;typically 17,000 for 2,000 places. A place in the Gurkha regiment is highly prized by families in Nepal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para25"><a name="09072215000201">In general, pension schemes need to recognise the service given by individuals in their occupations, and that is what the Gurkha pension scheme has done for successive generations of Gurkhas. I want to dispel one myth. I was in Nepal earlier this year, and I know that the pension provides a comfortable retirement income. To describe Gurkha pensioners as living in poverty or deprivation could not be further from the truth. I met many of them when I was in the country, and I can tell my hon. Friend that their standard of living is very high compared with that of many of their fellow citizens. I shall say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09072215000202">Before I explain the position of Gurkha veterans, it is important to dispel some myths surrounding the GPS. It cannot be separated from other pension schemes, including the current and previous schemes for our armed forces. It has been the policy of this and previous Governments that the terms and conditions of pension arrangements cannot be changed retrospectively after people leave public service. That is true for the GPS and for the pension schemes covering the armed forces and the public sector as a whole. The GPS cannot be treated separately so I shall deal with it in detail because, when we talk about &#147;equalisation&#148;, we must understand what that means in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09072215000203">Let us be clear&#151;under the GPS, all Gurkhas with service after 1997 now enjoy the same terms and conditions as their British equivalents. We are therefore talking  <br>

about veterans who retired before 1997 and comparing their scheme with that of their contemporaries with the same period of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09072215000204">The GPS pays a pension after a rifleman has completed 15 years&#146; service, so a man who joins at the age of 18 can retire at 33. In contrast, the armed forces pension scheme 1975 does not pay a pension until age 60 for other ranks with fewer than 22 years&#146; service. That covers the majority of British veterans, and means that most Gurkhas receive a significant pension value before equivalent British soldiers receive anything at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para29"><a name="09072215000205">My hon. Friend was right to say that, by the time they reach 60, Gurkhas receive lower monthly pension payments than their British counterparts. However, Gurkhas soldiers will have received some 27 years&#146; of annual payments by that point, whereas their British equivalents will have received none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para30"><a name="09072215000206">In any scheme, the earlier pensions are drawn, the lower the annual payments will be. Nevertheless, the reality is that a Gurkha who reaches 60 will generally have received at least as much pension value as a British soldier with an identical period of service, if not more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para31"><a name="09072215000207">For example, a Gurkha rifleman who retired in 1994 at age 33 will have received some &#163;61,000 in pension payments so far, at 2009 prices. In comparison, a member of the armed forces pension scheme 1975 who is the same age will not have received any pension yet. When both turn 60 in 2021, the Gurkha will receive an annual payment of &#163;2,900, whereas his British equivalent will start getting &#163;5,700 a year. That is assuming that the retail prices index in both countries is the same, although in fact the rate in Nepal is, at 14 per cent., much higher than here. As I announced earlier this year, we have increased Gurkha pensions in line with that rate so, based on those figures, the British soldier would never catch up with his Gurkha equivalent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para32"><a name="09072215000208">The crossover point, when a British veteran&#146;s pension is significantly better than that of a Gurkha, is generally at senior NCO level. If we agreed to equalisation, the only significant improvement would be for a relatively small group&#151;about 10 per cent.&#151;of officers. It is not the case that equalisation of the pension would benefit the majority of Gurkhas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90721-0021.htm_para33"><a name="09072215000209">The Gurkha pension provides a good standard of living in Nepal. The figures look low in comparison with Britain, but &#163;172 a month is equivalent to the salary of a doctor or chief of police in Nepal, and more than is paid to a Member of Parliament there. A British soldier who served less than 22 years before 1975 receives no pension at all. Many Members have championed the cause of people who served 21 years before 1975 and received no pension.</p>

Friend&#146;s point about a special case for the Gurkhas, yes, we are making a special case, in terms of the UK equivalent: whereas a Gurkha on the GPS is eligible for an immediate pension after only 15 years, his UK equivalent is not. When we talk of equalisation, we need to be very clear about the fact that in most circumstances a Gurkha veteran&#146;s pension is at least as good, if not better, over the whole life of the pension, than his British counterpart&#146;s. If we transferred the Gurkhas to the equivalent of the 1975 or the 2005 scheme, they would not be significantly better off, as I  <br>

 I shall return to that point, as I want to talk about equalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90721-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09072215000213">Our estimates are that it would cost about &#163;1.5 billion over 20 years to equalise pensions, yet only 10 per cent. of Gurkhas would be beneficiaries. The British Gurkha Welfare Society says that we have been scaremongering and that our figures are wrong, but its figures are higher. I pointed out that its briefing notes for Members of Parliament showed that the figure would be &#163;126 million, but failed to indicate that that was per year. Actually, the figure would be considerably higher than the &#163;1.5 billion that we estimate and, as I said, only 10 per cent.&#151;mainly in the officer class&#151;would benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90721-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09072215000214">It has been said that we are not talking about retrospection, but we are. We are being asked to change the agreements and conditions under which individuals joined the scheme. We have never operated pension schemes in that way in this country and it could open up other schemes to such an approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90721-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09072215000215">To return to my hon. Friend&#146;s point about settlement, I was concerned about the suggestion that we were changing the pension arrangements to stop people coming to the UK. In the debate, I made the argument from the Dispatch Box that when I visited Nepal earlier this year, it was apparent that most Gurkhas did not want to come to the UK. What they wanted was pensions. I am sorry, but people cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue that they want to settle in this country and then argue that if increased pensions were paid, they would stay in Nepal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90721-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09072215000216">I know that my hon. Friend has had talks with the Nepalese Government, as I have. My concern is that we would be taking about &#163;56 million out of the Nepalese economy if we changed the arrangements in any way. I still think that that would be a consequence of large numbers of Gurkhas settling in this country. It is not consistent to argue that we should introduce changes to stop people coming to the UK, when only a few weeks ago it was argued that we should give them rights of settlement in this country. We are working with welfare organisations to make sure that the settlement process is put in place. I am pleased that that work is being carried out with the Gurkha Welfare Society and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90721-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09072215000217">If there is a message that should go from the Dispatch Box tonight to Nepal, it is that I want people who decide to come and settle in the UK to make that decision on the basis of the full facts. They should not come here thinking that the existing pension that they have secured will buy a good standard of living here. What appals me is that certain organisations&#151;not the Gurkha Welfare Society, which is a responsible organisation&#151;are taking money and encouraging people to come to this country on the basis of false information. That is very worrying.</p>
