 (LD): If he will make a statement on the humanitarian situation in Malawi. [25985]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51109-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 Malawi had a poor harvest earlier this year due to severe drought. Almost 2&nbsp;million people have received food aid since June and that figure will rise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to more than 4&nbsp;million before the next harvest in April 2006. A new assessment published this week indicates that some additional maize is needed due to an increase in the price. The Department for International Development&#039;s commitment of &#163;15.2&nbsp;million to help deal with the food crisis is the largest donor contribution and we are ready to do more if required.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51109-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 This year&#039;s harvest in Malawi was exceptionally poor and the Secretary of State will be aware that there are another five months until the next one. The situation is bad and getting worse. Given that the Church of Scotland estimates that some 5&nbsp;million lives may be at risk in Malawi, what steps can he take to ensure that those people are not left to die?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51109-01_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the seriousness of the situation. The harvest was down by about a quarter and Malawi now seems to suffer a very severe drought every 10&nbsp;years. However, the assessment system for anticipating the scale of the crisis has worked quite well. We currently estimate that, overall, about 4.4&nbsp;million people will require food. Of course, the problem is not just the failure of the harvest but the impact of AIDS on people&#039;s capacity to cope, along with the high price of maize. From memory, maize costs some 16&nbsp;kwacha per kilo in the north of the country and 46&nbsp;kwacha per kilo in the south, where the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem is most acute. Trying to bring down the price so that people can afford to buy maize is important, but above all, it is about ensuring that food is distributed. I spoke to the Malawian President last week, and to the Finance Minister this morning, about the situation. The steps that are being taken suggest that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 288</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the international community and the Government of Malawi, working together, will be in a position to deal with the crisis, but we keep the situation under very close review.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51109-01_spnew2"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York)</b> 
 (Lab): Drought is not the only cause of the food crisis in Malawi&#151;a population weakened by AIDS is one that cannot get good agricultural yields. What longer-term help will my right hon. Friend&#039;s Department give to increase irrigation in Malawi, so that farmers are less subject to the vagaries of rainfall?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51109-01_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point about the importance of ensuring that farmers have the means to get the most produce out of their land. That includes trying to harvest water where possible, but drought clearly makes doing so difficult. It is also about providing and distributing seeds and fertilisers, and part of the money that we have made available in response to the current crisis is for that purpose, so that farmers, particularly those who may have had to eat the seeds or who cannot afford to buy fertilisers, are in a better position in the new planting season to plant and&#151;if the rains come, which I hope they will&#151;to get a better yield next year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51109-01_spnew4"><b> Pete Wishart  (Perth and North Perthshire)</b> 
 (SNP): The Secretary of State will be aware of the Scottish Executive&#039;s useful and timely mission in Malawi just now. Can he assure me that he, his Department and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign and Commonwealth Office are doing all that they can to encourage and support the Scottish Executive in that mission? Does he further agree that the success of the mission demonstrates that the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions have a real&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and meaningful role to play in international development?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51109-01_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I welcome the initiative on the part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scottish Parliament and Executive to build on the historic links between Scotland and Malawi. My view is very simple. In the field of development&#151;in trying to help people around the world to build for themselves and their communities a better life&#151;there is more than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough work to be done, so I welcome the Scottish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive supporting health and civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations and others. Everybody wants to contribute and we should welcome that fact.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51109-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend is right to concentrate on the long-term solution to the situation in Malawi, but is he aware that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the World Food Programme estimates that it is $165&nbsp;million short this year, while there is a food surplus in South Africa, just a few hundred miles away? Will he apply pressure internationally to ensure that enough money is put into the WFP, so that that short-term solution to the situation faced by 2 million Malawians is brought to fruition sooner, rather than later?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51109-01_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The overall position is that the United Nations Malawi appeal asked for $88&nbsp;million, only about half of which was directly related to the food crisis; the rest was for funding other development and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>humanitarian activities. The UN has received $29&nbsp;million so far, but the Government of Malawi have received $60&nbsp;million, so, overall, Malawi has $89&nbsp;million with which to respond to the crisis, rather than the $88&nbsp;million that the UN asked for. I know from talking to the Malawian President and Finance Minister that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every effort is being made to procure maize from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherever it can be found. Indeed, part of the procurement process in which DFID and the European Union have been engaged is resulting in trucks carrying maize entering the country almost daily. I also pay tribute to the United States of America, which is doing a great deal in this crisis.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51109-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State&#039;s Department has been criticised for the use of consultants in Malawi and for the extensive expenses that were built up. Can he tell the House how many consultants his Department employs around the world and what safeguards are in place to ensure that their expenditure is effective?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51109-01_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The number varies from time to time and I will see whether I can come back to the hon. Gentleman with a figure. DFID&#039;s total expenditure on consultants as a proportion of our bilateral budget has fallen from 10&nbsp;per cent., as I recollect it, in 1997&#150;98&nbsp;to about 5&nbsp;per cent. now, so it is a falling share compared with the position that we inherited in 1997. We use consultants for a range of activities, partly to help deliver programmes and partly to give us advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">In respect of Malawi, I have to say that some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;criticism was ill founded, because the training programmes that the National Democratic Institute was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engaged in were supporting civil society and parliamentarians in Malawi to think about how they could do their jobs more effectively. That included hiring rooms for training courses and feeding people who were attending them&#151;a normal day-to-day activity that Members of the House and of all organisations engage in. The feedback from participants in those programmes was that that support and training was very helpful in assisting them to do their job as elected representatives.

 My hon. Friend will know that we and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the European Union collectively have long thought&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there should be a target on reproductive health in respect of the millennium development goals.

In the Minister&#039;s dealings with the UN and international donors, will he urge them to stress to recipient Governments that commitments to children suffering from or orphaned by AIDS and to the most vulnerable people affected by it should be met, as it is all too easy for those commitments to fall behind in comparison with those of more vocal sufferers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51109-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the work of World Vision, which has been particularly active in campaigning to highlight the needs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of orphans and vulnerable children affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. He may know that we have committed, with UNICEF, to host its annual global partners forum, which looks at the specific needs of orphans and vulnerable children. This year, we will look at some of the blockages in getting the aid through to the non-governmental organisations working with orphans and vulnerable children at the grass roots. I am sure that he will also be aware that we have committed &#163;150&nbsp;million over the next three years specifically for assistance to help orphans and vulnerable children affected by AIDS.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51109-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 I recognise the campaigning work that my hon. Friend has done on this issue. As I told the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), we will consider what further action we can take to speed the delivery of aid to grass-roots NGOs of the type that my hon. Friend has worked for and consistently advocated. On my recent visit to Malawi and Zambia, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw that delivery is speeding up, but more remains to be done. As she says, that will be the focus of our global partners forum meeting with UNICEF in February.

 (Con): Effective prevention, education and treatment in respect of HIV/AIDS are essential if we are to progress control of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disease, and Opposition Members welcome the aspirations in that regard at the G8 summit and the global fund replenishment summit. Increasingly, however, DFID&#039;s budget is being spent through partnerships with Governments, multilateral organisations and institutions, and NGOs&#151;channels that have minimal accountability. Will the Minister say what progress DFID has made since the critical report of November 2003 in monitoring and evaluating the channels through which British taxpayers&#039; money is spent? How will partnership performance be assessed and resources allocated to ensure maximum prevention, and maximum treatment, of HIV/AIDS?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51109-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s premise that there is minimal accountability for the aid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we dispense through budget support or multilateral organisations. There is a whole process of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;auditing and assessing how the Government deliver aid and whether our arrangements are appropriate. Where our arrangements in-country are not appropriate, we will not dispense aid through budget support but work through NGOs or UN organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">I absolutely accept the point about the need to continue to focus on prevention of HIV/AIDS as well as on treatment. Over the past two years, significant attention has rightly been given to the question of how we get more access to antiretroviral drugs. We need to continue that work and to return to the question of how we can ensure that people have more access to the various prevention measures, such as condoms. We must also step up our research into developing a workable vaccine and an effective microbicide. In the run-up to world AIDS day, we are hosting an event for EU Development Ministers to look at that precise issue.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51109-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The education for all global monitoring report, published today, highlights the continuing problem of children learning to read and write in sub-Saharan Africa. The UK is helping African countries to strengthen basic education, particularly for women and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girls. For example, in Zambia, where we support teaching children to read and write in their mother tongue before learning English, the programme has dramatically improved literacy rates.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51109-02_spnew0"><b> Barbara Keeley: </b> 
 There are two objectives in the children&#039;s literacy strategy&#151;to ensure that low literacy levels are lifted and, as my right hon. Friend noted, to close the gender equality gap. One of the millennium development goals is to close that gap by 2015, so will he say what progress is being made in that direction?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 292</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those objectives depends on the capacity of the Governments of developing countries to raise the finance, employ the teachers and build the schools. In particular relation to girls, the task is to address the other factors that prevent girls from getting to school. Something as practical as a lack of toilet facilities can make parents reluctant to send their daughters to school. Another factor could be the lack of clean water, because if water has to be fetched and carried from somewhere else, we know that that burden falls on girls and women. If girls have to fetch and carry water, they cannot go to school.

<p>
<a name="51109-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o2">School fees present another obstacle that has to be overcome, as they prevent poor families from sending their children to school.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51109-02_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the problem. As he knows, the real problem involves the factors that drive teachers and other skilled professionals out of developing countries, such as poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay and working conditions, and the lack of opportunity for career and professional development. In the course of 2005, various commitments have been made to help developing countries improve pay and working conditions for teachers and provide more career and professional development, and the British Government have also increased aid to that end. Another obstacle is the lack of housing for teachers in rural areas: if there is no house to live in, is it any wonder that teachers are reluctant to go and work in a remote rural community? That is what we have to address, and our increased aid is supporting that effort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_o3">For example, the new President of Burundi has just abolished school fees. On the first day, 500,000&nbsp;children turned up for school, 300,000&nbsp;of whom had not been to school before. Although there is still the same number of teachers in the schools there, we have given the country some financial assistance to help it to begin to address that enormous challenge.

I assure the House that we will deliver every penny that we have promised and the record so far shows that that is the case. We have

<br>&nbsp;<br>made a great effort to bring the scale of the crisis to the attention of others in the international community. Nobody can be in any doubt about the short time left. That is why we need more money from others in the international community and more help on the ground to turn that money into support that gets to people in the remote mountain communities of Azad Kashmir and North-West Frontier Province.

 (Con): In the Government&#039;s capacity as president of the European Union, what efforts has the Secretary of State made to secure a fitting response from those member countries, highlighted by Oxfam and others, that have failed to donate to the Asian earthquake appeal? Is he aware that Spain, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Austria have contributed no additional funds?

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman what we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have done. Two days after the earthquake struck, we issued a presidency statement and I have now written twice to EU Development Ministers. Along with Jan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeland, I briefed them at the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Leeds on 24 October. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue was also raised by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 October. Every country should look deeply into its conscience and ask itself if it is doing all that it can to help people who are in desperate need.

<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="51109-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 May I suggest to the Secretary of State a specific way in which he could assist with that matter? After the Asian tsunami, the EU considered several trade measures to improve market access for the affected countries. Will he press the EU to liberalise its trade with Pakistan to promote economic recovery in that country? In particular, will he consider the inclusion of Pakistan in the generalised system of preferences&#151;the GSP-plus&#151;from which it was excluded earlier this year?

 I am sure that, as the European Union&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considers how it may provide support to the reconstruction process, it will be happy to look at all possible measures. Issues, and some difficulties, would arise from the proposal that the hon. Gentleman makes, but I simply say to him that the task of reconstruction will be big and take a long time. Our immediate concern has to be with helping to save the lives of those who are in desperate need as we speak. The time will come for reconstruction and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will attend the conference in Pakistan on 19 November. We will make a commitment there to support the reconstruction, in the same way as Britain has played an honourable role in helping to save the lives of those affected by that terrible catastrophe.

 (LD): I agree with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary of State about the ongoing gravity of the situation, but he should bear in mind the fact that small charities such as Shelterbox are delivering more tents than big Government in the UK. When it takes three weeks to deliver Chinooks to the region, does the Secretary of State agree that lessons need to be learned from the response to the emergency? When the dust settles, will he review the

 I am happy to review the effectiveness, but I emphatically reject the implied criticism in the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman&#039;s comment that somehow the British Government have been slow. The fact is that we were the first country in the world to send search and rescue teams. We have provided 5,500 tents, 27,000 blankets and 30,000 tarpaulins. We could do that so quickly precisely because we had prepared and we had those things in stock. We have now funded 65 flights for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disasters Emergency Committee, helping the NGO sector to bring in supplies. We are currently trying to find a way to lift the shelterboxes waiting to go. I simply ask Shelterbox to link up with one of the DEC agencies, as that is the most effective and easiest way of getting help to the region.

 The parliamentary skills group, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chair, has just published a report showing that MPs and businesses are concerned about funding and training in adult skills and learning, especially given the huge proportional rise in the population of older people that will occur over the next 10 years. Does the Prime Minister agree that we need to get rid of age barriers in apprenticeships and training, and does he accept that the Government need to bring the same passion and commitment as they have to other areas of education, and improve even on what they have already done in funding further education?

<a name="stpa_o8">And what we seek to do&#151;this ought to be capable of cool and rational debate&#151;is to test the extent to which the 90-day proposal can be justified. So let me ask the Prime Minister this specific question: can he identify a single case in which it has taken the police 90&nbsp;days after arresting a suspect to find evidence sufficient to charge that person with a terrorist offence?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="51109-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I really have to say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I find it quite extraordinary that he seeks to suggest that there is somehow no evidence that the police are putting forward for the case that they are making. They have put forward detailed reasons as to why they believe these powers to be necessary. For example, just this last weekend, we arrested people on a terrorist operation. There were 750&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gigabytes of data&#151;that is 66,000 ft-worth of data&#151;that would be printed out and have to be investigated. Just with the events of 7 July, there are two warehouse-fulls of exhibits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_o9">We know that each of these terrorist operations has links to abroad. We know, for example, that it took two weeks, just in respect of the bomb factories in Leeds, to make them safe. That is what the police have set out time and again. That is why it is important that they have this power, as they say, to make our country safer, and they have given details of why they say that these powers are necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_o10">Yes, it is true that we have agreed a sunset clause. Why? Because it is important. If people have these concerns, and I understand them, let us test it over the year. Let us see if the worries that people have are justified, or not. That is a reasonable thing to put forward. We have an independent review of the system&#151;Lord Carlile will also report on it&#151;but let us send out a signal from the House that, when it comes to defeating terrorism, we are going to give the police the powers that they need and back them.

 Does not the Prime Minister recognise that it is the duty and responsibility of every single Member of this House to test the arguments that are put forward by the police? The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have published various papers from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police. None of those papers includes a single case about which the police say that it took 90&nbsp;days after arresting someone to find the evidence required to charge them. I think that there is a general mood in the House for an increase in the time during which the police should be entitled to hold people without charge. The question is whether that period should be 90&nbsp;days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para6">

 I suggest, before we have the vote, that Opposition Members and the right hon. and learned Gentleman once again read the report that Andy Hayman provided that gave precise examples of the circumstances in which he needed a detention period of up to 90&nbsp;days.

<a name="stpa_o13">In those circumstances, I appeal to the House to have some sense of responsibility here&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is an occasion when it is important that we do what is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible, right and necessary to protect this country&#039;s security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para9">
<a name="stpa_o14">We have already indicated that there will be a sunset clause, so we can judge what happens over the year. Every seven days that someone is held, they will go back in front of a High Court judge. Hon.

It is also important that we protect the civil liberties of this country and the right to life and protection from terrorism. That is why we have put the proposals forward. We do that in a reasonable way and I ask, yet again, for the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s support.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="51109-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 We all want to fight terrorism effectively, but we do not have to look very far beyond our shores to see what happens if minority communities are alienated. What is likely to be the state of mind of someone who spends the equivalent of six months in prison on the basis of no evidence whatever and is then released without charge? What will that person&#039;s friends, relatives and community think? How likely would we be to receive intelligence from such communities? How does the Prime Minister think that we can effectively fight terrorism without intelligence from those communities?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para10">
<a name="stpa_o15">The Prime Minister referred to the document from Mr. Hayman. I have read the document very carefully. It refers to the difficulties caused by the inability of the police to question after charge; we have tabled amendments to deal with that. It refers to the difficulties caused by the disclosure regime; that, too, can be remedied. What it does not do is justify 90&nbsp;days. Does not the inability of the Prime Minister to identify a single case in which the police have needed 90&nbsp;days go to the heart of his failure to justify the 90-day period? Does that not prove beyond doubt that the Home Secretary is right when he says that there is nothing crucial about 90&nbsp;days?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="51109-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, Andy Hayman&#039;s letter and document set out very clearly why the 90&nbsp;days are necessary. Let me explain again the basic argument of the police. Most reasonable people would see what they are trying to say. Because of the nature of the new terrorism that we face, because the terrorists want to kill people without limit&#151;in July they killed 50&nbsp;people in London, but they would have killed 500&nbsp;had they been able to do so&#151;when the police are investigating whether or not a conspiracy is taking place, they are naturally inclined to charge these people, to take them and arrest 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 300</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them, earlier than they otherwise would. If they make a mistake about the particular gestation period of the conspiracy and they get it wrong&#151;they might think that the conspiracy is in its early stages, but in fact it is well advanced&#151;we could end up with mass casualties on our streets. For that reason, the police say that this is a completely different situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para11">
<a name="stpa_o16">We need to be able to lift these people earlier and accumulate evidence to charge them after arrest. The number of people, for example, who have been kept for over seven days since the new powers were introduced is just over 30, so we are not talking about large numbers of people, but they may be the crucial difference between saving this country from a terrorist attack and not doing so. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that we will alienate minority communities, but it is sad that he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should make that argument&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Muslim community in this country is as determined as any other part of our community to defeat terrorism. Its members do not want to be told that they are against this because it alienates them&#151;they want these people dealt with and arrested. In the end, if this is the best argument that the right hon. and learned Gentleman can make, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest that he and his colleagues ask themselves whether they really think that this is where the Conservative party should be.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="51109-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I agree with the Prime Minister that we face a new situation, which is why we and a majority of hon. Members on both sides of the House accept that there is a case for extending the period. The question that we face, and the question that the Prime Minister has not specifically answered, is why the period should be 90&nbsp;days. In September, the Home Secretary said that he would seek to compromise, and that he would not rule out a detention period of one month. Last month, he said that 90&nbsp;days was &quot;not a God-given amount&quot;. Last week, he said that the figure of 90&nbsp;days was &quot;not crucial&quot;. On Monday, he said that he would table an amendment to reduce the period from 90&nbsp;days. Why was that amendment not tabled?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="51109-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 For the simple reason that all the way through we have said that 90&nbsp;days are right. It is detention of up to 90&nbsp;days: every seven days the person has to be brought back before the court. The right hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and learned Gentleman asked why 90&nbsp;days&#151;it is for the very reasons that the police have given. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right period to allow them to conduct their operations and investigations properly. That is where the 90&nbsp;days comes from. I am afraid that in the end he and his hon. Friends must decide whether on this particular issue they are going to back the police and those charged with fighting terrorism in our country, who tell us&#151;in my view, rightly&#151;that they need this power to make our country safe. He and his hon. Friends must make their decision today. We have made ours: we believe that this is right for our country, we believe that it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism, and I am only sorry that he does not agree.

So there is much on which we can reach agreement, but he must surely understand that there were those who thought we would have an opportunity to record a vote last week, which we did not because of what the Home Secretary had to say. He told the House&#151;in all sincerity, I am sure&#151;that he would have urgent discussions with colleagues in his own party and other parties to see whether consensus could be reached. Is the Prime Minister seriously saying today, when we will come to the vote later, that the Home Secretary ever thought that a consensus would be reached over 90&nbsp;days?

 As the Home Secretary has explained, it was not possible to reach a consensus. I am sorry about that. The right hon.

When he says that they agree with large parts of the Bill, that is fine. Perhaps they do. According to the police and those charged with fighting terrorism in this country, however, this is not a peripheral matter. It is central and vital. It is not just about my leadership; it is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the leadership of other political parties too.

All of us have to make that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision. The right hon. Gentleman asks whether we should simply accept what the police put forward. We are accepting what the police put forward because, to any reasonable person, the reasons they give are compelling. We face a different type of terrorism. It requires them to arrest people earlier, to develop the evidence and to charge them later. That is why they need the power. In circumstances where we know and it is accepted that we face a continuing terrorist threat in this country, I find the position of the Liberal Democrats unsurprising, and I find the position of the Conservative party surprising.

That is the right thing to do, and it builds on the specialist schools programme, which has been immensely successful in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency and elsewhere.

A large number of GPs were already opting out of out-of-hours services, which is one of the reasons why we had to make the change.

<p><a name="st_o74"><a name="51109-03_spmin16"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>

That is the reason for tightening up the gateway. We have put an awful lot of money into the new deal and other programmes designed to help people off benefit and into work. It has been very successful; indeed, it is the reason why we now spend about &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year less on benefits than we did in 1997.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51109-04_spnew4"><b> Charles Hendry  (Wealden) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the mental health and special learning needs of convicted prisoners; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Bill is specific in trying to address the problems that affect a significant proportion of our prison population. I introduce it because I believe that the way in which our penal system cares for those with mental health needs at the start of the 21st century is a stain on our society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Daniel Meehan, a young constituent of mine, had always been a troubled young man. He had a history of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mental illness and drifted in and out of prison throughout his adult life. Daniel had been diagnosed as suffering from a series of mental illnesses, including the antisocial personality disorder, Tourette&#039;s syndrome, from the age of 17. He had spent around half his life in prison but he never received the help and treatment that he needed to tackle his problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Instead of rehabilitation, Daniel was left exposed and fell foul of the problems that, all too often, vulnerable people face in prison. He developed a heroin addiction while in jail and started to abuse alcohol. In September last year, on his discharge from prison, he was left homeless, without his medication or even any clothes. He was bailed by the courts to his father&#039;s address. When his father was not at home, he looked for somewhere else to stay and, as a result, he was rearrested for breaking his bail conditions and taken back into custody. His mother and sister desperately tried to arrange specialist care for Daniel and eventually arranged for a social worker to visit him in Lewes prison. However, on the same day the social worker was due to visit, he was moved to Her Majesty&#039;s prison Weare, a floating prison off Dorset.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Neither the social worker nor Daniel&#039;s family had been made aware of the transfer, yet the prison system somehow expected a prisoner with a long history of mental illness to rearrange the appointment himself. Daniel&#039;s complex needs were never properly assessed. Alone and without the support he needed, Daniel died at his father&#039;s house in January this year, aged 29. The coroner returned an open verdict on the death, but to most of us who had seen his case develop, we have no doubt that suicide would have been the more appropriate verdict.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Daniel&#039;s family freely admit that he was a difficult man, but time and again, over almost 10 years, the prison system consistently failed to address his problems. As Daniel&#039;s sister, Mrs. Meehan-Bissett, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Prison was not the answer for someone like Daniel, he needed rehabilitation. He died due to neglect. The prison authorities cannot be bothered with someone like Daniel . . . There needs to be somewhere for people like Daniel to go. If you need to lock them up, lock them up, but not without anything to do all day.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Government response to the Home Affairs Committee report on the rehabilitation of offenders, which was published in January 2005, stated that there were firm commitments that, by 2004:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;All prisoners with severe mental illness would be in receipt of treatment and that no prisoner with a serious mental illness would leave prison without a care plan&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 307</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">In Daniel&#039;s case, it is all too clear that those rules were not followed. Many hon. Members are aware of similar cases from our constituencies, so it is important to understand the extent of the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Last year in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), whom I am pleased to see on the Front Bench, the then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997&nbsp;by the Office for National Statistics, showed that around 90&nbsp;per cent. of prisoners sampled displayed evidence of at least one of the five disorders&#151;personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence&#151;considered in the survey. There will, at any one time, be around 5,000&nbsp;prisoners with a severe mental illness&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 2&nbsp;December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 247W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Similar findings were published in a report by the Prison Reform Trust, supported by the Nuffield Foundation, into the mental health of women prisoners. It found that two thirds of women in prison show symptoms of at least one neurotic disorder such as depression, anxiety and phobias. More than half suffer from a personality disorder. Yet, among the general population, less than one fifth of women suffer from those disorders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">The report found that half the women in prison are on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prescribed medication such as anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medicine and there is evidence that the use of medication increases while in custody. Of all women who are sent to prison, a terrifying 40&nbsp;per cent. say that they have attempted suicide at some time in their life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Research by Oxford university into suicide rates for younger offenders is even more shocking. The analysis of suicide rates in England and Wales from 1978&nbsp;to 2003&nbsp;found that the difference was particularly striking in 15&nbsp;to 17-year-olds. Offenders in that age group were 18&nbsp;times more likely to kill themselves than those in the general prison population. Depressingly, the report concluded that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;half those who commit suicide in prison have a treatable mental illness.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">If those illnesses were indeed treatable, it means that those suicides could have been prevented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The problem goes far beyond mental health; there are also too many prisoners who have serious learning difficulties. According to Home Office statistics, the prevalence of poor educational attainment among prisoners is shocking. Fifty-five per cent. of prisoners had a reading ability of level 1 or below&#151;the educational level for an 11-year-old. That proportion rises to 67 per cent. in young offenders&#151;in other words, two thirds of young offenders have the reading ability of an 11-year-old or younger child. In spelling, 79 per cent of prisoners were at level 1 or below, with that figure rising to 87 per cent. in young offenders. In numeracy, those rated at level 1 or below represented 69 per cent. of the general prison population, and 78 per cent. of young offenders, so the frightening truth is that about three quarters of young offenders are illiterate and innumerate. Despite this, however, the average time for education in prison was under six hours a week per prisoner in 2002, and only slightly higher in young offender institutions. As a result, most of them are almost as illiterate and innumerate when they leave prison as when they start their sentence.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 308</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">This Bill is not about making excuses for those who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break the law. One essential pillar of prison is that it should act as a deterrent to those thinking of committing crime and punish those who have broken the law. But prison works only if it also rehabilitates. As one governor said to me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;We are very good at incarceration, but not at rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">A prisoner without rehabilitation is a prisoner who will offend again. So, the mental health and learning needs of prisoners must be addressed if we are truly to have a prison system that meets those two core goals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The Bill that I am proposing is a simple one. Where it has been established that a criminal has mental health needs, there would be a legal requirement for those needs to be professionally and thoroughly assessed at the start of their sentence. For all prisoners, an assessment would be required of their educational needs. Those with mental health requirements would be detained only in an establishment with specialised facilities, and with staff trained to deal with them. A pathway programme of support would have to be developed to ensure that their mental needs were met. Those needing educational attention would receive a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more focused programme of tuition, instead of the haphazard tuition that they currently receive, and it should focus on skills training as well, to give them some hope of employment when they leave. As prisoners with mental health problems are now treated by the NHS, the primary care trust budgets covering this treatment should be ring-fenced to ensure that the funds to finance prisoner care cannot leak away into other areas of health care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">The objective of the Bill is not to create prison asylums surrounded by barbed wire&#151;far from it. The Bill seeks to ensure that prisoners with mental health needs are kept in an establishment in which those needs are addressed first and foremost, and which works to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support their rehabilitation. In no way does it undermine the principle that many people need to be kept away from society, for the good of society and for their own good, but it does mean that they will be given the care and medical support that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">I have visited a number of young offender institutions. They are the most depressing places I have ever been to, and I certainly do not know how we can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rehabilitate someone if we lock them up in a 9 ft by 5 ft cell for 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours a day or more. When those prisoners have mental health problems or special learning needs, this becomes a hopeless task unless rehabilitation is at the forefront of the approach. Through specialised and focused rehabilitative methods, the prison system can make major inroads into reducing reoffending, but rehabilitation must be more responsive to the often complex problems of prisoners, which have all too often contributed to their being in prison in the first place, and will have them returning there time and again if they go unresolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">The case of Daniel Meehan is a tragic one. A young man with profound mental health needs died because he did not receive the help that he needed. At the start of the 21st century, that is something that should shame us all. We have the power to do something about this. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="stpa_22">I know that Opposition Members object frequently to every programme motion, but I suggest that even they would find it hard to fault this one. The effect of this programme motion is to increase the amount of time that the House will have to consider this Bill on Report.

<a name="stpa_23">The House will recall that the programme motion passed after Second Reading allocated us six hours in total for Report.

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_24">Accordingly, the motion provides that we begin on amendments to clause 23&nbsp;and the new clauses that have been tabled. We have three hours for that part of our proceedings.

 I will not seek to divide the House on the programme motion, but I should point out to the Home Secretary that although we welcome the concession that has been made, the practical reality is that we still have far too short a time to consider the amendments tabled for this afternoon. Even at this late stage, I hope that he might consider taking advice on whether further time can be made available. Let me explain why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_25">We will start with a debate on the period of detention, which is a subject of considerable controversy. Given the way in which the procedures of the House operate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fact that the Government have tabled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amendment No. 55, which changes the period from three months to 90 days, anyone wishing to have the 28-day amendment considered must first vote on Government amendment No. 55. We will therefore have to have two votes, whereas one on the 28 days alone might have been necessary otherwise. I am not clear as to why that has come about, except to provide a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 311</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>delay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanism in the time that the House has for consideration. As a consequence, the reality must be that new clause 8 on stop and search, which was tabled by a Government Back Bencher, and which, I believe, merits the consideration of the House, is most unlikely to receive any consideration whatever. In the context of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to build consensus, that must be highly regrettable. There is no reason why that should have to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_26">When we move on beyond the three-hour break, when we will probably have had a couple of votes, and the stop and search matters will not have been considered, we will have five groups of amendments to consider, all of which are of importance, and three hours in which to do it. We might well have time to deal with the offences under clauses 1&nbsp;and 2, which remain controversial because the Government concessions do not appear to change radically the way in which indirect incitement to terrorism can still be committed negligently. If we have a full debate on that subject, however, which greatly exercised the Committee last week, there must be a danger that we will never get to the glorification clauses, which, as we know from last week, were the subject of enormous controversy. If the Home Secretary wishes to avoid the suspicion that the Government are trying procedurally to close down the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debate on those clauses, it would be wise to give us more time.

 My hon. Friend will agree that it is important that our proceedings today should be intelligible to the country at large.

 I do agree. As I said to the Home Secretary last week, the controversial nature of the Bill makes it immensely desirable that, if at all possible, this House should reach an agreed position so that we can all vote for the Bill on Third Reading tomorrow. But to do that we must debate, and if the debate is curtailed so that important parts of the Bill are never considered at all, that will place those who wish to consider them in great difficulty. As the Home Secretary knows, because the Bill is so controversial, there must be a risk that the other place will take over the responsibility that we have shirked&#151;and that we shall find ourselves involved, as we have too often in the past, in late-night spats as we try to sort out the differences between this House and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other place.

 I took exception to very little that was said by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Like him, we consider the timetable motion defective, but like him I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see no reason for us to divide the House on it. I accept the Home Secretary&#039;s point that some small measure of protection for the business has been made available, and that small amount of extra time is indeed welcome. Nevertheless, without second-guessing the way in which today&#039;s business will proceed, I think it very likely that we shall not go beyond the first string of amendments before the first knife falls after three hours. As the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, that will leave the stop-and-search provisions proposed in new clause 8&nbsp;entirely undiscussed. Surely that is too important a subject to leave this House without any proper discussion being placed on the record.

As a result, questions as fundamental as the definition of terrorism itself will almost certainly be left undebated. As a result of that, the only meaningful scrutiny will be carried out in the other place. If the Government are content to proceed in that way, they cannot then complain that the unelected House has interfered with or changed the Bill when it makes the amendments that are inevitable.

Twenty years ago, such an allocation of time for a Bill of this kind would have been regarded as laughable, and it would not have been entertained by the usual channels during the Thatcher Government. Thirty years ago, if a Conservative Government had proposed a Bill of this kind, several days of debate would have been allowed before any guillotine curtailing debate would have even been contemplated. Had anyone tried to force through a guillotine of this severity, I should have expected the sitting to be suspended as Labour Members caused disorder and began to run away with the Mace, or something of the kind, to give visual expression to their constitutional outrage.

The suspension of the rule to allow us at least to sit on through the evening until such time as the Government&#039;s business managers decide to try to call a vote to end the debate would constitute a very elementary extension of debating time, which would cause merely minor inconvenience to a few Members and no real affront to the House.

If this House is to continue to deal with matters of this importance in such a cursory fashion, it becomes all the more important that the whole Bill be properly scrutinised, and that the Lords force us to look again at, and to discuss in more detail, some of the other very serious aspects of this Bill.

In fact, the Bill has many of the features that would, in the old days, have made it be viewed as a constitutional Bill. As a general rule, such constitutional Bills of major importance were never guillotined. Every one of us should have the opportunity to justify, query or give reason to our anxieties about the Bill.

<a name="stpa_54">What I am going to suggest is something that I think is at least as serious. The charge is not that the Government are afraid of debate or that they are trying to shut people up. The charge is that the Government are, frankly, careless of and insensitive to the wishes of Back Benchers who want the opportunity to put their legitimate point of view and to receive responses to it. It seems to me that that was the kernel of the argument developed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Cormack), who is recognised throughout the House as a truly outstanding parliamentarian. He knows that there is a history in this place of considering these matters seriously and at length.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_55">I say in all sincerity to the Home Secretary, whose sincerity I respect and whose patriotism I acknowledge: what harm would be done either to the Government or to the national interest if we were to debate the Bill tonight until 10&nbsp;o&#039;clock? What would be the harm if the Government were to acknowledge that there was a welter of different opinions around the House and to let us have another day for debate? What damage would be inflicted; what disadvantage would be incurred?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_56">If the Home Secretary is looking just a bit irritated, as I suspect he is, it might be because he thinks that he knows that he has got it right, that the Government know what they are doing and that hon. Members must be told to let the Government get their business through. What I would say to the Home Secretary is that he should accept that in this, the cockpit of parliamentary democracy, we should debate the issues fully and comprehensively. We should have that opportunity, but we are being denied it. If I am prepared to stay here until 10&nbsp;o&#039;clock at night or to have another day&#039;s debate on issues that are far more important than most matters that the House will consider, why are Ministers not prepared to allow that? Why cannot we have a proper representation on the Government Front Bench for these important debates?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_57">Might I say that there was a time in the House&#151;a time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire will well recall&#151;when on occasions of this sort, the Prime Minister was customarily in his place to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear the arguments and listen to alternative points of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view? What is happening to our parliamentary democracy?

 Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51109-08_spnew1"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I will conclude in a moment, but of course I must give way to my hon. Friend.
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51109-08_spnew2"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a very important point. I well remember the days when Jim Callaghan, the late Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Callaghan, would sit in the Chamber for an hour or two at a time to listen to even rather insignificant debates. Other Prime Ministers have done the same, but not Lord Callaghan&#039;s successor.
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51109-08_spnew3"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I only wish that this Prime Minister would do that. I repeat that I respect his motivation, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 320</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>think that he is motivated by the highest considerations of national protection and public service, but neither he nor the Government have made much of a case for the central components of the Bill. Why cannot the Prime Minister be here? If he respected the House, the House would respect him.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51109-08_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 I endorse what has been said so far, and wish to make two other brief points. I also have a question for the Home Secretary which I hope will shorten the debate to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_58">Colleagues from three different parties on the Opposition Benches have argued that they accept that the programme motion gives more time for debate, but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we will still be hugely constrained. The Government&#039;s approach has two obvious defects. First, people outside the House who are not satisfied with Parliament and who have little respect for it will be able to say much more easily that we do not do our job properly or thoroughly and that we rush through important legislation. The central proposition for debate today is that we should make the period for which a person can be detained without charge six times as long as it currently is. Surely that merits a debate that is not constrained? There is no need to constrain debate, and the view that the Government should adopt a different approach is widespread.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_59">Secondly, the Government and the Home Secretary often criticise the House of Lords for being unelected and for interfering in the decisions of the elected House. It is impossible to criticise the Lords validly if this House cannot debate properly all the propositions that the Government put to it. The House of Lords then has an additional duty to make up for our failure in that respect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51109-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ronnie Campbell  (Blyth Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 How long will the House of Lords debate this matter for?
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51109-08_spnew6"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The House of Lords does not have a guillotine procedure. The debate there will go on for as long as people want to contribute to it. If ever there were a Bill that needed to be debated at somewhat greater length&#151;and for which time was available&#151;this must be it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_60">I turn now to my question for the Home Secretary, which follows the question posed by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) about the advice of the Scottish law officer. The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s answer to that question might shorten debate later: his answer to my question will do the same, and make it easier for him to make his case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_61">The Home Secretary got into difficulties last week when it came to explaining the legal advice that he received and its provenance, but my question does not ask him to reveal the content of the advice from the Attorney-General. It is this: who gives him advice as to whether the Bill, or any part of it, complies with the European convention on human rights? Is it internal legal advice from his Department&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51109-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b>

<p><a name="st_62">Government amendment No. 62.</p>











<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51109-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 All the amendments in this group relate to the complex and contentious question of pre-charge detention in terrorist cases. Government amendments Nos. 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60&nbsp;and 62&nbsp;provide that extensions of detention beyond 14&nbsp;days must be approved by a High Court judge or, in Scotland, a judge of the Court of Session. That responds directly to concerns raised in the Chamber at Committee stage. Any application that would extend detention beyond 14&nbsp;days will need to be made to the senior judge. If, for example, on day nine, the police thought that they needed only another couple of days before they would be in a position to release a suspect or suspects, they could still apply to a district judge. If, however, the police were clear at that point that they wanted a further seven days, the application would need to be made to the senior judge.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51109-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way at this early juncture. Why is application in Scotland to be made to a court of civil jurisdiction&#151;namely, the Court of Session&#151;for what is essentially a criminal matter?
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51109-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Following our exchanges in Committee, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set out clearly to all Scottish Members&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman will have received my correspondence&#151;the range of issues relating to that particular set of questions. I believe that that addresses the question that he has raised. If not, and he is indicating that it does not, I shall come back to him on the point later in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_68">In Committee, it was suggested that it was not only the level of judge that was important, but his experience of handling terrorist cases. It was suggested that there should be a cadre of judges designated for that purpose. We have explored that suggestion with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but it and the judiciary rejected that approach, so it has not been pursued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_69">Another option raised in Committee, following Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlile&#039;s recommendation, was for decisions to be taken by senior circuit judges, with an avenue of appeal to a High Court judge. In our view, that would lead to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an appeal in virtually every case with the cases eventually being decided by a High Court judge, so we have achieved the same result with fewer hearings. I can easily explain the effect of the amendments and I have also dealt explicitly with the proposals made by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 327</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_70">It was also suggested that judges should give reasons for their decisions to extend detention. The clear advice we have is that that would open up an avenue of appeal. There is also the risk that the judge might have decided to grant the extension on the basis of sensitive material, so we have decided not to proceed with that suggestion.
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51109-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 Can the Home Secretary amplify the exact procedure before the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Court judge? Will it be possible for submissions to be made by the person under detention pending charge? Will he be represented? How will the procedure operate and will the Government publish further material on that point, if necessary?
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51109-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The answer is yes. On the procedure, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come shortly to the codes of practice that will apply&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman pressed in Committee and to which I am keen to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_71">I turn to Government amendments Nos. 51&nbsp;and 58. As the Bill is currently drafted, extensions of pre-charge detention are for seven days unless there are &quot;special circumstances&quot; that warrant a lesser period. The amendments remove the word &quot;special&quot; so that a shorter extension period would be granted if the judge felt that circumstances warranted it. The amendments are identical to ones tabled by the Opposition in Committee, so we are responding to the debate on that issue.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51109-10_spnew0"><b> Lady Hermon  (North Down) (UUP):</b> 
 The Home Secretary will know that successive Chief Constables in Northern Ireland have had to fight terrorism in that part of the United Kingdom. What view does the present Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, have on the renewal of detention every seven days and extensions to 90&nbsp;days if needed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51109-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Lady has more personal experience of the dilemmas caused by such questions than most hon. Members. I have spoken to Sir Hugh Orde on that point, because of his particular experience. He was unequivocally clear, and he authorised me to say so in the House, that the legislation is&#151;in his experience and from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his point of view&#151;necessary, and that includes the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extension to 90 days. He is also of the view that the seven-day review by High Court judges is the right way to proceed, and that the flexibility that I am discussing is necessary. I hope that Members from Northern Ireland will take account of those views when they vote this evening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51109-10_spnew2"><b> Clare Short  (Birmingham, Ladywood) (Lab):</b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend tell the House whether any of our police officers have suggested that we have a power of internment? If they did, what view would the Government take of it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51109-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Since I have been Home Secretary, there have been no suggestions from any source, the police or the security services, that internment be adopted as a measure to deal with any of these questions. Were that suggestion to be made, I would consider it, but I am sure that the House will agree that the assessment of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation of internment in the period in which it operated was that it was a counter-productive approach 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 328</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to terrorism in the circumstances. By the way, I reject the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rhetorical comment&#151;made not by my right hon. Friend, but by others&#151;that the measures we are discussing today can in any sense be equated with internment. That is simply not the case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51109-10_spnew4"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to the point raised by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), Sir Hugh Orde will appear before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee this afternoon and will doubtless be asked many questions. Are there any chief constables who take a directly contrary view on this issue?
</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51109-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am not aware of any. I have not personally spoken to every chief constable, so I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that not one of them takes a different view, but all the chief constables to whom I have personally spoken about it take the strong view that the provisions are necessary. The Association of Chief Police Officers also strongly takes that view, which is held most strongly by those people who have been most directly involved in fighting terrorism.

<a name="time_14">
<a name="51109-10_time0"><h5>1.45&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51109-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary has just said that the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland had reached his conclusion based on his experience. The letter that we received from Hayman of the Met said that the experience in Northern Ireland was totally different and not relevant. We now face new circumstances. What relevant experience has the Chief Constable had? Does he believe that the new powers are necessary in Northern Ireland and, if so, did the Home Secretary refuse to give him those powers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51109-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I regret to say that the right hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the point that Assistant Commissioner Hayman made. His point was that the modern terrorism that we face is different in certain important respects from the terrorism that we had to face in the past in Northern Ireland. It is the case that the modern terrorism that we face is a challenge for police in Northern Ireland today in a very direct way, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why the Chief Constable is entitled to make his comments, not as a point of general principle but in terms of dealing with the modern terrorism that he has to face.
</p>








<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51109-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary may recall that under schedule 8&nbsp;it would be open to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judicial authority to exclude any person to whom the application relates&#151;the suspect&#151;or anyone representing him from any part of the hearing. How can he reconcile that with the provisions in the European convention on human rights on fair hearings?
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51109-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall come on to the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman in a few moments. I believe that the two can be reconciled, which is why I have provided the certificate for this legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">In answer to the earlier question from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), I want to say a few words about codes of practice. He also raised the point with me last week. In Committee, it was suggested that we needed a code of practice to govern the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 329</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>treatment of those held under the Terrorism Act 2000. We welcome that suggestion. Powers for that already exist in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under section 66&nbsp;of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Secretary of State can issue a code of practice in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect of those detained under schedule 8&nbsp;to the 2000&nbsp;Act if he so wishes. Existing PACE code C already applies to those detained under the Terrorism Act 2000, but we can see grounds for having a separate code for that purpose, as the hon. Gentleman argued earlier in our proceedings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_73">Such a code would be laid before Parliament and be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Similar provisions exist for a code that would relate to the Northern Ireland (Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland)) Order 1989. In Scotland, codes of practice are not generally used. Instead, the Lord Advocate, as the head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths, has a statutory power to instruct the police in relation to the investigation and reporting of crime under section 12&nbsp;of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995&nbsp;and section 17&nbsp;of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. Constables must perform their duties subject to the directions of chief constables, and chief constables must comply with all lawful instructions, in relation to the investigation of offences, from the appropriate prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_74">The Lord Advocate takes the view that it would be inappropriate to have different powers and periods of pre-charge detention in Scotland from the rest of the UK in terrorist investigations and, in considering appropriate guidance to chief constables in the Scottish context, he would want to maintain a consistent position north and south of the border, as far as possible. His officials would expect to work closely with Home Office officials on the preparation of a code of practice for England and Wales and any equivalent guidance to be issued by the Lord Advocate in Scotland. For those reasons, we are not tabling amendments at this point, but I can give a firm guarantee that the appropriate codes and their equivalent will be brought forward.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51109-10_spnew10"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Home Secretary will remember that last week we discussed the possibility of altering the rules about interviewing detained people after charge so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it facilitated inquiry after charges had been brought. Will that be part of the subject matter of the codes that he is bringing forward and, if so, does not it have some bearing on the total length of time for which we may need to detain people?
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51109-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do not expect that aspect of the code to deal with the particular point that we debated. Unless I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, I think his position is that we need, because of the particular situation of a possibly extended period of pre-charge detention compared with existing detention, to have a different approach to PACE in certain regards. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall say later&#151;

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_75">The question of judicial scrutiny is important and becomes more and more pressing at each stage of the process, as time moves on, and the judge needs to deal with that directly as we move forward. I am ready to have discussions on that point, too. The proposal is not designed to address the issue of questioning pre and post-charge that we have already discussed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51109-10_spnew14"><b> David Davis  (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b> 
 That is an extremely important point, which was twice raised by Mr. Hayman in his letter. It was raised during the Privy Council briefing that the Home Secretary organised for the Leader of the Opposition and me. The question of interview post-charge has clearly had a major effect on the attitude of the police to charge and to the proposal that we are discussing. It is clearly the case that if we alter the ability of the police to interview after charge, it will open up to them much evidence and procedure that will act to stop terrorism. Can the Home Secretary please give the House an undertaking that he will put that in process?
</p>

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51109-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with all that and, as I said to the House both on Second Reading and in Committee, we think the case for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is well made. Application of the procedure that he set out may mean that it would be less necessary in a given case, and thus there would be fewer cases where there was an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended period of pre-charge detention. The key point, however, is that it does not remove the need for pre-charge detention in certain circumstances, although I agree that the number would be limited. Nevertheless, I accept the integrity of his point; the view is shared across the Government that we need to achieve the state of affairs that he described. It is none the less important to note that there are implications for other aspects of the conduct of our legal process and they, too, need to be considered.
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51109-11_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz  (Leicester, East) (Lab):</b> 
 We have heard a lot about the views of the police on the extension of the detention period. Given that my right hon. Friend cannot tell us what the Attorney-General has told him, has he spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions? The Solicitor-General, who has responsibility to the House for the views of the Crown Prosecution Service, is sitting next to my right hon. Friend. What are the views of the DPP about the 90-day period? Secondly, given that the provision will disproportionately affect members of the Asian community, what steps will my right hon. Friend take to ensure that when the police have those additional powers they will engage fully, at a local level, with the Asian community?

 I can give my hon. Friend the specific assurance that he seeks on his first point: the CPS strongly supports the proposed extension to 90&nbsp;days.

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51109-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I want to finish answering my hon. Friend&#039;s question. His second point was very important. Without any encouragement from me, the police, over a period of 10 to 15 years&#151;perhaps since Scarman, perhaps for even longer&#151;have been working extremely hard to transform their relations with various minority ethnic communities in particular cities. Obviously, that is patchy and there are areas where not as much has been done, but some of our great metropolitan forces have made massive strides in developing relationships between operational policing and particular communities that did not exist previously. Moreover, the major faith leaders, nationally and locally, in most of our communities&#151;not all&#151;are working hard to find ways to co-operate in addressing the issues on a basis of respect for different faiths. To be candid, the comparison that was made earlier with current events in France is utterly unhistorically based when we consider our achievements in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_76">I agree with my hon. Friend that we need to re-intensify our efforts to ensure that police relationships with various ethnic minority communities and faiths are substantial and real in every community in the country. Much work is already going on, but I can give him an assurance, without qualification, of the key importance of that point.

 The Home Secretary was right to seek the views of the CPS in England and Wales, and it is right that the House should listen to them.

 I set out as clearly as I conceivably could the precise process that we followed in trying to obtain those views. That was the right approach.

 May I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take the Home Secretary back to the issue of the Lord Advocate? From what he told the House a moment or two ago, it appears that the Lord Advocate&#039;s view is that the period should be the same both north and south of the border, and that the authorities in Scotland should co-operate with the authorities in England, but it does not appear that the Lord Advocate endorsed the principle of 90&nbsp;days. Is that correct?

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51109-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The Lord Advocate endorsed the view&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it should be the same north and south of the border, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the case.

<a name="stpa_77">Amendment No. 63, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), addresses an important point that a large number of people have raised with me&#151;compensation in the event that someone was held incorrectly. The amendment provides that those held for more than 14 days and released without charge should be entitled to compensation. That is my hon. Friend&#039;s principal proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_78">I have much sympathy with the idea, but there are some issues regarding its implementation. Thus far, we have never paid compensation, other than in cases involving malpractice, to people tried and acquitted, even though they may be held in custody for far longer periods than we are considering in these circumstances. We may or may not agree with the justice of that position, but it has been the case for a long time. We need, therefore, to consider carefully the precedent that we might set if we agreed to the amendment. However, I accept, first, that my hon. Friend is making a serious point and, secondly, that by hypothesis we would be dealing with a very small number of cases indeed&#151;the very small number of cases where people are held, say, for more than 28&nbsp;days pre-charge and within that group the very, very small group of people who were wrongly held and subsequently not charged. For that reason, because the provision would apply to such a small group of people, I am prepared to look carefully at my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion and will report back to him and the House as soon as I can. I hope that he will understand that we need to take the operational implications fully into account, so I cannot give him an unequivocal commitment at this stage, but on the basis of that proposal, I ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment.

He says that the so-called

</p>








<p><a name="st_101"><a name="51109-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman totally misses the point. It is necessary, even under the PACE code that he describes, that a charge should be in place to go through that process. The hypothesis that we are discussing is that, in a number of cases, there is no possibility of charging on a short-term basis.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="51109-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes two points, one of which I do not accept and the second of which I do accept. I simply do not accept her description of the Prime Minister&#039;s motivation in terms of party politics. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not think that it is accurate; I do not think that it is his personal motivation; and I certainly do not believe that it is the Government&#039;s motivation. As I said on Second Reading, in Committee and at other times, the question that all Members must address is how can we do our duty as Members of Parliament in dealing with the national interest and national security.

We have only to look at the media on any day of the week to see that they provide a prism through which they say that all this debate is about party politics in some respect or another. I have tried personally, when interviewed on the media, to rebut that suggestion because I do not think that it is true. I do not mean that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that it is right but not correctly done; I think that it is an inaccurate description of the state of affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_83">I now turn to the point about consensus, about which my hon. Friend asks me. I believed and hoped as late as last Thursday that we could achieve a consensus with the main Opposition parties about the length of time that should be used. I also agree with her point that I was talking about consensus with Labour Members as well as with the Opposition parties on this question. That is what motivated me in the way that I operated. She may recall&#151;I think that she will&#151;that I asked every Member of the House to go back to their constituencies last weekend and take the view of their constituents, talk to them and ask their police and whoever else about these questions. I hope that she would agree that many Members have done precisely that: they have gone back and talked to people&#151;I am sure that she is one of those who have done just that&#151;and everyone will make their judgments on that basis.

That was their considered view. There was a discussion about the period between 14&nbsp;and 28&nbsp;days. I was of the view, which has been my view throughout, that 28&nbsp;days is not long enough to deal with the police case that we have, but I was ready to entertain discussions of a shorter period that could arise. I said that publicly in a variety of circumstances.

<br>&nbsp;<br>according to documents released to the Home Affairs Committee, when the Government agreed to support the 90-day proposal, they had received only two documents from the Association of Chief Police Officers&#151;the ACPO press release of 21 July and a two-page summary of two difficult cases, neither of which is analysed to provide a case for 90 days.

 Over the weekend, I sought the views of South Wales police and had a detailed discussion about the measure with them.

We are talking about a very small number of cases indeed, but by hypothesis we are trying to deal with some of the most dangerous people in the world. Secondly, we have not made as much of judicial oversight as we should have done, but we should address the powerful issue of a High Court judge reviewing the detention either every seven days or on the more flexible basis that I set out. It is very important indeed that we look at this in a balanced way, which is another argument for the sunset clause&#151;something to which, as I said, I am not usually sympathetic.

 My right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_101">I emphasise, as I said on Second Reading, that we are dealing with a very different threat now from the one we faced in previous decades. Recent terrorist plots have been designed to cause mass casualties with no warnings&#151;I emphasise, no warnings, sometimes using suicide and with the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_102">Some hon. Members have commented that terrorist cases are no more difficult to prosecute than complex fraud cases, but I argue that there is a very substantive difference between the two. In complex normal cases, the police may build a case before arresting an individual. It may also be possible to catch criminals red-handed in the act of committing a crime such as fraud, as the repercussions are not so great if the crime is committed. The need to ensure public safety by preventing mass casualty attacks that could be catastrophic in their effect means that it is necessary to make arrests in terrorist cases far earlier in the process than in other cases. That often means that much less evidence has been gathered at the point of arrest, so more time will be needed to gather sufficient evidence to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge a suspect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_103">Moreover, terrorist networks are often international, which means that highly complex inquiries have to be undertaken in many different jurisdictions. I remind the House again of the investigations into the events of 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 21 July, which yielded 38,000 exhibits that filled two warehouses, and so on. Terrorist networks are also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 343</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>now highly capable of using technology. In recent cases&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a large number, sometimes in the hundreds, of computers and hard drives have been seized. Much of the data on such computers and hard drives have been encrypted and take time to decrypt. The data then need to be analysed to incorporate the outcome of that analysis into an interview strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_104">Following the debates in the House and the request from hon. Members in all parts of the House for more substance, over the past few days I have consulted advisers from the National Technical Assistance Centre, whose experts deal with the hardest and most important decryption jobs. Their advice has been unequivocal. A 14&nbsp;or even 28-day period will not allow them the time they need adequately to investigate the most heavily encrypted data. They have made it clear to me that the use of advanced encryption technology by those who pose a threat to law and order or the security of the country is becoming more widespread and is growing rapidly. Encryption is more pervasive, more complex and easier to use than ever before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_105">That poses a significant challenge to police and investigators on two fronts. First, it means that even sifting the evidence to identify which computers require specialist investigation and decryption usually&#151;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experts&#039; word&#151;takes a number of weeks. Each computer must be examined to assess what data can be easily gleaned and where heavyweight code-breaking is required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_106">Secondly, even after the protected data sources have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been identified, significant additional time may be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to decode potential evidence. NTAC has advised me that this is an extremely challenging and time-consuming task, running in the majority of the hardest cases into weeks at the very least, and often even into periods of months. Taking all this together, the technical judgment of the professionals is clear and simple. They need more time to be able to deal with such challenges. We must honour that.

I say with humility that I do not need to give advice on that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to, for example, the west Yorkshire force, because I believe it is committed to doing it, but my hon.

Those Acts contain many worthwhile provisions, but none of them prevented the atrocities of 7&nbsp;July, so let us not pretend that we can win the war on terror by passing every single law that the Government throw up.

It is right to point out that all those provisions were obtained only through parliamentary pressure from both sides of the House.

 The point was made best by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon.

I have been through Mr. Hayman&#039;s evidence in some detail. The only quantification concerns a fictional case, not actual cases that have been presented, or might have been presented, to the courts. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

We have heard his account of it, but the whole House knows the real reason. By yesterday, only a day after the Home Secretary signalled his desire to listen to the mood of the House, listening was off the agenda, because he had lost control of the matter.

 My conversations with the police have been in order to seek evidence to support any case. I will tell the hon.

The suspect who ran off to Algeria was released after two days. It was intimated that the evidence material to that case was found after a few weeks, not after 90&nbsp;days. On the decryption of hard disk data, we suggested using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which puts a four-year sentence on withholding decryption codes. We suggested increasing that sentence, and that does now appear in the Bill. Then the police said, &quot;If we charge them, we can&#039;t interview them&quot;, so we raised the possibility of interview after charge.

The Government must focus, as I have asked them to do probably a dozen times, on providing serious evidence, which we will consider seriously.

At no time in that period, when Labour Members&#039; attitudes were clearly based on conviction and principle, did anyone accuse them of being complacent or pathetic.

Our job is to balance that important task with other important considerations. In the modern world, this country is defined by its institutional history&#151;its history of liberty, judicial process, the presumption of innocence, the right not to be locked up without trial.

<a name="stpa_126">The Prime Minister is on the record as saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case for the extension to 90&nbsp;days is &quot;compelling&quot;. He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly believes that there is such a case, just as he believed in those famous weapons of mass destruction. However, the proven case for 90&nbsp;days, like that for the weapons, simply does not exist. I am willing to give way now to any hon. Member who can cite a single terrorist incident in this country that would have been averted by the 90-day proposal rather than by good police work or implementation of laws that are already on the statute book.

 We do not know, because it never happened. The right hon. Gentleman has suggested that arrests should be made later, following further surveillance and so on. If he had taken the trouble to speak to local police chiefs, as many of us have, they would have told him that this measure is about the prevention of terrorism, not its detection. Therefore, it is not always possible for the police to wait until they have all the evidence necessary to make an arrest if they need to make that arrest quickly. Does he agree that that is a fair and reasonable stance to take?

 It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman, who is the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney-General, appears to be making a case for internment.

It is the first time in my 22&nbsp;years in the House that a chief constable has ever contacted me to seek support for a particular clause in a Bill in favour of the police.

<a name="stpa_129">It will doubtless be argued that what the police want, the police should have.

<a name="51109-19_para3">

<br>&nbsp;<br>made &quot;no recommendation&quot; on the detention period. To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), let no one claim, either, that we need to bring our periods of detention into line with those of other countries. In Australia, where a murderous terrorist plot has just, mercifully, been foiled because of vigilant police action, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce debate about an extension from two days to 14&nbsp;days. Most of the other countries with similar judicial systems to ours have smaller, not greater, rights to detain without trial. On the evidence that we have, 90&nbsp;days is simply too long, and too long by an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_131">The relative leisure of the three-month time scale, compared with the present 14&nbsp;days&#151;or for that matter, 28&nbsp;days&#151;risks the imprisonment and consequent release without charge of innocent people. Those innocent people will be drawn disproportionately from one section of the community and there is a real risk in that community of a backlash on an unprecedented scale, not to mention the affront to justice that would be felt by all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_132">When this matter was raised with the Home Secretary, it was clearly a sore point, because he went into his high-decibel overdrive, as he sometimes does. He started talking about how the leaders of the community were entirely onside against terrorism. Of course they are. Of course the heads of the Muslim communities, in particular, are onside against terrorism. They fear this more than we do, I suspect. The problem that they face is the problem of radicalisation&#151;indeed, unknown radicalisation&#151;of very small but dangerous parts of their own community, involving young men in their community. We must not make those community leaders&#039; job more difficult, or, indeed, almost impossible.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="51109-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ben Wallace  (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b> 
 Does the shadow Home Secretary agree that the security services and the police forces are finding it incredibly hard to recruit employees from the ethnic and Muslim communities because of the isolation that they feel? Would not the 90-day provision increase that problem, rather than decrease it?

<p>
<a name="51109-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_133">It was clear from the beginning of this process that the majority of the British people actually favour 90&nbsp;days, and I think that we should recognise that. I have been accused of opportunism; it is an odd kind of opportunism that takes the unpopular side of the argument, but never mind. A large number of people favour 90&nbsp;days&#151;perhaps this is true in the Muslim community as well&#151;but they will do so only until the day it goes wrong, and we find that someone has been held for three months, lost his job, broken his family, yet comes out innocent. If he did not hate Britain when he went in, I suspect that he would have a grudge when he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came out. That is the situation that we have to look&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward to. In the aftermath of 7 July, I quite understand the imperative, but we must be absolutely balanced in the way we approach this issue, and think forward.

</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="51109-19_spnew16"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. On Second Reading, I said that I did not really see an argument to go beyond 14&nbsp;days, and one of the fears was that locking people up for a month is still harmful. The only reason that I would go to 28&nbsp;days is that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home Secretary has given an undertaking that the powers will be used extremely sparingly. The trouble with 90&nbsp;days is that even one mistake will be a disaster. The hon. Gentleman is right that it is a judgment call, but in the balance between liberty and security, this country should always err on the side of liberty.

 The hon. Gentleman talks about the need for solid evidence and most of us would agree with that. Already in our legal system, however, is a recognition that getting the necessary evidence is not as straightforward as we would like. For example, we know that only 1&nbsp;per cent. of people are convicted in child protection cases, but we also know that child abuse is widespread and a terrible thing. Our legal system deals with that by having common law family courts that are able, if necessary in the most extreme circumstances, to take children away from people who might harm them. We have a special system. Despite what the hon. Gentleman says about the need for evidence, the key is that we cannot always prove matters as simply or straightforwardly as we would like, even though we know that bad things are happening. Surely, terrorism provides a similar example: we know that terrible things can and may happen, so we have to ensure that our legal system can deal with them appropriately.

It will not have been lost on the House that on three occasions he gave no answer to that very straightforward question. I do not understand how the Lord Advocate can be asked for an opinion about the desirability of a uniform law to cover the whole of the UK without then being asked for a view on the issue of 90-day detentions.

I accept that that is difficult under the laws of evidence as they stand, but on the basis of my understanding of the law of England and Wales, I must say that it is not already impossible.

That sort of spin and overselling should give us pause for thought. In my view, and this was the point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), it seems likely that the only basis on which that evidence might be forthcoming would be if the suspect had been ground down in the course of the 90&nbsp;days, and that would constitute evidence that was unfairly obtained and which, as a result, would be inadmissible. That might leave us in a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position in which the only time a suspect spends in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custody is the 90&nbsp;days prior to charge. How does that help the fight against terrorism? In our view, the bulk of cases are already adequately dealt with under the 14-day provision, and that will be sufficient.

It is simply their best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professional estimate, and we must respect that. Indeed, the Home Secretary has said since last week that the 90-day figure is not crucial.

Many members of the security forces risked their lives to work within the law, and we did so because we believed that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathering evidence before arrest was the best way&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prevent and counter terrorism. Royal Ulster Constabulary officers and many other people in Northern Ireland learned that there are no shortcuts to counter-terrorism. One cannot wipe the slate clean or try to outmanoeuvre the terrorists in minutes or days, as we have seen in four days of debate on the Floor of the House. Have we forgotten the lessons that we learned in Malaya, Northern Ireland and even in Basra? Terrorism is defeated by winning hearts and minds, when the communities themselves stop people committing such acts. If the Government think that they will bring communities closer to the forces of law and order by incarcerating people for 90&nbsp;days without trial they are badly mistaken. It is from communities that we get informers and tip-offs, and it is from the communities that we recruit members of the police forces and the security services that, in the end, defeat terrorism.

The Prime Minister learned one lesson in Northern Ireland, which he has chosen to ignore, perhaps because of <i>The Sun</i>.

 My hon. Friend is making a superb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speech. I put it to him that the intervention by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hon Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McFadden), who will see the point if he reflects on it, was extremely injudicious.

 My hon. Friend is right. If we accept the preventive principle, where will we stop?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_191">Detention for 90&nbsp;days is an affront, and it will not cure the problem. Yesterday, I heard Commissioner Blair speak to the Press Gallery. Ironically, most of his speech was about communities&#151;how Operation Trident works with the communities in areas of inner-city London to defeat drug dealing and gang warfare&#151;but he chose to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disregard the importance of communities in solving terrorism.

<a name="51109-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_192">Counter-terrorism is about two things. First, it is about information and getting ahead of the terrorist cycle&#151;being there when terrorists are preparing and catching them red-handed. Secondly, it is about prevention, and if one risks people who will help&#151;informers&#151;one extends rather than defeats terrorism.

: In many ways, this debate is very sad. This Bill will have a marginal effect on our overall security and the balance sheet is depressing. The truth is that the Prime Minister and Ministers have expended more effort on winning the votes of MPs than they have on winning the hearts and minds of young Muslims, and more energy has been expended on getting MPs into the Lobby than has yet been spent drawing young people in our communities into dialogue and debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">The cross-party approach that was rightly struck in July is now self-evidently in tatters, with hon. Members being urged to vote for party advantage. The stakes have been raised to a height that is not justified by the intrinsic merits of the issue, the handling of which has damaged the fight against terrorism. That need not have happened.

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_194">We are here because no demand was made for the most basic explanation from the police about why 90&nbsp;days are needed. All that the Home Office had received in writing when the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister backed 90&nbsp;days was an ACPO press release and two sides of A4&nbsp;detailing two cases, neither of which made the case for 90&nbsp;days. There had been no proper police working group, no systematic assessment of their experience and international experience, no discussion of options, and no evaluation of the difference between 30, 60, 90&nbsp;or 120&nbsp;days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_195">The House deserves better than that. The lack of confidence and trust that has run through today&#039;s debate comes from that basic decision to back 90&nbsp;days before receiving a proper assessment. We are now in a difficult situation. My personal view, which will shape my vote, is that had that proper assessment been made it would have supported an extended period that went beyond 28&nbsp;days. I entirely agree with the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates), with whom we have discussed the matter. I will vote for 90&nbsp;days because the choice is between that and 28&nbsp;days, and I am sure that 28&nbsp;days is too short.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_196">In that case, why have I made such a critical speech? It is because the process matters. Casual decision making, poor-quality discussion and a lack of proper assessment 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51109-26_spnew11"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I wish to make a few simple points about the relationship between the Bill and the Human Rights Act 1998. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have all said that if necessary they would amend that legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_199">If ever there were a case for disapplying the Human Rights Act, especially article 5, to a measure, it is this Bill. The Joint Committee on Human Rights made it clear that there were serious problems with the Bill&#039;s compatibility with article 5. Lord Carlile made a similar point. We know that the Attorney-General has given an opinion. The Solicitor-General claims that he has not given an opinion. The Home Secretary clearly said in the House that there was an opinion before apologising for the fact that he should not have said that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_200">Unless the Human Rights Act is disapplied to the Bill, the debate will have been a waste of time because the Law Lords will apply it, thus preventing the measure from being compatible with it. When that happens, it will render the whole exercise a complete waste of time. We must disapply the Human Rights Act.

<p><a name="st_383"><a name="51109-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. It is only fair to the Minister that hon. Members leave the Chamber quietly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_384"><a name="51109-29_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I am only sorry that this debate is not as much of a draw as the main attraction earlier, but I will do my best to make it as interesting as possible. The amendments build on some of the concepts in the amendments tabled in Committee by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and his hon. Friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_205">As the House will recall, we had quite a lengthy debate in Committee on the issue of intent and, more particularly, how we ensure that the offence of encouragement to terrorism in clause 1&nbsp;of the Bill is workable&#151;which is what I said I wanted it to be&#151;but does not cast its net unduly wide. I undertook to examine that issue further because I wanted to ensure that we did not catch people who clearly were not in any way intending to encourage others to commit acts of terrorism. We have gone back to the drawing board and come up with a formulation that we hope meets those objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_206">The key amendment in this group is amendment No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34, which replaces clause 1(1). It provides that the offence in clause 1&nbsp;can be committed in only two circumstances. Both of those circumstances were in amendments that we discussed last week, so the concepts have already been properly explored. The first set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and intends it to be understood by 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 389</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>its audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. I do not think that anyone could object to that being a criminal offence, and we have put the word &quot;intends&quot; on the face of the Bill so there is complete clarity about the conduct that is meant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_207">The second set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and is reckless as to whether or not it is likely to be understood by his or her audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. Again, for clarity, we have put the word &quot;reckless&quot; on the face of the Bill, and that was a word drawn from Opposition amendments in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_208">We have also defined &quot;reckless&quot; for these purposes as being a case where the person could not reasonably have failed to have been aware of the consequences of his action. Again, I am sure that no one could object to this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provision. If an individual makes a statement encouraging others to commit an act of terrorism and could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely consequences of his actions, that should clearly be an offence.

<p><a name="st_385"><a name="51109-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I was grateful to the Home Secretary when he said that he would amend the original clause 1, because it was very badly drafted, but I have some concerns about the amendments. The definition of &quot;reckless&quot; is completely contrary to the definition of recklessness in the recent case of R <i>v</i>.

 As I continue, I hope that I will be able to convince the hon. Gentleman that the formulation that we have now covers intent and recklessness. It is important that we have an objective qualification of recklessness, but the words used raise the threshold and reverse the presumptions in the provisions. That series of tests should be sufficient to convince the hon. Gentleman that we have moved away significantly from the negligence test about which he and other hon. Members expressed concern in Committee. I hope to be able to convince him that the present formulation, which includes intent, recklessness and an objective assessment of recklessness, is sufficient to meet his concerns as well of those of the Government that we have a formulation that enables us to have some prosecutions of people who are clearly committing criminal acts.

 No, I hope that as I develop my argument the hon.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was concerned about negligence, and I shared those concerns, so we want a formulation that lifts the threshold but still enables us to prosecute people who,

<a name="51109-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_209">I want to amplify those comments. We cannot allow people who could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely consequences of their actions to get away with that simply by saying that they did not know what effect their actions might have. That would enable people who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have encouraged or glorified terrorism to get away scot-free, without paying the penalty for their actions, by insisting, regardless of all the evidence, that they did not know the possible consequences of their actions. A provision that they should be caught if they could not reasonably have failed to know the consequences of their statements is the right way to avoid that situation.

<a name="51109-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_210">I think that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieve) said that juries are capable of considering such issues in context, and the provisions deal with the context and circumstances. The court will take all that into account. If we have only a subjective test, people will be able to say that they did not realise what the effect of their actions would be. We would then find it incredibly difficult to prosecute people who genuinely were encouraging other people, indirectly, to commit terrorist acts.

<p><a name="st_389"><a name="51109-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Every day of the week, juries conclude that people are not telling the truth when they claim not to have foreseen a consequence of their acts; otherwise, there would be no convictions at all. Why should the Government tinker with a definition that was approved by the other place? The House of Lords said that the Government&#039;s definition of recklessness in the provision is unjust and should not continue.

<p><a name="st_390"><a name="51109-30_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 We explored those issues in detail in Committee and, as I told the hon. Gentleman then, if he looks at rape and other sexual offences, he will find that there is an objective test of recklessness. In rape, an offence is committed only if the person carrying out the act does not reasonably believe that the victim consents. A person charged with rape cannot say that they believed they had consent; they have to prove the objective test that their belief was reasonable. There is thus well-established law that it is perfectly proper to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have an objective test of recklessness and that we should not simply believe what a defendant says were the circumstances. The formulation of subsection (1A) moves things up a field, as the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge. We are not saying simply that there should be a reasonable belief, but that the defendant could not reasonably have failed to appreciate the effect of his words. We have genuinely tried to achieve a tight formulation that still enables us to prosecute. That is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly legitimate objective for the Government and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it, despite his forensic examination of the legal niceties. That is legitimate, because we are talking about criminal offences, but it is my job to try to ensure that we have law that is practical, effective, workable and takes us away from the negligence provision, which I acknowledge was a concern. I think we have a good formulation.

 As I say, we covered a lot of this ground in Committee, and I have genuinely tried to narrow the provision&#039;s ambit while trying to ensure that it is workable. I point out amendments Nos. 35, 41&nbsp;and 42&nbsp;to the hon. Gentleman. Again, they make an important clarification to the Bill. They make it clear that, for an offence to be committed, the audience has to understand that what is being said is an inducement for them and no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one else to commit terrorist acts. For example, no offence will be committed if a member of an audience at an academic lecture thinks, &quot;Well, I am not encouraged to commit terrorist acts, but I can quite imagine that, if this sentiment was expressed at a gathering of young Muslim men, it could have an encouraging effect on them.&quot; I think that that is implicit in the drafting, but those amendments make it absolutely explicit that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely effect must be on the people to whom the statement is addressed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that that is another attempt by the Government to try to narrow the provision&#039;s ambit and focus it on the mischief to which this part of the Bill is addressed: those who directly or indirectly incite people to commit acts of terrorism. I hope that he will give us credit for seeking to narrow the ambit of the offence in those terms.

The only example that I have felt comfortable giving is where someone says, &quot;Wasn&#039;t it a fantastic thing that happened on 7&nbsp;July?&quot; knowing that the likely effect is to encourage their audience to engage in acts of terrorism. We are genuinely trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aim this legislation at that kind of formulation, not at all the wider examples. Sometimes, the offence has been stretched beyond the realms of possibility, and we have genuinely tried to narrow it down to the mischief that we are trying to target.

 I do not think that that deals with the issue. I acknowledge that the Minister has worked hard to try to improve the Bill.

I repeat the point that was implicit in what&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshall-Andrews) said. When a statement is published, its audience is necessarily wider and larger than that for a statement that is not published. Unless a more reasonable amendment is agreed to, surely we could be considering a mad, neurotic, or frankly hypersensitive individual who could be influenced to behave in a particular way, although that individual might well have behaved in that way anyway.

 I do not propose to narrow the offence to the point at which it would become impossible to prosecute.

He raises the prospect of one person who might take a statement in such a completely unreasonable way. I have set out the fact that there will be seven hurdles before there is a prosecution, so the likelihood of a prosecution for a criminal offence in such circumstances would be infinitesimal. It is not the business of the House to make legislation in such terms. There is a broad and reasonable case for our formulation.

 I remember our discussion in Committee. I think that the response that I gave to the hon. Gentleman then still stands. If an actual danger had to be proved, it would set the threshold too high and the prosecution would find it difficult to bring a case. We are trying to get the balance right so that we can use the legislation to prosecute people who are causing a real problem in this country, yet ensure that we do not inadvertently bring people into the net who quite properly should be allowed to say the things that they want to say. That is at the heart of the Bill&#151;we are trying to get the right balance between the correct security measures and the protection of liberty and freedom of speech. I am trying to draw that balance correctly without erring in favour of either priority. I do not want the Bill to be a piece of legislation under which people can still say those things with impunity because they are clever enough to formulate their words knowing that they will have an effect on other people but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they will escape prosecution themselves. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the interests of anyone in this country to allow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that situation to continue. Most of the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government amendments in this group are consequential, as the meat of the argument is contained in Government amendment No. 34. We have found a formulation that works, and I hope that it will be accepted by all hon. Members.

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">Amendments Nos. 19, 14, 2&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;would all have the same effect. Instead of allowing a recklessness test that would cover individuals who could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely effect of their actions, they limit the offence to people who intend or can be shown to have known the likely effect of their actions. As I said, that recklessness test is subjective, as opposed to objective. I have received advice that the formulation in subsection (1A) of amendment No. 34&nbsp;is drafted to reflect the Caldwell case. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) will know more about that than I do, but it is right to include such a test. If we simply used a subjective test, individuals who brazenly encourage terrorism would be able to argue, despite the fact that they could not reasonably have failed to understand the likely effect of their comments, that they did not foresee the risk that members of their audience would be encouraged to commit acts of terrorism. The difference between that subjective test and the test in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government amendments is crucial to the success of the legislation. Without an objective test, people could simply say that they did not intend their words to have a particular effect on their audience, and that they did not have any idea what would happen. We all know of individuals who have made such statements, but we have found it impossible to prosecute them. We want to make sure, however, that we can do so in future.

 As I said in my intervention on the Minister, I wanted to welcome the Home Secretary&#039;s conversion on clause 1&nbsp;in the light of last week&#039;s debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, when I saw him on Monday I was overwhelmingly grateful because during a wide-ranging discussion he accepted the argument that the drafting of clause 1&nbsp;was too loose. It took us some time to tease out the implications last week, but the upshot of our debate was that the offence could be committed as a result of negligence. Mindful of the amendment that I tabled last week, the Home Secretary accepted that the offence should only be committed intentionally or recklessly. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was pleased with that result, and I thanked the Home Secretary. However, when I looked at the draft of amendment No. 34, I discovered that it reads very well only until the end of subsection (1). Subsection (1A) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;For the purposes of this section the cases in which a person is to be taken as reckless as to whether a statement is likely to be understood as mentioned in subsection (A1) include any case in which he could not reasonably have failed to be aware of that likelihood.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_217">I always understood that in the normal test of recklessness, the word was to be given its ordinary English meaning. The problem has arisen because for a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period of 20&nbsp;years, which I suspect was an aberration, as a result of the Court of Appeal judgment in Caldwell, it became possible for a person to act recklessly even though he never foresaw the risk of something occurring. In a sense it was an objective test. The jury could say, &quot;We accept entirely that in doing what you did, you never foresaw the risk of something occurring, but we can say that you are guilty nevertheless, because when we look at the facts, we think we would have foreseen that the risk would occur.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_218">That decision stood until last year, when the House of Lords examined it again in a case called R <i>v.</i> G. As the Minister knows, before the House of Lords looked at it, the test in Caldwell had come in for massive criticism over the years from both academic and judicial authorities. In R <i>v.</i> G the House of Lords looked at the entirety of it, and the upshot was that the authority of Caldwell was wholly overruled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_219">It is worth considering the reasons why the Law Lords decided to do that. They stated, first, that while the most obvious culpable state of mind was an intention to cause an injurious result, knowing disregard of an appreciated and unacceptable risk of causing an injurious result or a deliberate closing of the mind to such a risk would be readily accepted as culpable also. But it was not clearly blameworthy to do something involving a risk of injury to another if, for reasons other than self-induced intoxication, one genuinely did not perceive the risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_220">Secondly, the Caldwell formulation was capable of leading to injustice. Thirdly, the criticism of Caldwell by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;academics, judges and practitioners was not to be

<br>&nbsp;<br>ignored, and fourthly, it was clear that the majority&#039;s interpretation of &quot;reckless&quot; in Caldwell had been a misinterpretation of Parliament&#039;s intention in the Bill at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that time, which was to leave the essential law unchanged. Therefore the test of recklessness should return to what it had been historically for many years before the Caldwell decision took place.
</p>

<a name="51109-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_221">I have a slight criticism, which is that it took me a phone call to the draftsmen in the Home Secretary&#039;s office to get finally an admission that it was true that they had put in not the current test of recklessness, but the old test of recklessness.

The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason we chose to do it was the nature of rape as an offence, its seriousness and all the surrounding circumstances. To equate rape with words used by an individual seems a very poor comparison. The equation given in the discussion in R <i>v.</i> G refers to criminal damage, which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good example of the narrow boundary between negligence and recklessness.

<a name="stpa_223">Where somebody is to be criminalised for something they said, on the basis that it might indirectly incite terrorism, we would be in danger of perpetrating injustice unless we said that the test that a jury has to apply is the current test, not the old test.

 I accept that point, but the Minister seemed to hint that if we introduce a recklessness test, as defined by the House of Lords in R <i>v.</i> G, it would present insurmountable obstacles to prosecution and that all sorts of unsavoury people who had said things that they should not would get off. I do not accept that argument: when a defendant goes into the witness box and says, &quot;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acted honestly when I walked out of the shop with the goods under my arm. It was all a mistake,&quot; juries have no difficulty in examining the circumstances and saying, &quot;Actually, you were dishonest, and that is a crime of specific intent.&quot;

<a name="stpa_227">One can still be convicted under the subjective test. All that needs to be shown is that the defendant must have foreseen a risk in the course of carrying out a particular activity. It is even easier to convict under the subjective test, so I do not accept that it will lead to people whom the Government want to criminalise being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquitted. Consider the example of a foreign preacher who does not know much about life in Britain and who has come over on a visit. If he said, first, &quot;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never intended to incite terrorism,&quot; and secondly, &quot;I never foresaw that there was a risk of inciting terrorism,&quot; the jury could say, &quot;Although we see those words as incitement, we understand that he is telling the truth.&quot; The question is this: if the person is telling the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth about it, is it right that he should be landed with a criminal conviction?

 The Government are developing a prodigious talent for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. They undertake a listening exercise, and agree that something is wrong with their Bill and try to find a way to resolve it. They go almost all the way towards securing the support of Members in all parts of the House, then they ruin it by quite extraordinary drafting. That is very regrettable. I would have hoped that last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week&#039;s debate, which was perhaps in rather more high-flown terms than we are mustering this evening, might have persuaded the Government that they had to do the job properly. The result of last week&#039;s vote might have indicated that were they not to do it properly, the Bill was highly unlikely to survive in this House or another place without further amendment. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regret that the Minister has come to the House with a rather unacceptable amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_234">I want to return to the origins of what the Government are trying to do, with which I have a number of problems. First, I do not understand why the current incitement offences on the statute book are insufficient to deal with the issue, apart from the fact that they are not prosecuted. Many of us find ourselves increasingly impatient because the police and prosecuting authorities do not use the offences already there to deal with the problem. Undoubtedly, incitement offences could have been used on occasions against prominent individuals who would be caught by the prospective legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_235">Secondly, as the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) pointed out, incitement is the correct term in the context of such an offence, rather than encouragement. It worries me that such a mild term is used in a way that is open to all sorts of constructions, which we have yet to learn, as the matter has not been before a court. I also worry because we have still not secured&#151;and I do not think that we will do so this evening&#151;an adequate definition of terrorism and terrorist offences. Potentially, therefore, an offence can be drawn from a much wider field.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 402</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>applies two conflicting tests&#151;the objective test of recklessness and the subjective test of recklessness&#151;in relation to the same clause. It is recklessness of a high degree to consider what the court has expressly rejected and then to introduce that in new legislation, as though nothing had happened and it had never been considered. That might be part of the Prime Minister&#039;s declared policy, as expressed at Prime Minister&#039;s questions today&#151;that he would prefer to listen to police officers than Law Lords. I am sure that that will endear him to those who will consider this Bill later. Perhaps he believes that Law Lords simply do not understand law in the same way as police officers do. I must, however, counsel Home Officer Ministers that that is not a sensible way of approaching the issue.

<p><a name="st_431"><a name="51109-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 There are a number of points to make. First, we are dealing with a constraint on freedom of speech, which does not apply to those other offences. In the sexual offences legislation, we are dealing with a specific issue of an interaction between two people in which the critical issue is consent, and in which one person&#039;s word will often be used against another&#039;s, and in that instance it is absolutely appropriate for the jury to come to a view on an objective test. I really do not understand how the Minister can come to the Dispatch Box, apparently briefed by her civil servants, to proclaim proudly that what she hopes to enact is that which is within the Caldwell case, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has described as something that leads to injustice.

<a name="stpa_237">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made an interesting point about what a cleric newly arrived in the country might understand the clause to mean.

It also occurred to me to wonder&#151;this too is an aside&#151;what the position of an interpreter would be. Does an interpreter publish the words that he is asked to interpret?

<a name="stpa_244">I seek from the hon. Gentleman at this late hour some acknowledgement that that formulation constitutes a higher threshold than the previous one, and that the Government have therefore moved significantly on this issue to try to ensure that recklessness is included, but that the realistic prospect of successful prosecutions remains. The hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 405</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>this formulation is different and is not simply an objective recklessness test, because it also raises the threshold test.
</p>








<p><a name="st_443"><a name="51109-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I did acknowledge earlier, I hope, that there appears to be some slight difference between the test in amendment No. 34&nbsp;and the test in the Bill as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originally drafted. Certainly, if I may say so, this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provision is much clearer, which is in itself a commendation. I would also like to put it on the record that I do not believe that either the Home Secretary or the Minister tried to deceive me; I think that there was a genuine misunderstanding between us as to what the Home Secretary was actually conceding. I also hope that the Minister will understand the reasons why, when I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was talking about recklessness, I meant the common-or-garden English term as interpreted currently by the courts. It is for that reason, and because it will not do any harm to the successful prosecution of offences, that I prefer my version in amendment No. 19. With some regret, therefore, I have to vote against amendment No. 34.

<p><a name="st_444"><a name="51109-35_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s position, in that he is struggling with modern drafting. All I can say is that our formulation meets the objectives that we want to achieve&#151;to make practical, effective and workable legislation. Who knows? In time to come, perhaps even the hon. Gentleman will be a little more comfortable with some modern attempts at the drafting. I commend the amendment to the House.

 These amendments address the important issue of the encouragement of terrorism. As the Minister will know, we have supported provisions on indirect incitement, even if we have had differences of opinion on whether it can be committed recklessly and what the definition of &quot;recklessness&quot; should be.

<p><a name="st_453"><a name="51109-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The concept of unlawful glorification is alien to our law. On the whole, if people wish to go out and glorify something, they are free to do so. Indeed, as the House will be aware, the origin of the provisions seems to have come from a decision by the Government at some time in the summer that they wanted to make glorification a separate offence. That attracted much adverse public comment and, as a result, the Government decided shortly before the Bill was published&#151;a previous draft Bill contained the separate offence of glorification&#151;to collapse glorification into the single offence of encouragement of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_254">The impression that was given at the time was that glorification had disappeared, but unfortunately it has not. It is present as a distinct subsection in clause 1. It is difficult to understand why it has been left there. I can easily think of examples of someone glorifying something that might amount to an incitement to commit a terrorist offence, because the words of glorification could clearly relate to incitement. But if there is indeed no incitement, to identify glorification as a form of incitement and as something that is likely to be understood by members of the public

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision would apply not only to Guy Fawkes and Robin Hood but, at least in theory, to Gerry Adams? There is a difficulty for the Prime Minister and the Government, as it is unclear that the Prime Minister would not fall foul of his own law, given the fact that he has often praised, and expressed admiration for, the contribution of a man who is unquestionably a former terrorist. The courts could have a field day with the Prime Minister, who could end up behind bars as a result of the provisions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_455"><a name="51109-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a possible unintended consequence. In fairness to the Prime Minister, I do not think that he has ever commended Mr. Adams for having committed terrorist offences. He has commended him for being a reformed terrorist, which is a slightly different concept&#151;if indeed, Mr. Adams is reformed, a subject on which there is always a certain amount of speculation, given his membership, certainly in the past, of the IRA army council.

 Che Guevara was a student pin-up when I was at university; indeed, there were Che Guevara societies. There were commemorations of what people claimed was his heroic death and life, and of the fact that he was a freedom fighter or, as some would say, a terrorist, using force to combat what were regarded as capitalist and tyrannical regimes. There is no doubt that if someone were to glorify the activities of Che Guevara at a meeting where

 The hon. Lady makes a serious point. During the war, the Germans described those who were resisting them as terrorists. Indeed, that issue was not necessarily free of difficulty. I am half French by background. General de Gaulle had concerns that the violence being used by the resistance in France should be proportionate and focused, otherwise those involved could be reasonably classified as behaving as terrorists. Indeed, he tried to moderate them by saying that they should use complete force only when the liberation was at hand and it could be shown to produce a military goal. I simply cite that as an example of the very difficult grey areas that we must consider.

 We still have a realistic case in Northern Ireland. A significant section of the community no doubt will hold commemorations to glorify the actions of the men of 1916. Clearly, that has a resonance with what is going on in our streets and towns in Northern Ireland today. Equally, others will celebrate the work of Carson and his volunteers, who defied Parliament and the Government. No doubt, that will have a resonance among many people in the streets and towns of Northern Ireland as well. The only defence that the Government have is that the DPP might not take a case to court in those circumstances. That is hardly a safe way for us to proceed, is it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_461"><a name="51109-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Of course, the commemorations of the Easter rising that are due to take place next year, sanctioned by the Irish Government, are undoubtedly a glorification of the actions of people who were regarded at the time as terrorist and, indeed, treated as terrorists during the rising by a large section of the Irish population. That is a simple truth. Subsequently, partly because of the folly of the British Government, those involved were turned into heroes, but that is not how they were viewed when the rising occurred. That absolutely epitomises the nature of the problem that we face.

Glorification as an offence has no place in our law. I do not want to take up the House&#039;s time tonight&#151;this issue has been rehearsed before&#151;but the simple and easy solution is for Parliament and hon.

I hope that the House, which has shown its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;independence today, will simply say that, of course we support the offence of indirect incitement to terrorism, but this glorification notion is a muddle. It will not help to prosecute those who need to be prosecuted. It will cause endless bother and send out a slightly tacky signal about how Parliament and the Government view individuals who express opinions in a sense about past events. We can deal with clerics, British National party leaders and others who may wish to invoke terrorism, violence or whatever they wish to do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quite easily by keeping the Bill while deleting subsection (2) and the related subsections.

 I entirely concur with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). There is no place for the offence on our statute book.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_262">Let us make no bones about this. The provision is clearly a vestigial remnant of an idea that must have sounded good on the day on which it was put forward by the Prime Minister, but that has been expunged elsewhere. The fragment of the Prime Minister&#039;s idea remains in the Bill, but I hope that we will clear it up today, which is why we have put our names to amendment No. 3.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_263">The offence might have looked appropriate in 17th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century legislation because it is the sort of thing that Parliament passed at that time. Parliament could afford a little imprecision in its terms in those days because it knew that it had a compliant judiciary that could be relied on to do the Executive&#039;s bidding. I can imagine some of my ancestors being prosecuted for glorification. They were transported as slaves after the rebellion in 1685. We had a wonderful judicial system in those days, as defendants were advised not to plead their innocence before the court because that would waste the court&#039;s time. We have moved on a long way since then.

<a name="stpa_264">The provision is drafted in such imprecise terms that it undermines the Government&#039;s rational case behind other measures in the Bill. Its chilling effect is that it has the capacity to worry a great many people who will never be prosecuted under the Bill. We have considered such an effect when we have dealt with other legislation. The fact that it might be possible to bring a perverse prosecution under the Bill could mean that people would think it better not to say what they had intended to say. However, that would lead to the serious curtailment of our free speech.

The provision will be struck out there, but as I have said on many occasions, it would be preferable for the elected House to do its job. Ministers claim to be looking for consensus on the Bill, but they know that there is a general consensus on the proper requirement to deal with people who incite terrorism in this country. They should listen to others and acknowledge that the provision will not achieve what they want.

Of course, such prosecutions would not be brought. When we are legislating in the House, particularly when we introduce new offences that curtail the power of free speech, which some of us hold dear, we must be extremely careful and precise. We should know what is intended in the measures, and if we use hyperbole to illustrate our case we should do so with the intention of bringing the House to its senses so that it can understand the consequences of ill-considered legislation.

<a name="stpa_268">My hon. Friends and I have tabled amendments Nos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31 and 30, which deal with the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; in clause 21. I urge the Government to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reconsider its inclusion, because we have terms to proscribe organisations under the Terrorism Act 2000. Only a few weeks ago, the Minister submitted to the House a further list of organisations that should be proscribed under that Act. The House agreed with her, albeit with concerns about one organisation. Generally, however, it was happy to accede to her view that those organisations should be proscribed under that legislation. If she is going to extend the terms of proscription to include the vague concept of glorification, a vast number of organisations around the world could be caught. Some of those organisations may have had a presence in this country, but that will not be the case for many of them, as we learned from the order that was laid before the House only a few weeks ago.
</p>

<p>

: Is there not an important reason why this is not just a passing thing that can be ignored? The difficulty with effectively buying prosecution in this way is that we create circumstances in which political decisions appear to be made. Of course, that is not the case, but that is how it appears to other countries when they see that one organisation is subject to the law, but another is not. That is very dangerous: not only does it bring pressure to bear on the Government but it makes people feel hard done by if their organisation is dealt with in that way, while another is not.

 The right hon. Gentleman is right, and the provision will prejudice British interests in future. People whom we call terrorists today may be freedom fighters tomorrow and the Government the day after. The measure therefore puts the country in the difficult position of receiving requests that we cannot possibly fulfil in the interests of justice, but with which diplomatic pressure and the immediate national interest will urge us to comply. That puts the Home Secretary in a difficult position for the sake of a definition that is not worth the candle. If terrorist and other organisations are covered by the wide definition of support for terrorist activities in the Terrorism Act 2000, it is right that we should proscribe their activities in this country. However, we do not need the flimsy excuse of glorification to extend those provisions, because the House has shown that it is prepared to act responsibly when presented with information by the Government, even when, for reasons of security and the need to protect the provenance of the information, it cannot be given the full facts. The House has been prepared to take on trust the advice of this very Minister in extending the provisions of the Terrorism Act. That trust may be strained if we accept the provision, as the grounds for proscription would then be that much weaker. That worries me because it is a serious step that the Government are taking in these instances, and we wish to protect the strength of the arguments behind it.

<a name="stpa_276">I shall move on to one of the more tricky examples. If someone in the Caucasus were to praise the Chechen rebels and their struggle against the Russian authorities, they would arguably commit an offence, although they might not appreciate it at the time. They would have praised the commission of an act, because they would undoubtedly have praised people who had participated in terrorism in circumstances in which it might be inferred that they were encouraging other people to join. It is almost certain that they would not have the first idea that they were breaking British law or were making themselves liable to conviction in a British court when they stood up to speak in some far-away town in the Caucasus and became carried away with their own version of patriotic fervour.

<a name="stpa_278">A Bill that seeks to define the encouragement of terrorism in such general and uncertain terms should not be allowed to create an offence of worldwide application.

 The word &quot;glorification&quot; is pretty unusual. Its only regular use is in the formularies of the Church of England and the Church of Rome, where it has a particular religious meaning.

<br>&nbsp;<br>seeming ability of clerics from various organisations, among others, to talk in a hot-headed manner and thereby seemingly encourage people to accept actions that are manifestly dangerous and unpleasant. The Minister needs to be very careful about things that are left over and no longer of any use. The appendix, for example, is a particularly nasty part of the body in the sense that it causes a great deal of harm to no discernible good effect. That is because it is left over from a use that it once had but does not have any more. It would have been much better had the Almighty so organised the process of evolution that we got rid of it altogether. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspect that that is precisely what we should be doing with this part of the clause.

<p><a name="st_477"><a name="51109-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend referred to ecclesiastical language at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning of his speech. Is not it dangerous, when those who mean us harm already try to use religion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inappropriately to justify their actions, to use terminology in our legislation that would perhaps enable them to do that more, rather than less, easily?
</p>








<p><a name="st_478"><a name="51109-39_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has put his finger on the reason for my unhappiness with the word. He is right that, if ever there were a subject about which our language should be clinical and avoid overtones that might have the effect that he described, we are considering it. He is right to point out why it is so dangerous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_284">However, it is also dangerous for another reason. If glorification were some residuum of a law that was passed in 1734&nbsp;and somebody suggested that it would be a good idea to get rid of it because it was no longer useful or might be used badly, the answer would be the same as the one the Minister has given in previous debates: it is perfectly safe because nobody could use it and there is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always the gate of the Director of Public Prosecutions and others. That works if it applies to a provision that has been in desuetude for a long time. However, we are proposing a new provision. It would be difficult in 2006&nbsp;to say that we did not mean legislation of 2005&nbsp;to apply to a case. We could not claim that it was a jeu d&#039;esprit or a little twiddle in an otherwise dull Bill. It 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 420</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would be hard to argue that. The intention to include it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in such a serious measure is therefore genuinely problematic for the Government. Let me define the three specific problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_285">First, the Government should not underestimate the extent to which the Director of Public Prosecutions can be perceived by those who do not understand the process as a political figure. We all have experience in our lifetimes of examples when, because the Director of Public Prosecutions has or has not allowed something, it has been suggested that Ministers have leaned on him. That is a mean, unpleasant and unfair suggestion but it should nevertheless be avoided rather than encouraged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_286">Secondly, the provision becomes an even greater danger if extra-territoriality&#151;I am delicate in my references because of your earlier, proper restrictions, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;turns out to apply to the extent that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieve) suggests. Those who may wish to put pressure on the Government are even less likely to understand the independent position of the Director of Public Prosecutions if they are from countries where such an independent position does not exist. The example given by my right hon. and learned Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) of the Russians and the Chechen rebels, or my own example of the Rwandan authorities and the Belgian priest, would in those circumstances become even more germane. The Government would be likely to have pressure brought to bear on them by people who were not going to take seriously the fact that this great independent figure, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of Public Prosecutions&#151;so unknown anywhere else&#151;was the gate that had prevented a prosecution from taking place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_287">Thirdly, I beg the Minister to recognise that this legislation as a whole has struck a very sharp note for many people among the ethnic minorities in this country. The Home Secretary was utterly right, in answering an earlier intervention, to point out the enormous support for law and order and the opposition to terrorism that we find among the Muslim community. Unfortunately, he was not answering the question that he had been asked. It was a very good answer to a question on that subject, but that was not the question that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) had asked him. I am not going to stray from the subject of glorification, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_479"><a name="51109-39_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>

<a name="51109-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_288">I was trying to say that what was true in that discussion becomes germane when we think of glorification. I cannot believe that a simple explanation or understanding of the word &quot;glorification&quot; would be universal among the Muslim community. It might be, among some people, but that would be unusual. I do not know what its translation into the various languages involved would be, and it would be improper to refer to them in the House in any case. However, glorification is a concept that is not easy to pass around between those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 421</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who have lived all their lives knowing it in its ecclesiastical context, and far more so for those who have had no such knowledge. There is a real problem that glorification could easily be misinterpreted by those in the ethnic community when they came to explain to their friends what the word meant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_289">This is one of the most dangerous parts of the Bill. If the word &quot;glorification&quot; were misinterpreted by some, it could lead to people expecting a prosecution, because of the way in which they had interpreted it, only to have that expectation dashed because this curious figure, the Director of Public Prosecutions, had said, &quot;No, this is the sort of glorification that you can go in for. There are other sorts that you cannot go in for.&quot; The prosecution would therefore be prevented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_290">The whole of the Bill has been overshadowed by the misinterpretation of many of the Government&#039;s views. There is so much misinformation out there, and if we consider that alongside our discussions of other Bills&#151;which we shall no doubt discuss again here&#151;we see too many opportunities for misunderstanding being opened up among the minorities in this country. Clarity and sharpness in the language that we use is absolutely essential, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) so clearly pointed out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_291">I turn now to the breadth of the circumstances in which the concept of glorification could be used. Unlike some of her colleagues, the Minister is not someone who eschews history. There is a tendency on the Labour Benches to talk as though nothing that happened before last week actually counts or has any real reference to today. I am one of those who thinks that if everyone learned a bit more history, they would have a bit more humility about the excellence of today&#039;s ideas. History is important, and many of us like to be pretty biased about our history. I am pretty biased against Carson, and pretty much in favour of a number of those people whom I would see as freedom fighters in earlier years in Ireland. I have a pretty clear view of that, and history is made much more interesting if one takes sides in relation to it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_292">I have therefore been guilty of an offence under the Bill over many years, although I hope that the DPP will not enforce it against me. In my enthusiastic pursuit of history, I have glorified a number of people who, in fighting for freedom, behaved in a way to which we would probably object today, largely because we live in a democracy and there are alternative ways of putting one&#039;s case forward. One of the things that the Government have found so difficult throughout consideration of the Bill has been to understand that in many cases people have had to take action in a way that has meant the loss of life, because there was no other way of righting terrible wrong. In such cases, the fault lies with the system and the Government, rather than with those who took up arms to uphold such a right.

When I say that I think this or that, I must ask whether I think it in relation to me. Earlier, many of us voted against the 90&nbsp;days. In doing so, I was not thinking of people a long way away but of what I would think, or of what my children would think, if they were arrested and locked up for 90&nbsp;days.

I am sure that that will not be the case in the classroom or the local authority, but I warn the Minister that the BBC and organisations that deal with the national press are all too likely to say, &quot;I think this may be a bit dangerous. Let&#039;s not do it quite like that.&quot; Our experience of people allowing the public to see what an abortion is actually like&#151;which is not glorification&#151;shows what happens if organisations such as the BBC and ITV are allowed to control the expression of powerful feelings and emotions more than is absolutely necessary.

The speaker might notice them coming from the local mosque; he might see them gathering around his soapbox on the corner of Hyde park.

There is a big difference, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gummer) raised the fundamental issue about the clause when he asked what sort of action would be covered by the word &quot;glorification&quot; that would not be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covered by &quot;encouragement&quot; yet still attract punishment under the criminal law.

<p>

<a name="stpa_308">My second concern has to do with the points raised already about the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand the Government&#039;s argument that there is no need to worry about the clause because, although it may be completely inappropriate in all sorts of circumstances, the DPP will put his foot down and prevent it from being used. That seems a profoundly unfortunate position for a Government to be in when proposing a clause to be part of the criminal law. It may be that the DPP currently in office will be able to protect us from all the different situations in which a glorification charge would be inappropriate. It may also be that the next three or four holders of the office will do so. Surely, however, we in this House must make law that will stand as good law, and not simply as law that needs to be propped up by the DPP, or, worse, law from which the DPP needs to protect us. It is fundamentally unsatisfactory to propose legislation that would have that effect.

As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal said, the concept of glorification&#151;indeed, the term itself&#151;does not currently form part of the criminal law. It seems to me that there is good reason for that: it is too broad, too ephemeral and too difficult to define, and if that is so, the fact that it has no place in the criminal law is frankly because it deserves no place there. It will create difficulties in the future. I ask the Government to reconsider that part of this clause.

It is important to include reference to glorification for the very reason that it is a new concept to our courts and, therefore, we need to provide the courts with a guide to the kind of behaviour that we are trying to ensure is covered through the direct and indirect incitement provision.

 We debated that point at great length in Committee and we went through all the different examples. The glorification part of this offence also has to fulfil the other provisions of clause 1. That means that there has to be intent, or recklessness, or the objective definition of recklessness. A statement also has to be one that encourages terrorism and encourages people to emulate such behaviour. The offence contains a series of different elements that have to be completed before there is any prospect of a prosecution.

Someone would have to condone or glorify terrorism in such a way that the persons hearing his statement would be encouraged to commit an act of terrorism or emulate that behaviour. It is not simply glorification or condoning that form the offence, because there is the second limb of the likely effect on the audience and what it would be encouraged to do.

Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) is asking whether I can pick and choose between regimes or perhaps between a good terrorist and a bad terrorist, I repeat that it is wrong for people to encourage others to undertake terrorist acts. As I have said, it is a slippery slope&#151;

 I wholeheartedly welcome the commitment made by the Home Secretary today to refer the thorny issue of the definition of terrorism to Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlile and to ask him to report to the House within a year. That issue has exercised many of us, and it is a very difficult one to get right. I cannot think of anyone better than the noble lord, given his track record, to report to us. I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend and to the Home Secretary for recognising that concern and for at least giving us a possible way forward.

<p><a name="st_525"><a name="51109-43_spnew7"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that contribution. He will know that we have put a copy of the letter from the Home Secretary to him in the Library. The letter sets out the fact that there will be consultation with those in the House who can make a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relevant contribution, such as Chairs of Select Committees and no doubt other hon. Members who will want to get involved in the review process. That will be a practical way of reviewing the legislation&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<br>&nbsp;<br>House of Commons to get involved in making such statements. On reflection, do we want to get into the business of encouraging people to carry out violent acts against other individuals? There might be circumstances in which we can have that debate. Our legislation is focused on situations in which individuals either deliberately or recklessly encourage people&#151;especially our young people in this country, who can be vulnerable to being drawn into extremism&#151;to engage in terrorist acts. There is a real danger of that in this country given the new threat of international terrorism that is facing us all. It is not just a threat; I remind the House of what has happened in this country. We face a serious situation.

 I was going to address the points made by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal and the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para2">
<a name="stpa_324">I do not think that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe is in the Chamber, but it was good that he popped in to see us. He will know that amendment No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48 is an attempt to narrow the extra-territorial jurisdiction. The measures in clause 1 that we are discussing would apply only to convention offences because if we are to be able to ratify international conventions on the matter and comply with our international obligations, we have to ensure that there is extra-territorial jurisdiction. Other states will be doing exactly that, too. There are circumstances in which we refuse to extradite people to states in which offences take place, such as for human rights reasons. We thus must have the extra-territorial jurisdiction to allow us to carry out a prosecution here for an offence on which we are unwilling to extradite for good reasons. We have tabled further amendments on extra-territorial jurisdiction to narrow its reach as an attempt to address genuine concerns that were raised about the worldwide jurisdiction of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para3">
<a name="stpa_325">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heath) talked about pressure from other Governments and raised the question of the glorification of proscription offences in clause 21. We will make a proper and full assessment of organisations, without any preconceptions, to examine the criteria that apply to proscription. We will then reach a proper view on the basis of the evidence. Clause 21 addresses the fact that promoting or encouraging terrorism will include glorification. It is proper for us to say that if organisations glorify terrorism, they should not operate in this country and draw young people into extremism.

<a name="time_41">
<a name="51109-44_time4"><h5>8.32&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_545"><a name="51109-44_spnew5"><b> Helen Jones  (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b> 
 After the excitements of today, my hon. Friend the Minister and I come along like sweepers-up after the Lord Mayor&#039;s procession. I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the closure of the Bruche police training centre and its effect not only on the people who work there but on those who live in the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para5">
<a name="stpa_337">The training centre at Bruche has been a feature of Warrington life for a good many years. It provides the residential stage 2&nbsp;of foundation training for probationary officers. It is a large site that caters for the needs of several police forces and employs, I believe, 60&nbsp;people directly, with about 55&nbsp;working for contractors. I say, &quot;I believe&quot;, because it has proved extremely difficult to get accurate information from Centrex on such matters. There are also 70&nbsp;police officers stationed there, as well as about 10&nbsp;security staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para6">
<a name="stpa_338">Because of the position of the site in the midst of local housing, the prospect of its closing became a matter of concern to staff and to people in the area when it appeared that changes to police training meant that recruits would no longer be sent for residential training at regional centres. However, it has proved extremely difficult in the run-up to the announcement of closure to get accurate information about what Centrex plans to do. I had raised the matter on several occasions, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverted to it with a number of parliamentary questions, which I tabled in July last year because the staff from the centre had approached me, greatly concerned about their future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para7">
<a name="stpa_339">Unfortunately, answer came there none from the Home Office. I wrote again in August and, after much to-ing and fro-ing, I received a reply on 18&nbsp;November. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;It has not proved possible to respond to my hon. Friend in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time available before Prorogation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 18&nbsp;November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 2080W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para8">
<a name="stpa_340">That is extraordinary. If the Home Office cannot answer a simple question in more than four months, I worry about the rest of its work. On 26&nbsp;November that year, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received a letter from my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, in which she apologised for the delay and said that the Home Office had lost sight of the questions over the summer months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para9">
<a name="stpa_341">The letter raised more questions than it answered, however. It said that the matter had been given detailed consideration over the summer. If that was true, I do not understand why I did not receive an answer to my question in November. The letter was unenlightening in other respects. It said that Centrex had been discussing what should happen to police training with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and other stakeholders. I am never sure what &quot;stakeholder&quot; means. It is one of those words that, like some of Lewis Carroll&#039;s verse, means whatever one wants it to mean. The letter mentioned neither the trade unions at the centre nor the staff. They were not mentioned in a parliamentary answer that I received later that month.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 441</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para10">
<a name="stpa_342">I was approached again by the staff, who were concerned that they could not get information about what was happening. I tabled another question to ask who had been involved in the meetings and what options for the future of the centre had been discussed. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be pleased to hear that the Home Office answered that. I suppose that that is a step in the right direction. However, I was not much further enlightened because, again, there was no mention of what was happening or of any negotiations with the staff. That is unacceptable. The staff have families to keep and bills to pay, just like the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para11">
<a name="stpa_343">I know that the Home Office will say that that was the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility of Centrex, but it cannot be shrugged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off in that way because, after all, Centrex is a non-departmental public body which manages public assets and has strong links to the Home Office. If no one at the Home Office asked what steps were being taken to consult and inform staff, they should have done so. They should be reminded that we are in the 21st century with a Labour Government, and it is unacceptable to treat people in that way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para12">
<a name="stpa_344">The failure of Centrex to be open about what was happening caused a great deal of consternation in the local area. The centre is set in the middle of a lot of local housing. Rumours circulated about what would happen to it. That allowed some evil-minded people to spread the rumour that it would be turned into an asylum centre. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety quashed that rumour in a letter to me on 13&nbsp;July this year. However, the anxieties remain and they need to be tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para13">
<a name="stpa_345">Not only was Centrex less than open about its plans, it sometimes actively misled people. In November last year, it told the <i>Warrington Guardian</i>, my local newspaper, that the centre was &quot;absolutely not&quot; closing in 2006. In the same letter on 13&nbsp;July, in which my right hon. Friend dealt with the rumour about the asylum centre, she wrote that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;there are currently no immediate plans to close the Bruche training centre.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para14">
<a name="stpa_346">A week later, on 21&nbsp;July, Centrex sent out an e-mail at 6.4&nbsp;pm&#151;only four minutes after the House had risen for the summer recess&#151;announcing the closure of three training centres, including Bruche.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para15">
<a name="stpa_347">I find it astonishing that a public body should behave in that way. I can think of no explanation for that other than a desire to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. That is not surprising when Centrex and the Minister&#151;presumably relying in good faith on what it had told her&#151;previously said something entirely different. Centrex also wrote to me on 21&nbsp;July announcing the closure. In that letter, it responded to a letter that I had sent to it on 26&nbsp;June. However, it responded to it in a postscript, which I am afraid is typical of the kind of dismissive attitude that my constituents have had to put up with all the way along.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para16">
<a name="stpa_348">I am sorry to say that that kind of attitude extended even into parts of the Home Office. When I rang the private office of the Minister of State the day after the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;announcement, I received what I can only describe as a curt dismissal. I asked to speak to the Minister 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was told that she was in her constituency. When I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested that her staff contact her&#151;she was in Salford, after all, not Timbuktu&#151;I was told that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should write in. To her credit, the Minister did telephone me, albeit a week later when I was no longer around. However, I have to say that I have never before encountered that sort of behaviour from the private office of a Minister. It is entirely unacceptable for Centrex and the Home Office to behave in this way when we are talking about people&#039;s livelihoods and the future of their communities. I hope that this can be prevented from happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para17">
<a name="stpa_349">I wrote again to the Minister on 26&nbsp;July&#151;there has been a lot of correspondence on this matter&#151;to ask why I had been told that there was no immediate prospect of the centre closing, when in fact the announcement was made a week later. I also raised my concerns about what I saw as an attempt to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. The answer that I received was very revealing. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;Given the timing of my letter and of the announcement, it would have been more accurate to have said that no decision had yet been taken.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para18">
<a name="stpa_350">It certainly would. However, I give Ministers credit by assuming that, if they sign a letter, they will have checked the facts and that that is what they have been told. We need to know what happened to change matters between 13&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;July. Until that is cleared up, we are all left with the impression that Centrex has been, and is continuing to be, less than frank about its plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para19">
<a name="stpa_351">I was also concerned about what was said in that letter about parliamentary scrutiny. It said that the decision to close the centre had been taken at the Centrex board meeting on the morning of 21&nbsp;July. It went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;The timing of the announcement relates only to the timing of that decision.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para20">
<a name="stpa_352">But it does not. If the decision was taken in the morning, I can see no reason to wait until just after the House had risen for the recess to announce it. I have asked for the reason, and I was told by the Minister that she was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;certainly clear that Centrex had not timed the announcement to avoid parliamentary scrutiny&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para21">
<a name="stpa_353">If the Home Office is &quot;certainly clear&quot; about that, it needs to give me the information as to why, because I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not had it, and neither have the people I represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para22">
<a name="stpa_354">I received a letter dated 5&nbsp;September, signed by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), in the absence of the Minister of State. The explanation that I was given was that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;it would have been unacceptable either to make an announcement before the board had made a decision or to delay the announcement until after the parliamentary recess.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para23">
<a name="stpa_355">Frankly, that is Home Office gobbledegook. A decision cannot be announced before it has been taken, and no one suggests that it can. However, there was an alternative&#151;a third way, if you like. It could have been announced when the House was sitting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para24">
<a name="stpa_356">I am equally concerned that that letter shows an unacceptable attitude towards parliamentary scrutiny. It goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;I do not believe that it is an announcement that needed to give consideration to parliamentary timetables&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para25">
<a name="stpa_357">I beg to differ. When my constituents are losing their jobs, and when decisions are being taken that will affect a whole area, it is not only the right but the duty of their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 443</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member of Parliament to raise the matter in the House. My constituents would expect no less. I am very disappointed that any Minister should think differently. That was a most unfortunate turn of phrase to use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para26">
<a name="stpa_358">Because of all this, and because of the way in which Centrex has behaved since the announcement, it is difficult to have faith in what it is doing. I still have staff approaching me who are very demoralised about what is happening, and people who live in the area are deeply concerned. The chief executive of Centrex wrote to me in August to say that he had briefed the staff on what was happening, and that he had set up a programme board. He did not, however, answer any of the points that I put to him about what was happening to the staff or about the future plans for the site. He told me that I would get information about those matters at the appropriate time. I happen to think that the appropriate time to answer queries from a Member of the House is when they are asked, not when some unelected person decides to answer them. That is treating my constituents with a fair amount of contempt, which is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para27">
<a name="stpa_359">Since then, Centrex has not engaged with the local council&#039;s redundancy support service, the job centre or our economic development authority, until yesterday, when it sent an e-mail to the council in response to an e-mail that had been sent weeks earlier, saying that it looked forward to working with Warrington borough council. It is a miracle what getting an Adjournment debate can do, but I would prefer not to have to have one every week to ensure that that process continues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para28">
<a name="stpa_360">The sad thing is that we have a good record in Warrington of getting people into jobs following redundancy, but engagement between all the partners involved is needed. If I make a comparison with what happened when Marks and Spencer closed a call centre in my constituency, there was immediate engagement with all the partners in the area, and we had a lot of support from my right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), who was then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I expect a public body to do no less than that.

<a name="stpa_361">I want to turn to the future of the site. As I said, it is surrounded by housing, with only very limited access. When it was transferred to Centrex, I understand that the written-down value was &#163;3&nbsp;million. It might now be worth much more, depending on the future use of the site. I wonder whether my hon. Friend can tell me what will happen to any windfall profits from that, whether local people will be able to benefit in any way, and whether any of that will be used to help to find jobs for the staff involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para30">
<a name="stpa_362">There is a further problem, however. As well as the rumours that have circulated about this site, there is a real concern about over-development in the area, which I believe is well founded. The adjoining roads already have a lot of traffic problems. For any future development at the site, we need proper community engagement. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State said in one of the numerous letters that we exchanged, the date of which now escapes me, that she was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;keen that there should be proper community engagement&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para31">
<a name="stpa_363">in any future planning application. I would like to see that keenness translated into reality, however. Although I know from the parliamentary answer of 17&nbsp;October that Home Office officials and Centrex have had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 444</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discussions about the future of the site, there has been no contact with the local planning department, let alone with people in the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para32">
<a name="stpa_364">I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will accept that this matter has so far been very badly handled. It has not increased confidence, either in the staff or the community, about what Centrex will do in the future. We now need to put that right. I hope that he can assure me that he will ensure that Centrex now engages with all local partners in order to make sure that the proper procedures are in place to find jobs for people who are made redundant at that site. Far from dismissing concerns raised with it, I hope that it will now engage with the local community and have a proper discussion on what should happen there in future, so that whatever is done with the site, it can be for the benefit of the local community and not to their detriment. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s reply.

<p><a name="st_546"><a name="51109-45_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones) on securing the debate. She has raised an issue that is of concern locally and to her, and I am glad that she has had an opportunity to raise it in a characteristically forthright way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para0">
<a name="stpa_365">Let me give some of the background to the decision to close Bruche and the other training sites that my hon. Friend mentioned. Given the points that she raised and the copious correspondence between her and Home Office Ministers, I should say something about how the decision was made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para1">
<a name="stpa_366">Until recently, police probationer training was split between an officer&#039;s home force and the Central Police Training and Development Authority, known as Centrex. Once officers are recruited, they undergo two weeks of induction and familiarisation in their own forces. They are then sent to Centrex for 12&nbsp;weeks&#039; residential training, which is followed by a couple of weeks in their own forces learning about local procedures before they go out on patrol with a tutor constable for 10&nbsp;further weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para2">
<a name="stpa_367">That system is now changing. In the summer of last year, five forces began piloting the initial police learning and development programme. That moves stage 2&#151;the residential stage with Centrex&#151;back into the force. Officers learn in their own force and their own community, often in conjunction with members of that community. That is a huge change in the system and the culture, but I believe that it will help to foster a meaningful connection with police officers in training and the communities that they will serve. It is important for the police service to develop a culture of training and qualification so that we have a fully professional service. I am pleased to say that the Adult Learning Inspectorate has evaluated the effectiveness of the pilots. It considers them to have been highly successful, and welcomes the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff involved in the programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para3">
<a name="stpa_368">Working to identify and address the huge challenges involved in the change, the Government and the police service are rolling the programme out across all the forces in England and Wales. Thirteen forces have already gone live, and nine more will adopt the same 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 445</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>approach over the next five months. From April next year, the remaining 21&nbsp;forces will be ready to go live. We are changing pretty dramatically the way in which probationer police officers are trained. One of the main consequences of that approach is that officers will no longer be sent to Centrex for their initial training. The last probationer officers to go through the old system will leave Centrex on 26&nbsp;May next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para4">
<a name="stpa_369">Centrex has a number of sites around the country. Three have been used almost exclusively to provide foundation training: Ashford in Kent, Cwmbran in south Wales and Bruche in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. There are two other sites, Ryton near Coventry and Bramshill, where Centrex&#039;s headquarters are sited. They will continue to be used for other purposes because they are multi-functional sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para5">
<a name="stpa_370">For all those reasons, the chief executive of Centrex and his senior management team have been considering the future needs of the Centrex estate for some time. They reached what I judge to be the entirely logical and sensible conclusion that there was no value-for-money argument for retaining the three sites at Ashford, Cwmbran and Bruche. On 21 July, the Centrex board considered a paper from the chief executive that recommended the closure of the sites. I should explain that the board consists of a number of independent members, including the chair, and includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Home Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para6">
<a name="stpa_371">The Centrex board agreed with the recommendation from the chief executive that the sites should be closed. Home Office Ministers were made aware of the decision as soon as it was made, and the chief executive then informed the staff. He wrote to staff, spoke to them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly by means of a DVD, and later visited each site in person to discuss the implications with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para7">
<a name="stpa_372">Police staff at the three sites have been given notice that their posts are likely to become redundant by 26&nbsp;May 2006. On or before that date, up to 175&nbsp;seconded police officers will return to their forces. Forty of those officers are employed at Bruche, and 40&nbsp;further police staff at Bruche have been given notice that they are likely to be made redundant. In addition, between 30&nbsp;and 40&nbsp;subcontracted workers involved in security, catering and so on face redundancy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para8">
<a name="stpa_373">Shortly after the chief executive informed the staff, he contacted Members of Parliament representing the areas affected to make them aware of the announcement. A public announcement was made once staff had been informed, and the head of Bruche training centre also wrote to local residents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para9">
<a name="stpa_374">I want to make it clear to my hon. Friend that Home Office Ministers apologise for any difficulties or misunderstandings that occurred as a result of correspondence, particularly the letter sent on 13 July by the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Hazel Blears). That reply followed a conversation between the Minister and my hon. Friend, in which she raised some of the concerns that she has outlined this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 446</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>evening. It is true that in that letter, my right hon. Friend said that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;there are currently no immediate plans to close the Bruche training centre&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para10">
<a name="stpa_375">Of course, when she wrote that letter on 13&nbsp;July, that was true. Although discussions were taking place within Centrex, no decision had been taken, and none was taken until 21&nbsp;September. As my hon. Friend pointed out, such a decision is entirely a matter for Centrex, as a non-departmental public body; indeed, Home Office officials were informed of it only after the meeting on the morning of 21&nbsp;July concluded. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister has been able to write since and to set the record straight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para11">
<a name="stpa_376">My hon. Friend also raised the concern that the timing of the announcement, which was made on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day that this House rose for the summer recess, was such as to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. My right hon. Friend the Minister explained in her letters, and in answer to parliamentary questions tabled by my hon. Friend, that the decision was taken by the Centrex board on the morning of 21&nbsp;July. Quite apart from the fact that, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it would have been impossible to make an announcement about a decision that had yet to be taken, it would of course have been wrong to make a public announcement until the staff themselves had been made aware of that decision. My hon. Friend will agree that it would also have been wholly unfair to hold back that decision or any announcement until October, when the House returned from its recess.
</p>








<p><a name="st_547"><a name="51109-45_spnew0"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 I understand what the Minister is saying, but does he agree that what happened was at the very least unfortunate, and will he give an assurance that the Home Office will do its best to avoid such things happening again in future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_548"><a name="51109-45_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, because it is precisely the one that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to make. This was not in any way an attempt by Ministers to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. However, there is a lesson to be learned here for Government agencies, including non-departmental bodies of this kind. When they are taking such key decisions, they should have half an eye on the fact that Ministers and Parliament may need to be informed, and they should also keep an eye on the parliamentary calendar. Although I cannot give specific assurances about particular bodies, this is a lesson that the Home Office and perhaps other Departments can learn. We need to ensure that a connection is made between decisions taken outside Government Departments, and the importance of Ministers being accountable and able to explain those decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para12">
<a name="stpa_377">I turn to the future use of the site, which my hon. Friend also mentioned. Rumours circulated that plans were already in place to turn the centre into one for use by asylum seekers. As she has made clear&#151;I thank her for doing so in the manner that she did&#151;there are no such plans, as my right hon. Friend the Minister also pointed out. No decision has yet been taken about the future use of the site. The centre will be in use and fully 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 447</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>operational until roughly the middle of next year. It will of course need to be put up for sale before we can know who is likely to purchase it. Only then will we begin to know its possible future uses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para13">
<a name="stpa_378">My hon. Friend rightly points out that any future change in use would require planning permission. It is important that both she and local councillors in the area are fully committed to consultation with local residents on any proposals. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend and her colleague councillors for the assiduous way in which they will follow up this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para14">
<a name="stpa_379">Finally, my hon. Friend is quite right that the staff of Bruche&#151;both the current staff and their predecessors&#151;should be commended for the tremendous work that has been done over many years. They have trained many thousands of police officers, who have worked in my hon. Friend&#039;s, my own and many other constituencies. We are deeply grateful for that. We owe them a debt of gratitude and all the help and support that we can provide to enable them to find alternative employment. It is important that Centrex adopt a positive and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 448</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proactive approach to providing support and help for those trying to find new posts. That will include consulting Jobcentre Plus. I noted my hon. Friend&#039;s comments about other local economic development agencies. No stone should remain unturned in our efforts to find suitable employment. Centrex is taking a number of initiatives: paying for a consultant to work with the staff, opening a careers room, offering other employment training opportunities and developing links with other local employers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para15">
<a name="stpa_380">In closing, I would like to reassure my hon. Friend that every effort will be made to ensure that those who face redundancy can work through this period. Hopefully, with some new skills and new opportunities, they will be able to find local employment. As my hon. Friend rightly says, they have bills to pay and families to keep, so we are obliged to try and help them to remain in employment.
