The chain has changed hands, as such businesses do, but we cannot find any reports of intentions to reduce places. That rumour and a number of other comments from Opposition Members are untrue.

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution. It is in parents&#146; interests that we ensure that providers and local authorities understand that this is a free entitlement. That is the point of it. We do not want to discriminate between parents who could afford to pay top-up fees and those who could not. From my discussions with local authorities and the broad swathe of providers, I am convinced that the &#163;3 billion a year that the Government are committing to this free offer is sufficient. Provided it is administered properly by local authorities&#151;we are looking at that&#151;there is no reason at all for any provider to ask for a top-up fee, and we will certainly not allow them to do so.</p>

 I am delighted to see the Minister back in her place. We are all agreed that we want to see more child care, rather than less, but the Minister must accept that the free entitlement is not free, that in large measure the local authorities are not passing all the costs on to providers, and that the providers are using the extra half-hour over and above the statutory entitlement to subsidise the cost. To a large extent, the Government have had this child care cheap. Does the right hon. Lady accept that there is a mixed economy in respect of provision? Will she come clean and say what will happen when the code of practice applies to the pilot areas, and clear up any confusion? There is great uncertainty on the part of providers about what will happen from 1 April.</p>

 I know that the hon. Lady is keen to develop a campaign on the issue, but the points that she makes here and elsewhere are simply not true. They are causing needless concern for parents. The experience over the vast swathe of the country is that the money going through local authorities is sufficient. In some instances the way in which it is being allocated by local authorities should be examined. I am sure she is aware that that is why on 7 March we launched a consultation document on schools, early years and 14 to 16 funding, including specific proposals which, if they are supported, will ensure better alignment in allocation across the sectors in local authorities where that might not be the case. I am convinced that the &#163;3 billion is sufficient and that the provision must remain, as it is at present, free to parents at the point of access. We will not have the kind of two-tier system that the hon. Lady wants. We do not want vouchers and we will not allow discrimination&#151;</p>

Lord Dearing published his report this week in respect of language teaching, and we are addressing some of the recommendations. The statistics on maths teachers are very encouraging, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning launched some new measures in respect of science, technology and maths this week. The overall picture is that we have more than 36,000 more teachers than we did 10 years ago, and we have added 140,000 more support staff so that teachers can concentrate on teaching.

 My hon. Friend has been assiduous in raising that concern with the ministerial team. We will continue to look at the success that we have achieved through the chartered London teacher scheme, London Challenge and Teach First.

balance that against the concerns raised by the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay). There are particular subjects such as languages, maths and science where we need to improve the supply of teachers. Although the vacancy rate for head teachers is broadly what it was 10 years ago, there is a future challenge in terms of succession planning. We have to strike that balance. The level of supply is broadly in tune with the level of demand, but there will always be some geographical disparities.</p>

 The Secretary of State is no doubt aware of the decline in the study of languages in secondary schools, following the Government&#146;s decision to relax the curriculum. We all want to see the study of languages prosper, and we now have the Dearing proposals to try to address the problem.

 Lord Dearing has done a valuable task, and his report is full of good sense. We have accepted his principal recommendation that we should make languages compulsory in primary schools, and we will do so at the next available opportunity when we review that key stage. As for children in secondary schools, we need to do much more to encourage schools to go for a much higher benchmark. On Saturday, I was at Wakefield City high school, which is in the middle of a council estate and has a large intake of pupils who have free school meals. The number of students taking languages has not changed since we moved from compulsion to entitlement. That is because of inspirational, very good-quality languages teaching and a method of teaching that enthuses youngsters. That represents a large part of Lord Dearing&#146;s recommendations, and we should ensure that it happens in every secondary school.</p>

Is not the ability of those people&#151;who will live here for the rest of their lives, will have children here and will become part of the community&#151;to speak, learn and acquire English important both to community integration and to good race relations?</p>

 I entirely agree. I think it is critical for people to live genuinely as part of communities rather than being hermetically sealed in individual areas. One of the changes that I intend to make, which I have announced in the past week, is the reprioritisation of funds at local level to provide free access to ESOL for spouses who are priority learners in hard-to-reach groups, and unlikely to have access to their own money or family benefit documentation. I believe that that will go a long way towards allaying the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern.</p>

A Dutch educationalist said to me that the difference between them and the United Kingdom is that they are just as intelligent, computer-literate and educated, but they also believe that people have to build the houses that they live in, carry out the plumbing work and do the wiring as well, and that they celebrate that rather than make it a second-class occupation.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the problems that we have traditionally had in respect of vocational qualifications. They are particularly to do with the parity of esteem argument, as academic qualifications are seen as infinitely superior to vocational qualifications. That is in large part due to cultural issues, and we can do a lot in schools to address that. Let me say something about the introduction of diplomas, although they come in a bit later&#151;at 14 to 19&#151;and the right hon. Gentleman is right in what he says about youngsters as young as 12, and boys in particular, having to be switched on to learning.

I said a lot yesterday on issues to do with young boys&#151;working-class boys in particular&#151;and trying to close the attainment gap at age 14, especially in English, as in other subjects we do not have that gender gap.

I know that in my own area in the village of Gouldon, the local community has got together to put in place packages of assistance for young people by creating pods and developing youth activities, and ensuring a greater police presence and CCTV cameras.

A number of reforms are being made. New criminal justice procedure rules put in place last November are now coming into play; the post of forensic science regulator has been set up; and the Attorney-General&#146;s review of shaken baby syndrome cases is under way and will have important recommendations. In accord with the view of the Court of Appeal&#151;the recommendations of his honour Sir Igor Judge&#151;new CPS guidance on the use of expert evidence will ensure that, whereas expert evidence has been wholly relied on in the past, it should not be in the future and that corroborative evidence, which is independent of the experts, should be sought.

 My hon. Friend is right; there is considerable expenditure in relation to expert witnesses.

We should attempt to ensure that, where possible, there is as much consensus as possible about the expert evidence that goes before a court and a jury.

Can he tell the House how those businesses and trade organisations can take part in the review with the organisations that he has just announced?</p>

 It is important that the private sector and, indeed, the public sector work much more carefully and with the police at not just seeking to catch criminals after they have committed an offence, but in seeking to prevent crime and fraud from taking place. The fraud review sets out ways in which we can get the private and public sectors to work together with the police and the other agencies in developing a strategy to tackle fraud. The national fraud strategic authority will raise awareness among the public and seek to promote best practice in fraud detection and prevention. Individual institutions need to design systems that make fraud much more difficult to commit. There is a growing body of good practice in fraud management strategies and we have encouraged the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission to look at the strength of anti-fraud controls in the organisations that they audit.</p>

 I welcome the fraud review. I hope very much that issues such as plea bargaining and better management of fraud trials can all be looked at very carefully in the course of it. However, in view of the fact that the review is taking place and that it is likely that by next week the Bill that would remove the right to trial by jury in certain fraud cases will be defeated in the House of Lords, can I urge the Solicitor-General to use the fraud review to reconsider the position of wanting to get rid of the right of trial by jury in certain fraud cases? If this fraud review is properly carried out, it will make such a measure even less necessary despite the Government&#146;s attempts at justifying it.</p>

that we need to deal with. We have put in place the fraud review and he has welcomed that. I assure him that we will look with care at issues such as plea bargaining. We have also put in place the new Fraud Act 2006, which he and I took through this House. That Act means that we are in position to have a modern legal framework to deal with fraud, but we also need to ensure that the procedures are right and that we get fraud trials right. That is why the Fraud (Trials without a Jury) Bill is necessary. It is about ensuring that we get the courts into a position in which they can deal most effectively with fraud. This is a package in which we want all three measures&#151;the fraud review, the Fraud Act and the Bill&#151;put in place.

That may be the answer to the question of how we get the right court and maximise the chance of success.

Indeed, one of the Chancellor&#146;s close allies, the former Deputy Leader of the House, resigned over the issue. Not for the first time, the Government would not have carried their business without the support of Conservative Members. May we thus have a debate on the dwindling authority of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07031532000176">Back in those good old days, the Prime Minister and Chancellor promised us that they would be &#147;whiter than white&#148;.

On his watch, green taxes have fallen from 9.4 per cent. to 7.7 per cent. of his total tax take. And then there is his policy to provide home insulation: he announced it in 1995, scrapped it in 1998, and re-announced it last year.

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07031532000181">The right hon. Lady makes a serious point about whether Ministers answering parliamentary questions should at least meet the standards set by the Freedom of Information Act. I cannot comment on the specific case that she raises because I do not know the circumstances of it. However, it is certainly the case that Ministers all strive to ensure that, at the very minimum, they are at least as forthcoming with the House in respect of the answers that they give as they would be required to be by the Freedom of Information Act. I will ensure that that is maintained. The matter is being discussed by the Procedure Committee, which is examining written questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07031532000182">The right hon. Lady asks me about Morgan Tsvangirai. I entirely share the utter horror of all decent people throughout the world at the way in which the thugs of Robert Mugabe have sought to use the truncheon, rather than debate, to determine the future of that once-wonderful country, which has collapsed into the worst situation of almost any African country that one can think of due to the total mismanagement of Robert Mugabe. What I said two weeks ago is correct; I promise that the only issue is finding a date on which Foreign Office Ministers can be present for the debate, because they have travel plans&#151;I know that it sounds slightly lame, but it happens to be true. I am sorry that we have not been able to find time, but we will continue to work on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07031532000183">Thirdly, the right hon. Lady referred to our debate yesterday. I should just say that it was actually my noble Friend Lord Kinnock who resolved the issue of nuclear disarmament for us, and there was much relief that did so before my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister took over. It is true that the issue of nuclear disarmament and nuclear weapons has always been difficult for the Labour party. I take one view on the subject and some of my colleagues take another, but I do not think that a party should be criticised for agonising over what is unquestionably not just a defence and security issue but, in many people&#146;s eyes, an issue of conscience and morality. I draw to the right hon. Lady&#146;s attention that although the numbers involved were slightly smaller, some rather senior people in the Conservative party rebelled against their party Whip, including the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram).</p>

 Well, I agree with the hon.

If the right hon. Member for Maidenhead wants to swap stories about divisions inside parties, I suggest that she tries to pull the beam out of her own eye before she examines the mote in the eyes of others; she ought to examine what happened upstairs with regard to the draft Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007.

 You are right to admonish me, Mr. Speaker, and it means that I can dispatch the next two issues raised by the right hon. Member for Maidenhead very quickly. On Alistair Graham, he served his five years and we are grateful to him. I do not recall hearing similar complaints when Lord Nolan and Patrick Neill moved over to make way for their successors. On the environment and the draft Climate Change Bill, I had wondered what the Conservatives would say about that terrific Bill.

 May I welcome the announcement about the way in which Government statements will be dealt with in future? If the Leader of the House wishes to see evidence of Ministers failing to give answers, I refer him to the answer that the Secretary of State for Health gave to three specific questions that I tabled well in advance of Health questions this week. I did not get a reply to a single one of them; the responses were entirely evasive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07031532000189">While the Leader of the House was away thinking last week, his then deputy, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), fielded my question about the medical training application service. He suggested that my idea that it should be suspended was &#147;absolutely cuckoo&#148;&#151;he then flew the nest. If I am absolutely cuckoo, so is the entire British Medical Association, and so are junior doctors across the country. Will the Leader of the House look again at the issue? A review has been published, but there has been no suspension of the system that is causing so much damage to doctors&#146; careers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07031532000190">Last night, a press officer announced that it was the Government&#146;s intention to appeal against the administrative review High Court decision on pensions. That has not been formally reported to the House, but it will have profound consequences for pensioners who are still waiting for recompense. It also has consequences for the conduct of the Pensions Bill and for the way in which amendments are dealt with before Report. May we have statement from the Department for Work and Pensions on how it intends to proceed, so that it can allay the pensioners&#146; fears that they are again being ignored by the Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07031532000191">May we have a statement on the formal rebuke to the Government issued yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on the discontinuation of the investigation into the al-Yamamah arms deal, and on the fact that the OECD is going to send investigators to question the Attorney-General about why the UK outlawed bribes of foreign officials in 1998, yet not a single prosecution has ensued?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07031532000192">Lastly, we anticipate that the Government&#146;s response to the Lyons report on local government spending will be encompassed within the Budget statement and debate. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is not expected to participate in that debate, but the matter is of huge interest to people up and down the country who are worried about council tax bills and seek a fairer replacement, so it would be proper to have a full statement and, in due course, a debate on local government finance.</p>

that accurate answers are given within the due notice time. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there has been a huge increase in the volume of questions&#151;they have increased by 40,000 in two or three years&#151;which places an unacceptable burden on everyone involved.

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70315-0004.htm_para28"><a name="07031532000194">On the medical training application service, the hon. Gentleman will know that it is under review, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced about a week ago. We are well aware of the problems that have arisen, and she has said that she will seek to tackle them. On the pension judgment, I can confirm that the Government are appealing that judgment, as we are entitled to do. The issue is not whether we were right or wrong to make the original decision, and of course, we understand the concern of pensioners who have lost part or all of their pension, and we all have constituents in that position. However, if we are to try to recompense them fully&#151;we have already achieved partial recompense&#151;that entails a very substantial cost to the public purse, so the issue of fairness arises.</p>

Does the Leader of the House not accept that there is something wrong with proceedings if, a week after we discussed in the House the pre-eminence of the Commons in debates, such an important matter was dealt with in a Statutory Instrument Committee, which meant it was not possible for us to debate it extensively and vote on it in the Chamber?

It is possible to be in favour of the principle, but worry about its impact, and we still do not have an answer to many issues surrounding adoption and education legislation.

There will be five new permanent sports venues and a number of temporary venues, which will be used around the UK after the games. The 1 million sq ft media centre for the games will provide in legacy a state-of-the-art business space. Four thousand homes will be converted from the village, and a further 5,000 will be provided elsewhere in the redevelopment. And there will be one of the largest shopping centres in Europe, which will involve an estimated &#163;7 billion private sector investment. That money has been invested because we won the Olympic games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70315-0005.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000240">Across the country, the games will inspire a whole generation of young people to play sport, volunteer in their communities and be proud of what their country has achieved. We chose to host the games at a site where the need was greatest and where the benefits would be most keenly felt. We chose east London, because of the challenge to regenerate one of the most deprived areas not only in the UK, but in the whole of Europe. The site of the Olympic park needs remediation before construction work can even begin. That work is well under way. Essential utilities for the area need to be installed. That work is also well under way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70315-0005.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000241">Developing the Olympic village requires the largest number of homes ever to be built in one place, at one time in this country. The planning for that work is on schedule. As the National Audit Office report in January set out, when we bid for the games, we estimated the cost of the Olympic park, infrastructure and an element for community and elite sport at around &#163;3 billion, plus an additional &#163;1 billion as part of the wider lower Lea valley Olympic regeneration. This made the total cost of preparing for the games and Olympic regeneration just over &#163;4 billion. Those costs were net of tax and of wider security costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70315-0005.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000242">I made it clear to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 15 May 2005, which was before we won, that if we were successful, I would institute a detailed review of costs. That review began in early autumn 2005, after we had won the bid. The budget for every venue, every bridge and every facility on the park has been scrutinised. The Olympic Delivery Authority&#146;s private sector delivery partner, CLM, has unrivalled expertise in advising five Olympic cities on their plans. CLM has made a detailed study of the site and all the attendant risks inherent in a project of this magnitude and tight time scale. The site master plan has been amended to avoid potential costs in the region of &#163;600 million. However, other costs have been judged to have increased, as I set out for the Select Committee in November, resulting in a net increase of &#163;900 million.</p>

<notus-date day="15" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>15 Mar 2007 : Column 451</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07031532000243">We will now set a budget for the ODA, the body established to manage the delivery of all the structural and regeneration elements of the games, and I can today confirm what the budget will be. The ODA will be given a budget to cover the construction costs as a whole of up to &#163;5.3 billion up to 2012. That comprises &#163;3.1 billion for building the Olympic park and venues&#151;the core Olympic costs&#151;&#163;1.7 billion for Olympic infrastructure and regeneration linking the park to the rest of the lower Lea valley and a &#163;500 million allowance for programme contingency, which represents 12 per cent. of the total programme contingency that has been allowed. I am placing a summary of the ODA 2007-08 business plan in the Library today as well as details of this investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000244">Those costs, as in the 2004 bid, are net of tax. The ODA will pay tax, but the cost at around &#163;840 million will be covered in full by the Government contribution. I can assure the House that the tax treatment of the ODA will have no impact on other funders. The Government have also decided that as the funder of last resort, it is prudent that a programme contingency should be held within Government under very tight conditions. This will be drawn on should the need be demonstrated, so as to ensure that the timetable is met and that quality is maintained. The level of contingency is &#163;2.7 billion, of which, as I have said, &#163;500 million will form part of the base budget of the ODA. Within that overall budget, we have also allocated a figure of &#163;600 million for wider security, which is on top of the ODA budget for site security. This &#163;600 million figure has fluctuated as assessments have changed and will obviously be subject to continued oversight and scrutiny in the coming months and years by the relevant Cabinet Committee, the Home Secretary and the Metropolitan police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000245">Lastly, as we announced at the time of the bid, around &#163;390 million will be invested in non-ODA provision, including in sport&#151;for example, community coaches&#151;and in the Paralympics. That figure was included in the public sector funding package, but it is not part of the ODA budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000246">Let me turn now to how the budget will be funded. At the time of our Olympic bid, the lottery and the London contribution was estimated at &#163;2.4 billion, and as I told the House on 2 February 2006, the Government will contribute a further &#163;1 billion as part of our commitment to Olympic regeneration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000247">I can announce today that central Government provision will be &#163;6 billion. This comprises the &#163;1 billion already committed for Olympic regeneration, the funding of the tax bill, broader regeneration, infrastructure within the park, wider security and programme contingency. Without any further increase for London council tax payers beyond that already committed, or any increase in transport fares to fund the Olympics, the Mayor will over the lifetime of the Olympic programme be making a further &#163;300 million available to help meet Olympic costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000248">The lottery will make a further contribution of &#163;675 million. This will mean a total contribution of &#163;2.2 billion from the lottery, which is 20 per cent. of lottery income for good causes from 2005, when the Olympic lottery started, to 2012-13. In addition to the &#163;410 million already  <br>

confirmed, which will be shared according to the normal lottery shares, I propose to transfer after 2009 &#163;425 million from the Big Lottery Fund and &#163;250 million from the other good causes. No transfer will be made from UK Sport, which is responsible for preparing our sportsmen and women for the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics in 2012. The decision to take a further share from the lottery has been taken only after very careful consideration, and implementation will take place only after full consultation about the implications with the lottery distributors and the other stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000249">The original memorandum of understanding made it clear that should we win the games, we would call on the lottery to help fund them. I believe that that principle is widely accepted. However, I am determined to ensure that this temporary diversion from the existing good causes to the Olympic good cause is done with the least possible disruption. I will continue to consult the lottery distributors about how best this can be done, but I assure the House that it is the Government&#146;s intention that no existing lottery projects need be affected. We have also agreed with the Big Lottery Fund that resources for the voluntary sector will be protected and will, as it expects, continue to receive the &#163;2 billion from the Big Lottery Fund between now and 2012. The decision on the lottery will be subject an affirmative resolution in both Houses in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000250">London 2012 will bring financial gain to London and, indeed, across the country. For example, land values in the Olympic park are expected to increase considerably as a result of the investment that we are making. In my view, it is only fair that the lottery good causes, having contributed to the Olympics, should share in any such windfall. The Mayor of London and I have agreed that we will rewrite our memorandum of understanding and put in place profit-sharing arrangements to enable the lottery and future regeneration needs of the local area to benefit from the returns on the investment that we are making in the Olympic park.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000251">As I told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the NAO has agreed to work closely with us in scrutinising the budget from now on, and the team overseeing the project in the ODA has a world-class reputation. This makes generous funding provision for the project as a whole, of which &#163;3.1 billion is the core Olympic cost, net of tax and contingency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000252">Only a fortnight ago, the International Olympic Committee said that it was &#147;assured and impressed&#148; by the work under way after its visit to London. The announcement that we make today means that it is full steam ahead for 2012. The London Olympics will change Britain for the better for ever. The fact of hosting the Olympic games is already changing lives and communities and building ambition. I commend that, and this statement, to the House.</p>

First, if one adds together all the separate parts, the budget for which the Government are responsible has nearly trebled since the London Olympics Bill left Parliament under a year ago&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Secondly, as a consequence, in raiding the lottery for a further &#163;675 million to make up the shortfall, the Government will penalise precisely the clubs and small organisations throughout the country that were supposed to benefit from the Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000257">Thirdly, as the Secretary of State has given us only the main column headings, we do not yet have the full, open and transparent budget that was necessary to restore confidence in the financing of London 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000258">As time is short, I should like to ask the Secretary of State five questions. The first concerns disclosure. As a result of information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we now know that KPMG identified serious risks to the Olympic budget as early as October 2005, yet a month later the Secretary of State was still assuring the House:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07031532000260">The Bill did not leave Parliament until March 2006&#151;a clear six months after KPMG had first raised concerns. My first question for the Secretary of State is therefore this: when were she and the Treasury first aware of concerns that the original budget was not deliverable, and why did not she share those concerns with Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07031532000261">Secondly, on contingency, the requirement to add whole project contingency to the individual project contingency already built into the bid has added, as the Secretary of State told us, &#163;2.7 billion to the Olympic budget. Why did the Treasury and the Chancellor fail to identify that cost when they signed off the original budget?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000262">Thirdly, on tax, given that we lifted our structures directly from Sydney, where no VAT was payable, and that VAT was not payable for the Manchester Commonwealth games, why did the Treasury and the Chancellor sign off the bid budget, without VAT, before adding, as the Secretary of State announced, a further &#163;840 million to the budget? Can she assure the House that this is, indeed, simply a case of transferring balances and that no tax money will actually be collected?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07031532000263">Fourthly, on the private sector contribution, the NAO report highlighted the fact that &#163;738 million was to come from the private sector in order to reduce the need for public funds&#151;and is, presumably, still part of the new budget announced today.

Culture, Media and Sport has so far refused to answer any parliamentary written questions on this issue, always merely saying that it will let me have a reply in due course. Can the Secretary of State therefore explain to the House how that figure was reached, and will she confirm that it is still robust? If it is not, further public money will clearly be required to fill that additional shortfall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07031532000264">Finally, on the lottery, the Secretary of State announced that she will raid the national lottery for a further &#163;675 million to pay for the Olympics. Despite the fact that</p>

Can she confirm exactly what percentage sport&#151;and, indeed, heritage, the arts and the Big Lottery Fund&#151;will get under these new proposals, and, crucially, what assessment she has made of the financial impact of this in each and every constituency throughout the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para20"><a name="07031532000266">Many Members in this House supported the Olympics and support them still. My party is among them. However, this statement confirms that the cost has almost trebled in the year since the Bill left Parliament and that the lottery will bear an extra &#163;675 million shortfall. One of the key drivers for that is that the Treasury and the Chancellor signed off the original budget but failed to allow for VAT, at &#163;840 million, or for contingency, at &#163;2.7 billion, which they have now added to the bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para21"><a name="07031532000267">The key thing now is for the Government to put a full, open and transparent budget in the public domain so that everybody knows who is paying for what, and when, and then to stick to it. That will do more than anything else to restore public confidence in the London 2012 Olympics. If they do not do that, I fear that the Secretary of State, or her successor, will be standing in front of us a year from now to admit that costs have risen further.</p>

distinction between the budget for the ODA, which I set out today&#151;the money we expect it to spend&#151;and the funding provision to safeguard the project against any as yet unforeseen risks. That is a clear distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para24"><a name="07031532000271">There is a specific reason for Manchester&#146;s exemption from VAT. The Commonwealth games operated on a host city basis and local authorities are exempt from paying VAT.</p>

Negotiations are under way all the time with different private sector partners, so it is possible, but not certain, that that may change. If the hon. Gentleman wants to know about private sector investment in the Olympic park, I refer him to the confidence that Westfield has shown in investing in the largest retail park at Stratford city and residential development because of the Olympic games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70315-0006.htm_para26"><a name="07031532000273">Let me deal with the point about raiding the lottery. Such criticism is hard to take from an Opposition who made a manifesto commitment to wind up the Big Lottery Fund, which they are now defending, and conduct some sort of moral audit of grants that it made. Nothing has done more to galvanise sport and ambition among young people in this country than the prospect of London hosting the Olympic games. We are guardians of that ambition.

 I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution and I welcome her support for the Olympic games. It is absolutely right that the decisions, costs and every aspect of the Olympics should be subject to scrutiny. I have set out today as best I can both the consequences of a further take from the lottery and the safeguards that we are extending. I have made it absolutely clear that it is not the Government&#146;s expectation that any current lottery-funded project should see its funding either cut or withdrawn as a result of the Olympics. The problem, of course, lies with giving an absolute blanket assurance in respect of hundreds of thousands of lottery projects throughout the country, as some may close for reasons quite unrelated to the Olympic games. My assurances about lottery-funded projects have been put on the record in the House today and I am absolutely sure that all hon. Members will come back if they find the consequences in their constituencies to be any different.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State aware that today&#146;s announcement that another &#163;675 million has been taken from the lottery on top of the existing &#163;1.5 billion will be greeted with dismay by arts and heritage organisations, charities and grass-roots sports? Will she accept that that makes it all the more imperative that those causes should not suffer a double hit with an announcement of a cut in direct grant funding as a result of the comprehensive spending review? Can she give the House an absolute guarantee that this is the final figure for the call on the lottery, and that if there are any further increases in costs beyond the figures announced today, they will not be taken from the lottery but met by the Treasury through central Government expenditure?</p>

 I will make two points in response to the hon. Gentleman. First, this is intended to be the final lottery contribution to the costs of the Olympic games between now and 2012. Secondly, we should not forget that a major part of the Olympics and Paralympics will be the cultural Olympiad, which starts next year when London becomes the host city and Liverpool becomes the capital of culture. There is not a single aspect of our heritage, our culture, our community sport or our national life that cannot be enriched by our hosting of the Olympic games. Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked about the comprehensive spending review, but without wishing to be coy, I am sure he will accept that that is an announcement for the Chancellor, not for me.</p>

 We all regret that the Secretary of State has had to come back to the House as she has. In all honesty, I suspect that on 5 July 2005 she did not expect us to win the Olympic bid; hence the budget was much slacker than it otherwise might have been. She rightly points that there has to be legacy, and that providing a catalyst for regeneration is the raison d&#146;être of the Olympic games. We all know that it will be a spectacle and a great sporting success in 2012, but without that legacy it will have been a wasted opportunity.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is specifically about legacy. The investment in regeneration and Olympic infrastructure in and around the Olympic park is precisely about legacy, because the sporting venues that will be built will be used for decades to come&#151;long after the 60 days of the Olympics and Paralympics. That is one of the reasons why we should look at this not just as a cost but as an investment in the quality of life of those communities for decades to come.</p>

Sport has been enjoying an unprecedented level of investment, and we need that to continue.</p>

I sit on the South East England Development Agency and Kent county council Olympic groups, and we need a challenge fund to bid for elements of the Olympics in 2012. Therefore, if she is going to take some of the lottery money away, will she reconsider the 12p in the pound that the lottery takes in tax and use that 12p, not cuts in the lottery, to resolve the dilemma?</p>

 It is the duty of every Member of the House to scrutinise budgets and make sure that we get value for money, particularly with expensive schemes such as the Olympics. What the Opposition have shown, however, is that they know the cost of everything and the value of absolutely nothing. Over the past two generations, the affected part of east London has seen factories, docks and, south of the river, the Woolwich arsenal close. Is not two thirds of the budget announced by my right hon. Friend for infrastructure and regeneration?

In every school in this country, young people are counting the years and the months until the Olympics. The Olympics have lifted prospects, ambitions and aspirations, as more young people take part in sport. The approach of the Conservative party is to say that it is a great supporter of the Olympics, but then to seek to destabilise, carp and criticise at every turn.</p>

 With permission, I shall make a statement about the report of the review of party funding by Sir Hayden Phillips entitled &#147;Strengthening Democracy: Fair and Sustainable Funding of Political Parties&#148;, published earlier this morning. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000351">In a written ministerial statement this morning, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister thanked Sir Hayden, on behalf of the Government, for his hard work over the past 12 months. In the course of his review, Sir Hayden received submissions and held discussions with representatives of all the major political parties, as well as consulting the public, the Electoral Commission and various academic experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000352">Sir Hayden's report identifies important principles that could form the basis of a lasting settlement of the party funding system. However, as Sir Hayden himself concedes, a number of practicalities remain to be worked out and will require further discussion between the parties. We will play a full and constructive part in those talks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000353">The issue of party political finance and spending is central to the debate about the health of our democracy. There is a keen public interest in securing lasting reform in a way that curbs wasteful spending, does not gratuitously advantage one party at the expense of others, and does not interfere in the internal structures of any political party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000354">If the various political parties can agree on a reform package that meets those objectives, we will have a funding regime that will increase public confidence in the probity of the democratic process and help stimulate grass-roots renewal of our parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000355">The most compelling need identified by Sir Hayden is the need to end the political spending &#147;arms race&#148;, which has seen expenditure spiral upwards even as party memberships have declined. In the 1997 to 2001 Parliament, the Government, with all-party support, sought to tackle the problem of excessive spending with what became the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Act reflected key recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Patrick Neill QC. It introduced a national limit on campaign expenditure, created the Electoral Commission, and made the funding system more transparent by requiring that all donations above &#163;5,000 nationally and &#163;1,000 locally be made public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000356">We all believed that through the introduction of those limits and that transparency, public confidence in the system could be assured; but the recent revelations about unpublicised loans to parties by individuals, resulting from a loophole in the 2000 Act, have clouded that transparency. In addition, the line between local and national spending has become blurred by developments such as political campaigning facilitated by the internet, and other advances in telecommunications. As a consequence, a modest relaxation of spending controls in the 2000 Act at local level has been exploited to an extent far beyond what was intended in the legislation.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="15" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>15 Mar 2007 : Column 468</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000357">Sir Hayden draws attention to the fact that spending by the two main parties in the 12 months before the last general election&#151;in 2005&#151;rose to &#163;90 million, up nearly 40 per cent. on the &#163;65 million spent during a similar period in 2000-01. He must be right to say that the 2000 Act</p>
<a name="70315-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07031532000932"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;sought to control the level of spending, but it has proved inadequate to the challenge&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000358">The immediate problem of transparency in relation to party loans has been resolved by the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which requires that loans be publicly declared in the same way as donations. However, in his report Sir Hayden advances proposals for further reform. Crucially, he shows support for the principle of continuous spending limits at local and national level. He also proposes tighter controls on third-party expenditure, and a reformed Electoral Commission with the power, capacity and practical experience to perform its role as an effective regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000359">The importance of effective spending limits cannot be overstated. As the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs observed in its report &#147;Party Funding&#148;, published in December last year, the United States offers an instructive example of what can happen when political spending is left unchecked. The Committee said that in 1976, the total cost of all United States elections was $40 million. By 2004, the cost of federal elections alone had risen to $3.9 billion, 97 times higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000360">Sir Hayden also recommends the introduction of caps on donations. All three main parties agree in principle that there should be some form of donation cap. The Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended a voluntary arrangement. We believe that that would work, providing enough flexibility for the different structures and traditions of the various parties to be respected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000361">Sir Hayden offers welcome backing for the judgment of the Constitutional Affairs Committee that</p>
<a name="70315-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="07031532000933"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any move to change the nature of party funding must not stray into prescriptive devices to require political parties to organise internally in ways that violate their democratic relationships with other institutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000362">Finally, Sir Hayden recommends the introduction of a higher level of state funding for political parties. The Constitutional Affairs Committee reached a similar conclusion, but recognised the need for further debate about the values and principles that should govern such funding. As a 1976 report on party funding&#151;by a committee chaired by the then Douglas Houghton&#151;showed, there has long been a degree of state funding in United Kingdom politics. All political parties have the opportunity to claim free television and radio broadcast slots, along with free postage. Since the 1970s, the provision of Short money and Cranborne money has given millions of pounds of state aid to the main Opposition parties. That funding has increased more than threefold since 1997. In 2006, the total amount of Short money was &#163;6.3 million, with more than &#163;4 million being paid to the main Opposition party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000363">The Neill committee noted in its 1998 report that the arguments for and against state funding were &#147;finely balanced&#148;. Although Neill did not recommend a major extension, his committee concluded:</p>

We want to have cleaner and cheaper politics, and we want to work with the other parties to achieve that goal. However, if cleaner and cheaper politics is the goal, we start a long way from that point. The cash for peerages scandal has pushed the public&#146;s estimation of politicians to a new low. This issue is not just about our vanity, and nor is it just a joke that can be easily written off. Public cynicism about our political process is deeply damaging to our democracy, so will the Leader of the House agree to hold cross-party talks on Sir Hayden&#146;s recommendations as soon as possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70315-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07031532000369">There is much to welcome in Sir Hayden&#146;s report.

 Of course we would like the all-party talks to take place soon, but I must say to the right hon. Lady that they will have to take place on the basis of what is actually in Sir Hayden Phillips&#146; report, rather than on what she wishes was in his report.</p>

It is simply untrue that Sir Hayden anywhere says that the &#147;principal block&#148;, to use the right hon. Lady&#146;s phrase, to solving the problems is the issue of the trade unions. More to the point, she knows that, in all this public concern about some aspects of trade union funding, there is absolutely no evidence&#151;not a scintilla&#151;of any problem in respect of funding by the trade unions. She also knows that her party went through a series of so-called reforms of the method of the trade union political levy through the 1980s and up to 1992, and that in 1998 the Neill committee reported that there was no evidence that there was a case for any further reform. The Conservative party said in its evidence to the Neill committee:</p>

Of course, Conservatives will say things in opposition, but they did nothing between 1951 and 1964 or between 1970 and 1974, and the only thing that they did&#151;although it was a big thing&#151;between 1979 and 1997 was to seek to undermine another party&#146;s finances while their own were maintained.</p>

We support the principles that he so clearly sets out, as we also welcomed the report by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which preceded it. Sir Hayden correctly identifies the lack of public confidence in the party political process, and that is partly fuelled by factors such as the cash for peerages allegations, the loans scandal and the perceived influence of big donors, as well as increasing resentment of the spiralling costs of campaigns. Parties say that they have little cash to spend, but spend more and more on national campaigns.</p>

One has already been clearly identified in the opening exchanges: the limits on individual donations. We have always strongly supported the view that there should be a limit on individual donations, but does the Leader of the House agree with Sir Hayden when he says that the principal defence against avoidance will be public opprobrium?

it is impossible to reach a solution that takes account of those concerns and, at the same time, produces a binding limit on individual donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70315-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000394">The second issue is the limit on campaign spending.

In the end, this House and the other place have to make decisions, and he described the process appropriately: no party should have a veto on sensible reforms that are likely to carry public support, but at the same time the discussions and any agreement that can be reached have to take account of the legitimate interests of all the parties.

She was trying to return to the opt-in arrangements in the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927. Not even Margaret Thatcher tried that on.

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70315-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07031532000401">My last point on the issue of trade unions is that there may have been a public perception about trade union funding, but it was completely dispersed by changes introduced both in legislation and by us. All opinion poll evidence shows almost zero concern about trade union spending, because it is the most transparent arrangement. Interestingly, the Better Regulation Task Force said that there is too much regulation of trade unions in that respect, not too little, and the assiduous certification officer said that there have been three complaints&#151;only three&#151;about the operation of the levy since 2000. Two of them were withdrawn and one rejected.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his statement. Does he agree that the central issue the electorate expect us to deal with is the question of both national and local spending limits? That is the driver of dodgy practices such as the Midlands Industrial Council, which we have come to know only too well, and the dining clubs in the House of Commons. Does my right hon.

Member for Maidenhead says about the need for regulation that does not deny the reality that elections are principally fought in marginal seats&#151;of course that is true&#151;and which takes some account of the so-called incumbency factor, although it affects different parties at different times and I do not recall its being mentioned often between 1979 and 1997, but there you go&#151;here you go. The reason why those proposals, which emanated from the 1998 report of the Neill committee, have not worked is that there used to be a clear distinction in practice between national and local spending, but because of things such as call centres and personalised mailing the division between national and local spending has become almost non-existent. That is why we need both national and local controls on spending, for which Sir Hayden provides strong support in his report, and they should be pretty continuous.</p>

closely the lines of the Select Committee&#146;s report? Does the Leader of the House recognise that the Committee believe unanimously that there should be voluntarily agreed binding limits on all large donations, whether individual, corporate or trade union, and a cap on all party spending, including spending outside the election period, as a precondition for more state funding? Does he realise that all the parties will have to move on from past positions? We found it was possible to do so when we saw how successfully Canadian parties had adapted to quite fundamental change that still enabled them to preserve their trade union links or their ability to engage with the electorate.

 Will my right hon. Friend confirm that Hayden Phillips was given that job in the aftermath of cash for peerages, starting with the Tories way back in at least 2001&#151;as far as we know&#151;and then encroached on by us, the Labour party? Will he also confirm that when deciding on Hayden Phillips to do that job there was not reference at any time to examining the trade union movement? Is not it ironic that despite all the big business money, and the Swiss roll-over for the Liberal Democrats, we find ourselves here in the House discussing a report from Hayden Phillips about clean money from the trade union movement that is balloted for every few years, while the Tories and the rest want to imagine that big business has played no role whatever? There should be no cap on the trade unions, the cap should be on the spending. In terms of equality, we should decide on a national spending cap of about &#163;10 million&#151;equivalent to the amount a party would spend in every constituency it contests&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend&#146;s recollection of the history of the establishment of the Hayden Phillips inquiry is entirely right; at the time, there was not a single mention of problems with the trade unions, because there is no problem with the way that trade unions have been making contributions towards the Labour party. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) asked me about the matter when I gave evidence to the Select Committee and I invited him to provide even a sheet of evidence that suggested any concern that the current, highly transparent, highly regulated system in respect of trade unions was operating inappropriately. None was forthcoming. The Conservative party has been unable to produce such evidence; nobody has been able to produce it. The Department for Constitutional Affairs cannot and neither&#151;as I confirmed to the Select Committee&#151;has the Electoral Commission. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) is entirely right to say that what the Conservative party are trying to do is on the one hand say, &#147;Yes, we&#146;ll take part in talks&#148;, while on the other trying to shift the issue in a rather blatant and obvious way from the real problem, which is the over-reliance by all three parties on single, large donors, with the inappropriate and completely opaque influence that can bring, to trying to suggest that the trade unions are the bogey. I am afraid that is the old Conservative approach, and they will have to wrest themselves away from it if they want consensus in the talks.</p>

 I say to the right hon. Gentleman that there will be a debate on the recommendation of the House of Commons Commission in respect of the communications allowance. As he will see when the report is put forward, that is about communicating in respect of our parliamentary duties and it actually proposes tightening up considerably the way in which the existing incidental expenses provision is currently used and restricting the amount that can be spent on franked envelopes from no limit at the moment to one that Mr. Speaker will set at &#163;7,000. Yes, some additional funding will be provided for communication by Members of Parliament and all the evidence suggests&#151;and it is not a party issue at all&#151;that that is necessary if we are better to inform our electorates.

He reinforced that view in an aptly entitled book on the 2005 elections called &#147;Dirty politics, Dirty times&#148;.</p>

Crucially, not only the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Sir Hayden Phillips, but the Committee on Standards in Public Life, have all recommended that there have to be people among the commissioners who understand how political parties operate and who have experience within parties.</p>

 I beg to move, That this House do now adjourn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07031532000458">I am pleased to have this opportunity today for, I hope, an informed debate about widening participation in higher education, which is rightly at the centre of the Government&#146;s efforts to expand opportunities and life chances. As Members of Parliament, many of us will have direct experience of going to university, either as students ourselves or by having a graduate in the family. Many, like me, will be first in our families to have gone to university. I grew up in a council house and went to a comprehensive school. Without having gone to university, my life would certainly not have developed in the way that it has. I certainly do not believe that I would be standing here today as Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000459">The Government are strongly committed to ensuring that every student across all the socio-economic groups who wants a university place and has the necessary talent and commitment, can get one, so that regardless of their background or financial position, they too can experience the challenges and benefits of study in higher education. We strongly believe that that objective is critical to the continued economic success and social well-being of this country. However, that opinion is not universally accepted. We sometimes delude ourselves into believing that we have achieved a consensus on the issue in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000460">I fear that there is still a strong body of opinion, which is most notably featured in the pages of the <i> Daily Mail </i>and <i> The</i><i> Daily Telegraph</i>, that continues to argue against increased and widened participation in higher education. The opposition centres on the view that if more people are going to university, that, in some sense, devalues the degrees that are awarded. People say that quality will decline and that the Government will be interfering in admissions and fair access, and that, as a result, people from higher income groups or independent schools will miss out. I wholly reject the view that to validate one&#146;s educational success, one has to see others fail. Frankly, such a view has held this country back for far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000461">Educational success should not be restricted to the privileged few. Increasing access to, and widening participation in, higher education is not in any sense about denying people from higher socio-economic groups or independent schools the chance to progress. It is, however, about helping everyone, whatever their background and circumstances, who wants an independent future through higher education to fulfil their potential.</p>

 I am sure that we all agree that we do not want to restrict access to further and higher education.

to university? It is important to talk about a broad range of educational options that might be suitable for some, but not others.</p>

<p><a name="st_o271"><a name="07031532000463"><a name="70315-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="07031532001282"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 I agree in part with the hon. Gentleman. It is not the Government&#146;s policy to present university as the only route to educational success. One of the Government&#146;s achievements over the past 10 years of which I am most proud is the tripling of the number of apprentices in this country. However, it is exceedingly difficult to get journalists and the national media interested in that issue. We need more people to be educated at all levels, and that certainly includes apprentices and people going through school, further education and, indeed, university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000464">We must be clear that ensuring that people have such an opportunity is an economic and social necessity. Failure in our education system, whether through illiteracy, high drop-out rates or an unskilled work force, breeds wider failure in our society and economy. In many senses, this is a fundamental economic imperative. I strongly believe that being a global economic leader demands a skilled and educated work force that have not only the right skills, knowledge and experience, but the ability to update them in the face of phenomenally rapid change. That change is very significant.</p>

 I am sure that the Minister will join me in acknowledging the great work that the Open university in my constituency has done for the past 30 years or so. Given that many people are considering part-time higher education, what does he propose to do to ensure that there is a level playing field for those in part-time and full-time higher education?</p>

<p><a name="st_o273"><a name="07031532000466"><a name="70315-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="07031532001284"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 I am certainly happy to celebrate the achievements of the Open university, which was one of the finest creations of the previous Labour Government. The Open university was among the bodies that strongly welcomed the 27 per cent. increase in the part-time student grant that I announced last year. Indeed, the significant increase in the access to learning funds from some &#163;3 million to &#163;12 million has been a really important step forward that we should celebrate. The increase gives the Open university, Birkbeck and other institutions a real opportunity to thrive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000467">I was talking about the rapid rate of change. There is research showing that of the 12 million jobs that were expected to become vacant in this country between 2004 and 2014, 6 million would be in occupations that were most likely to employ graduates. Employers value graduate skills immensely. Over the course of a working life, a graduate, on average, earns over &#163;100,000 more, net of tax, than someone with just two A-levels. The latest Universities UK report on the economic benefits of a degree confirms that graduates, on average, earn more, and are more likely to be in a job, than people without degrees. It also shows that higher education is likely&#151;we should promote this very strongly&#151;to be the best investment that a student will ever make. In addition, the report confirms that the graduate earnings premium is holding up well.</p>

 How does that &#163;100,000 premium, which is an average, compare with the figure that was cited in the last Parliament&#151;before I was a Member of the House&#151;when the Bill that became the Higher Education Act 2004 was being considered? I think that the figure cited in 2004 was about four times that amount. Does the Minister think that if the research on the premium that is available now was available then, the top-up fees Bill would have gone through?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman had done his research a bit better, he would be aware that the &#163;400,000 figure was the difference in earnings between a person with a degree and someone with no qualifications. The figure that I am citing is the difference in earnings between someone with a degree and a person with just two A-levels. The figures are not comparable. The body of evidence suggests that the graduate earnings premium has not declined as we have expanded participation in higher education.</p>

<p><a name="st_o276"><a name="07031532000470"><a name="70315-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="07031532001287"><b>David Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b>
 One aspect of what the Minister just said was puzzling. According to Universities UK, nearly everyone with two A-levels or better goes on to higher education. The figure that he cites must thus be calculated from a low statistical base.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="07031532000471"><a name="70315-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="07031532001288"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 That demonstrates that a little research can go an awful long way towards misleading people. It is not the case that virtually everyone with two A-levels goes on to university. The figure that I am citing is robust. There is a sustainable graduate earnings premium. If hon. Members wish to try to decry that notion, they are doing a disservice to not only their argument, but the young people throughout the country whom we need to inspire to participate in higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000472">There is an international dimension to the debate. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that there is a clear relationship between the number of graduates in the economy and increasing rates of growth in gross domestic product. Emerging economies such as India and China are developing large reserves of talent with people who are highly skilled and ready to reap the rewards of globalisation. Countries such as China and India are certainly not having navel-gazing debates about whether to expand higher education; they are just doing it. That should give us a strong pointer in the right direction. Unless we face up to the challenges that arise from the changes that are taking place around the world and do more to educate people right through the system to higher levels, we will be blown away by the global competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000473">Given the challenges that we face, what have we actually done? Increasing and widening participation in higher education is a good social policy and an invaluable economic policy. To make it a reality in this country, the Government have rightly focused on attainment, aspirations, applications, admissions and affordability, which involves delivering high-quality education to enable people to gain higher education entry qualifications; increasing people&#146;s knowledge and understanding of higher education so that they see it as a possible and realistic option; encouraging young  <br>

people to apply to the institution and course that best suits their potential and ambitions; ensuring that higher education institutions are fair, transparent and professional in the way in which they make their admissions decisions; and addressing perceived financial barriers that might deter or delay young people from poorer backgrounds from going to university or college. Through pursuing those changes, we have made a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000474">In 1997, fewer than 82 per cent. of young UK higher education entrants came from state schools. Some 12 per cent. of higher education entrants came from neighbourhoods that were known to have a low proportion of young people in higher education. By 2004, the number of young UK higher education entrants from state schools had risen to nearly 87 per cent., with almost 14 per cent. of higher education entrants coming from neighbourhoods with little participation in higher education. We have certainly got more to do, but I believe that we are moving in the right direction. Overall, the number of UK students in higher education, as measured by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, has risen from 1.8 million in 1997-98 to 2.2 million in 2005-06. For those undergraduate students for whom HESA has social class data, the proportion from lower socio-economic groups has risen from 30.8 per cent. to 31.5 per cent. since 2002-03.</p>

 I have listened to the figures with interest, and particularly to those for before 2004, but according to the Government&#146;s own figures, only a fifth of those going on to higher education are from the lowest socio-economic groups. We have not yet felt the full impact of top-up fees; when will the Minister publish those figures, broken down by demographic group, and what will he do to get more than a fifth of those from the lowest socio-economic groups into higher education?</p>

(Mr. Chaytor) makes a pertinent point, because one of the frustrations in the debate about variable fees and their introduction concerns the obsession of the opponents of variable fees with focusing on full-time students instead of on the many thousands of other students who are rightly accessing higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000499">On attainment, despite claims in the media that it is now easier for a person to get the qualifications that they need to go into higher education, the demands of studying and of achieving those qualifications are as high as they have ever been. The gap in attainment between higher and lower social classes goes some way to explaining the relative success that they have in getting to university. Our significant investment in schools since 1997 has helped to raise standards overall. The attainment gap, at age 16, between higher and lower social classes at level 2 is narrowing, and that is welcome, but it is still the case that only about a quarter of lower-social-class 18-year-olds achieve two or more A-levels, compared with around half of those from higher social classes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000500">That is one of the most worrying and troublesome challenges that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000501">The research shows that in the 1990s, children with parents whose incomes were in the highest 20 per cent. were about five times more likely to acquire a degree by the age of 23 than children with parents whose incomes were in the lowest 20 per cent. That is simply unacceptable, and we are determined to address the problem. Evidence shows that if someone makes a decision to stay on at school or college at 16, they are much more likely to stay in education after 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70315-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000502">The choice of too many 16-year-olds not to stay in education is the biggest barrier that we have to overcome. Through the development of diplomas, ongoing investment in personalised learning in schools and colleges and, crucially, initiatives such as education maintenance allowances, we are making progress. EMAs have contributed to an increase in participation in post-16 education that we expect to feed through to higher education. The proportion of 16-year-olds in the first post-compulsory year of full-time education at the end of 2005 is estimated to be 76.5 per cent.&#151;the highest-ever rate and an increase of 2.7 percentage points since the end of 2004. It is the biggest step change in participation in full-time education at 16 since 1993.</p>

Significant investment in the Aimhigher programme, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) mentioned, and other interventions are raising the aspirations of more young people with the ability and talent to enter higher education. Through a range of activities, such as university visits, master classes, mentoring and summer schools, we aim to show students from disadvantaged backgrounds what study at a higher level involves so that they can experience the realities, challenges and joys of being a higher education student. We welcome the fact that early evaluation of Aimhigher shows that its participants have more positive intentions towards higher education than non-participants. Furthermore, national data indicate that the gap between higher and lower social classes at age 16 intending to go on to higher education narrowed by almost 5 per cent.  <br>

That is a challenge for all of us, and for the way in which we advance the debate.</p>

I remain strongly committed to a system of post-qualification application. Such a system would help to ensure that students are better matched to their courses, and reduce the potential for students to drop out. Fifty per cent. of predicted grades are inaccurate, and they are most inaccurate for students from lower socio-economic groups; we need to be clear that that is unacceptable. Whatever a student&#146;s background, that level of inaccuracy is a cause for concern. I acknowledge that change cannot happen overnight.

 The Government are not responsible for the HE applications process.

We had a constructive working party chaired by Sir Alan Wilson, the former director general for higher education at the Department. We achieved a consensus among all the representative bodies in higher education, which sets out a clear timetable for progress on this important issue. It is a two-stage process of reform.</p>

 I can assure my hon. Friend that we have ongoing discussions with all institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge. One of the changes included in the 2008-09 reforms is the concept of a gathered field before the evaluation of applications takes place. Although that will not move the Oxford and Cambridge application date, it should ensure that all applications are dealt with on their merits. That will help to improve the admissions process for those two institutions and many others.</p>

The UCAS figures released earlier this month show a significant rise in applications from students in England. Applications have risen from 271,700 in 2006 to 291,000 this year, which is a very encouraging rise of 7.1 per cent. Among those providing social class data, applications from the lower socio-economic groups have increased from 30.9 per cent. to 31.3 per cent. Although it is true that the rise in applications will have been affected by demographic trends, that explains only a small part of the increase. The population in England is rising, and applications are rising even more strongly. The increase is well in excess of this year&#146;s 0.8 per cent. population growth among 18 to 20-year-olds.</p>

 Before the Minister draws too many firm conclusions from the socio-economic data derived from the UCAS collation of statistics, will he concede that the biggest group in the data is unknowns, because students do not have to tell UCAS which social group they come from? How can we be so certain that the proportion from lower socio-economic groups is going up?</p>

 I concede that one cannot be absolutely certain. We seek to ensure in the best way possible that we get as much information as possible on the backgrounds of students who are applying to university, and UCAS is looking at that. If we are having an adversarial trading of blows on this issue, I know whose position I would much rather be in: I would rather defend the changes which we have made and which the hon. Gentleman opposed. One of the reasons why I am confident that we are protecting access for those from poorer backgrounds is that the new system of student financial support is genuinely progressive and genuinely fairer. Student grants have been reintroduced, and we have ensured that students do not start to repay until they are in work and earning more than &#163;15,000 a year, which is effectively a postgraduate system of repayment that rightly ensures that the greatest resources go to those who are most in need.</p>

 The Minister is right; the robust argument that we had on these Benches during the changes meant that the student support and bursaries were much improved to sweeten the pill. I would be delighted to be proved wrong about participation by people from poorer backgrounds, but the evidence from overseas shows that when fees are raised all the other moves tend to be neutered, so the overall result is neutral. Does the Minister agree that there is a world of difference between having a cap at &#163;3,000 and giving in to the blandishments of some universities to raise the cap and to introduce a system similar to that used in the United States? I hope that he will resist any such blandishments.</p>

 I disagree with my hon. Friend about the evidence from overseas. This debate raged long and hard during our proceedings on the Higher Education Act 2004. In some countries where higher fees have been introduced, there has been an increase in applications. On his core point about what we will do about the cap after 2009, we have made it clear that we will not move until we have seen the first full three years of operation of the new system. There will then be an independent commission. I say, both to those who advocate lifting the gap and to those who say that we should scrap fees now, that both those approaches are premature, because we need to see the full operation of the first three years of the new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70315-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000526">The role of the Office for Fair Access has been significant in helping to smooth the passage of the new system. The introduction of access agreements through which universities can commit publicly to what they will offer students from poorer backgrounds out of the additional income generated from fees has been an important step forward. In the Higher Education Act 2004, we legislated to ensure that a university must have an access agreement approved by OFFA if it wishes to charge more than the basic fee. The introduction of variable fees was an incredibly difficult decision to take, but the Government had the courage to take it, and as I have said, we are being proved right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70315-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000527">I welcome the fact that the Conservative party has shifted its ground on that issue.

Nevertheless, the pamphlet that was produced before Christmas by the Lib Dem think-tank, which fundamentally endorsed the Government&#146;s approach on a post-graduation repayment system, was very significant.</p>

OFFA has been an important success. All the institutions that have chosen to set fees above the basic level have successfully completed an access agreement. I take this opportunity to pay the fullest of tributes to Martin Harris and his team for the outcome that they have secured and for how they have gone about it. As a result, access agreements are in place and forecast to deliver in excess of &#163;300 million per year in bursaries to students. I have no doubt that the right to additional fee income for universities must go hand in hand with a social and  <br>

moral responsibility to students from less advantaged backgrounds. Universities have demonstrated their genuine commitment to that principle through the extent and generosity of the bursary schemes and additional outreach commitments in their access agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70315-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000529">At this juncture, I should refer to the concerns that have been raised about a potential underspend on bursaries in some universities. I have been monitoring that situation very closely. The overall scale of underspend has been exaggerated in some reports. In several universities, including a significant number in the Russell group, the projections are that there will be no underspend at all. Forecasts of spend inevitably carry with them some uncertainty, especially in the first year of an entirely new bursary scheme, and some universities set a high figure for reasons of prudent financial management. I am not in the business of unfairly or unjustly criticising people. OFFA will monitor expenditure and performance annually, and we will have a full picture of year 1 after the relevant monitoring information has been collected this summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70315-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000530">At the same time, universities should be doing all they can to ensure that students get the support to which they are entitled. In recent weeks, several vice-chancellors have explicitly said to me that they intend to invest any underspend in their original bursary estimates on other measures to improve social inclusion. One of them told me:</p>
<a name="70315-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07031532000947"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The money for bursaries is &#145;budgeted out&#146;. If it cannot be spent on bursaries, then it will go to support other widening participation projects.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70315-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000531">That is heartening. I would urge all universities forecasting a genuine underspend on bursaries to take that approach.</p>

 Before we leave the question of bursaries and fees, we must recognise that we are still talking about full-time undergraduates.

 My hon. Friend hits on a key point. The 27 per cent. increase in the part-time student grant that we announced last year was a very significant step forward. However, there remains a challenge. If we simply replicated the full-time system of student financial support for part-timers, there would be an immense amount of dead weight. We need to encourage employers to invest more in the higher education of the people who work for them. Bearing in mind&#151;I am quoting these figures from memory&#151;that 35 to 40 per cent. of part-timers receive a financial contribution from their employer, I do not see why the state should automatically step in through a replication of the full-time student support package in order to absolve the employer of that responsibility. We must ensure that we keep these issues under review to ensure that the part-time student package is as flexible and attractive as possible.</p>

the UCAS figures are definitive&#151;of course not&#151;but if they are correct in so far as they relate to lower socio-economic groups, they are, as the Minister rightly said, very encouraging. There is a great deal more to be done, as he conceded, and the Government have been open in their confession of failure to attract candidates from lower socio-economic groups. We are not doing well enough yet in convincing people of natural ability from poorer backgrounds that university might be the place for them.</p>

It would be quite wrong to blame the vice-chancellors, students or lecturers for those dismal figures, because all three are making huge efforts. Anyone familiar with today&#146;s students or who looks at their CVs knows how much time ambitious students at least seem to spend&#151;who knows, they probably do spend&#151;working with schools in deprived areas to encourage kids to think of themselves as potential university material. That happens to an extent that would have been unimaginable 20 or 25 years ago, or however long it was since I was at university. That is a wonderful thing for students to be doing, it will reap huge dividends over time and it is the way to go. That is why we completely support the objectives of the Aimhigher programme, though I note that the Minister has ordered a review of it and that it is to be cut by &#163;19 million in 2007-08, so I would be grateful if he would explain the consequences of that cut for the objectives that we are all share.</p>

In recent years, the gap in attainment between the free-school-meals lot and the non-free-school-meals lot appears to be widening. Those people do not go on to do A-levels, and the consequence is that there are very few candidates in that socio-economic group with the requisite A-level qualifications to get into university. There were about 850 in that group, all told, who got three grade As at A-level. It is no wonder that it is so hard for the universities, which are keen to meet these political objectives, to show that they are widening access and participation, when they are all chasing the same small number of candidates from those groups.</p>

As in the maintained sector, the number of A-level candidates has increased, by 11 per cent. The key point, however, is that entries have also increased for the crunchy subjects. In 2004, chemistry was up 8.6 per cent.; physics, which, if he remembers, was down 9.1 per cent. in the maintained sector, was up 6.5 per cent.; maths was up 8.5 per cent.; and modern languages, which saw such dismaying declines in the maintained sector, were up 5.5 per cent. overall.

 I am not entirely sure where the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is going.

In 1995, 26 per cent. of new modern languages students came from the independent sector; in 2004, under the present Government&#146;s watch, the figure was up to 30 per cent. Alas, the trend is all the more pronounced at the so-called top universities. I know that we are not allowed to use that phrase, and the Minister carefully avoided it, but as usual I have introduced an unthinkable phrase into our discourse. In 2004, 48 per cent. of the French department at Bristol university came from the independent sector. I do not believe that that is the university&#146;s fault: as any Labour Member with an ounce of fairness would agree, it makes huge efforts to widen participation.

In my experience, universities are not interested in the background of parents; they are interested in the potential and the academic ability of students. I think that it would be disastrous for every university admissions procedure to become a nightmarish discussion about nature versus nurture. I believe that students have a right to withhold that information, and should be judged on their educational performance and potential alone.</p>

 I cannot resist pointing out that during an earlier discourse, the hon.

 I think the Minister knows the answer to that. Indeed, I think he was about to give it to the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). It is perfectly all right, in general, for UCAS to have the information so that we, as a society, can know what kind of people are going to university and can study social progress. What is not right is for university admissions tutors and academics to feel the pressure and oppression of such data, and to be constantly dragged into discussions about the background and parentage of individual candidates when they are seeking to make a judgment about their academic potential. That is wrong, and I hope that the Minister will give students the option to withhold that information.</p>

 I can give the hon. Gentleman some support&#151;although, as a Cambridge academic, I might have to declare an interest to do so. The request for information about parental background was removed from the Cambridge application form because it was thought that applicants might think that it might prejudice their application and that it would have an adverse effect on access.</p>

<p><a name="st_o356"><a name="07031532000591"><a name="70315-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07031532001367"><b>Mr. Johnson:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for injecting some common sense from the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;on this occasion, at least. I hope that the Minister will take account of what he is being told because his position on the matter under discussion is mistaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07031532000592">The imbalance in respect of the uptake of difficult subjects is producing perverse incentives. Let me give an example. The hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) talked about the need to encourage people to study science subjects, and we are all keen to keep our science departments open, but there is a paradox involved in that. If a university admits a good science candidate, the chances are&#151;statistically, this is very likely&#151;that they will come from a relatively well-off background and from a relatively successful school. Therefore, the university might achieve the objectives of admitting a good science candidate and of expanding science education in this country, but it will not achieve the objective of widening participation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000593">As I&#151;and the Minister, too&#151;never tire of saying, in terms of science, success is followed by success. Let me give a statistic that the Minister should have used when addressing the Liberal Democrats: engineering graduates enjoy an earnings increase of &#163;243,730 as opposed to an increase of only &#163;34,494 for those, like the Minister and me, who were so unwise as to study an arts degree. That point is a great advertisement for science, and it should be used more widely by all Members to evangelise on the benefits of the study of science at university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000594">However&#151;to return to my core point&#151;the tragedy is that we deprive our children of a realistic choice of what to study much too early in the system; that happens not at university, but much earlier. As well as taking steps such as recruiting more science teachers and making science more interesting, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) that we should take a harder look at the effects of the league table system, and particularly the extent to which the tables build in disincentives to study what I call the crunchy subjects. As my hon. Friend suggested, it would be a sensible reform if we were to give a special weighting in school performance assessment and league tables to such difficult subjects&#151;which are the subjects that universities look at in particular in deciding on admissions. That is the key to what I, the Minister and everybody else wants to achieve, which is to expand the classic route to university.</p>

 It is particularly important that students have better advice on the right mixture of GCSEs necessary to gain admission to the place they want to go, but we will not solve the problem we are discussing by addressing the careers advice system alone. We must make sure that all children in all schools have equal access to the vital utensils that they will need to get to higher education. The hon. Gentleman trivialises the matter by endlessly banging on about Connexions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000597">Let me turn to a point that has been repeatedly made: everyone involved in universities who is listening to this debate and my speech&#151;and everyone else who is listening&#151;would say that we are missing out addressing a huge chunk of matters relating to how we could widen access to higher education. The hon. Member for Bury, North made just that point a moment ago. We should not think of higher education as an 18-24 issue or even as an 18-30 issue. We have to encourage all sorts of groups to think of themselves as university material at all kinds of ages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000598">We should also be expanding part-time study and it is interesting to hear the focus on that point in the Chamber today. We are clearly all getting pressure from constituents to expand part-time provision and find an imaginative way&#151;I am sure that the Government can think of one&#151;to ensure that part-time students have the same access to financial help as full-time students. That would be very expensive, and I am not making any spending pledge, because I would be immediately jugulated. I am conscious that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) is in his place and watching me very carefully, but it would be good if we could consider the issue. I heard what the Minister said about not wanting to drive out business funding and the point about dead weight is well taken, but there has to be some way to help part-time students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70315-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000599">It is sad that one sector that has declined under this Government is the adult and community learning sector.

 That is very disobliging of the hon. Gentleman, who was being kind to me earlier. I have already made it clear that we have two concerns. The first and most important is that the school system is not adequate for the job of widening participation in the way that we all want to see. That is why we should look again at the league table system and there was some nodding by Labour Members when I made that point&#151;perhaps the hon. Gentleman was nodding  <br>

It is widely recognised that one of the failures of this Government, to which the Minister did not allude, is that there has been a 15 per cent. increase, to 1.25 million, in the number of 16-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training. We are seeing, time and again, the results of failures at earlier stages of education. We need a better vocational route for those people and a better progression from further education to higher education. I am glad that progress has been made, although I realise that the Further Education and Training Bill was a rushed job, spatchcocked together at the last minute&#151;<i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I thought that was what the Minister said. However, he has been imaginative and conciliatory in his solution to the difficult problem of further education colleges issuing degrees with no co-operation with universities. I think he has accepted that articulation agreements will be in the Bill&#151;I hope he will reply on that point&#151;which is a good thing, because the agreements will ensure that there is integration and co-ordination between FE and HE institutions.</p>

Most young people who remain in education after the age of 17 go on to higher education, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), who has left the Chamber, suggested.

I have taken the Education and Skills Committee to visit many of the ivy league universities in the United States. People in those universities do not sit there, concerned and worried about the lack of bright students from less privileged backgrounds. The universities have a technique for identifying where those students are and a rigorous way of going out, finding them and bringing them into their institutions. If we look at the overall performance&#151;particularly of the research-rich universities in our country&#151;it is lacking, in terms of what our universities could learn from the United States. Stanford, Princeton and other leading ivy league universities in America have a map of America that shows every state, city and community. They know where the students are coming from and they know when they are underperforming in terms of attracting students from a particular state or municipality. They are so well organised that they use their alumni, as well as professional staff, to visit schools in areas from which they do not get students.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. American universities, and especially ivy league universities, have greater resources. When one meets a president from somewhere such as Stanford, he will have 50 MBAs standing behind him. That does not happen with most vice-chancellors in most universities in Britain. But let us get the balance right. I am not condemning universities in this country; I am saying that they could do far more in terms of going down their supply chain and looking at where their talent comes from and, if there is a deficiency, doing something positive about it.</p>

enough. We have summer schools, as do many universities. But, without the impetus of the Sutton Trust and Sir Peter Lampl, many universities would not even have gone that far. The hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) and I have visited summer schools in Cambridge. The criterion for someone to go on one of those Cambridge summer schools, which are supported by companies such as Goldman Sachs and organisations such as the Sutton Trust, is that neither parent has been to university. Perhaps it is dreadful that that criterion is used, if the hon. Member for Henley is to be listened to, but the fact is that a high percentage of the young people invited to those summer schools get into Cambridge. So, there is much that can be done. </p>

I am disappointed that more universities have not gone into partnership with academies, or created academies. They could go down their supply chain and choose to be based in communities where they could make a difference and participate in the process long before children choose their subjects. That is the level of partnership that I would like to see our universities indulging in. There is also the new ability to form trusts, which are in some senses less onerous. I would like to see more imagination from our higher education institutions in reaching down the supply chain, identifying the problem and doing something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70315-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000629">Let me make a comparison. The thing that, more than anything else, has stimulated universities in the United Kingdom to move faster towards the American tradition is fundraising. Universities throughout the country now carry out fundraising much more successfully than before, usually because they are copying American techniques. Indeed, many universities are hiring Americans to raise money for their institutions. If more attention were paid to the situation in America&#151;the Americans have a similar culture to ours, and a comparison with continental Europe is much more difficult&#151;we could learn American techniques reasonably quickly. There is much to learn from the United States. Of course, American universities have more resources, but there are now more resources in this country than there have been for a long time because the fundraising of some of our premier institutions has been very successful.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although there are many similarities with the American system, one of the major differences, which has a direct bearing on what he is saying, is that American universities have a well-developed system of keeping their alumni interested in, and supportive of, the university? Does he agree that British universities could try to do that to a greater extent? If they were to succeed, there would be not only more examples of people from less well-off backgrounds who had gone to university on which to draw, but better access to funding.</p>

Those of us who passionately believed in variable fees and still have the bruises from our discussions about them in the House&#151;they were backed by a very narrow vote in the opposition of Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members&#151;are seeing that the measure is showing much success. English universities are out-competing universities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales on applications, and there is evidence that more children in England from deprived social and economic backgrounds are going into higher education than in other parts of the United Kingdom.

We have a problem that the research-rich universities have a disproportionate amount of funding for bursaries compared with the less well-endowed universities, where the need for bursaries is greater.

Independent schools justify their position to me by saying that they put money back into poorer students, but the &#147;poorer students&#148; to whom they give bursaries tend to be those with parents who are not very well-off and are struggling with the fees, rather than children who are from very poor backgrounds, but have ability.

 No, it does not, because we only have one year&#146;s figures to look at in considering the impact of fees. As we have said, we will look very carefully at the figures for the three years. One reason why Labour Members believed that the variable fees option was the way to go was that we understood clearly that although expenditure on education across the piece had increased substantially under the Labour since 1997, less of an increase had been affordable in higher education. We knew that realistically, there was one way to get new resources for the higher education system, and we knew that there was one way to start  <br>

paying staff in higher education properly&#151;something that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) will perhaps appreciate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70315-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000637">Let us remember that we still have many world-class universities of which we should be proud, but we cannot take them for granted, and if we do not pay academic staff adequate salaries we will not get the talent coming through. People will not choose an academic or research career, but will instead go to the City of London, which everyone seems to think is the acme of success. They will not choose to give something back by teaching in a higher education institution. There has to be a balance; if people choose that pathway, they should earn an adequate income for doing so. I have a vested interest, as I am still a vestigial member of whatever the Association of University Teachers is called these days. I also have a son-in-law who is a struggling academic; they will all tell you that they are still struggling on their salaries, which compare badly with those in the United States.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again, and I appreciate his supportive comments about rates of pay for my colleagues in academia, but he should appreciate that the amount of money that universities, especially research universities, get from tuition fees is actually quite small, compared with the university budget as a whole. In Cambridge the total university income is something like &#163;500 million, and the net income from fees is less than &#163;20 million, so academic pay is not entirely determined&#151;in fact, is hardly determined at all&#151;by tuition fees.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman is quibbling a bit. The fact is that a significant tranche of new money came in, and will continue to come in, for higher education. One of the great things about the university system in this country is its relative autonomy from government. It is far superior to the rather centralised systems in continental Europe. One of the reasons why I know the details is that the Select Committee on Education and Skills is considering the Bologna accord at the moment, and we have taken evidence on the subject.</p>

 In a moment. The very different tradition in mainland Europe, and difference in the history of its universities, has been brought home to me. We should surely nurture a system in which there is greater independence from government. We were talking about receiving money from alumni, and we are now talking about receiving money from fees, and surely that arrangement is part of the health and strength of a relatively independent higher education system. It adds to universities&#146; viability and independence. It means that in many years&#146; time, long after we have stopped strutting this stage, we will have a university and higher education system that maintains itself, and has independence and integrity. Surely the hon. Member for Cambridge would agree with that.</p>

 When the Select Committee intervened and held a session to try to bring the two sides together in the pay dispute, I asked the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers whether she was embarrassed about taking the money after opposing the proposal. She said that she did not feel any embarrassment at all. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, I am glad that she spoke up for her members in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70315-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000646">Another problem affecting access to higher education is the existence of subcultures. We can discuss the problem in an airy manner, but some children face barriers to higher education. As I travel around England looking at the problem and talking to students, I meet people in my own community and in other communities, and I have discovered that there are distinct subcultures in which people do not believe that higher education can play a part in their life. They do not know anyone who went into higher education, and they do not have any neighbours in higher education. They live in communities where that aspiration is not voiced, so there is a tremendous onus on their teachers to introduce them to higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70315-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000647">It is extremely difficult to tackle that problem. We know which parts of the country, which wards and which postcode areas are affected, so we must identify the relevant schools so that we can support them in raising aspirations and giving students the imagination to think about going to university. With my colleagues in the Select Committee, I try to visit schools around the country and talk not only to teachers but to parent and students. We know when we are in part of the country where that aspiration is low. I recently visited a Yorkshire school&#151;it is not in my constituency&#151;in a white working-class area of social housing. The head told me, &#147;We don&#146;t have many aspirations that these children will go into higher education.&#148; That attitude made me angry, as it is rare that one hears such low aspirations from teachers.</p>

We know where they are, which is why I want more active participation by the Government, through whatever agency, so that schools can raise the aspirations of their students and tackle the problem. There are other subcultures that worry me, too. I have four children, two of whom went to Cambridge, one to Bristol and one to Edinburgh. I accept that I am lucky that my children all went to university in towns and cities that are accessible and pleasant to visit. They went to local comprehensives, and they all said that there is a subculture in those universities that puts off a hell of lot of children from ordinary backgrounds. I do not know as much about Oxford as the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and other Oxford graduates in the Chamber, but a subculture dominated by the independent sector and the leading public schools is prevalent in our research-rich universities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70315-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000649">That problem is underestimated. In the past five years, the number of students from Eton going to Oxford and Cambridge has grown from 38 to 70  <br>

I do not wish to condemn those schools, but Oxford, Cambridge&#151;and, I admit, the London School of Economics&#151;are regarded almost as finishing schools for our leading independent schools. That is not the only problem, as a subculture has been set up within those universities. Having discussed the issue with my children, who have been to those universities, I know that there is another Oxford, another Edinburgh and another Bristol. That subculture is extremely off-putting to children from other&#151;</p>

That is tragic, and it also shows that the hon. Gentleman is failing to address the key point of the debate. If we want to widen access to higher education, there is no point in blaming the people who are at Russell group universities for being in some way off-putting&#151;a pathetic argument, which will be bitterly resented by Russell group universities, because they make huge efforts to widen participation.

 The point is that the figures quoted by the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) conceal the fact that in the 1960s direct grant grammar schools were deemed to be part of the maintained system. That figure comes from the redefinition of which schools were in the maintained system, which is completely irrelevant to widening participation.</p>

 As one of the working-class kids who was not put off by Cambridge&#146;s atmosphere and who went on to interview applicants for Cambridge undergraduate courses for 20 years, may I say that the reason why there is a different cut-off point for the Cambridge entrance procedure has to do with the desire to interview as many applicants as possible in as short a time as possible, in order to be fair in comparing various applicants.

 I want to end my remarks by saying this: this country must use all the potential of all the people. One valuable point that has come out of today&#146;s debate is that we are not focusing simply on the potential of young people at 18 or 21. As my hon. Friends have said, part-time students and mature students are entering higher education in larger numbers; you will know something about that, Madam Deputy Speaker. People are deciding to enter higher education later, which is a success story. We want people with potential to be able to go into higher education, if it is right for them. It is not right for everyone.</p>

United States, they say, &#147;We don&#146;t interview. If we wanted more people like us, we would interview.&#148; Many people in this country are hooked up to the view that interviews are the best way to identify talent. We restrict the scope of people who enter higher education by using interviews. Some universities do not interview, but the research-rich universities tend to interview.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000685">In the United States most universities use five different criteria on which to judge a student, including written work, standard assessment tests and recommendations from teachers. Those five criteria are used to judge not only examination passes and grades, but whether students have the potential to benefit from the institution. That goes to the heart of today&#146;s debate. If we are going to do something radical about getting into higher education all the talents who could be there, we must change how we assess potential at every level of our education system.</p>

 I enjoyed the long speech by the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), and I enjoyed some of the interventions even more. One of the other jobs that I do for my party in this House is to sit on the Select Committee on Education and Skills, which the hon. Gentleman chairs, and yesterday we visited the Natural History museum together to see the outreach work that it does in education. We did not see any Liberal Democrat creatures among the specimens there, nor Etonian creatures for that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000687">When the Minister opened our debate, he rightly referred to the economic reasons why we need to get more people educated to level 4 or degree standard. The Leitch report, which has not been mentioned by name so far, has the rather challenging target of increasing from 29 per cent. to 40 per cent. the number of people in our work force who are educated to degree level. The stark statistic in the report, though, is that 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force have already left formal education. That suggests that the people who will need to go into higher education in order to achieve that target by 2020 will be the people who are currently in work, which suggests in turn that an even greater proportion of people than now will be studying for degrees part-time. Moreover, a greater contribution will probably be made by the further education college sector, which already contributes about 14 per cent. of the people who study for degrees. Those are some of the topics that we have not heard a great deal about this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000688">We are here to discuss widening participation in higher education, which is about much more than simply increasing the stock of the population&#151;the human capital&#151;with a degree. Throughout the past few decades, because a greater proportion of the population have gone into higher education&#151;we hear about fiscal drag; perhaps this is educational drag&#151;people from all classes have participated to a higher degree. None the less, there are still some alarming gaps, which means that we do not have a broad mix of social classes within higher education. For instance, over the past 15 years the proportion of people with unskilled or manual worker parents who go on into  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Mar 2007">

<notus-date day="15" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>15 Mar 2007 : Column 516</b><br>
higher education has increased from 11 per cent. to 19 per cent., whereas the proportion of children who have parents with non-manual or professional occupations has increased from 35 per cent. to 50 per cent. The social groups at either end of the social spectrum, as measured by the Office for National Statistics, have increased their participation in higher education, but nevertheless the gap has widened. If we go back 40 years, the proportion of students from the lowest socio-economic group of all has barely changed&#151;it has increased, but the increase has not been dramatic&#151;whereas the highest socio-economic group of students with professionally qualified parents who have been to university themselves has a participation rate in higher education of more than 80 per cent. That implies that we have reached saturation point in that social group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000689">There are other differences in society. Nobody has referred to the gender difference that is opening up in higher education. For some years, the Government&#146;s favourite measurement of initial participation rates in higher education, for which they have the target of 50 per cent.&#151;although they do not talk about it much any more&#151;has been stuck at about 42 per cent. However, that is an average, and underneath that average we find that the participation rate is 37 per cent. for male students and 47 per cent. for girls&#151;a 10 per cent. gap that is widening with each year that passes. That trend continues in the most recent UCAS application statistics, which the Minister is fond of quoting. There are 221,000 applications from women and 174,000 applications from young men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000690">As many hon. Members have acknowledged, a large part of the explanation for that difference lies further back in the educational system: it reflects attainment at school, not just the higher education process itself. In future, the gap between girls and boys may actually have some beneficial aspects in society. The salary premium has been mentioned a couple of times. At the moment, male graduates tend to get the higher salary premium because of the kind of professions that males and females have traditionally gone into. Perhaps the widening gender gap means that women will start to dominate in some of the higher earning professions such as medicine, law and accountancy. That might be a good spin-off benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000691">The ethnic gap has not been mentioned. In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) on 13 March, the Minister gave the latest available statistics, which show that only 305 students who identify themselves as black African, black British or black Afro-Caribbean, and only 300 who identify themselves as being of Bangladeshi origin went to Russell group universities. That is a pitifully small number, which does not get the attention that it deserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000692">Geographical variations have also emerged from the underlying trends. My constituency, along with others such as Sheffield, Hallam, is in the top category for participation in higher education. However, Bristol, South&#151;which the Paymaster General represents and is just over the river from my constituency&#151;and Nottingham, South are the bottom two parliamentary constituencies for participation in higher education. In one city, which is one of the most prosperous cities in Europe, and the most prosperous in this country after London and  <br>

Edinburgh according to some measurements, there are stark differences in educational attainment and participation in higher education.</p>

 I am listening attentively to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument and I agree with the thrust of it. Will he comment on the extent to which Bristol university has extended access to students from St. Paul&#146;s, which I believe is the ward to which he refers, and contrast that with the work of London Guildhall university, which has a remarkable record of widening participation for ethnic minority communities?</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, although the Government have made some progress with black African ethnic minorities, the representation of Asian Indians in higher education institutions has gone backwards? How does he explain the disparity between the wide range of ethnic minority children and white children that appears to exist at universities?</p>

 I thank my Select Committee colleague for his intervention. It is perhaps for the Minister rather than me to explain matters on behalf of the Government. However, even within the white group to which he refers, there are enormous variations between social classes. It is a flaw in the statistics that they do not reflect that. The participation rates of white boys from council estates in higher education are probably even lower than those of students who identify themselves as being from the different ethnic groups that we discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000697">In my constituency, eight wards have higher education participation rates that exceed 43 per cent., which is the highest figure that is given in the Higher Education Funding Council&#146;s statistics. However, nine wards in Bristol, South have participation rates of below 16 per cent. In Bristol, North-West, Southmead ward has a participation rate of less than 10 per cent. Westbury on Trym, which is next door, but happens, by a quirk of the boundary, to be in my constituency, has a participation rate that exceeds 60 per cent. I shall not breach the rule about props, but simply mention that the cover of HEFCE&#146;s compendium of statistics, which I am holding, displays a map of the Bristol wards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000698">There are similar pockets elsewhere. Not many representatives of rural constituencies are currently in the Chamber, but participation rates are unacceptably low in parts of Cornwall, Devon and other rural seats. </p>

 Yes, I agree absolutely. I intend to say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000702">The 2003 review of Steven Schwartz showed that of the top three Office for National Statistics social groups, 47 per cent. get the requisite A-levels to go on into higher education, compared with 23 per cent.&#151;fewer than half&#151;of classes 4, 5, 6 and 7. A large part of the problem could be dealt with, I believe, by the reform of the curriculum. Some points were raised about that in Education and Skills questions this morning. The reason why people are not achieving more at 16 or are not motivated to stay on beyond 16 probably lies in the school curriculum itself. Although we have a statutory school leaving age of 16, I think that many people in our communities leave school mentally at 14 or even younger. That is the big challenge for the Minister and his ministerial colleagues&#151;to make sure that the 14-to-19 diplomas start to arrest that alarming situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000703">The Minister initially disputed the fact&#151;though not when it was repeated&#151;that 90 per cent. of people, from whatever social class, who get their A-levels go on into higher education. The big problem is therefore young people not reaching the standard of qualifications that they need. School reform is clearly outside the scope of this particular debate, Madam Deputy Speaker, but there are things that universities and higher education colleges can do about the problem. The Government&#146;s programme has a role to play, but universities can do more through their outreach work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000704">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), I take part in the Royal Society MP-scientist shadowing programme, which I find extremely worthwhile. Last year, the chemist who was shadowing me&#151;I was shadowing her on that particular occasion&#151;helped me to find out much more about Bristol university&#146;s outreach work in Bristol schools and further afield in rural parts of Gloucestershire. It does much to enthuse children about the excitement of science&#151;chemistry in that case&#151;and to encourage school teachers into the university department to upgrade their skills and take them back into the classroom. Those teachers then help to get some of their children interested in what higher education has to offer them.</p>

We have a part to play in trying to tackle them. When it comes to our parliamentary role in visiting schools, I think that I can trump the hon. Member for Huddersfield today, because I visited a school before I came here on Monday morning, and on Friday I will visit two primary schools and a secondary school as well. Like the hon.

as I can. We can find out far more about what is going on in our schools by visiting them than we can even by attending Select Committee hearings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70315-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000707">Another barrier to participation in higher education is undoubtedly the burden of debt, exacerbated by fees and the different financial arrangements that students now face. The Minister has been crowing, as we all expected, about the latest UCAS statistics, which has been echoed by some, though not all, of his hon. Friends. The figures show that UK applications have gone up from about 371,000 to about 395,000&#151;an overall increase of 23,624, to be precise. The point has already been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge that the number of 17 and 18-year-olds who could have applied has gone up by 30,000.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman distance his party from some of the remarks that were made before the last election about tuition fees discouraging students from applying to go to university? We now have evidence that that is not the case. Will he also accept responsibility for discouraging some young people from low income backgrounds in my constituency from going to university, because his party&#146;s representation of tuition fees made no mention of the reintroduction of bursaries and grants?</p>

 No, I will not accept responsibility for that. In every speech that I made in the 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns, whether I was talking to schoolchildren or to people in student unions who had already gone to university, I was careful to make the point that if they had the educational attainment and the ambition to go to university, they should not let the prospect of debt put them off, because university would transform their lives. I am sure that all my fellow Liberal Democrat candidates would have said the same thing. I was actually trying to do some of the Government&#146;s work for them, and I continue to do it. However, that does not mean that we can disregard the fact that debt will be perceived by some students as a barrier to their going into higher education, or that it might well skew their occupational choices thereafter.</p>

To do so seems rather perverse, however, given that, underneath that statistic, there has also been an increase in the number of teenagers who are eligible to apply to university. We can get lots of good news out of the way in one go this afternoon, because the number of teenagers who are eligible to apply to go to university will increase every year between now and 2011. I am sure that the Minister will therefore have lots of good news for us in the future.</p>

 I do not think that it is perverse to celebrate the fact that a higher number of students are leaving school more qualified to go to university. The hon. Gentleman said earlier that we had effectively reached saturation point among the better-off going to university. Clearly, the level of payment that people in the better-off groups are making is not affecting their entry into higher education. Is he arguing that the better-off should be paying more, to subsidise the least well off?</p>

 That was a rather convoluted economic point. All students will have had their debt increased in the current year by &#163;3,000 when they leave university, no matter what social group they come from. The debt burden will be the same for all of them. The Minister appears to be grunting, and I recognise that the Government have introduced bursaries and maintenance grants, but students use those to live off while they are at university.

 The arrangements that a modern-day applicant has to face are so convoluted, compared with those that we all had to deal with, that I am not sure that we can make that judgment.

One swallow does not make a summer, and one blip this year does not make for a statistical trend either. Over the past few years, as different financial arrangements have come into play, higher education statistics have been on a rollercoaster, and that will continue for the next few years as students under the old regime leave, and those who have to face the new regime join the system. It is too early for the Government or Labour Back Benchers to justify retrospectively the decision in 2004. They certainly cannot rely on one data set from one year of applications to imply that it will be okay to take the cap off fees in 2009. Such far-reaching policy conclusions cannot be made on the basis of one year&#146;s worth of statistics.</p>

Why does it have to be three years? It is not three years everywhere else, as we know from discussions we have had elsewhere about the Bologna arrangements. Perhaps the period could be condensed. Do students really need the long holidays that are required by the academics who teach them? If we condensed the programme of study into two years, the debt with which students leave university would undoubtedly decrease, and that would draw more people in.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for correcting me. I trust that the research takes place in the courts of Cambridge and not on a Mediterranean island&#151;unless it is archaeological research, of course.

Widening participation is not merely about increasing the total volume of people who enter higher education; it is also about the institutions at which they study. Some higher education institutions have been extremely successful in attracting more students. I recently visited the university of Bedfordshire in Luton, where 60 per cent. of students come from areas with a Luton postcode, and I have already mentioned the contribution made by further education colleges to attracting members of the local community to higher education. However, it is not just a question of going to university; it is a question of where people go.</p>

I had never met people of that sort before, but, unlike other Members who have spoken today, I was not put off by that, and to this day some of my best friends are people who went to those schools. Nevertheless, fair access must be an aim of widening participation. It is not just a question of increasing numbers; it is a question of ensuring that people have fair access to our top universities, a phrase that has been used a number of times today.</p>

given A-Level grades, while others&#151;including, regrettably, Bristol, of which I am an alumnus and which I now represent in Parliament, as well as Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Nottingham&#151; fall short of their expected intake of students from social classes 4 to 7. I will not restart the debate between the hon. Member for Huddersfield&#151;who has left the Chamber&#151;and the hon. Member for Henley about the state school-private school gap, but as recent reports have shown it is widening in some higher education institutions. That leads to there being an important role for those institutions to play. I have mentioned the local outreach work that universities do; I know that Bristol university does that in local schools, and I am sure that all other universities also do such work.</p>

I see no reason why such programmes could not take place at our universities as well. Under the &#147;widening participation&#148; postcode-related grants that universities receive from the HEFC for taking students from certain backgrounds, there is, effectively, a financial incentive. As we know where those low participation postcodes are, why can we not encourage universities to reach well beyond what they consider to be almost a catchment area and pair them off with particular schools, especially those in low participation areas, so that they can enthuse and draw in students from such backgrounds? When I was doing my own university applications&#151;before somebody brings this up, I admit that I am an Oxford reject&#151;I noticed from reading the Oxford prospectus that certain Oxford colleges have historical links to particular schools. Why cannot some of our universities develop links with certain state schools?</p>

Fees might skew the choice of subject that people make. We know that there is already a social imbalance in certain subjects: 45 per cent. of the medicine and dentistry intake come from the highest socio-economic group&#151;higher managerial and professional people&#151;compared with 8 per cent. from class 6, which covers semi-routine occupations. The figure for class 7 is so low that it is not even reported. The balance is better in law and business. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, so it is better in the professions of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and me, but, curiously, the trend is the opposite in education and teaching. Only 14 per cent. of the intake for degrees that lead to teaching careers is from the highest socio-economic group. We are also worried that the intake for science subjects is skewed.

Many Members have cited statistics this afternoon. What is clear is that it is far too early to know with certainty whether fees are having a detrimental effect, but we certainly know that there is a lot more work to be done in widening participation.</p>

I wanted to refer to my visit. Professor Latchman is a dynamic leader of that institution, whose president is the distinguished historian, Professor Eric Hobsbawm. Birkbeck is a higher education institution serving one of the great cities of the world and a range of students who largely study part-time. I was impressed by the fact that it is ahead of Government and other thinking about how we address the skills deficit and widening participation, especially in its innovative project to develop a new campus in the east of London and the Thames Gateway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70315-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07031532000748">Professor Latchman raised important issues, with which I am sure many Members are familiar, about ensuring that part-time study is better supported. Before I go through them, I should point out that many other higher education institutions that are supportive of part-time students, such as London South Bank university, my own university&#151;Swansea&#151;and the North East Wales institute of higher education, would also benefit if we addressed the economic barrier faced by part-time students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70315-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07031532000749">Professor Latchman made the following points: first, it is necessary to make use of full economic costing in determining the allocation of teaching funds, to recognise the higher cost of part-time provision; secondly, the funding allocation must be responsive to the flexible and modular patterns of study followed by part-time students; and, finally, there must be recognition that the present funding method has limited scope for increasing part-time fee rates as a means of closing the funding gap faced by many institutions, such as Birkbeck, which have a large number of part-time students. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the points raised by Birkbeck and similar institutions.</p>

The Government have done outstanding work in supporting carers&#151;from the Prime Minister&#146;s national carers strategy in 1999, which established the carers special grant, to my Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which the Government supported and highlighted the importance of education and training opportunities for carers, and the Work and Families Act 2006, which gives carers the right to request flexible working. To build on that progress, I believe that the current review of the national carers strategy should recognise the pioneering work of the National Extension college in helping carers to access further and higher education. There should be a section in the new review on carers&#146; ability to access such opportunities. That would contribute enormously to addressing the question of social exclusion and the need to widen the participation of this very important group. The whole question of the 21-hour rule is a serious barrier to carers studying part-time.</p>

The challenge before us today is much easier than it was 150 years ago, when the university of Wales was established. The pennies of the poor, which inspired the establishment of the university of Wales, still inspire developments such as the Community university of the valleys, with which I was associated, Birkbeck college&#146;s fine work in east London, and&#151;most inspirationally of all&#151;London South Bank university&#146;s partnership with universities in South Africa to widen participation for black and coloured peoples, women, and working class people in that new country. It is the task of this Labour Government to sustain, widen and deepen such initiatives so that they are not marginal, but are mainstream in our higher education system. That would be a real achievement.</p>

 I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis), because I want to pick up on some of the points that he made about part-time students, but also because I share with him an interest that I should declare: until fairly recently, my wife was in charge of widening participation at Warwick university. I should put that on the record from the outset, before I start complimenting Warwick university on all the wonderful work that it did until recently to widen participation&#151;and, of course, is still doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000759">It is quite apparent from what we have heard in the debate so far that the issue of widening participation in higher education has been around for a great many years, but the issue has changed and developed. Whereas once upon a time we might have talked about the need to bring more women into higher education, as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) has just observed, that is most distinctly no longer the issue. If anything, the issue is now the opposite of that. It is just as true to say that, as the Secretary of State observed yesterday and this morning, we must look at how to bring more white working-class boys and young men into higher education, as to say that we must look at many ethnic minority groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000760">The issue is changing and developing and we find new challenges within it. One of those new challenges, to which reference has also been made, is the need to bring more disabled people into higher education. That brings with it specific challenges that are to do with the need to persuade people with disabilities, whether physical or mental, that university is an environment within which they can thrive. I say that because, for those with a disability, it is particularly challenging and worrying to have to adapt to a new environment. It is important for that group that we make every effort to ensure that the environment is reassuring and that the development that they will need to find within the environment that they will move into will be suitable for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000761">Above all&#151;this applies not just to disabled potential students, but to many of the other groups that we have talked about&#151;we need to find new and imaginative ways to persuade people of something on which everyone has focused. I am talking about the issue of explaining how it is that, despite their initial perception, university is a place within which they can do well and feel comfortable. One of the most imaginative and effective ways to do that is to develop mentoring programmes. If it is possible to demonstrate to someone that a student who is just like them&#151;in terms of their background, the challenges that they have faced and the interests that they share&#151;has done well at university, that is the most effective way that I can think of to show a prospective student that they  <br>

will also do well in a university setting. I hope that what the Government have in mind for developing the widening of participation in higher education will include an element of mentoring because that is very effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000762">I want to widen the debate beyond the issues about which we have talked at some length and to concentrate on how we can broaden out the 18-to-30 age group that is going into university. We could widen participation among those outside that group. I disagree with the Government&#146;s 50 per cent. target for participation in higher education among the 18-to-30 age group for several reasons. One of the target&#146;s flaws is the fact that it tends to focus too much attention on that age group and thus to underline the perception that higher education is only for people between the ages of 18 and 30 and that when one reaches the age of 30, it is no longer an appropriate course to pursue. That is profoundly wrong, and it is entirely at variance with other things that the Government are properly trying to do to develop the idea of education being a lifelong experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000763">In many ways, the problem is mirrored by what is happening with adult learning courses. For perfectly understandable reasons, the Learning and Skills Council is focusing its attention and funding on the 14-to-25 age group, but the people who suffer are those outside that age group who are trying to attend adult learning courses later in life. Again, I understand why that focus is there and I sympathise with many of the reasons for it. However, one of its consequences is that it underlines the perception that if one has not taken the chance to go into higher education early in life, one cannot do so later. Such a situation would be profoundly regrettable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000764">I am not making my point solely to criticise the Government because, contrarily, I think that they are trying to deal with the situation. It is important that people understand that education, and especially higher education, is about second chances as well as first chances. Someone who did not go into higher education should be able to do so later, and people who, for whatever reason, went into higher education and then came out of it should be able to go back. Academics and those involved in higher education often say that people who go back into higher education later in life after an initial only-too-brief experience have done proportionately better on the second occasion and better than others who have gone straight into higher education. There is a lot to be said for the opportunity to go in, or back in, at a later date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000765">It is important that we develop the idea of lifelong learning and consider widening participation in that context. We face a changing economic world in which few people of my age or younger will be able to look forward to one career from the moment they leave education to the moment they retire. We have realised that that is true for manual trades and technical professions, but we might not have recognised it quite so comprehensively for the professional or academic fields. For people in those fields, too, there will be huge burdens of retraining and expectations of re-education, so universities have a massive part to play in developing that re-education and retraining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000766">I accept that that already happens, to an extent, so I congratulate universities on what they do. They already  <br>

effectively provide continuing professional development for those in mid-career who wish to develop their skills. I would like to see more of that. However, we face a particular challenge when addressing those who are between careers because, for whatever reason, they have left their particular employment or profession. Such people might wish to retrain and re-educate themselves so that they can go forward in a different field. However, those people are often in an especially difficult position. Employers, of course, see it as in their interests to pay for the continuing professional and academic development of their staff, so they do so. The universities find that helpful and they provide a good service. However, people who are between careers have a problem because they do not, by definition, have an employer that can help to fund what they wish to do to retrain, to be re-educated, or to re-skill. How are they to fund what they wish to do? Those individuals face particular problems. The hon. Member for Aberavon mentioned people who wished to become part-time students; overwhelmingly, the people I am describing will wish to study part-time, rather than full-time. They may face caring responsibilities, or more general family responsibilities, and they may well be obliged to earn money while studying. They will almost certainly face the challenge of having to re-acquaint themselves with how studying and learning works, because they will have been absent from education for some time. They will face particular challenges, and although the issue is partly about how we can structure their education experience so that they feel more comfortable with it, it is substantially about funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000767">I do not have a magic solution to offer the Minister any more than anyone else does, but neither his Government nor any other Government can simply say, &#147;The issue is too difficult and complicated; we won&#146;t address these problems.&#148; An answer must be found, because the group of people to whom I am referring will become ever larger, and will have ever more demanding needs. We need to find a way to ensure that their educational experience is comfortable, and we need to ensure that they can afford to undertake those educational tasks and can sustain themselves economically while they do so. That is partly because of the economic benefits that they will receive, but partly because of the benefits that we will all receive if more people reach a higher standard in education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07031532000768">There are wider benefits to higher education, too, but very little has been said about them this afternoon. There are huge cultural benefits, benefits of well-being, and straightforward health benefits to higher education and further education. We have an increasingly ageing population that will need to return to education more often. People may wish to return to education once their working life is done. They may well want to re-enter some form of education during what may be a very long retirement, in order to keep their brain active and keep themselves interested, and we should encourage that. Why should we not talk about widening participation in higher education for those in retirement? They will have the time, and may have the income, to go into higher education. There must be considerable advantages to our society of encouraging people to keep their brains active, given that we know that dementia, Alzheimer&#146;s and other conditions among older people will be an increasing drain on the health budget.</p>

It should not be expected or anticipated that a person&#146;s education will finish when they are 16, 24, 60 or 84. It should genuinely be an opportunity that people may take advantage of at any stage of their life. If we can achieve that, we will genuinely have widened participation.</p>

 I, too, congratulate the Minister on introducing today&#146;s debate. Like many others in the House, I share a real interest in widening participation in higher education. As hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000771">The debate is important, because it underpins values held by the Labour party, most notably the value of securing equal opportunity for all socio-economic groups when it comes to education. That is one of our foundations, and it remains an important aspiration. I am sorry to start on a contentious note, but I could not disagree more with the hon. Members for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) about the Government&#146;s aspiration of getting 50 per cent. of young people into higher education. We have to look closely at why the Government set that target. It has helped us to shape the debate about higher education by focusing it clearly on getting more people into HE.</p>

 I accept, as does the hon. Lady, that it is a good thing to get more people into higher education, so I do not object to the target on those grounds. However, if we set a target of 50 per cent. we instantly suggest to young people who are seeking to go to university that if they do not do so, they must be in the bottom half. There is no problem in saying that we want as many people as possible to go to university who have the capability and ambition to do so, and who will benefit from the experience, but there is no reason for putting a figure on it.</p>

 I accept that point only insofar as we should not rest with the minimum. We must do everything that we can to encourage as many young people and other age groups to go to university.

In the past couple of years, I have had the opportunity of visiting India and China, where there is massive investment in the higher education system and a hunger for learning among young people. If we are to compete in future we must ensure that our young people have suitable skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07031532000775">There are other reasons for extending higher education opportunities. Recent forecasts by the Institute of Employment Research show that half of the 12 million jobs&#151;some 6 million&#151;likely to become vacant between 2004 and 2014 will be in occupations most likely to employ graduates. Graduates are more likely to enjoy better health and are less likely to commit crime. They are much more likely to engage actively in civil society, and we need no other reason for trying to encourage access to higher education. So far, the Government&#146;s record is quite good. Since 1997, university applications for undergraduate enrolment have risen by about 23 per cent., and there has been a 28 per cent. increase for postgraduates. The proportion of first-degree entrants to university from state schools has risen, as has the number of young people going to university from low-participation areas. About 28.2 per cent. of young entrants to first degree courses are from the lowest socio-economic groups, which shows that good progress has been made on achieving the 50 per cent. target. However, Government Members are not at all complacent, and we accept that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve the 50 per cent. target and, indeed, exceed it, as we all want to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07031532000776">To achieve that goal, the Government have taken a number of steps to improve the admissions process. In particular, they have sought to raise aspirations. Not only do we have to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for everyone, but we must ensure that we raise the aspirations of people in the lowest socio-economic groups, as well as their attainment at university level. That means encouraging more young people to engage in post-16 learning. As well as young people doing A-levels and going straight on to university, there has been an increase in part-time study at university.</p>

the MP for City of Durham, I draw attention to the work of Durham university and New college Durham. Durham university is one of our leading research institutions. It would probably accept that it could do more to widen access. Nevertheless, it has a school targeted aspiration raising scheme, which it calls STARS, fortunately. That is targeted at local schoolchildren aged 14 to 16 to give them an idea of what it is like to be a student. They are brought into the university for study days and given mentors in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07031532000780">I also want to draw attention to the mentoring scheme that Durham university runs through Collingwood college for its students to mentor looked-after children. We need to put more effort into raising the educational attainment of looked-after children, and the mentoring scheme has been shown to be extremely successful in raising the aspirations of those children. The Government should try and think of ways in which that scheme could be rolled our further. Durham university does all the things that almost all education institutions in the country do, by offering master classes, summer schools, talks and tours for years 12 and 13.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07031532000781">New college Durham undertakes activities though the Aimhigher programme. It has a target of taking 75 per cent. of its students from low income neighbourhoods. We should applaud that target and the college&#146;s efforts to work with local schools and other colleges to meet it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07031532000782">There are a few topics on which I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s comments. We have heard the figures that show that the Government are making considerable progress towards the 50 per cent. target, but there is more to do. What role will extending foundation degrees, particularly vocational foundation degrees, play in achieving the target? How might the Further Education and Training Bill address the issue by giving colleges the ability to award their own foundation degrees? What more can be done to encourage universities, particularly ones like Durham, where the majority of the intake comes from the independent sector, to get more applications and more students from state schools into our best universities, and to ensure that some of those students come from lower income backgrounds, to raise aspirations across the board? Will the Education and Inspections Act 2006 be an important factor in that respect in terms of extending the right of schools to have a sixth form?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70315-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07031532000783">Will the Minister acknowledge that there is still a need to streamline all the different organisations involved in promoting skills and skills development? The situation is incredibly confusing for not only young people, but older people who are trying to get back into higher or further education, because they are bombarded with information from a huge number of agencies. There needs to be better liaison between local authorities, learning and skills councils and schools in an area in order to plan effectively.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate. We all agree that, as the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) has outlined, the issue that we are discussing this afternoon is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70315-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000787">To be fair, the Government have committed enormous resources and effort to trying to widen participation and improve fair access to higher education; they have spent some &#163;350 million of taxpayers&#146; hard-earned cash on that in recent times. I criticise them not for their commitment but for their use of outdated dogma, and to some extent for their incompetence. The Government suffer from the same problems that afflict many in the education establishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70315-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000788">I have looked at a number of briefings for this debate from organisations ranging from the National Union of Students to the Association of Colleges, many of which make the same basic error. They seem to believe that the Government can do everything&#151;that the Government can intervene and change the world to create a perfect model of society. I suggest that the lesson of the past 10 years is the opposite of that: we need less interference in order to achieve more success. The old saying &#147;Less is more&#148; is relevant in this particular case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70315-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000789">Part of the problem is that the Government have approached increasing participation from the bottom socio-economic groups from the wrong end. As my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) has said, much of the problem in getting a wider section of social groups into higher education lies in primary and secondary schools and the social problems in the areas surrounding those schools. As several hon. Members have said, there is a poverty of aspiration in many parts of the country today, and far too many parents have a poverty of aspiration for their children. We can set as many artificial and socially engineered targets as we like, but if we do not tackle that poverty of aspiration, improvements will be difficult to achieve and maintain. Our schools, both primary and secondary, do not currently provide a significant ladder of opportunity for social classes 4 to 7 as measured by UCAS.</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Henley said, the latest wheeze is to record whether applicants&#146; parents went to university so that admissions tutors can make judgments as to which candidates deserve to go to their universities. Our great academic institutions are being encouraged to pick students not on merit but on the basis of what their father did decades before. After last week&#146;s debate, some will appreciate the irony of this Government&#146;s establishing a new hereditary principle. Universities are being penalised for not hitting arbitrary targets for the number of poor students they should be taking; several have had funds cut as a result. That kind of social engineering attacks the problem from completely the wrong end, and does nothing to resolve the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70315-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000792">One thing that the Government may have got right, although it is still too early to tell for certain, is top-up fees. The figures suggest that after last year&#146;s dip, this year&#146;s applications have climbed by about 7 per cent. That is good, but as we have heard, the NUS and others, including the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams), suggest that it may be related to the demographic bulge.</p>

 Well, we will see about that. The NUS also makes a significant point about the 42 per cent. of higher education students who are part-time, about whose socio-economic class we do not have much information. For poorer students, there is something to be said for an annual grant of &#163;2,700 plus a university bursary and interest-free loans that do not have to be paid back until they start earning. That may incentivise some poorer students to go to university; it certainly should not disincentivise them, as the Liberal Democrat spokesman suggested, particularly as fees are not paid up front. What I find less convincing, and less attractive, about that model is its effect on those who fall just above the qualification level. As always, students and parents who are just above the qualification level for such grants and bursaries face the biggest barriers to entry.</p>

However, within the overall context of widening participation, policy mistakes are limiting access for poorer socio-economic groups. Let me demonstrate that with a couple of examples of how the schools system, as run from the centre, has militated against the success of the Department&#146;s own purported aim of improving fair access.</p>

from the core curriculum at key stage 4. Surprise, surprise&#151;the numbers taking languages slumped. In 2004, 80 per cent. took one language or more at GCSE; now only half that number do. With fewer and fewer young people taking the subject to GCSE and then on to A-level, many universities struggle to recruit students. Consequently, languages are becoming elitist because only middle class students study them at top universities. While the number of comprehensive schools teaching languages falls, grammar schools, specialist schools and independent schools forge ahead with them. Students from those schools go on to the Russell group of universities. However, further down the pecking order, 16 universities no longer offer a degree in the four major languages of French, German, Italian and Spanish.</p>

That is an important concept, because we have had a thousand years of social engineering that has led to the kind of class-based inequalities of access to university that we now suffer from. The job of the university admissions tutor is to identify potential.

and to widen the social base of the students attending universities, the problem is not at the point of entry to the university. As speakers from all parties have said, the problem is to be found earlier in the education system. In my view, it arises at the age of transfer from primary school to secondary school. What distinguishes the British education system from many others in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is the significance that parents attach to the choice of school for their child.

We make a mistake, however, if we believe that the key to the problem is somehow to get parity between the vocational and the academic. As long as the academic subjects lead to the kinds of careers that pay two, three, four or even 10 times as much as those to which the vocational subjects lead, parents and students will never be convinced of parity.

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000834">Finally, may I make a plea that the Government do it differently next time? We cannot just sit back as we did last time, and subcontract the decision to Sir Ron Dearing or some other expert. We cannot just have an external analysis of the impact of raising fees on the first cohort, and then try to push the change through Parliament. We must prepare the ground and develop a better understanding among Members of the three main parties represented here and among the wider public, parents and students. We should start discussing the arguments for and against raising the cap. We should not leave it to the last minute. We must do the groundwork so that in 2010, when I believe that the case will have been made for raising the cap in a careful and regulated way&#151;and in a way that provides sufficient scholarships and bursaries so that no applicant from a low-income background feels that they cannot go to university&#151;that change will become part of the new consensus in an expanding, thriving and internationally competitive university system.</p>

 I think that our debate has been genuinely helpful, informed and instructive. I must say that at the outset I did not expect, at the conclusion, to be urged from the left to lift the cap, and I greatly respect my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) for that. I will not alter my opinion that we need to see what happens during the first three years of operation, but my hon.

 My point is that the money is there to target young people from the poorest backgrounds, which is not happening in all circumstances. We need to put that right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000844">The hon. Gentleman went on to make a number of comments about the fact that the key challenge in providing access to higher education is posed not by the university admission system, but at a much earlier stage. I agreed with that analysis, but I parted company with the hon. Gentleman when he repudiated the real progress made in the last 10 years in driving up attainment in state schools. There has been a step change in performance during that time. However we structure the figures&#151;whether or not we include English or maths&#151;there has been a significant improvement in the performance of state schools which, before 1997, had been flatlining for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000845">The hon. Gentleman majored on the position in the Russell group of universities. Ten thousand more young people are gaining access to those universities than were doing so in 1997. Is that enough progress? No, we have further progress to make; but I think the figure demonstrates that progress is being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000846">We saw a couple of weeks ago how long it takes for a clear commitment on the part of the Conservative party to mellow into an aspiration. I think there was a gap of two minutes between the hon. Gentleman&#146;s commitment to abolishing the Connexions service and his commitment to reforming it. I found that an instructive example of the evolution of Conservative party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000847">The hon. Gentleman made a number of points about announcements made by the UCAS board about the need to take account of socio-economic and parental backgrounds. I should make it clear that the decision was made by the UCAS board, which includes representatives from universities across the country. It is a positive response to the Schwartz review&#146;s recommendations on an holistic assessment process. The Government did not ask for the decision or intervene in it, but I certainly welcome it. The new arrangement is optional for higher education institutions, which can decide for themselves whether they want to use it, but it could help the difficult process of assessing potential, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North. Universities have been grappling with the issue for some time, and I think we undervalue its importance if we decry it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000848">The hon.

statement that was completely erroneous, and which motivated me to intervene on him. He talked about the targets for higher education institutions in respect of the proportions of students from poorer backgrounds and state schools accessing them, and he then made the completely unsubstantiated claim that if universities do not meet those targets, they will be financially penalised. That is simply untrue. They are not performance targets, there is no link with funding, and I hope that he will withdraw those comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07031532000849">The hon. Gentleman also made some comments about the teaching of modern languages. The most significant change that we can make is the one that this Government are committed to: to ensure that by 2010 every child in every primary school in this country has access to learning a modern foreign language. The key change we are making is to introduce that commitment at primary school level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07031532000850">The hon. Gentleman also talked about science subjects. After several years in which there was a decline in the number of applications to study the hard science subjects, over the past three years there has been a positive trend in the right direction. In particular, in terms of the applications announced a few weeks ago for next September there have been big increases&#151;of above 10 per cent.&#151;for chemistry, physics, maths and engineering. That is solid progress, and it should be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000851">The hon. Gentleman also made some very strange remarks about post-qualification applications and claimed that the Government had gone quiet on that issue. He cannot have been in the Chamber when I made a significant point during my opening speech about the importance of post-qualification applications and the fact that although the Government do not control university admissions, we are doing everything in our power to urge universities to move towards having a full system of PQA by 2012. The fact is that more than half of predicted grades are inaccurate, and in terms of both under-prediction and over-prediction&#151;both of which are a cause for concern&#151;students from the lowest socio-economic groups are the most adversely affected. However, it is for the benefit of people from all backgrounds that we need a fairer system of application and admission to university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07031532000852">My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) made a number of important points, but I think that he under-represented the progress that our universities are making in terms of community outreach and summer schools. Those efforts should be supported.</p>

Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) made a significant point about the importance of work-based higher education. In respect of the Leitch challenge, 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force are already in work today. We need to ensure that those who are already in work have real opportunities to access higher education. That will be the biggest area of expansion in the system in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07031532000854">The hon.

like any loan that people can get anywhere on the high street because there is no real rate of interest&#151;people repay only when they are in work and earning more than &#163;15,000, and if after 25 years they have not paid the debt off, it is cancelled. If people could get a loan like that in any building society or bank on the high street, we would not be able to move for people queuing up to get hold it. We need to do much more to get across the benefits of the new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07031532000855">The hon. Gentleman also decried the fact that, under the new system, there has only been a small increase in the proportion of applications from students from lower socio-economic groups. I do not deny that we need to do more, but, before we introduced the new system, it was alleged that that, if we introduced variable fees, applications would plummet, particularly from students from poorer backgrounds. That simply has not happened, and I would like some recognition to be given to that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70315-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07031532000856">The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made some important points about mentoring, which is a key element of what we are seeking to do. Both he and my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham talked about the 50 per cent. target, and my hon. Friend rightly said that that is about setting an ambition and an aspiration. I would hazard a guess that that 50 per cent. target probably has the greatest common currency of any public service agreement target among ordinary people in this country. I think that underlines our ambition for the expansion of higher education opportunities, both for the younger population and throughout people&#146;s working lives.</p>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss the subject of Channel 4 and public service broadcasting. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), is in the Chamber for this debate, but sorry that I have had to take him from pressing duties elsewhere, at the launch of the new digital service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000874">The debate offers the House its first formal opportunity for a full and frank discussion about the offensive and&#151;in my opinion and that of many others&#151;racist material broadcast on Channel 4 two months ago. In January, Channel 4 began broadcasting the latest and fourth series of &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148;. The channel&#146;s 24-hour, seven-day-a-week coverage of celebrities isolated in a house in Hertfordshire attracted millions of viewers who had tuned in to see a narrative of human interaction. However, that series revealed a much uglier side to so-called reality television. It began with bullying, derogatory cultural references and blatant racist behaviour against the Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty from Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O&#146;Meara&#151;a trio of young female celebrities. Two of them have since apologised for their behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000875">It is not necessary or productive to provide a full list of the incidents of abuse that took place inside the &#147;Big Brother&#148; house, but to have an understanding of the situation we should remember that over successive days and weeks Ms Shetty was called &#147;Shilpa Poppodum&#148;, asked whether she lived in a &#147;house or a shack&#148;, told to &#147;go back to the slums&#148; and repeatedly referred to as &#147;the Indian&#148;. Those were the bits that were broadcast, although for the many hours of footage that were shown many more hours were not aired. One wonders how much of it was in a similar vein.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000876">Given the 24-hour nature of the programme and its wall-to-wall coverage, it is not surprising that the public&#146;s reaction was so intense. The programme holds the record as most complained about in British television history. More than 40,000 complaints were received by the authorities. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Ministers and 91 Members of the House made it clear that they felt that the programme was doing a disservice to the multicultural society we have achieved today and was providing a major platform to the minority with such prejudiced sentiments. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport spoke for many when she said in a personal capacity that &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; was nothing more than &#147;racism masquerading as entertainment&#148;&#151;one of the most powerful and commendable statements made by anyone on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000877">Of course, offence was caused not only to the British Asian community, but to our friends and allies in the sub-continent. Fortunately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was leading a delegation to India at the time and could properly and immediately represent the rejection of the racism shown on &#147;Big Brother&#148;.  <br>

Otherwise, I fear that even greater damage would have been done to our standing abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000878">It is of credit to Britain that this series of &#147;Big Brother&#148; resulted in a final victory for Ms Shetty, who won herself many admirers when she became the first ever ethnic minority winner. The Minister himself spoke for millions when in the Chamber on 29 January he congratulated Ms Shetty on her victory after what he described as a &#147;ghastly few weeks&#148; on the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000879">Throughout this sorry state of affairs, Shilpa Shetty carried herself with dignity, calm and grace&#151;a real ambassador for Asian women the world over. The millions who voted for her also deserve congratulations on their rejection of those who sought to demean and humiliate her. We should rightly pride ourselves on the steps that our country has taken in recent years to change our national culture into one that accepts differences and respects diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000880">The loser from the whole incident was the broadcaster Channel 4. Through ignorance or wilful neglect, it allowed these broadcasts to continue through to a very bitter end and then sought to justify that on the basis that its viewers had chosen Ms Shetty as the winner even though Channel 4 had no role in or influence on the final result. In so doing, it lost the support of its viewers and it lost a multi-million sponsorship from the Carphone Warehouse and the advertising revenue of PepsiCo as those companies took the right decision to stop supporting it. It also lost the revenue from its premium rate phone lines as it was forced into donating the money to charity. Finally, it lost the trust of the nation, which had looked to Channel 4 as a responsible public service broadcaster and as a real champion of ethnic minority broadcasting&#151;hence this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000881">The initial response of Channel 4 during the peak of public outrage was most disappointing, as it distanced itself from the outrage felt by many. On 18 January, Channel 4 chairman, Luke Johnson, went on the &#147;Today&#148; programme and provided Mr. Jim Naughtie with a succession of &#147;no comments&#148;. As the interviewer aptly pointed out, it was a great irony on that day that it appeared that the only person in the country with nothing to say on this major news story was the chairman of the broadcaster responsible for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000882">By lunchtime, when it was apparent that such stonewalling would not do, its chief executive, a tie-less Andy Duncan, appeared before the world&#146;s press in Oxford. His statement offered the opinion that what constituted racism was a &#147;complex&#148; area. It appears sadly from a successful career at Unilever that Mr. Duncan, the man who promoted the catchphrase &#147;I can&#146;t believe it&#146;s not butter&#148; also could not believe that it was racism. Mr. Duncan went on to say that it was &#147;unquestionably a good thing&#148; that the programme</p>
<a name="70315-0021.htm_brev8"><a name="07031532000978"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;raised these issues and provoked such a debate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07031532000883">Others believe that the role of &#147;Big Brother&#148; has a less grand purpose than creating a national debate on major issues. In fact, it was the very same Mr. Duncan who reportedly said 20 months before that &#147;Big Brother&#148; made no claim to provide &#147;social or moral education&#148; but was just a very important entertainment  <br>

programme for Channel 4. Rory Bremner could have turned up on 18 January and would have done much better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07031532000884">It is perhaps not surprising that Channel 4 was so unprepared for the reaction. Remarkably for a major public institution, it is run by an all-white management board. Despite the channel&#146;s professed commitment to providing a service to all minorities, there is no way that any member of the board could have understood from personal experience what racial discrimination felt like. Perhaps that is why they found the issue so complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07031532000885">Overall, the response of Channel 4 was pathetic, ineffective and derisory. I met Mr. Duncan last week at my request. It was clear that he felt that his response and the general response of Channel 4 was in retrospect unsatisfactory. Mistakes were made, he said. He assured me that Channel 4&#146;s internal investigation will address the areas where improvements could, and I suggest should, be forthcoming. It is a sad fact that during the events of January the channel, which was originally set up with the express intention of catering for minority interests, responded so poorly. It has damaged its own hard-won reputation in the eyes of many who previously looked to it to represent their experiences. What pride it took last year when it chose to front its alternative Queen&#146;s speech with a woman in a niqab. Was that pride before the fall?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07031532000886">I hope that, at the conclusion of the investigation, Channel 4 will take a belated opportunity fully to condemn racism in all forms and fully to apologise to all offended, especially Ms Shetty. The regulator&#146;s inquiry is important&#151;not least for the precedent that it will set in a digital age. &#147;Big Brother&#148; is a unique show and I have concerns about the regulatory framework. It does not have the capacity to cope with reality television programmes of this kind. Unlike a normal programme, which lasts a few hours or less, the 24/7 nature of reality programmes results in masses of footage, filmed by several cameras. In the case of &#147;Big Brother&#148;, there would have been hundreds of hours of footage. Unfortunately, the complaints are not being assessed individually by the regulator. It has been pretty slow in responding to my requests for a meeting, although, oddly enough, it has agreed to meet me next week. The Minister will understand that, as channels proliferate on the digital spectrum, there is no effective mechanism that provides an efficient and effective oversight of the increasing number of reality shows that are broadcast over weeks or months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07031532000887">It has been reported that, in an age of strong digital competition, the future of Channel 4 is uncertain. Its chief executive has projected a &#163;100 million shortfall for the channel once digital switchover is complete. It is clear that that is expected to be made up in the form of a direct Government subsidy. The sum of &#163;100 million would be only slightly more than the channel receives from the &#147;Big Brother&#148; franchise, which accounts for between 7 and 10 per cent. of its &#163;800 million budget. It is clear that the management at 124 Horseferry road are attempting to avoid having to make a choice. They are trying to square the circle of broadcasting high-profit television franchises while demanding a subsidy on the basis that they are a public service  <br>

broadcaster serving the public interest. It would have happened eventually, but &#147;Big Brother&#148; has shown that that will not be possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07031532000888">Many have misunderstood the debate as being one about editorial censorship. I must clarify that. This is a debate about how a channel that causes massive offence to the public in pursuit of advertising revenue can claim to be serving the public interest and deserving of public subsidy. Channel 4 now faces a clear choice between maintaining its distinctive and original identity and becoming just another outlet for shock television.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para20"><a name="07031532000889">I hope that the Minister will join me and clearly state that, as far as he is concerned, racism is not a complex area involving subjective opinions. He has been involved in the great steps taken by the Government to promote the equality agenda and to encourage public institutions to modernise their attitudes. I call on him to ensure that all broadcasters can properly represent today&#146;s Britain. Perhaps he can even get Channel 4 to apologise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para21"><a name="07031532000890">I also ask the Minister to use his good offices so that the public can be assured that all the money raised by premium-rate phone lines and later pledged to charity is accounted for. Many members of the public pursued their involvement in voting for Shilpa Shetty only on the basis that Channel 4 would not directly profit from their votes. In the light of recent scandals affecting other game shows and TV competitions, of which the Minister is very aware, there are questions about how much the concerned charities should expect to receive from Channel 4 and by what deadline, and who will monitor the money earned for the charity and the processing of that amount. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07031532000891">Is the Minister satisfied that the powers of the regulator are strong enough to deal with reality television formats? Can he offer the House any assurance about how far a reality-series television station could go before Ofcom could intervene with force?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para23"><a name="07031532000892">The issue of accountability is at the heart of this. Mr. Duncan explained the system of accountability in Channel 4. The chairman and non-executive members appear to be appointed by the regulator. Ofcom will be expected to regulate the broadcaster under the management of its chosen appointees. At the same time, the chief executive of Channel 4 is selected by the board of Ofcom-appointed non-executive directors. One can imagine that once the board selects Channel 4&#146;s chief executive, it will be loth to admit collective responsibility for selecting an individual who is not up to the job. Will the Minister clarify that point about accountability?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para24"><a name="07031532000893">If this case were simple, one would obviously have expected a ministerial response, but it is complicated, and Ministers cannot intervene because they have appointed a regulator to do so. However, the Minister must accept that there is a duty in such a situation for the regulator to be able to intervene and, quite frankly, press the off button. What assurances can the Minister provide the House that his Department will consider again whether the powers of the regulator are effective enough when it comes to such broadcasts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para25"><a name="07031532000894">What are the Minister&#146;s thoughts about where the future of Channel 4 lies? We await the publication of  <br>

two reports on that subject. If either investigation reveals that Channel 4, either by act or omission, was in any way responsible for the broadcasting of racist material and failed to act appropriately, will the Minister join me in expecting either the chairman or the chief executive&#151;or both&#151;to offer their immediate resignation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07031532000895">The past 10 years have seen a radical time of change and the adaptation of different approaches for those in the media. That will continue in forthcoming decades. The House is familiar with the continuous debate that we have on the role, responsibilities, functions and financing of the BBC. I hope that the Minister will use this opportunity at the Dispatch Box to begin a new national debate on the future of Channel 4.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) on securing the debate. I certainly join him unequivocally in condemning all racism, wherever and whenever it takes place. We rightly should be totally intolerant of racism in this country. Why anyone would want to put themselves up for &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; is somewhat beyond me, and I say that as an editor of &#147;That&#146;s Life!&#148;, which was a programme that understood the values of entertainment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para27"><a name="07031532000897">The truth is that however awful hon. Members might find this form of programming, the public could watch our own &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; in this Chamber every day, yet, remarkably, few choose to do so. I do not know what our viewing figures are right now, but I suspect that they are in the single figures, with hon. Members&#146; relatives probably being the major players. However, &#147;Big Brother&#148; and its derivatives attract huge audiences and it is clear that the public enjoy them. Equally, &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; enjoyed huge audiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07031532000898">I want to put on record, as I am sure that all hon. Members will continue to do, our admiration for Shilpa Shetty. She is a woman who, even if we did not know her as a celebrity before, in the course of enduring those weeks in the house earned huge respect from many people throughout the country, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Her resilience and dignity during what I have referred to as &#147;ghastly&#148; weeks, as my right hon. Friend said, were as remarkable as the apparent bullying and racism were distasteful, grotesque and highly offensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70315-0021.htm_para29"><a name="07031532000899">My right hon. Friend has a proud track record of ensuring and fighting for equality in this country. As I have already said, I share his feelings about the need to root out racism. However, when it comes to sharing some of his conclusions, I urge caution. I absolutely understand, as he does, why so many people found the programme so distasteful. It led to Ofcom receiving a record 45,000 complaints.</p>

We have legislated to that effect, and Government policy reflects our view. We introduced a specific offence of racially aggravated  <br>

harassment. In addition, under the Public Order Act 1986, there is an offence of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent or likelihood of stirring up racial hatred. That offence covers inflammatory comments made in public or in the media, as well as the distribution of printed material. &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; was unquestionably highly offensive, but the question is not whether it was offensive, but whether an offence was committed. I understand that Hertfordshire police have announced that no criminal charges will be brought in connection with &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148;, and the Crown Prosecution Service has stated that what occurred was clearly offensive, but not criminal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07031532000901">On editorial content, and on &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; specifically, responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the organisations that regulate broadcasting, which in Channel 4&#146;s case is Ofcom. Ofcom is, of course, independent of Government. We believe that that is right, and that it should remain independent. It is a fundamental principle that the Government do not and should not intervene in matters of editorial or programme content, particularly when an investigation is in progress. We believe that it is right to let the regulator continue to conduct the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07031532000902">Ofcom has been charged with the task of setting and assessing standards for the content of television and radio broadcasting. Its standards code, drawn up under the Communications Act 2003, aims to ensure that generally accepted standards are applied to the content of television and radio services. Its function is to provide the public with adequate protection from the inclusion in such services of harmful and/or offensive material. Of course, the legitimate question in this case is whether the public have been adequately protected. That is why Ofcom&#146;s inquiry is so important. Parliament has charged Ofcom directly with establishing procedures to handle and resolve complaints, so it seems premature to prejudge the inquiry&#146;s outcome, and the procedures by which it will achieve that outcome, while the inquiry is being conducted. After all, its procedures are not a reality TV show, and while we await the outcome, we should be careful about carrying out our own voting on its procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07031532000903">My right hon. Friend raises the question of whether the regulator should have hit the &#147;off&#148; button. It has been suggested that a fundamental design fault must exist, as the big button was not hit when &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; was on air. I suggest that we pause to make sure that what we are asking for is really what we want. We should ask whether the request truly falls in with the responsibility that Members have chosen to give Ofcom, and indeed whether it runs against the principle of providing a fair hearing, which should extend to Channel 4. Ofcom can, if appropriate, take action against a licensee while a series is on air. However, in line with the right to a fair trial and the provisions of the 2003 Act, it must give licensees an opportunity to make representations before any decision is reached on whether material is in breach of the standards code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07031532000904">There were undoubtedly tens of thousands of complaints, and clearly many people were offended, but the number of complaints about a programme is  <br>

not, and should not, be a factor to be weighed in a set of scales. The fact that there has been a large number of complaints should not, prima facie, prove that a programme was guilty. We need an inquiry to be conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07031532000905">The question was raised of whether each complaint should have been investigated. The chief executive of Ofcom wrote to my right hon. Friend on 26 February, and a copy of the letter has been placed in the Library. It explained that Ofcom decided not to reply to individual complaints, not because of the high volume of complaints, but because the regulator wanted to pursue a full investigation into them. Having said that, I do not think that Channel 4 or its chief executive, Andy Duncan, are complacent or remotely insensitive to what happened. At no point did Channel 4 condone what was happening, and I know that Andy Duncan has extremely strong views&#151;as strong as those of my right hon. Friend and myself&#151;about racism and the need to root it out from our society.</p>

 As far as I am aware, the regulator has not asked us for additional resources, but I do not believe that that will be a problem. If it is, I invite the regulator to tell us. We cannot allow a lack of resources to prevent us from dealing with the issue, but I genuinely do not believe that that is the case. If it is, however, we would want to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07031532000910">In evidence heard by the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport in March 2007, Mr. Duncan acknowledged that there were lessons to be learned from the episode by Channel 4. Channel 4 has indicated that its own internal review of &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; will include an examination of the channel&#146;s complaint handling, response times and communications. I share my right hon. Friend&#146;s interest in the review&#146;s conclusions, but I truly believe&#151;and I honestly believe that this is part of the principle of natural justice&#151;that it is only right that we should allow the channel to conduct that inquiry before we condemn it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07031532000911">I therefore urge caution before we turn our attack on Channel 4. I put on record my belief that Channel 4 is an exemplary public broadcasting channel. In its work on equality issues, for example, it tackled gay issues head-on at a time when other programmes and channels found them a difficult area to tackle. In religion, its high-quality programming has looked at different religions and cultures at a time in the past few years when some found that too difficult to handle. &#147;What Muslims Want&#148; was a major study in multiculturalism. &#147;Undercover Mosque&#148; aired during the &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; run, and it looked at the impact of hate-style preaching in this country. My right hon. Friend will accept that to caricature Channel 4 as a channel that deliberately chose to offer only shock television is a little unfair. Channel 4 has done a great  <br>

deal to further understanding and tolerance in this country, and I believe that its chief executive believes firmly in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07031532000912">That does not mean that the result of the review by Channel 4 and of Ofcom&#146;s work will stop the House from wanting to debate the subject again. However, I urge my right hon. Friend to be cautious lest he hastily decide that Channel 4&#146;s chief executive is not up to the job or, indeed, that he has led the channel into the kind of broadcasting that does not reflect its inception in any shape or form. The review is extremely important as, indeed, is Ofcom&#146;s investigation into &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148;. The Government believe that Channel 4 has a role to play alongside the BBC, both now and in future, in the provision of public service broadcasting. It has a distinctive public service remit, a great tradition of innovative, quality programme making, as well as a wide remit to appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07031532000913">Channel 4 has made an important contribution to broadcasting in the United Kingdom in the past 25 years, and I am confident that it will continue to do so under its existing leadership in future. It is worth reminding ourselves that only last year, a cultural diversity network survey confirmed &#147;Channel 4 News&#148; as the news service that Britain&#146;s ethnic minorities thought covered their issues best. That news service, of course, is broadcast under the present Channel 4 leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07031532000914">Although the debate has focused on allegations of racism and how they were handled, it also offers an insight into how bullying operates in our society. As a former deputy chairman of ChildLine, I saw the harm that bullying can do. It rears its revolting head by using vehicles of racism, homophobia, religion and many others. In my own household we found that the &#147;Celebrity Big Brother&#148; to which my right hon. Friend referred indeed provoked a discussion about racism, and also about bullying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07031532000915">The good thing is that so many people in this country complained about the programme. That demonstrates progress. I doubt that there would have been so many complaints a decade ago. We look to our broadcasters to ensure that such behaviour is not exploited as entertainment. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, albeit in a private capacity, described the programme at the time as &#147;racism masquerading as entertainment&#148;, and I think that many in the House knew exactly what she meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07031532000916">The programme was a reality TV show, but because it allowed us to see through the window we, the public, were educated about some of the attitudes of some people in our country, and we were all ashamed of what we saw. So now we look to the broadcaster for its review to ensure that such television does not become an entertainment practice by prosecuting values which most of us hoped had long since gone. Ofcom undoubtedly has a role to play in that, and we look to its inquiry to see how we can improve the handling of complaints about such programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70315-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07031532000917">We should all look carefully at the lessons to be drawn. We should be cautious about expressing our own anger and focusing it, perhaps, on the leadership of Channel 4. The programme may have reflected something deeply distasteful, although regrettably not  <br>

everybody finds it distasteful. The problem with bullying is that it can find any vehicle. Sometimes it is racism, sometimes it is homophobia, sometimes it is focused on women, sometimes it is focused on someone&#146;s size, but bullying is a part of our society and all of us have a duty to tackle it. I hope that that is a subject to which Channel 4 will direct its attention in the months to come.</p>

that I will meet him and discuss with him the outcome of the reviews, both by Channel 4 and by Ofcom. I commend him for having brought the debate to the House tonight. If in future he or other hon. Members want to raise the subject, I will be more than happy to discuss it.</p>
