 On the subject of how far the Bill has travelled, I am also extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks and now to the Government for their support for it. The Bill arose from a specific problem in my constituency and started in the House two and a half years ago. It is very gratifying to see it come all the way through to today, so that the problem can be resolved legislatively. It is not just a good day for the environment; it is a good day for the decentralisation of power, so I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s support.</p>

That the Bill was subject to only a minor technical amendment in the other place is testament to the hard work put into moulding it into a workable piece of legislation in Committee in this place. Thanks go both to the hon. Gentleman and to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, the then Minister for Housing, who took responsibility for the Bill in Committee.

Friend the Member for Hendon, for which I thank him, the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 includes a regulation-making power for the Secretary of State in relation to England, and for Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales, to prescribe sustainability standards, including in relation to energy efficiency. Once the power has been exercised, the resulting sustainability standard in relation to energy efficiency would be appropriate for local authorities to use when setting energy efficiency standards for their areas in reliance on the Bill. My hon. Friend made an important point about the Lords amendment. We have allowed for the possibility that this power might be superseded or supplemented in future by other powers.

It sits neatly with the fundamental measures that the Government are taking to cut emissions and tackle climate change. Those include the Climate Change Bill and the Energy Bill, which are now progressing through this House and the other place respectively, and the Planning Bill, which is now before the other place.

 I am very worried about the prospective application of the amendment. My hon. Friend has referred to an Act of Parliament that has already gone through, and I can understand why we should perhaps not refer to it by name in an amendment to the Bill. However, he has also referred to other Bills that have not yet passed through the House. Would it not be more appropriate to amend those Bills as they go through the House, so that we are not legislating prospectively, and to refer in this Bill only to the Act that has already gone through?</p>

 As usual, my hon. Friend raises an important point. It is worth reminding him, however, of the extra powers the Bill will deliver. It places in legislation the power for local councils to make policies on local energy requirements for new developments. He might have missed this, so it is important to remind him that this provides the reassurance that some councils were looking for. It reassures them that they can go further and faster than building regulations, but within the national framework. It also means that there will be no place to hide for any local authority that does not want to take up this agenda. It also underlines everyone&#146;s commitment to using local&#151;including on-site and near-site&#151;green energy in new developments.</p>

Friend has further questions, I will try to answer them. I can see the officials busily writing away, and I am sure that another note will be passed to me soon. I do not mind if it is passed to me by a member of the Cabinet or someone else.</p>

time to write the answer to my last question. I have listened to what he has just said, but it did not really relate to the point that I raised. I certainly support the Bill, and I remember expressing my support for the various points that he has raised in the debates that we had in the House on previous occasions. However, the real point here is a matter of principle. This is not so much to do with the Bill itself as with the principle of prospective legislation. As I mentioned in my first intervention, the House rightly disapproves of retrospective legislation, but we have here a new constitutional line being developed by effectively giving a blank cheque in relation to what might come along in the future. I suggest to my hon. Friend that it would be more appropriate for this to be done by means of the Act in question cross-referring back to this Bill, rather than by trying to anticipate what might or might not happen in the future.</p>

 I do not have the joy of being the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, but I thought that most legislation was, by definition, prospective, because it is not retrospective. I am sure that, during the course of my short speech, I will come to the point that my hon. Friend has raised, in my own way. If I do not, I will respond to it once a note has been passed to me.</p>

 Perhaps the best way to interpret the amendment is to see it as an attempt to interpret future enactments in a way that is compatible with this Bill, so that if, by some mischance, future legislation did not refer to the Bill, it would not be taken as an implied repeal of the Bill. This is just a matter of protection against future accidents. Although the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) is correct about the normal way in which we do things, I think that this is a perfectly reasonable amendment.</p>

This is our &#147;Merton-plus&#148; approach, building on the Merton rule.

There have been lengthy discussions of various issues raised by the Bill, and I am pleased that they have been resolved to everyone&#146;s satisfaction without the need for a substantial amendment. I am grateful that the other place did not consider it necessary to revisit any of the points raised during the passage of the Bill in the Commons. That demonstrates how well the Committees of this House worked to produce a workable Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81017-0002.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000130">There was, however, one point of detail that the other place needed to address and it is worth explaining it to colleagues who may not have seen the record of the debate. The concern of the other place resulted in just one technical amendment. I can assure the House&#151;this also deals with the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon&#151;that the amendment does not affect the substance of this private Member&#146;s Bill. The reason why the Bill needed amendment is straightforward and we should thank the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place for spotting the necessity for it. It enables us to correct the reference to regulatory-making powers and to improve the Bill&#146;s clarity. It was unfortunate that the amendment was needed and that it was necessary for the Bill to come back to this place, but the fact that we are here today demonstrates the will to see the Bill through to what I am sure will be a successful conclusion.</p>

Friend the Member for Hendon was keen for me to answer his point directly, so I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe for passing me a note a few moments ago, which will enable me to respond to his query. I want to assure the House and my hon. Friend that the power given to local authorities properly relates to the prevailing energy efficient standards set by Parliament in the future. My hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion would mean that every piece of future legislation would have to refer to this Bill, and I believe that that was the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge when he rescued me from my inability directly to answer my hon. Friend&#146;s point.</p>

In its 10th report, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee noted that Baroness Andrews had written to its Chairman to explain that the Government intended to propose an amendment to the Bill. The amendment was intended to remedy the drafting deficiency, which, as we have just heard, was spotted by my hon.

For the benefit of those who are not lawyers, it might be worth trying to explain the implications in layman&#146;s terms. The problem was with the drafting of the then clause 1(2)(a) in that it did not clearly refer to regulation-making powers in other legislation. It seemed to create a new power for the Secretary of State to set energy efficiency standards, which would not have been subject to any parliamentary controls. That was never the intention and it is precisely why the Bill had not included a procedure setting out how such a power would operate.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that explanation. I very much sympathise with the view of hon. Member for Hendon that a court would have been very unlikely to have interpreted the Bill as originally drafted as creating in itself a separate order-making power for the very reason that the Minister just outlined, as the Bill does not include any procedure, conditions or limitations relating to such a power. The Bill&#146;s original phrasing would have been interpreted as meaning &#147;under any other enactment&#148;, not just as creating a power by itself.

Appropriate regulation-making powers already exist in other legislation and there was no need for the hon. Member for Sevenoaks to introduce new powers. That would have been unnecessary duplication. The intention was for local authorities, in setting energy efficiency standards, to choose only those standards that have been set out or referred to in regulations made by the Secretary of State, or which are set out or endorsed in national policies or guidance issued by the Secretary of State.</p>

The Minister went into great detail and has answered the questions, so I do not want unduly to delay the House. This is important legislation because it is key to fighting climate change. It promotes a drive towards new localism and is key to promoting energy independence.</p>

 It is unusual to be told, when one has prepared for one debate, that another debate has been put before it and that one has to read a brief on a very technical amendment before we get to the substance of the day. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) for his assistance in briefing me on this technical matter. With his learned knowledge, he may also have assisted the Minister earlier. I know the fear with which my hon. Friend is regarded in some circles because of his abilities, and his books sit in the Library and are referred to on such technical matters by all parties.</p>

The amendment brings clarification to the Bill&#146;s intent to allow local councils to set targets in their areas for on-site renewable energy and on low-carbon electricity energy efficiency standards in addition to national requirements. The Bill will cover England and Wales, and it will also require developers to source at least 10 per cent. of any new building&#146;s energy from renewable sources, implementing nationwide the so-called Merton rule. However, as Baroness Hamwee pointed out in the other place, Richmond is actually moving to 20 per cent., which shows that local authorities can make even greater progress. The rule was named after a planning policy first adopted by the London borough of Merton. The Government had implemented policies in this area, notably the planning policy statement on climate change, issued by the Government on 17 December 2007 after public consultation. Some councils, such as Merton, have already adopted environmentally friendly strategies, but the picture across England and Wales is rather mixed.</p>

Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) that it was unlikely that a court would have done so&#151;as conferring a new order-making power that did not exist elsewhere in authority. However, the Bill would ensure that any future enactment is fully approved by this House, so it is not a blank cheque.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81017-0003.htm_para9"><a name="08101749000191">As the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) said, this is the substance of the day. It is also a highly topical subject, notwithstanding the fact that I gave notice about 10 months ago of my desire to debate this subject on this day, the last day on which Members have a chance to discuss potential private Members&#146; legislation. Obviously, because it is the last day on which private Members&#146; Bills can be discussed in this Session, the Bill has no prospect of reaching the statute book. Even if it were to conclude all its stages in this House today, it would not have time to be considered in the other place. So this debate is more along the lines of the debates that we used to have on Fridays when I was first elected&#151;on a subject of a Back Bencher&#146;s choosing with a motion at the end of the debate. The removal of that opportunity from Back Benchers was a backward step, because there are several issues of concern to them that may not necessarily be of such concern to Front Benchers, or they may be nervous of initiating a debate on such issues for fear of misrepresentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="81017-0003.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000192">We have the prospect today of having an excellent debate, and I shall begin by welcoming the Minister who will respond to it. This debate is about abolishing the television licence fee, which is more accurately described as the television tax. It is not about abolishing the BBC. One can be a friend of the BBC&#151;as I am&#151;without being a supporter of the licence fee, although the lengths to which the BBC sometimes goes to defend the licence fee often create enemies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="81017-0003.htm_para11"><a name="08101749000193">I count myself with those who consider the World Service to be the best that the BBC produces&#151;impartial, informative and often entertaining, with the ability to separate news from comment. It is all funded by direct taxpayer grant via the Foreign Office, which last year amounted to &#163;264 million. That money was raised from the taxpayer on the basis of ability to pay. The World Service encapsulates the best of BBC values and is a living demonstration of the fact that those values do not depend on the licence fee. Let us hope that during this debate no one is tempted to resort to that tired misrepresentation that only the licence fee can protect BBC values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="81017-0003.htm_para12"><a name="08101749000194">In a recent MORI poll, to which I shall refer again later, it became clear that the public do not believe that the protection of BBC values is dependent on licence fee funding. Last week, I was present when Michael Grade, now the boss of ITV, addressed a breakfast meeting organised by the Royal Television Society. In commenting on Ofcom&#146;s public service broadcasting review, he described the &#147;seismic shifts&#148; under way in broadcasting and called for &#147;a new settlement&#148; to sustain the health of British broadcasting. He said that that was needed urgently and had to be implemented before the end of 2012. That date coincides with the requirements of my Bill&#151;that the licence fee should be abolished no later than 31 December 2012, by which time the digital   <br>

switchover will be completed. So, what is wrong with the licence fee at the moment? It is a tax on almost every household in the land, irrespective of ability to pay.</p>

<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="08101749000195"><a name="81017-0003.htm_spnew10"><a name="08101749000871"><b>David Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b>
 For the most part, the hon. Gentleman is making an interesting case. How would he respond to the large number of my constituents who do not possess television sets and are therefore persecuted by the licence fee authorities? Perhaps we might return to that subject later. Under his proposal, those people would end up paying tax for a service that they do not want to receive. They would therefore be worse off than they are now, as long as they are not further interfered with by the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="08101749000196"><a name="81017-0003.htm_spnew11"><a name="08101749000872"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is fair. I am concerned, as he is, about those people who feel that the licence fee is an impost. They do not want to watch television and they certainly do not want to watch BBC television, yet they find themselves having to pay the fee. If we funded the public service element of the BBC output in some other way, whether by subscription, direct grant or a mixture of advertising and sponsorship&#151;all those options have been proposed by different organisations&#151;the burden that the hon. Gentleman says would fall on his constituents through direct taxation would not be anything like the burden that is faced by those who have to pay the licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="81017-0003.htm_para13"><a name="08101749000197">The situation would be more analogous to the situation with the Arts Council. The Arts Council is funded directly by the taxpayer to the extent of about &#163;500 million a year, and it decides how to reallocate those funds between different deserving causes that promote the arts in accordance with Arts Council principles. My Bill does not address the issue of what to put in place in terms of funding for the BBC, but it would prompt a big debate about alternative funding. I hope that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) agrees that the Arts Council model in relation to public services for the arts might be a valid one.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has just reached the point that troubled me about his Bill. Basically, this is a very anarchist approach to funding our public service broadcaster. He wants to sweep away the existing method of financing through the licence fee and has only the vaguest idea of what to put in its place. The Bill should never have seen the light of day. It does not in any way, shape or form deal with the fundamental issue, which is worthy of debate, about the funding of the BBC. It simply sweeps away what exists now and provides nothing in its place. If the Bill were to be approved by the House&#151;technically and theoretically, it could go through all its stages today&#151;the consequence would be that the BBC would close down tomorrow.</p>

 That is not correct. It is not incumbent on legislators to impose any alternative solution. There are already powers under the relevant legislation for the Government to fund the BBC in ways other than through the licence fee.</p>

 Apart from the fact that the hon. Gentleman seems to have misunderstood the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), he also seems to think that it is perfectly acceptable to impose a requirement on the BBC to generate advertising revenue. Does the hon. Gentleman have any idea of the financial strictures facing ITV and the other commercial elements of the broadcasting sector? What exactly would he do for ITV and the others by way of compensation for removing hundreds of millions of pounds from the BBC and requiring the BBC to compete on a level footing with that sector while advertising revenue is diminishing?</p>

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present at the Royal Television Society breakfast at which I was present, but he would have heard Michael Grade explaining ITV&#146;s predicament. ITV has a public service broadcasting obligation, in terms of the licences under which it operates, and Michael Grade estimates that in the next couple of years a lot of the ITV companies will go into deficit in meeting that public service broadcasting objective. That is why he, Ofcom and others are arguing that we need a central fund of taxpayer-funded resources that can be drawn on by those who provide public service broadcasting for use in that particular type of broadcasting&#151;not in general entertainment broadcasting.</p>

 I am even more confused now. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting a central taxpayer-funded pot for public service broadcasting. I would be interested to know whether that would come from general taxation, in which case he will be taxing people who do not watch television. Alternatively, does he have some other plan for a form of taxation to provide the PSB requirements? We should also bear in mind that Michael Grade, who is a great man, had a very different point of view when he was at the BBC.</p>

 I shall not comment on whether Michael Grade had a different point of view when he was at the BBC. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about having to fund public service broadcasting from general taxation and the idea that that would be an impost on those who do not benefit from that service are true, but the same is also true of funding for the Arts Council. If general taxpayers do not use any of the Arts Council sponsored or subsidised services, they could say that they were contributing to the Arts Council but not getting anything in return. The same is true of a host of other generally publicly funded services. Obviously it is true of the health service. People without children contribute to the cost of education through their taxes, although they do not see any direct benefit. Other people opt out of the system and end up paying twice. People opt out of the health service and those who are in good health pay without needing it at the moment.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman tried to make a comparison between funding for the BBC and funding for the Arts Council, but surely that is like comparing chalk and cheese. The Arts Council has a specific remit within a limited field. The BBC provides arts programmes and educational programmes, and is required to produce public broadcasting for the general good, but it also provides a good deal of general entertainment. In some cases, the comparison is more like going to the cinema than the Arts Council. If people go to the cinema, they pay when they go through the door.</p>

 That would be so if I was suggesting that all the BBC&#146;s services should be funded by such a body. I am talking about those services that can be described as containing a public service element. In a few minutes, I shall come to the comments made recently by a member of a body that has argued strongly in favour of setting up such an organisation. David Cox is a member of the Broadcasting Policy Group and that body has suggested that a new organisation should be set up to disburse public money for public service broadcasting.</p>

However, students had to pay only 20 per cent. of the community charge. Under the licence fee, they have to pay the full charge even though they may live in a shared house and watch no BBC television at all, merely having a TV card on their laptop. In that respect, the licence fee is worse than the community charge in terms of its impact on those who are less able to afford it. Indeed, it is said that more than one third of adults watch less than five hours of BBC television a week and more than one in eight watches less than 15 minutes a week. At least one could argue that the community charge was used for the collection of refuse and everyone contributed because they needed that service, but even that justification is not available for the BBC licence fee.</p>

I remember that elderly people in my constituency thought the community charge unfair and found it hard to pay, but TV licences are free for the over-75s and many people qualify for concessions; for example, the blind concession reduces the cost by 50 per cent. I do not recall that blind people had a concession on their community charge. People who live in residential care may be entitled to a reduced-fee TV licence under the accommodation for residential care concession and so on. The hon.

In fact, most people regard having access to television receiving equipment or possessing a mobile device that can receive television as essential, just as they regard having a telephone as essential. The question then arises about the use to which the equipment is put, but to describe having television receiving equipment as &#147;something of a &#145;luxury&#146;&#148; is to be out of touch with today&#146;s reality.</p>

He does not want to see the BBC fade away, but does not think that the present system is sustainable. He thinks that a mix of alternative sources of funding, perhaps including viewer subscriptions, is the way forward.</p>

There is &#163;264 million for the World Service and &#163;508.4 million for the free licences for the over-75s. A significant sum&#151;we do not have exact figures&#151;is required to meet the costs to the Ministry of Justice of running the courts dealing with licence fee evasion cases. According to the last figures available, in 2006, 129,000 such cases came before the courts, resulting in 113,874 fines being imposed. All those proceedings had to be funded and were an enormous burden on Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service. Indeed, 24 of the cases resulted in people being sentenced to imprisonment.

It brings digital TV to millions of people and is now the digital platform of choice. Perhaps freesat, a great collaborative venture between ITV and the BBC, or the iPlayer, which he mentioned, might have modified his attitude, or some of the great programmes that the BBC has produced since 2000. Programmes such as &#147;Planet Earth&#148; have been viewed by millions of viewers. The old argument that there was a golden age of the BBC that we have lost is deeply flawed. Programmes such as &#147;Planet Earth&#148; are watched by far more people than ever watched &#147;Civilisation&#148; in the 1970s, because of the expansion of education and BBC output.</p>

 I am a great supporter of our post offices. One of the reasons I am on the Back Benches rather than on the Front Bench is that I have tended to vote that way when the opportunity has arisen in the House on motions on the Post Office. I share the vigour of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s defence of post offices. It is a pity that the BBC licence fee cannot be paid at a post office, though it can be paid through PayPoint.</p>

Gentleman mentioned the change in technology and posed the question whether the licence fee was undermined by the fact that content can now be downloaded from the iPlayer after the event or accessed by other means. He cited the arguments put by Greg Dyke. Ninety per cent. of households still have televisions, the overwhelming majority of which pay the licence fee. If one accesses BBC content live, whether through television or computer, one is liable to pay the licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000259">The hon. Gentleman mentioned BBC resistance, a group that I had not heard of before and which he seemed to mention with approval. I do not detect a widespread movement of resistance to paying the licence fee, although it is right that the BBC Trust is investigating other methods of collecting the fee and reviewing whether all the ways of pursuing people to ensure that they pay are appropriate. We all look forward to the BBC Trust&#146;s report in due course.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the terms of reference adopted by the BBC Trust are narrow? The review does not invite people to consider whether non-payment of the TV licence fee should be decriminalised, whether it is reasonable that there should still be imprisonment for non-payment, or whether there might be an alternative to the licence fee as a means of paying for the BBC.</p>

 Some of those suggestions go way beyond what the BBC Trust is trying to do. It is trying to fulfil its responsibilities of overseeing the collection of the licence fee. It is not up to the BBC Trust to initiate a debate on alternatives to the licence fee. The hon. Gentleman mentioned sponsorship approvingly. The BBC Trust has reprimanded management about sponsorship of the Proms and Sports Personality of the Year, thereby showing that it has teeth. Its investigation of the topic is to be welcomed.</p>

 I do not know whether that programme might tempt the hon. Member for Christchurch late at night on a Friday. It clearly tempts his colleague on the Front Bench, the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey). President Sarkozy is now insisting that the French public service broadcaster drop advertising and move in a different direction. ITV certainly would not support the BBC having advertising. An already volatile market would collapse if the BBC were funded in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000266">Sponsorship offers a limited possibility of funding. Total TV sponsorship across all the channels is less than &#163;100 million a year and does not provide an alternative to the licence fee. That leaves direct taxation. One of the great things about the licence fee, even though it is a matter of public controversy, is that it is fixed till 2012. That is a long time in terms of public funding. It is not subject to an annual spending round. If the chairman of the BBC had to troop in to see the Chancellor every year, that would, over time, impact on the BBC and undermine the cutting edge of a presenter such as Jeremy Paxman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08101749000267">KPMG did a study of public service broadcasters around the world that examined different models of funding. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s advocacy of the system in Belgium does not offer great comfort to me. I do not know whether he can name the public service broadcaster in Belgium or assess its impact on world culture, but I imagine it is rather small compared with that of the BBC. He cited the mixed model of funding for S4C, but that is a small player.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000268">Studies from around the world show that if we want a strong public service broadcaster that can bring programmes with high quality content to the whole nation, the licence fee model stands out as the best model. In Australia and Canada, the public service broadcasters, ABC and CBC, are far weaker and rely on the BBC for much of their programming content. If we want high quality, there is much to be said for sticking to the model of the licence fee.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many of the programmes that we all praise and that make the BBC what it is today are possible only because the BBC has direct access to funding that does not have to be repaid in a commercial sense? Further to that, many of the other commercial enterprises in the broadcasting sector depend on the mentoring and the tutelage of the BBC, which effectively supplies many of the staff across the board who start in the BBC and move on to the independent sector.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which gets to the crux of the matter. The hon. Member for Christchurch advocated a sort of arts council of the air. There are a number of problems with the idea that public service broadcasting could be preserved if the licence fee were top-sliced or abolished entirely and all broadcasters could bid to make programmes. The fact that the BBC provides such high quality programming is something to do with the security and continuity over time of the institution. People can be creative and take risks in comedy, drama and political and news coverage.</p>

Channel 4 if the licence fee were top-sliced and it had to be publicly accountable for the licence fee in the same way as the BBC is. Would &#147;Big Brother&#148; or &#147;Dispatches&#148; be supported by the licence fee? We have to look for other models of the BBC supporting the rest of public service broadcasting, rather than top-slicing the licence fee and breaking the link between licence fee payers and the BBC.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman give his view of what should be done, in the light of the Ofcom review, to promote competition among regional news channels, for example? ITV regional news will die as a public service news organisation unless it receives money from somewhere. At the moment, the BBC is enjoying a monopoly of public service revenue.

 The hon. Gentleman has cited Michael Grade; it is a complete misrepresentation of his position to say that he wants public funding for ITV.

 I am interested that the hon. Gentleman has brought up Polly Toynbee; the Secretary of State has also done so. The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) likes to give the impression that the Labour party is an uncritical supporter of hers; if it supports her views on the BBC, does it also support her view that the Prime Minister should resign immediately as he is a lame duck?</p>

The Conservative party has had at least as much to do with the BBC and its development over the years as the Labour party. The Conservative party created the BBC and created not its current charter, but its previous two.

 There is an argument for that; those who are leading at the very top of the BBC must recognise that they are going to earn less than they would in the private sector, although I do not want to name a particular figure. The BBC clearly has to pay for top talent, because it is a complex organisation to manage and it needs top talent to appear on our screens as well. However, such people should recognise that their terms and conditions will involve a little less pay than they would receive in the commercial sector. Nevertheless, the BBC should pay decently those who manage one of our most valued and cherished public institutions.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, BBC staff accept that they effectively take on a financial penalty for working at the organisation. However, its culture is so strong and the working environment there is so attractive in respect of creativity and what they can do, that they accept that cost. Is that not one of the most powerful testimonies of the benefits of the BBC as it is now structured and a reassurance to the public that paying for the licence fee does not mean paying through the nose for BBC staff?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right; clearly, every penny of BBC expenditure has to be scrutinised, and the new system of the BBC Trust under Sir Michael Lyons is doing that job better than the old Government system. The BBC Trust is a relatively new form of governance, but it is stressing value for money. I hope that we will hear from the Opposition strong statements of support for the BBC in line with the solid Tory tradition to which I referred. The BBC is not the property of any particular political party; it belongs to the nation. Of all British institutions, it speaks to the world; Polly Toynbee was right on that, and I hope that Conservative Front Benchers share that view&#151;the Leader of the Opposition seems to.

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000290">We are having this debate at a timely moment. Over its 80-year history, the BBC has been too centred on London. This week has been dramatic, with lots happening in the world economy and so on. The House may have missed a speech by Jana Bennett, director of BBC Vision, who announced much more ambitious targets for moving BBC production out of London to the nations and regions. By 2016, a third of all BBC production will come from the English regions, up from 26 per cent. now. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will account for 17 per cent. of the production of all BBC programmes by that stage&#151;nearly a tripling of their output. As Jana Bennett said,</p>
<a name="81017-0005.htm_brev3"><a name="08101749000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is no substitute for being there.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para11"><a name="08101749000291">It has taken the BBC a long while to learn that lesson. It will be simply fantastic when Manchester can boast BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Live Extra and the two children&#146;s channels. A lot of BBC commissioning has gone to Manchester through BBC Learning as well. In answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Christchurch about what more the BBC can do to assist other public service broadcasters, I should say that the sharing of facilities is one of them. The BBC management have suggested that they could share some of their local and regional news output and some of their research and development with the commercial sector; they have already co-operated with ITV on issues such as Freesat.</p>

glad that the Government are reviewing the list of sporting events that must be made available to free-to-air broadcasters at a reasonable price. It would be nice to see added to that the Ashes series, the last day of the Ryder cup and the home nations&#146; qualification matches for the World cup and European championships. The BBC is still the world&#146;s biggest terrestrial broadcaster in terms of sport. Ten per cent. of the output of BBC1 and BBC2 is devoted to sport. It enriches the lives of many people who could not afford to pay subscriptions for Sky TV and Setanta. Our national life would be much diminished without BBC Sport&#146;s contribution to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81017-0005.htm_para15"><a name="08101749000295">The BBC licence fee still has a lot of life in it. It is the least worst system of supporting a BBC that still reaches 93 per cent. of people in the nation every week. Eighty-four per cent. of people&#151;a figure that is slightly up on last year&#151;watch one or other of the BBC TV channels each year. More than 50 per cent. of our radio listening is done via the BBC. Our local radio stations enrich communities across the length and breadth of our land. Above all, the BBC produces programmes of such quality that they are the envy of the world. They inform, educate and entertain. Because of the BBC, people switch on their radios or television sets, things catch their eye or make them prick up their ears, and they become interested in things that they would never believe they could be interested in. It is still true that, in the words of Dennis Potter, one can tune in, switch on and marvel. It gives me great pleasure to oppose this Bill and to support the BBC licence fee.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), who has been a vocal supporter of the BBC during his 11 years in this House. It is rumoured that his time here may be coming to an end, but I am sure that he will re-emerge outside in some form or other as a continued supporter of the BBC.</p>

First, as my hon. Friend said, to propose the abolition of the licence fee&#151;or, to put it more kindly, to propose an alternative way of funding the BBC&#151;is not to launch an attack on the BBC. One can be a friend of the BBC and still suggest that it might be alternatively funded. Secondly, no one in this House, whatever their views of the BBC or the licence fee, should be afraid to debate whether the licence fee is the best way of funding the organisation. Since I entered politics, I have found that it is always extremely dangerous to muse, debate or think outside the box. I want to put it on record that I am a firm supporter of the licence fee, as is the Conservative party. Nevertheless, no one should be afraid to rehearse the arguments about whether the licence fee is the best funding mechanism.</p>

those of the hon. Member for Selby, on to other aspects of public service broadcasting and the merits of the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000299">Let me focus on some of the proposed alternative methods of funding the BBC. I say to my hon. Friend&#151;in all humility because he is an extremely experienced parliamentarian and former Minister&#151;that his arguments against the licence fee might have been strengthened if he had put forward a clear and cogent alternative. I echo the hon. Member for Selby in saying that although the licence fee has some imperfections, it is probably the least worst mechanism for funding the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000300">I must confess that I was horrified to hear my hon. Friend propose what amounted to an arts council of the airwaves. Knowing as much as I do about his firm principles and views, I was appalled by the idea of setting up a terrible quango of the great and the good to distribute public money to make programmes that, if I could put it this way, people like us would like to watch. I can confidently predict that were he to get his way and have that arts council established, he would be back in this Chamber within a year or two proposing its immediate abolition having seen some of its output. To be fair to Ofcom, which has been criticised for proposing an arts council of the airwaves, that is no longer being seriously considered as an option. What is being seriously considered, however, is the idea of top-slicing, which in effect shares the BBC&#146;s licence fee with some of the other main public service broadcasters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000301">On the other proposed alternative arrangements for funding the BBC, first, there is the obvious method of subscription. Intellectually speaking, particularly in a digital age, there might be no problem with a subscription service. However, the trouble would be that it would immediately narrow the BBC&#146;s audience base. It would also betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the BBC&#146;s purpose in terms of its role as a public service broadcaster and its place in the ecology of public service broadcasting and broadcasting as a whole, because its audience would be segmented and severely diminished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000302">Similarly, some public service broadcasters are supported by advertising&#151;Channel 4 is the most obvious example, but that also applies to ITV and Channel 5, if we want to include them in the family of public service broadcasters. Indeed, to some extent, the BBC plays fast and loose with advertising. For example, there is advertising on BBC Worldwide, and the BBC adopts forms of sponsorship, which, in my book, come close to advertising. However, in the current climate, the idea of the BBC suddenly entering the marketplace to compete for advertising is unrealistic. Again, the BBC&#146;s ecology and the public&#146;s wishes favour a BBC that is free from advertising and directly funded. That is the way forward.</p>

 What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s perspective on the fact that the independent sector is concerned about the prospect of the BBC&#146;s having to resort to advertising? It feels that the pot is already under great pressure, so although we may argue about the best way in which to fund the BBC, there is no appetite in any part of broadcasting to require the BBC to make its domestic output dependent on advertising revenue.</p>

to commercial broadcasters. It is the last thing that those broadcasters want. Most do not want direct funding from Government, either&#151;ITV and Sky adamantly oppose top-slicing and receiving a subsidy from the Government to produce what is known as public service broadcasting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08101749000305">We are essentially debating whether the BBC should be funded by a licence fee, which individual households pay, or general taxation. Before concentrating on that argument, let me accept the challenge from the hon. Member for Selby to say something nice about the BBC. Given that he quoted the Leader of the Opposition saying something nice about the BBC, it would obviously be in my interest, too, to say something nice. However, I can happily cast self-interest aside and speak genuinely of my love and adoration for the BBC. I believe that it is fantastic and that most people in this country regard it as a great organisation and as family. The family analogy is important: we give the BBC the nickname &#147;Auntie&#148;, and, by and large, we like the BBC, but we also feel free to criticise and have rows with it. Sometimes, those rows are incoherent&#151;rows for the sake of having a row, as most of us have in our own families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000306">We constantly talk about public service broadcasting, but one of the frustrating aspects of those discussions is that we always end up talking about an individual programme. I can be more specific: we always seem to end up talking about &#147;Blue Planet&#148;. At some point in the debate, somebody will mention &#147;Blue Planet&#148; as the justification for &#163;3.5 billion of taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<p><a name="st_o118"><a name="08101749000307"><a name="81017-0006.htm_spnew2"><a name="08101749000927"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>

 Indeed&#151;I win the bingo prize for mentioning &#147;Blue Planet&#148;. However, the BBC as a public service broadcaster is much more than &#147;Blue Planet&#148;. The BBC, like all publicly funded organisations, is always desperate to prove its economic worth, so it publishes worthy papers&#151;probably wasting licence fee payers&#146; money in the process&#151;to show that it contributes more to the economy than it takes from it. The latest report&#151;from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, or some other such auditor that probably failed to audit a commercial bank&#151;pointed out that, for the &#163;3.5 billion we give the BBC, we get back approximately between &#163;5 billion and &#163;6 billion. I have no doubt that those figures reflect to some extent the fact that BBC puts back more than it takes from the licence fee payer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000309">I keep using the rather amorphous term &#147;ecology&#148;, but I believe that the BBC is embedded in our culture. It gives the arts tremendous support, for example, through the Proms. It helps numerous other arts organisations, but one barely hears about that. A few weeks ago, because I did not think that the BBC had made enough of a point about it, I flagged up the fact that it was giving singing bursaries to young singers. People may argue that that is beyond the BBC&#146;s remit, but I want to emphasise that the BBC is involved in so much more of the public realm than simply switching on BBC 1 or BBC 2 or listening to Radio 4, Radio 5&#151;or, indeed, Radio 1, to which I occasionally listen&#151;suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08101749000310">As a public sector organisation, the BBC is surprisingly innovative. The hon. Member for Selby mentioned Freeview, freesat and the iPlayer, which are important innovations. The great thing about Freeview is that the BBC got stuck in and created a platform that is open and available  <br>

to all, and ensures that there is no monopoly of platforms provided by subscription service television. That was an extremely important innovation&#151;I am not going to say that it is as important an innovation as the invention of television, but I suspect that we will look back on it as incredibly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08101749000311">The hon. Member for Selby mentioned the recent speech by Jana Bennett, the director of BBC Vision, which was a welcome statement by the BBC on the redoubling of its efforts to ensure that it has a presence in the regions. &#147;Crimewatch&#148; is moving to Cardiff&#151;don&#146;t have nightmares&#151;although I could not quite understand the row about &#147;Question Time&#148; moving to Glasgow, because as far as I am aware it is produced by an independent television company based in Hammersmith. I do not think that anyone is going to make David Dimbleby live in Glasgow, but anyway, that is beside the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000312">I hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch said about the need for the BBC to provide value for money. Many executives in the BBC are extremely well paid. The director general of the BBC, who went to my college at Oxford&#151;incidentally, Merton college also produced Jeremy Isaacs and the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who is relevant to this debate because he is a Labour Member who wants to abolish the licence fee, which he sees as a regressive tax&#151;forwent his bonus. However, it was a wake-up call to learn that the bonus that he forwent was equivalent to my annual salary, so he is pretty well paid.</p>

 So the hon. Gentleman says, implying that I am not worth it. That just goes to show hon. Members that sending somebody a letter of congratulation on their elevation to the Front Bench will not earn them any quarter at all in the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08101749000315">We should be careful about saying that the BBC should cut costs and introduce value for money, because it is a standing joke in the BBC that the part that produces the least value for money is the BBC Parliament channel. In terms of viewers per buck, as it were, the Parliament channel is the least economic channel that the BBC provides. I was told yesterday&#151;this may be entirely wrong; if so, I will come back to the House and correct it&#151;that BBC engineers are constantly trying desperately to reduce the picture size of the Parliament channel, because apparently it will then take up less spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08101749000316">When we admonish the BBC for its excessive salaries and expenditure, we should remember that the easiest way for it to save money would be to close down the Parliament channel. But then, I gather that Parliament itself is being closed and that we are moving to the Lords quite soon so that the hot water can be fixed, and this in a week when we have given the banks something like ten times the BBC&#146;s annual budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08101749000317">I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch that it is extremely important that the BBC should be audited by the National Audit Office. It is extraordinary that the BBC would seek to dictate terms.

the public to see how much it costs. This is a personal statement, albeit from the Front Bench, but I would like the BBC to publish the salaries of everyone whom it employs. The BBC will not tell us, for example, how much Jonathan Ross is paid, citing commercial confidentiality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08101749000318">The implication is that the BBC is in competition with the commercial broadcasters and therefore cannot possibly publish the salaries of its top talent. My answer to that argument is that if the BBC is indeed in competition with commercial broadcasters, it is already fighting with one leg up, because it is guaranteed an income of &#163;3.5 billion a year that the commercial broadcasters are not and which would slightly level the playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08101749000319">One aspect of the wider debate is how we secure public service broadcasting. Those issues are for another debate, but we look forward to the Minister&#146;s boss, the Secretary of State, bringing forward proposals in January about the future of public sector broadcasting. As everyone knows, the options on the table are pretty clear cut, including top-slicing, changes to the regulations that constrain Channel 4, and increasing the commercial exploitation of intellectual property and programmes provided by the public service broadcasters. To be fair to the BBC, BBC Worldwide has done an incredibly effective job in that regard, and it is bringing money back into the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08101749000320">When we talk about the licence fee, it is also important to acknowledge that it might be time limited. That is a dangerous thing to say; I said it at a fringe meeting recently and got myself tied up in knots. However, it is important to acknowledge that technology is changing at an enormously rapid pace. The prerequisite for paying the licence fee is that someone has a box sitting in a room, and the BBC and the collection agencies can check to see if they have such a box. In a time scale that I would hesitate to predict, however, that box might no longer sit in the corner of a room. It could be inside a jacket pocket, on a mobile phone, on a computer on a table, or on many other kinds of device, some of which we have not yet imagined. In the spirit of musing, I suggest that that might well provide a challenge to the licence fee. As far as I am aware, students are charged a licence fee on their laptops, as a way of getting round the fact that many students now watch television&#151;or the iPlayer&#151;on the internet on their laptops without having a television in their rooms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08101749000321">These changes will provide a challenge to the licence fee, but at the moment, the Conservatives are certainly committed to the licence fee as a way of funding the BBC. Ultimately, this will come down to a choice between direct funding by the Government&#151;the money has to come from somewhere, and, in theory, that would involve a rise in general taxation&#151;and funding through the licence fee.</p>

I would recommend that Members read Greg Dyke&#146;s excellent autobiography. While it does not give us general principles about the BBC, it does show  <br>

It does not necessarily give the BBC a fixed income, because its income is based on its ability to collect the licence fee. Indeed, the BBC&#146;s income has gone up as more households have been created in this country.</p>

 I put that on the record. What I was saying was important, but it is not the same as arguing whether the licence fee or direct Government funding is the best way to fund the BBC. As I was saying before the intervention of my hon.

 That is right. The licence fee gives the BBC the freedom to innovate, which is an extremely important point. If the BBC were to sit down and negotiate a direct grant, strings would be attached&#151;something for which I often criticise the Government. Those strings may not necessarily be sinister, as it were&#151;that may not be the Government&#146;s intention&#151;but the Arts Council analogy comes into play again. Although the Arts Council is meant to be an arm&#146;s length body, it receives a direct grant from the Government. What happens then is that the Government, perhaps perfectly laudably, say: &#147;If you are receiving money from us, you had better ensure that you increase access and that you do this, that and the other&#148;. The Arts Council thus appears not to have the freedom to innovate and plough its own furrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000331">Although my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch may object to the phrase, the fact that the BBC can, as it were, &#147;see the licence fee and licence payers&#146; money as its own&#148;, gives it the freedom to innovate. As I suggested earlier, among public sector organisations, the BBC is, uniquely, a very innovative body. I thank the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) for helping me to make that point with greater clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000332">In conclusion, however, freedom to innovate is not confined to the BBC. I do not believe that the BBC can ever rest on its laurels&#151;nor should it seek to. The hon. Member for Selby mentioned BBC Sport and others have mentioned BBC News. I think that the BBC has improved its broadcasts in those spheres because of the fierce competition from Sky, which, as a private company with no subsidy from the taxpayer, has been fantastically innovative in sport, as well as through its introduction of 24-hour news&#151;now a loss-making element provided effectively as a public service&#151;which has completely revolutionised how news is presented on television.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81017-0006.htm_para23"><a name="08101749000333">As I said in my opening remarks, it is entirely appropriate for my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch to bring this Bill forward. It is entirely right, as he said in his opening remarks, for this debate to be conducted in the spirit&#151;not too often seen&#151;of debating a matter of principle. To countenance the abolition of the licence fee is not the same as to countenance the abolition of the BBC. Those who support the licence fee do so with an element of humility when we say that it is the least worst option. I think that our debate has teased out some of the specific reasons why the licence fee is so important, the most central of which are the maintenance of an arm&#146;s length between the Government and the BBC, the maintenance of the BBC&#146;s independence and the means of conferring on the BBC the freedom to innovate and create.</p>

the truce seems to have broken down outside the House, a degree of cross-party consensus remains, at least on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08101749000335">Particularly in this day and age, when we seem to be deluged by cheap reality TV programmes&#151;I mean cheap in terms of production costs and artistic and educational merit&#151;there is certainly a place for publicly funded television that maintains certain standards. I am afraid that the hon. Member for Wantage has somewhat stolen my thunder, or at least accused me in advance of being rather predictable, as at this point I want to pay tribute to the BBC&#146;s natural history unit. It has been based in Bristol since its inception in 1957, although sadly not quite in my constituency. As has been said, it has produced fascinating and ground-breaking programmes such as &#147;The Blue Planet&#148; and &#147;Life on Earth&#148;, and it continues to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000336">In some respects, however, I would question whether the BBC is making best use of licence payers&#146; money. That relates to the point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the fact that the licence fee gives the BBC freedom to innovate. In one area, I am particularly concerned that it is moving into pastures new, which might not be the best approach. I understand that Ofcom and the BBC Trust are examining proposals from the BBC for a massive expansion of its website services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000337">I have nothing but praise for the national and international news on the BBC website, and we have only to look at it to realise that it is used not just by expats, but by many people from other countries who want an insight into what is going on in this country. However, the BBC intends to expand into much more local video news, sports and weather, and I understand that there are plans for three daily bulletins for each, which will be updated three times a day. That will be rolled out in 60 different geographical areas from 2009-10 onwards and will cost about &#163;68 million over three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000338">Putting that in context, last year, the natural history unit&#146;s annual budget of some &#163;37 million was cut by a third, which has meant a reduction in some series that are being produced and a staff cut of a third. Is that really where the BBC should be heading? There is concern that the plans will affect other providers of local news services, which I would argue do the job an awful lot better because they are based on the ground and understand their market. For example, local newspapers are setting up local websites, which run the same stories while catering for a slightly different audience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000339">The concern is that the BBC&#151;by, in effect, using licence fee payers&#146; money to park its tanks on the lawns of local newspapers&#151;will increase the pressure on a sector that is already hard pressed and struggling for advertising revenue in days when the property and jobs markets are perhaps experiencing a downturn. Should the BBC be doing that or sticking to what it is best at?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08101749000340">My other concern was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Selby, and I would have leapt to my feet to intervene had I not been about to mention it in my speech. He referred to the speech made by Jana Bennett on the regionalisation of services. Generally speaking, I do not have a problem with that, and it is obviously good that the BBC is not London-centric and that it is moving some programmes outside London, but one proposal has dismayed people in Bristol. The BBC is moving &#147;Casualty&#148; to Cardiff.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000341">I accept that basing 5 per cent. of BBC production in Cardiff may well be a good move, but &#147;Casualty&#148; has been filmed in Bristol since 1986. It is the world&#146;s second longest-running medical drama and the longest-running emergency-based hospital drama. It paved the way for programmes such as &#147;ER&#148; and &#147;Chicago Hope&#148;. Last year, it won best continuing drama at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards and has been nominated for many other awards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000342">For me, &#147;Casualty&#148; and Bristol are inextricably linked. The programme is based in the fictional city of Holby, but everybody knows the landmarks, such as the Clifton suspension bridge, and the accident and emergency sets are based in warehouses in my constituency. A recent programme was filmed in Arnos Vale, a restored Victorian cemetery in my constituency. Relocating &#147;Casualty&#148; to Cardiff would be akin to relocating EastEnders to Trafalgar square instead of Albert square. It just would not be the same.</p>

 To what extent has the hon. Lady, as a Bristol MP, been consulted by the BBC on this issue? Does she share my concern that this is another example of how although the BBC receives the proceeds of what is effectively a tax from the licence fee payer, it is not accountable for the way in which it spends it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o130"><a name="08101749000344"><a name="81017-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08101749000939"><b>Kerry McCarthy:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I have only been approached by the <i> Bristol Evening Post</i>, which is running a campaign to keep &#147;Casualty&#148; in Bristol, and by the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union, which represents those who work on the programme. As I was about to say, &#147;Casualty&#148; contributes &#163;10 million a year to the local economy. More importantly, it also provides training and work experience for people who want to work in the media industries. That has attracted students to Bristol universities to study media, broadcasting and journalism. Many people have worked on &#147;Casualty&#148;&#151;not only the actors and extras who are seen on screen, but lighting engineers, set designers, camera operators, technicians and writers&#151;and used that experience to move on and set up their own production companies, to work on other programmes or go to the natural history unit. &#147;Casualty&#148; has given them invaluable experience. As the hon. Member for Christchurch suggests, the BBC has not talked to local people about the impact of moving &#147;Casualty&#148; out of Bristol on the local economy. As we experience more difficult times, such factors are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08101749000345">I do not wish to name drop, but last night at a reception in the other place I bumped into Kwame Kwei-Armah, the well-known actor, broadcaster and playwright, who just happened to star in &#147;Casualty&#148; for five years. He was very disappointed by the announcement that it might be relocated, and he has pledged his support to the campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08101749000346">In conclusion, I support a publicly funded BBC and, in the absence of compelling arguments for another way to fund it, I support the retention of the licence fee. It is valid to discuss why it should be that everyone apart from those who qualify for concessions has to pay the same amount, and the increasing demonisation of people who do not have television licences, who are hounded  <br>

by the licensing authorities. I was in that position myself, when I bought a flat in London but did not occupy it for three months and certainly did not have a television there. It felt as though I was being threatened with court action every other day, and that was wrong. The BBC licence people are also based in Bristol and I took the issue up with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000347">There are questions to be asked about how the system operates and whether the best use is made of licence fee money, but I remain to be convinced that the hon.

 It is unusual for all three Front Benchers to sing from similar, if not entirely the same, song sheets. Earlier, we were predicting future legislation, and I suspect that I predicted fairly accurately in this case. The tone of the debate would be rather different if instead of its present title, the Bill were called the Broadcasting (How do we pay for the BBC) Bill. We would be arguing about the licence fee, how long it should last, whether it should be scaled down and alternatives to it. Instead, we are discussing a dramatic change in 2012, and not a more constructive approach to making progress.</p>

 Earlier, we compared the licence fee with the community charge. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that during the so-called poll tax riots, the people who were fed up with the poll tax did not say that they wanted to put a different system in its place? They said that they wanted to get rid of the existing system because it was unjust.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman might be right about the poll tax. He made that comparison earlier, not I. I merely responded to his comments in an intervention. I shall come to public opinion later in my speech, if he will give me the time and the opportunity to do so. I want to go through some of the basic arguments and to consider some of the potential consequences of not having a licence fee. For example, what would have happened if we had not had a licence fee in the past? What would we have missed? I shall also look at the programme for the BBC. The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) mentioned speeches by Jana Bennett, which raised some interesting points that I hope to discuss if time permits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08101749000351">The licence fee is &#163;139.50 for colour and &#163;47 for black and white. I must ask how many black and white licences are sold, if any. I know they exist, but perhaps someone will be inspired at some point and will be able to answer that question. A colour licence fee is the equivalent to about a pint to a pint and a half of beer a week. That is not a vast sum of money for what we get. We get two national TV stations, 10 free national radio stations, 40 free local radio stations, comprehensive online services and, of course, multi-channel services for multi-channel homes.</p>

turned out to be very fine. The BBC&#146;s digital channels BBC 3 and BBC 4 are groundbreaking, inventive and challenging, as well as carrying repeats and other features that we welcome the opportunity to view again. As MPs, we often have surgeries on a Friday night or duties on a Saturday, and we welcome the ability to catch programmes on a Sunday when we forgot to set our digital recorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08101749000353">No one should doubt that the BBC is good value for money. It is not just about the quantity, but about the quality. That is especially important with the move to digital. The broadcasting world is changing, however. We now have films on mobile phones, TV over the internet and so on. In principle, digital switchover means more choice. In practice, we risk the cheap and the easy&#151;more mindless, exploitive reality TV shows. Even Members of Parliament have been on them. Do we recall? We would rather not&#151;I see grimaces round the House. Such programmes crowd out the good programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08101749000354">Heaven help us if we were to rely on FOX News, for instance, for our information about the world, or if we moved towards narrow casting and the narrow-mindedness encouraged by placing viewers in minority interest ghettos. There would be no more of the shared experiences across the nation that we are given by the BBC and by its breadth, with the changes from programme to programme during the day. There are people who do not just get up and change channels. Some people will go from one programme to another and enjoy the experience that they accidentally come across. Some of us found at first that we would sit on the settee with the remote control, clicking from channel to channel to see what was on, much to the annoyance of our other halves. That problem was resolved in my household when the TV channel switcher was put on my wife&#146;s side of the lounge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08101749000355">There are dangers that must be resisted, because the role of the BBC is crucial. We cherish the BBC for its diversity&#151;educational programmes, high quality drama and comedy and children&#146;s shows&#151;free from adverts. There is a huge range of music choice on radio. The BBC website is the most trusted in the world for news and current affairs programmes that are authoritative, accurate and, above all, impartial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08101749000356">Like the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy), who is no longer in the Chamber, I must of course mention nature programmes. My interest in nature was very much inspired by some of the early BBC programmes. The Attenboroughs have both contributed to our creative industries in various ways, and I was transfixed by nature programmes such as &#147;Planet Earth&#148;, although sadly I saw little of it. We have other duties and life is full, but the episodes I saw were of exceptional quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08101749000357">We would be foolish to put all that at risk. The opinions of about 7,000 UK residents on the cost of the licence fee were set out in a survey commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2006. The survey found that respondents were willing to pay a maximum of &#163;138.24 for current BBC services, but that they would pay up to &#163;162.66&#151;I do not know how that was worked out to the exact penny&#151;for the current service and the proposed new activities.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Does he think that people who responded in that way would be willing to make voluntary payments of &#163;139.50 a year to the BBC if there was no compulsory licence fee?</p>

 I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman were to ask the shadow Chancellor that question in terms of whether people would voluntarily pay tax, the answer would be no. Some things have to be paid for and a mechanism has to be found to do it. If we believe that the BBC is a valued institution that should continue, the payment has to come from some source. At present, the licence fee is the fairest way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para18"><a name="08101749000362">To continue my point&#151;if the hon. Gentleman will allow me&#151;when people in the survey were asked what they would be willing to pay for the current services and the proposed new activities, 36.5 per cent. wanted to keep the same licence fee, 35 per cent. were willing to pay a slightly increased amount, of between &#163;15 and &#163;19 a month, and 11.5 per cent. were willing to pay a substantially increased licence fee. In 17 per cent. of cases, the respondents wanted the fee lowered from its then &#163;11 a month, so only a small number&#151;less than a fifth&#151;wanted the licence fee lowered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08101749000363">A more recent poll, carried out for <i> MediaGuardian</i> by Ipsos MORI on 18 August 2008, found that 41 per cent. of respondents agreed that the licence fee was the appropriate way of funding the BBC. I am not too sure where the battalions signing e-petitions have come from, but they are not borne out by a poll in which the majority of people were in favour of keeping the licence fee and only 37 per cent. disagreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08101749000364">There were criticisms, however. It is fair to say that there are concerns about how the BBC manages itself, about its relocations&#151;as we heard earlier, some of its programmes will be relocating from Bristol to Cardiff&#151;and about whether it is good value for money. The fees paid to some personalities give rise to concern from the general public. I do not say whether the BBC is right to pay those individuals such sums. Those are commercial considerations. The BBC is in a competitive market; it is competing with the ITV companies and Sky for people to front programmes. It is for the BBC to make judgments about what it is worth to secure not the mediocre, but the best people to front its services. There is no reason why the BBC should not have the best, albeit not necessarily for all its programmes. In that competition, the BBC sometimes loses&#151;clearly, it has lost out on sport in the past, and it has taken action by Parliament to protect some sports events so that coverage is not subject to open bidding and they are not lost. I know that whether that protection should be extended is a matter of debate, but that is for another time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000366">Criticisms were made in the survey: one third of respondents agreed that the licence fee provides value for money, but almost half&#151;47 per cent.&#151;disagreed. Just under one third agreed that the licence fee assures the provision of quality programming and services not available elsewhere, but a significantly higher proportion&#151;41 per cent.&#151;disagreed. There are questions to answer, which we might consider if this were a different debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000367">There are alternative ways of funding the BBC. The first is subscription, but that would result in a reduction in the BBC&#146;s income, so that it would be unable to do all that it does now. That includes things that benefit those who never watch the BBC&#151;the &#147;university of broadcasting&#148;, the technology development and the drive to digital. The emphasis would be on programmes that persuade viewers to sign up, but people are not easily tempted by the unfamiliar&#151;a point that we touched on earlier. The adventurous, creative initiatives would suffer the most. In addition, funding by subscription does not provide a solution for radio: we are a long way from technology to raise subscriptions for radio, which uses 18 per cent. of licence fee income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08101749000368">In an aside on the quality of the BBC&#146;s output, let me say that when I worked abroad in Iraq for seven months in 1982, my sole contact with home was the BBC World Service. I realise that its funding comes from a different body, but the World Service linked into those BBC programmes with which I was familiar. Listening to the sport, including football, on Saturday night certainly helped me to keep in contact with the UK. I found the familiarity of the BBC helpful when I was living away from home and from my fianc&#233;e, now my wife, to whom I had got engaged shortly before having to work abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="81017-0007.htm_para24"><a name="08101749000369">The second alternative is to pay for the BBC via advertising and sponsorship, but other broadcasters that rely on advertising would suffer. The TV advertising pot remains static. Broadcasters are losing funding and making changes to their newscasting and regional news in an attempt to save money. Public service broadcasters that rely on advertising would demand a reduction in their public service obligation, as ITV already has. If it were reliant on advertising and sponsorship, the BBC would go only for the most popular material that attracts advertising and sponsorship. The diversity that we cherish would be lost.</p>

Yes, it would be more progressive&#151;the hon. Member for Christchurch has a good point&#151;but the licence is already free for the over-75s. The blind receive only a 50 per cent. reduction; it could be argued that that should be increased to 100 per cent., but that, too, is an argument for a general debate on BBC funding. Furthermore, those in care homes get a concessionary rate of &#163;7.50 a year. We could go further, because there are other groups to whom we should consider giving a free service.</p>

Governments of whatever hue could cut funding at a stroke if they did not like what they saw or heard. The public service broadcaster in Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, has had its income cut by 25 per cent. in the past 18 years. Significantly, there is now a campaign to reintroduce the licence fee in Australia. If the UK got rid of the licence fee, in 10 years&#146; time, hon. Members would be saying, &#147;We want to bring back the licence fee, because we used to cherish the BBC, but we have lost a lot of that feeling.&#148;</p>

about its journalism. The BBC only just survived the disgraceful attacks made on it by Alastair Campbell and the Government during the Gilligan affair. We now know that Gilligan&#146;s story was broadly right, yet oddly he, the chairman of governors and the director-general all resigned. In my view, and the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), that was unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000373">Let us imagine what it would have been like if the BBC had been funded directly by the Government. We would have the Fox News problem. Some 80 per cent. of Fox News viewers in the States believed one of the following: that weapons of mass destruction had been found; that there were proven links between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein; and that the US went to war with the support of the rest of the world. Only 23 per cent. of viewers of PBS in the States believed such nonsense. Whom would we believe if the BBC was directly funded by the Government? We would not know what to believe. I trust its coverage. I can see that it is biased at times&#151;we are all slightly biased in what we say&#151;but we can take account of that, and we can hold it to account for that. We can argue with it, and I am sure that all political parties do so, from time to time.</p>

 I observe that even now the BBC regards its funding settlement with some concern because of the political threats that my hon. Friend described. If he is saying that that concern would be made many times worse if there was a direct grant, I very much agree with him. Is he saying that, from the point of view of civil liberties and free speech, the TV licence seems to be the most effective way to put space between the political pressures that the BBC feels and the immeasurably greater political pressures that it would feel if we changed the system?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. The BBC felt threatened as a result of the way in which the licence fee was negotiated last time. I understand some of those concerns, but I am not sure how much of that was manoeuvring. There were arguments on both sides about what the fee level would be, and what would be satisfactory. However, he makes a valid point: if we moved to a direct grant, there would be a significant risk. As I started out by saying, if the tone of the debate were different, we could consider how direct payments could be made and protected. We might come up with a system that protected those payments from interference by Government Ministers, acting on whim because they thought that they had been slighted, or that the Government were being attacked viciously by the BBC all the time. That might be a different issue. I am not saying that we should ever rule those issues out, but given the context of the Bill before us, they are not matters that I could argue for at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000376">The BBC must change in these changing times. For example, it cannot be right for governors to be both flag-wavers for, and regulators of, the BBC. Some of that has changed. The rest of the world looks at us in envy, and abolishing the licence fee would risk throwing it all away. Do we want a dumbed-down, cut-down, less adventurous BBC? No. Do we want a BBC that no longer sets the gold standard for other broadcasters, helps with technological development or is the envy of the world? No. The best way to stop such a change is to vote against the Bill of the hon. Member for Christchurch. We need to consider consequences.</p>

 The &#147;Blue Peter&#148; dogs since the inception of the programme were called Petra, Patch, Shep, Goldie, Bonnie, Mabel and Lucy.

adult life. I recently had the pleasure of attending the David Tennant &#147;Hamlet&#148; in Stratford and I was struck by the number of children and young people in the audience, who had been drawn there because of his performance in &#147;Doctor Who&#148; and who thoroughly enjoyed the &#147;Hamlet&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="st_o148"><a name="08101749000389"><a name="81017-0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="08101749000957"><b>Richard Younger-Ross:</b>
 The Minister makes a good point. Those children had seen an actor in one guise and gone on to watch him in another. I believe that David Tennant&#146;s &#147;Hamlet&#148; is an exceptionally good one. One day, I might get to the theatre myself&#151;something which, sadly, rarely happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000390">I used to listen to &#147;The Archers&#148; as a young child. In a debate yesterday, I said that as a child I wanted to be a signalman, rather than a train driver, because I wanted to direct where the trains went. From &#147;The Archers&#148; I gained an interest in agriculture, and from nature programmes, an interest in wildlife. In my teens, I went from wanting to be a farmer to wanting to be a zoologist, and that all came from the programmes&#151;primarily BBC programmes&#151;that I had listened to and watched. However, to refer back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), I should sadly confess that I was a &#147;Magpie&#148; fan, so I was a traitor to the cause, but competition from the other side can be good for the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08101749000391">There are other popular programmes that are valuable to people, and we could have more of them. &#147;EastEnders&#148; might well survive if there was a downsizing at the BBC. People talk about exporting things from one city to another, but the BBC tried to export that programme to Spain and fell dismally on its face. With direct funding, some programmes would face a lot of pressure. I enjoy watching &#147;Top Gear&#148;, a programme whose presenters&#146; silly and foolish antics a number of hon. Members criticise. I would not condone some of the things that those presenters have done, but overall the programme is enjoyable and brings valuable satisfaction to many people. One can go through the list: &#147;Last of the Summer Wine&#148;, &#147;All Creatures Great and Small&#148; and &#147;Some Mothers Do &#146;Ave &#146;Em&#148;.</p>

He made programmes directly critical of the BBC and wrote &#147;In the Red&#148; and &#147;Absolute Power&#148;, which many of us will have enjoyed. Some of his early stuff was critical of the BBC. He had worked for the corporation at one point and was adept at poking fun at his previous employer and getting it to pay him to broadcast it. A programme that we all know and love&#151;&#151;and a favourite of a former Prime Minister&#146;s&#151;&#151;is &#147;Yes Minister&#148;; that valuable series probably would have survived any cuts.</p>

Successive Government reviews of the BBC charter have concluded that the licence fee is the most appropriate means of funding the BBC, which is so highly valued by the public, and I am sure that the Minister will continue in that vein.

 The Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) is half-baked. We often discuss weird and wonderful Bills on Fridays, some of which are badly drafted, but I do not think that we have had a Bill as badly drafted as this one this year. This debate has been more like an Adjournment debate on the licence fee than a Second Reading debate on a public Bill introduced as a private Member&#146;s Bill under the presentation of Bills procedure.</p>

While the licence fee may not be the best system, the Bill makes no provision for any alternative. It is nihilistic and would sweep everything away with only the vaguest idea of what to replace it with. It is simply not thought through. He made comparisons with the poll tax, but that is a false comparison. The poll tax changed a system&#151;the old rating system&#151;that had been there for many years. It was a tax per person in a household, not, as in the case of the licence fee, a single charge per household. The licence fee has exemptions, which the poll tax did not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08101749000406">The hon. Gentleman argued about cost, but we need to bear in mind the cost of the licence fee as against that of buying a new TV. Some of the expensive large flat-screen plasma TVs are extremely expensive, and the cost of the licence fee will be a tiny part of the overall total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000407">The hon. Gentleman referred to waste at the BBC and the number of managers and their salaries. That argument is a red herring, because any waste would still have to be dealt with however the BBC were financed, whether through the licence fee, direct subsidy from the Government, sponsorship or advertising.</p>

Gentleman had no answer to my question about how the Bill would deal with the funding of radio, one of the BBC&#146;s great flagships. Ultimately, he had no alternative to put forward. He vaguely talked about sponsorship, and we have heard about the difficulties involved in that. Will we see &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148; sponsored by Moss Bros or Harvey Nichols? It is simply not a viable option. He talked about adverts. We know that Channel 4, which is perhaps the commercial equivalent of the BBC and a public service broadcaster, has had great difficulty filling a gap in its revenue because of the fall in advertising income. Such a move would have an impact on commercial television generally, spread the cake more thinly and not provide an answer.</p>

There is no way that we could have a system of state funding that could provide the necessary guarantees to ensure that we did not have political interference and that the impartiality for which the BBC is famous was maintained. We could have a situation where the &#147;Today&#148; programme one day beats up the Chancellor through a challenging interview by John Humphrys, and the next day the Chancellor is responsible for setting how much money the BBC should be allocated.

 This has been a long and, sometimes, very interesting debate. The Bill proposes that the television licence fee be abolished, although it does not offer, as other hon. Members have mentioned, an alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para26"><a name="08101749000413">Let me outline the Government's position on the proposal of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). The Government position on the licence fee is well established. The future of that fee and the funding of the BBC were addressed fully in the recent BBC charter review, which was completed in 2006. The review concluded that, compared to the alternatives,</p>
<a name="81017-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="08101749000692"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the licence fee continues to be the best funding mechanism for the foreseeable future&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para27"><a name="08101749000414">in other words, it is the least worst option. It is a very difficult subject and I fully understand why that phrase was used. Under the terms of the BBC&#146;s royal charter, therefore, the BBC will continue to be funded by the licence fee for the duration of the charter, which is in force until the end of 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para28"><a name="08101749000415">I will explain shortly how the charter review reached that conclusion. As a first step, however, it may be helpful to set out why large sums of public money are put into broadcasting and not into other creative industries such as the music industry or publishing. There are two main reasons for that. First, broadcasting can contribute to society in ways that other media do not. The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) and my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) illustrated that well. Secondly, as citizens, we would not get everything that we have come to expect from broadcasting if we relied on commercial providers alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81017-0008.htm_para29"><a name="08101749000416">The case for public funding of the BBC and for public service broadcasting is in general based on the benefits that it can bring to society, which have had a very good airing in the Chamber. That includes &#147;Yesterday in Parliament&#148;, which several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey), mentioned. That programme has a niche audience, but one that appreciates the time given to the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08101749000417">The BBC has been set objectives that reflect the benefits. It is defined by its goals as a public service, not only its programming output. The 2005 charter review Green Paper, entitled &#147;A strong BBC, independent of government&#148;, states:</p>
<a name="81017-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08101749000693"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Television and radio audiences are huge. Almost every programme on the major terrestrial channels will reach millions of people simultaneously. That places such broadcasters in a uniquely powerful position, and since the BBC was first established, in the 1920s, it has been commonly accepted that such power should be harnessed for society&#146;s good. Audience research shows that the public agree with this principle. They want programmes to inform and educate as well as entertain.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000418">Like the hon. Member for Teignbridge, I find that &#147;The Archers&#148; fulfils those three criteria wonderfully: it informs, educates and entertains. I have listened to it for more years than I care to remember.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000419">We recognise the positive contribution that broadcasting can make to the effective functioning of democracy. While people continue to watch television and listen to radio in such large numbers, we are determined that the public should get the service that they need and deserve, and that the BBC should retain the potential to deliver those benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000420">The hon. Member for Wantage referred to the ability to innovate that the licence fee grants. That is an important part of its benefit to the public. Audiences would not reap the full benefit of that sort of innovation or of the information, education and entertainment that the BBC currently supplies without large-scale public funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000421">The Green Paper continues:</p>
<a name="81017-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="08101749000694"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As the scale and sophistication of pay-TV options increase, television viewers may benefit from an increased choice and diversity of different types of service. Ofcom&#146;s review of public service broadcasting has concluded that fully commercial providers will never provide us with high quality public service on anything like the current scale.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08101749000422">Anyone who has spent time in another country such as the United States, where there are a couple of good public service channels, will realise that the permeation&#151;the mainstreaming&#151;of the public service ethos that pertains in this country does not exist there. I would personally be sad to lose it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000423">We value television&#146;s ability to interest us in new ideas and the way in which it can reflect other communities&#146; lives. We need to spend public money on that and we need the BBC for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000424">The Green Paper goes on:</p>
<a name="81017-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="08101749000695"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The case for public service radio is, if anything, stronger than that for TV. Even if audiences wanted to pay for the sort of distinctive content that the BBC provides, there is as yet no price mechanism that could allow them to do so. Radio is entirely free to listen. Commercial stations do fulfil a public service role in some ways&#151;particularly through the provision of news and local information. However, the only available commercial models rely on advertising and sponsorship and commercial stations therefore tend to cluster towards the middle ground of taste, in order to reach the widest possible audience.&#148;</p>

 The Under-Secretary makes a valid point. Does she accept that one of the problems with commercial stations is the amount of time given to news? There is always a conflict in those stations between the journalists, who want longer news broadcasts, and the programmers, who want more adverts and music, and less information and news?</p>

 That is a problem. The 30-second soundbite that politicians are traditionally allowed on the perhaps less pressured stations tends to be reduced to 20 or 15 seconds on commercial radio stations in my area, which is the eastern region and Hertfordshire. One tends to get a great deal of music, quite a lot of advertising and not much information, but people like to have that information.</p>

Members might be interested to learn that the annual percentage share of BBC 1 fell from 30.8 per cent. in 1997 to 22 per cent. in 2007 and that the annual percentage share of BBC 2 fell from 11.6 per cent. in 1997 to 8.5 per cent. in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000429">The Green Paper continued:</p>
<a name="81017-0009.htm_brev4"><a name="08101749000697"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the last decade, the BBC has moved beyond broadcasting into online and interactive services. Such services do not generally have the same sort of mass impact as television or radio programmes&#151;the internet is a more personal, one-to-one medium. Nevertheless the internet is an increasingly important source of information for millions, and the BBC has established itself as a central, trusted presence in the online world. BBC Online is the most popular site in the UK. In this context, the independent review of BBC Online...identified some clear purposes for BBC Online that place it alongside the BBC&#146;s television and radio services&#151;sustaining social values and providing high quality, innovative and accessible content for UK users.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08101749000430">I know that the BBC ticker runs constantly across the top of many hon. Members&#146; television screens in the House and on those of their staff. Indeed, it is often how we are alerted to breaking news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08101749000431">The Green Paper continued:</p>
<a name="81017-0009.htm_brev5"><a name="08101749000698"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In addition, that review noted that BBC Online plays a valuable role in the development of the web itself: using the BBC&#146;s position as a trusted guide to bring new users to the internet; encouraging users to try new interactive technology; and setting a benchmark of innovation and creativity. The BBC&#146;s internet presence also offers valuable support to its traditional TV and radio programmes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08101749000432">For instance, the BBC broke new ground in its coverage of the Olympics in 2004, by backing it up on the internet and the radio. Indeed, that has now become usual for television and radio programmes. For instance, we can now go online and watch the &#147;Today&#148; programme in action in the studio, which is an innovation.</p>

The Beijing games were the first time that viewers could watch the Olympics in high definition, on the BBC HD channel. I understand that all in all there were about 300 hours of coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="81017-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08101749000434">In looking at options for funding, the Green Paper came down unequivocally for public funding of broadcasting.

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned the BBC World Service. As someone who has been a consumer of it quite often, I find it very good, but not as in depth as some of the services that we get here. We can see some of the commercial considerations at play there, particularly in countries with quite a high level of advertising. For example, outside Britain, we can see BBC World with advertising.</p>

 Yes; in fact, that funding comes through the Foreign Office. I am sorry that I got the two confused.

 I listened to the BBC World Service a great deal when I worked in Iraq; it was very important to me. I was in Iraq in 1982, during the Falklands war, and I remember the then Conservative Government putting pressure on the BBC World Service because of what they perceived as its biased reporting of that conflict, although from my position, sitting in Baghdad, I thought that its reporting was very fair. There have been pressures ever since then, in Government circles, in regard to that budget. The hon.

 The latter is extremely good and I enjoy listening to it, as I enjoy Radio 3.

If services were put together in differently priced packages, with premium programmes available at different prices depending, for example, on their newness or exclusivity, audiences would have more freedom of choice and some argue that the BBC might retain a sustainable level of funding. This sort of model would raise significant issues of principle. The chief argument against subscription as a funding method is that it would undermine the principle of universal access&#151;BBC content would no longer be free at the point of use. It can be argued in response that the existing licence fee is in anyway a form of &#145;compulsory subscription&#146;. Services are only &#145;free&#146; once a bulk licence fee has been paid.</p>
</ul><a name="81017-0009.htm_brev20"><a name="08101749000711"><ul><p class="tabletext">But if people choose not to subscribe then prices might have to rise for those who carried on paying, and some low-income viewers and listeners who wanted to subscribe might be priced out of the market for BBC content. If that content were not universally available, its potential benefit to society would be reduced.</p>
</ul><a name="81017-0009.htm_brev21"><a name="08101749000712"><ul><p class="tabletext">In the short term, there are also significant practical problems. In mainstream radio, no subscription facility exists, nor does one look likely to be available for some time.</p>

 I am reluctant to intervene in the Minister&#146;s long and dogged analysis, but has she considered the fact that the BBC&#146;s audience share is 30 per cent., and that the figure is falling, not increasing?

 My arguments date back because they were part of the research that was done for the general charter review. One reason that there has been a fall-off in audience for a great number of things is the huge variety of outlets that are available. A particular example that is cited in relation to younger people, particularly younger men, is the availability of computer games and other calls on people&#146;s time. What I am trying to do&#151;I agree that it is dogged&#151;is to prove to the hon. Gentleman that we looked at the funding of the BBC in every way possible.

the fact that the BBC has followed the example of Sky and others and now broadcasts for 24 hours, which places greater pressures on its budget.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is completely right. Television has changed and is changing almost as we are standing here. We must take the final point about why people like the licence fee: it is seen as a way of guaranteeing high quality public service broadcasting. There are good and bad public service broadcasters, and I think that the BBC is second to none. We get an excellent service from it, which is partly based on the fact that the corporation&#146;s annual income is unaffected by commercial factors and economic fluctuations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08101749000476">Let us imagine what would happen if people had to rely on subscriptions from some of the firms that are facing an economic downturn. We would definitely suffer.</p>

 Is not one of the BBC&#146;s advantages the fact that it knows where its funding comes from and knows that that funding is there for a certain period? That allows it to plan in a way that others cannot, and that is an advantage in enabling it to produce high quality public service broadcasting.</p>

 It also allows it to broadcast programmes such as &#147;Yesterday in Parliament&#148;, which can be seen as loss-leaders, to appeal to a niche market. If that ability is removed, there is a danger that the situation could end up like that with the buses, where only the popular routes are served. That can be very dangerous.</p>

Their strong support for the licence fee was secured by the belief that the current system was tried and tested.

As long as the British public want the BBC to be an independent, universal broadcaster, committed to serving everyone on equal terms and to delivering quality and originality, the licence fee will remain a powerful and effective means of paying for its services. It is the BBC&#146;s licence fee funding that enables it to focus solely on serving the British public. It gives the BBC the time, breathing space, freedom from commercial pressure and stability to take risks and to aim to serve the widest possible range of audience needs. The first obligation of commercial broadcasters is to their shareholders.</p>

<p><a name="st_o180"><a name="08101749000496"><a name="81017-0010.htm_spnew15"><a name="08101749000989"><b>Barbara Follett:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman. Fear does not come into it, but his remarks are indeed helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000497">I shall finish my speech by considering the BBC&#146;s views about why the licence fee is the best way of funding the service. The UK&#146;s culture, society and democracy benefit greatly from the universal availability of high quality broadcast services that create public value. Licence fee funding confers on the BBC an obligation&#151;a responsibility to treat everyone in the country fairly and equally, ensuring that they receive the high quality programmes they want, even if the audiences are not always large. That direct connection between the BBC and the British public has conditioned the way the BBC behaves and the programmes it makes. Because rich and poor, old and young pay the same, the BBC treats all the same. In the words of a Member of the other place, Lord Puttnam:</p>
<a name="81017-0010.htm_brev20"><a name="08101749000735"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The licence fee remains the most effective and equitable form of funding that has ever been created for a public body.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21 April 2004; Vol. 660, c. 325.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000498">The second consideration is politics. A conundrum in public service broadcasting is how to ensure that a publicly funded broadcaster can remain independent from political influence, given the old saying, &#147;he who pays the piper calls the tune&#148;. Licence fee funding solves that conundrum by ensuring that it is the British people who pay for the BBC, and not the Government, who control its output. Although the Government set the licence fee at regular intervals, the BBC&#146;s finances do not form part of their annual spending reviews or budget setting. The licence fee is therefore an important pillar of the BBC&#146;s independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08101749000499">The final consideration is economics. Broadcasting has unusual economic characteristics. Like street lighting and public parks, it is a public good: one person consuming it does not prevent others from doing so. Without intervention, public goods tend to be priced too high and to be under-supplied; as a result, some people who could have consumed the goods at no additional cost go without. Those welfare losses represent a market failure, in the sense of an inefficient allocation of society&#146;s overall resources. The effect is compounded by the tendency of private providers of public goods to become monopolists. Licence fee funding for the BBC recognises the public good characteristics of broadcasting and ensures a low price and universal availability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08101749000500">There are other advantages. Because it is independent of the economic cycle&#151;that is extremely important at the present time&#151;the licence fee enables the BBC to behave counter-cyclically, ensuring that investment in the UK&#146;s creative economy, training and technology is maintained, even in times of downturn. It also supports the BBC in taking longer-term risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81017-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08101749000501">In May 2005, the BBC published its response to our Green Paper. Its findings include the following:</p>

Advertising funding would creative conflicting incentives for the BBC. It would have to balance the requirement to deliver on its public purposes with the need to generate revenue in the marketplace. Over time, it would broadcast a less rich range and balance of programmes than it does today.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I understand that the Minister, notwithstanding my intervention, is continuing to speak because there is a problem on the Government Benches, in that the Minister who is to reply to the debate on the next Bill is not yet here.

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000508">Moving to subscription funding would result in the permanent loss of one of the main sources of the BBC&#146;s public value: its universality. Research, again commissioned by the BBC, showed that as a subscription service, the BBC would need to charge &#163;13 a month to maximise revenue, which was 30 per cent. higher than the licence fee in 2004. As a consequence, it is estimated that a significant number of people, including some low-income viewers and listeners, would be priced out of the market for the BBC content that they value. Over and above that, the UK population would lose &#163;300 million-worth of consumer welfare every year. In conclusion, the Government and the BBC, having considered the numerous alternatives, cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that the television licence fee as currently constructed should be abolished.</p>

BBC television licence fee, which 37 per cent. of people are against, is just a necessary evil. I may be the only radical present, and the only person fighting against the outbreak of conservatism with a small &#147;c&#148; in the Chamber, but I know that I have the support of other radicals in promoting the ideas in the Bill. Earlier, I quoted Greg Dyke and Anthony Jay; an increasing number of forward-looking opinion-formers will not let the matter rest. They think that we have to find an alternative to the despised licence fee.</p>

 No. The Minister seemed to be saying that the BBC is an island and that what else is going on in the economy does not really matter, but I suggest to her that the BBC is not an island. That was made very clear by Michael Grade in his speech to the Royal Television Society. I quoted part of it before, and I shall now quote a different bit:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000513">The Minister will be familiar with the arguments that Michael Grade put forward in that speech. They are all related to what has been happening in the real marketplace, to the threats to the future of competition in the provision of television news services in this country, and to the possible demise of independent television news services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000516">The Minister referred to the report that the penetration of BBC 1 and 2 into people&#146;s homes has gone down to 30 per cent. and is still falling.

one of the problems with the present structure. There is no such sense of accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000518">The Minister praised the BBC internet services. If Google can raise &#163;50 million a year in advertising from its services, I see no reason why the BBC could not get some advertising revenue from its internet services. Even more important, it is wrong that on its internet services the BBC does not allow a relationship to be developed with other non-BBC services. That is an abuse of a monopoly position, which I hope the Minister will address, even if not the other points that have been raised during the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000519">The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) made a number of points, going back to all those years when the BBC was a monopoly funded by a licence fee. But things have moved on. He argued that the BBC should be free to compete for the best people. I have no argument with that. My argument is that the managers in the BBC are in a bubble of immunity and seem to be getting much larger salaries than the marketplace would suggest they are worth. I hope the BBC will look into that. As was pointed out by Polly Toynbee, the very high salaries being paid are, in a sense, a poisoned chalice for the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08101749000520">Let us not forget that my Bill would not prevent people who wished to continue supporting the BBC voluntarily from doing so. Instead of public service broadcasting in the present format, it might, at some time in the future, become a charitable objective. The BBC could obtain charitable status and donations from its supportive public could benefit from Gift Aid and tax relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08101749000521">I am not keen on prescription. For that reason, the Bill does not set out in detail the alternative forms of funding, but what is common to all those who criticised the various forms of alternative funding is that they put each one in a silo and suggested that that would be the only alternative form of funding. What I suggest is that the best way forward would be a basket of several different alternative forms of funding, depending on the nature of the service being funded. That argument has not been addressed in the debate.</p>

Members always say that their Bills or debates are timely, and I am no different. My Bill is particularly timely, not least because next week attention will focus on stem cell research and regenerative medicine because of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. At that stage, the focus will predominantly be on embryonic research, but my Bill gives us an opportunity to focus on the increasingly significant issue of umbilical cord blood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08101749000530">There is a concern that Britain is lagging behind other countries. When we debate the remaining stages of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill next week, we will no doubt hear the Minister saying that the aim is for the United Kingdom to be at the forefront of stem cell research. The concern is that this country is lagging behind when it comes to umbilical cord blood&#151;in respect of availability, transplantation and, significantly, research.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we are lagging behind in those respects. Does he agree that that is a tragic irony, as in this field we have some of the best minds in the world? He will know that I am very involved with the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Does he agree that the innovations that he proposes make sense, because we can make a world-class contribution to curing motor neurone disease and other diseases if we have the courage to make the investment?</p>

The issue is timely because at Newcastle university Professor Colin McGuckin and his assistant Dr. Nico Forraz have been leading the way in making the point that umbilical cord blood is not only an alternative to bone marrow stem cells. Professor McGuckin has demonstrated the existence of pluripotent cells in cord blood and that cord blood-derived cells have the capacity to form differentiated tissue types. Like embryonic stem cells, they can be differentiated into other types such as liver, renal, pancreatic, vascular and corneal cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08101749000534">It is important that we recognise the potential in the neurone area as well. It is such a shame that Professor McGuckin and Dr. Forraz have resigned from the research unit at Newcastle. They are going to Lyons in France, where they will have the benefit of being able to carry out research into regenerative medicine. They want to set up a regenerative medicine institute dedicated to umbilical cord blood and adult stem cells. Their departure is a significant loss.

the importance of collecting umbilical cord blood from the minority communities, among whom collection is lower than among the population as a whole. Does he agree about the importance of that? I see that the Bill refers to the issue. Does he agree that we need to do much more to encourage mothers from minority communities to donate their cord blood, to help deal with the diseases that particularly affect, and are prevalent among, those communities?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and for his support for the Bill. A significant service is provided by the cord blood bank at Edgware and, not far from his constituency, at the Royal Free hospital, with the work that the Anthony Nolan Trust does on cord blood at its headquarters there. A key aim of the Bill must be to ensure the promotion of the collection of cord blood for minority groups and mixed-race families, who are often at the bottom of the scale in terms of finding bone marrow matches. Cord blood offers great hope for people in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and mine. Families in the Cypriot community often experience great difficulties when children who are suffering from leukaemia are unable, because of their particular blood type, to obtain a bone marrow match. They too recognise the importance of umbilical cord blood.</p>

 I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks. A constituent of mine, Mrs. Jeanette Crizzle, who has now very sadly passed away, was of mixed parentage and died of leukaemia because she could not find a suitable bone marrow match. That led to the creation of the Jeanette Crizzle Trust, which is designed to help the Government to promote the &#147;Give and Let Live&#148; donor programme in secondary schools. That has been taken up by 3 per cent. of schools. The cord blood bank that my hon. Friend would like to set up would give a lot of hope to people of mixed parentage who face these life-threatening diseases with, sadly, little hope of finding a suitable donor.</p>

The service is available in four areas&#151;Luton and Dunstable, Northwick Park, Watford and Barnet. The midlands, for example, has no NHS hospital collecting cord blood. It is important that we look at how that can be improved, and I know that the Minister will want to indicate that progress is being made. Organisations such as the Anthony Nolan Trust are keen for availability to spread further. I commend its national cord blood bank, which was opened on 11 September in Nottingham. It has the great aim of increasing the collection of cord blood, which currently stands at about 10,000 cord units, to 50,000 units in five years. It wants to ensure that there are collection points that properly reflect the importance of providing people, particularly those from mixed-race families, with the matches that they need.</p>

Her daughter, Billie, sadly died of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She was ill for nearly two years and was due to have a bone marrow transplant but could not get back into remission. Mrs. Josiah tried high and low to find matches for Billie, but sadly, particularly because her daughter was of mixed-race background, it was not possible to find one. She contacted me to say:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08101749000541">How we respond to that is the challenge of the Bill and my question to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000542">The Bill is timely in the sense that the Government have an ongoing umbilical cord blood review. I hope that the Minister has sufficient time to provide an update on the conclusions of that review and on whether the aims of the Bill can properly be met by its recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="08101749000543"><a name="81017-0011.htm_spnew17"><a name="08101749001007"><b>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch) (Con):</b>
 What my hon. Friend is putting forward seems to be absolute common sense. Have the Government indicated to him in advance that they support the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_o199"><a name="08101749000544"><a name="81017-0011.htm_spnew18"><a name="08101749001008"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 Sadly, I have not had that indication. As I am sure the Minister will confirm, there is a general indication that there is support for the Bill. Indeed, a recent parliamentary answer said that there is support for umbilical cord research as well as other types of stem cell research, but the Bill wants to put those warm words into reality. We want the Minister today to say, ideally, that there is support for the Bill, despite it not having time to go through all its stages, and to give an assurance that, even through non-legislative means, we can achieve the purposes of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000545">The Bill is also timely because this week an all-party parliamentary group was launched on umbilical cord blood and adult stem cells. That has been supported by a number of hon. Members and those in the other place. What is significant about the members of that group and about those who attended the meeting is that they come from all sides of the argument, although they will no doubt draw their battle lines during the human fertilisation and embryology debate. They included many who would traditionally be seen as pro-life, those who would traditionally be termed pro-choice, those who support embryonic research and those who look to what they would consider more ethically sound stem cell research routes. All were there together supporting umbilical cord blood donation and the aims of the Bill. That support shows that we have an important opportunity not just to go down the route of embryonic research but to put cord blood centre stage&#151;it seems to be sidelined at the moment&#151;and to ensure that it has support, so that it is available at collection points and there is proper transplantation and research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08101749000546">Why is there a need for the Bill? As I have said, just four NHS hospitals have collection points, but there is also a lack of information. I was fortunate to live near Barnet hospital. Throughout the births of our six children, never were we informed that there was the opportunity and option for us to allow the cord blood from our  <br>

children to be donated. That seems madness and a complete waste. It is a waste that over 90 per cent. of cords are simply thrown away and treated as a waste product when they could be a life-saving opportunity for many. To collect 1,000 or so cords a year is not enough. It is far behind other European countries such as Spain, which sees it as the norm and part of the process of giving blood to collect the cord. Fewer than 200 transplants out of a worldwide total of 8,000 is also not enough. About 65,000 litres of cord blood are thrown away. That is not acceptable. Of those cords that are collected, 50 per cent. effectively end up being thrown away. The Anthony Nolan Trust and others say that we could make so much more use of that. We could make some great research use of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81017-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08101749000547">The way that cord blood is traditionally used is to help in leukaemia and other blood-related disorders. Such disorders have traditionally led people to seek matches through bone marrow, but of the 24,000 cases of leukaemia in the UK, less than 50 per cent. of patients will find a bone marrow match. That has led to the individuals who have already been mentioned today and to others contacting me about their concern that more should be done. The mother of Eva Winston-Hart, Amy, said, when she sought to find a cure for a particularly vicious form of leukaemia:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08101749000548">In desperation she got out a message to the media to find help. A number of donors came forward. More than 500 people queued in Market Harborough, but no one was suitable. Amy said:</p>
<a name="81017-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08101749000746"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It was agonising. We were doing everything we could, but as time went by we really thought nothing would be found to save her life.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000549">However, a few months later, Eva found a match. Was that match through bone marrow? It was not. The blood stem cells were from the umbilical cord of a baby born thousands of miles away in a small town in New Jersey, America. Now she is doing well and is optimistic about her future. We need to ensure that there is a life for those like Eva, for those like Billie, whose life, sadly, was taken away&#151;and for those like Caitlin Behan, whom I met only last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000550">At the age of seven, Caitlin also suffered from a particularly rare blood-related disorder. Again, she could not find a bone marrow match. By chance, her doctor attended a conference with a consultant from Spain, who happened to mention the option of cord blood. Only through that chance conversation did the information get back to Bernadette Behan that there was an option of finding cord blood as a match for her daughter. The search continued and they went to Barcelona, where the cord blood that was given to Caitlin was found. Now, at the age of 11, she is making progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000551">We need to support the work of the Anthony Nolan Trust and other organisations that do such a fine job. Their aim, which should be commended, is to collect 50,000 cord blood units and to locate 10 collection centres in ethnically diverse areas throughout the country. That is a fine aim and those organisations work well with King&#146;s College to ensure that samples are available for transplantation and research. We should also support the national cord blood programme, which is based in Nottingham. However, we need to go further by providing information to pregnant mothers. The Bill would do  <br>

It is not only an alternative to bone marrow, but has great potential for the future. We need to ensure the availability of cord blood samples for research. We support the fine work of Newcastle university and Colin McGuckin on ensuring that we do not necessarily have to rely on embryonic research, but can pursue umbilical cord blood as a convenient, ethically sound alternative, which many people would support.</p>

people who need bone marrow transplants, particularly those from the smaller ethnic groups or those of mixed race, face problems finding a match. That is a difficultly in my constituency, where there are fairly large Kashmiri and Bengali communities, simply because we do not have the opportunity to get matches in this country.

 First, let me say to the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) that of course we have sympathy for the sentiment of the Bill. Indeed, it would command our support were it not for the fact that we already carry out everything that it requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08101749000564">It is important to place on record the fact that although we export nearly 75 per cent. of our cord blood units, we import a large percentage through mutual access to international networks. The NHS cord blood bank is the fourth largest in the world. There is no call anywhere in the world for routine collection. We have a large bank and it will get bigger. There is access to more than 10 million cord blood and bone marrow samples through worldwide networks. It is essential that we support the research that hon. Members have raised involving their constituents&#151;sadly, including constituents who are no longer with us&#151;so that they can benefit from it. That is what we are all about.</p>

Before explaining our opposition in more detail, I, like the hon. Gentleman, would like to welcome the Anthony Nolan Trust&#146;s initiative. Since its establishment in 1977, the trust has proved highly successful and is today arguably one of the leading centres of bone marrow expertise in the world. The trust&#146;s register of more than 400,000 bone marrow donors plays a crucial part in helping to treat NHS patients suffering from life-threatening blood disorders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08101749000566">I volunteered to become a donor in the &#146;80s, when I was working as a nurse in the NHS at Hammersmith hospital, which had launched an initiative to encourage people to donate towards the Anthony Nolan Trust. Its work is vital not only nationally but internationally, because it is part of a network that gives NHS patients access to more than 10 million registered bone marrow and cord blood donations worldwide. That is a fantastic achievement, and it is made possible by the hard work and dedication of those involved with the trust. It is a commitment for which I and many thousands of others are very grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08101749000567">There is already a national cord blood banking programme. The Department of Health has funded targeted cord blood collection for the past 12 years. The NHS cord blood bank, managed by the NHS Blood and Transplant authority, was established in 1996 and has received more than &#163;10 million in funding from the Department of Health. It is the fourth biggest such bank in the world, with an inventory of about 12,000 umbilical cord blood units. The Department will be investing a further &#163;10 million to increase the number of units stored to 20,000 by 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08101749000568">The vast majority of donors available on registers worldwide are of white Caucasian ethnic background, and most patients from that racial group have more than a 90 per cent. chance of finding a matched unrelated donor. However, that figure falls substantially for patients from ethnic minorities, who have only a 30 to 40 per cent. chance of finding a good match. The point raised by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) on that issue is taken seriously by all of us in the House because we all have constituents from different backgrounds and because we all have a responsibility to worldwide research in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08101749000569">The aim of the bank is to redress that imbalance by focusing collection at hospitals with high ethnic diversity and high delivery rates. As a consequence, approximately 40 per cent. of donations in the NHS cord blood bank derive from ethnic minority mothers&#151;in contrast to the 3 to 4 per cent. ethnic minority bone marrow donors presently in the British bone marrow registry&#151;thus increasing the potential for matches among patients from diverse ethnic groups. Collections take place in a dedicated area outside the delivery suite, so that risk to the well-being of the mother and child is minimised.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. The Department of Health&#146;s umbilical cord review is due to report in the late autumn, towards the end of the year. The consultants carrying out this extensive review are due to produce their report soon, as I have said. The work is important because it also includes comparisons with current practice in other interest countries, namely, Canada, China, France, Japan and the United States of America. Interest in the review has far exceeded expectations, and it&#151;along with the accompanying debate and the very well-received expert workshop that took place at the end of May&#151;has provided the Department with a far more detailed picture of the situation, nationally and internationally.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman again raises an interesting point, and I feel really confident that the Minister who has responsibility for this matter will want to share the findings of the review. If he writes to me on those points, I will personally see that they are given priority in the Department so that they can be included. We will do our best to do that, because his interest in this matter is obviously heartfelt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000575">As I suggested, the collections take place in a dedicated area outside the delivery suite, so risk to the well-being of mother and child is minimised.

Suitable samples, which contain at least 40 ml of blood, are processed for banking and later transplantation. Those not meeting the criteria are, of course&#151;where consent is in place&#151;made available for this important research. All the units are available to NHS patients across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81017-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000576">The cord blood banking remit also encompasses the collection of directed donations to treat members of high-risk families. Collections are made by midwives at four NHSBT centres at Oxford, Bristol, Birmingham and Leeds. The service is supported 24 hours a day and includes training, telephone advice and liaison with the obstetric delivery unit to arrange collection. The training is, of course, essential. When people are on the telephone, it is critical to pass this information on to them in an informed way. That is why the continuing professional development of all concerned is an important issue; it must be taken with the seriousness that it deserves.</p>

However, Department of Health Ministers and officials in their many conversations with the trust have made it clear that support for any proposal of this nature&#151;from the trust or any other organisation&#151;can be given only if it supports and complements the current collection programme of the NHS Cord Blood Bank. The bank has vast experience and highly developed skills in the collection and banking of cord blood that cannot be matched anywhere else in the UK. I hope that all hon.

If current collection and use is to be expanded in order to meet optimal unit numbers earlier or to provide more research material, that is best developed through existing specialist services in the area and in collaboration with NHS trusts and maternity services. Legislation requiring routine collection in all births would lead to a drain on NHS resources that could not be justified by clinical need. I am sure that the hon.

 It is not often that I ask for an Adjournment debate, but a few weeks ago I met someone at my weekly advice surgery and something about her story really got to me. I almost could not believe that a big business, and especially a big power supplier, could treat her as it had and not realise that anything was wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08101749000629">My constituent, Michelle, told me that she and her six-year-old son, Jayden, had been left without hot water, cooking and heating for four and a half months. She told me that she had fallen behind on her gas and had been cut off. At no time did she disguise the fact that she had arrears. She said that she had spoken to her supplier on numerous occasions to try to get on a lower tariff and make affordable monthly payments, or even go on a prepayment meter&#151;all to no avail. She said that she had told her supplier that she had a six-year-old son, but that the person she spoke to had said that that would not make any difference, as they could help only if he was under four. She told me that ever since she had been cut off, she had faced problem after problem and felt as though she was being held to ransom over impossible demands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08101749000630">Michelle&#146;s gas supplier is Scottish Power. The more I have dealt with that company in this case, the more I can believe what she has told me. Like other hon. Members, I take up dozens and dozens of new cases each week, writing and speaking to companies and public bodies alike. I do not always agree with the outcome, but I usually feel that I am dealing with reasonable people. Scottish Power might be a perfectly nice company, but something about my dealings with it has not felt quite straight. If I were to apply for an Adjournment debate every time I thought that a constituent had got less than they deserved, I would be here every week. But I want to single out Scottish Power for special attention. The information it has given me has been inconsistent and contradictory, and at root I just do not think that it is bothered about my constituent. Nor does it think that I can do anything to affect it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08101749000631">I have initiated this debate because I am worried that Scottish Power might be treating other people unreasonably. I want Michelle and Jayden to be able to cook again, and to be warm this winter. I just do not think that Scottish Power is all that fussed. I do not pretend for a moment that Michelle has been one of the company&#146;s best customers. She certainly fell behind with her payments, and it has been a vicious circle for her for three years. But the price has been going up, and she is on benefits. It has not been easy, and she has got into a mess. Her history with Scottish Power has been far from straightforward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08101749000632">Scottish Power took over her supply in March 2005, when she was obviously a customer it thought worth attracting. It said that she could pay a direct debit of &#163;35 a month, but within six months it said that she had to increase her direct debit by 30 per cent. to &#163;45. It is not possible to tell whether it lured her in with a low introductory rate and then decided to start taking more and more, but a 30 per cent. increase in the first six  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2008">

months seems rather high. We should remember that this was before the huge price rises of the last year or two. Nor was it necessary. Michelle&#146;s bill said that in that first six months she had actually overpaid, by &#163;81.38, but still Scottish Power pressed ahead and increased her direct debit. This was the point at which Michelle started to fall behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08101749000633">Michelle called Scottish Power to say that she could not afford &#163;45 a month, and asked to stop her direct debit. Scottish Power did not get any further information at this point, or find out if she had children or was on benefits. They just let her be, no doubt happy to add the monthly penalty to the bill of customers who cannot pay by direct debit these days. It did nothing for another five months until, in February 2006, it sent out a reminder, took Michelle off any discounts she might have once had, and gave her case to the collections team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08101749000634">When I first raised this case with Scottish Power, it insisted that it had been unable to talk to Michelle, and that it did not know anything about her circumstances. But I received a new account on Wednesday, and it admitted that since Michelle first got into difficulties when the company increased her direct debit, she had rung it on many occasions. On at least three occasions, she offered to set up a direct debit that she could afford, every time for more than the &#163;35 a month she was originally told would be enough. Scottish Power said no. By now, the tariff that she was being charged for her gas and electricity became less and less generous, and so a vicious cycle developed. From the moment Scottish Power increased her direct debit beyond her ability to pay&#151;while Michelle was still in credit, remember&#151;the die was cast. The gap between the amount she could afford and the amount she was charged widened until, almost inevitably, Scottish Power cut her off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08101749000635">Let us look at the tariffs again in more detail. Michelle&#146;s original tariff was &#163;35 a month. Scottish Power put that up to &#163;45 a month, from which point things got worse: because she could not pay that amount, her charges increased month after month. According to the latest documentation, which Scottish Power sent me on Wednesday, between April and July 2006 Michelle&#146;s bill for her gas and electricity averaged &#163;50 a month. From July to October 2006, it went up to nearly &#163;70 a month. In the next three months, it went up to &#163;110 a month. Her next meter reading was amended, and the bill went up to &#163;320 in just one month. In the next two months, she was charged an astonishing &#163;150 a month, and so it went on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08101749000636">How is such a thing possible? Michelle and Jayden live in a small, two-bedroom housing association flat. Last week, Scottish Power told me that she was being charged an average of &#163;75 a month and I thought, &#147;Wow, that&#146;s a lot for a small home like hers&#148;. I thought she must be on a really horrible tariff, but the new information from Scottish Power shows that her bill went up to more than &#163;100 a month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08101749000637">If I do nothing else today, I want to complain about how those who can least afford to pay a bill always seem to be on the least generous tariff. Why are those who are most likely to get in trouble always charged the most? As I said in the topical debate yesterday, the Government must do even more to stop the disproportionate charges  <br>

levied on people with low incomes. I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is committed to doing more for people who use prepayment meters. Most people on prepayment meters are the least well-off. It is well known that people who pay by prepayment meters are penalised heavily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08101749000638">According to Ofgem, people with prepayment meters pay &#163;125 more than people who pay by direct debit, but, ironically for people such as Michelle and Jayden, they can be a useful solution. For people in such a bad position, a monthly payment coming out of their bank account is too much of a worry, and pay-as-you-go can be a helpful arrangement. Michelle has been asking Scottish Power to install a meter, so that she does not lose her heating, cooking and hot water again, but Scottish Power has refused. The company says that it is an infrastructure issue and that a meter can be installed only by the infrastructure provider, Southern Gas Networks, and the meter provider, National Grid Metering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08101749000639">Apparently, Michelle and Jayden must have extra pipework installed in order to have a prepayment meter and it will cost &#163;350 plus the cost of a CORGI engineer, who is also needed for the job to be done. However, it is not the big utility company that will have to pay all that money. Michelle and Jayden have to pick up the bill. How can that possibly be? How can they be expected to pay hundreds of pounds when they cannot afford even a single month&#146;s charge? The utility companies are not only charging our least affluent constituents the highest tariffs, but trying to get them to pay hundreds of pounds for the privilege of having a prepayment meter that most hon. Members would consider a rip-off if we had to have one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08101749000640">I asked whether Scottish Power has a charitable arm, or a social responsibility fund, but it replied, &#147;Not for things like this&#148;. So, Michelle cannot even have a prepayment meter. What is worse is that she cannot have her standard meter back either, because Scottish Power will not let her have it unless she agrees to pay a direct debit of &#163;136 a month&#151;&#163;101 more than the amount she was originally paying. That is an increase of nearly 300 per cent. in three years. It is just staggering to see such a price rise for someone on benefits, with a young son.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para31"><a name="08101749000641">I am not sure how Scottish Power expects my constituents to get back on the level. They are in a Catch-22 situation. They cannot afford the bill so they cannot have a standard meter, and they cannot afford the charges to install a prepayment meter. As the public affairs man from Scottish Power says, without any sense of how satirical he is being:</p>
<a name="81017-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="08101749000750"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any payment plan lower than this would not be realistic as this would only result in the debt increasing, which we cannot allow to continue.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para32"><a name="08101749000642">The company seems to have made up its mind. There is no compassion and no sense of responsibility for the position of my constituent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para33"><a name="08101749000643">The company says that it could not do anything because it did not know that Michelle was on benefits and it did not know that she had a child. I am not sure that I believe that; as I said, Michelle told me that she had spoken to an adviser and they had said they could help only if her son was four. Nor am I sure how hard Scottish Power tried to find out whether Michelle was on benefits or whether she had a child. The company said that it had not been able to get through to her, but  <br>

every time I ring her she picks up straight away, even though her mobile says &#147;Number withheld&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para34"><a name="08101749000644">Michelle has always been very open with me about her situation, so I do not understand how Scottish Power could not have known her circumstances. From my experience of the company, I can easily believe that it would not have bothered, or had the common sense, to ask her&#151;perhaps because it could charge her more if it did not know. Whatever the reason, the Government should insist that utility companies find out whether anyone in arrears has children or is on benefits. When companies find that out&#151;as in this case&#151;the Government should ensure that they change their approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para35"><a name="08101749000645">Scottish Power would rather have Michelle and Jayden pay hundreds of pounds they clearly do not have and carry on without cooking, heating or hot water. The best the company can offer is to say that as Michelle is on benefits she might be eligible for Fuel Direct, whereby the Department for Work and Pensions deducts payments directly from benefits to pay off arrears. However, as Scottish Power has repeatedly stressed, that would result only in her accruing further debt. Things can only get worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para36"><a name="08101749000646">As I said in the topical debate yesterday, it is not fair. Keeping a family without hot water, heating or cooked food for four and a half months and trying to charge them &#163;500 for a new meter when they cannot even afford &#163;45 is not right. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will listen to this story and come to the same conclusion. The utility companies are very well off and cases such as this are very rare, but there is a degree of responsibility. Utility companies spend an enormous amount on public relations. Scottish Power is part of a group that made profits of &#8364;200 million last year. It talks a lot about corporate social responsibility, and for all I know its record may be better than most, but corporate responsibility is about more than fuzzy words and glossy leaflets sent to people such as us and other key stakeholders; it is about people such as Michelle and six-year-old Jayden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para37"><a name="08101749000647">It is time that the utility companies learned real social responsibility. I hope this debate helps them to move in that direction.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) for raising this very important constituency case and highlighting the wider issues that are of universal concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para38"><a name="08101749000649">I express my sympathy for my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent, Michelle, and the situation in which she finds herself. Although we all have a responsibility to pay our bills, there is no doubt that rising prices can overwhelm people&#146;s ability to pay and to organise their family finances. That is why a supplier&#146;s ability to disconnect a customer is strictly circumscribed, and rightly so. It should be a weapon of last resort that no one would wish to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para39"><a name="08101749000650">We expect our energy companies to have in place effective debt prevention policies, which should be rooted in good management and good communications.

rises. Most companies alive to the difficulties brought by higher prices have a social tariff enabling certain groups of low income people to benefit from lower charges. It is surprising that no such tariff is offered by Scottish Power, although the company has told me that it expects to have one in place by the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para40"><a name="08101749000651">Disconnections are governed by a range of rules in the supply licences under which energy companies operate. Before disconnecting a customer, suppliers have to follow a series of steps&#151;as my hon. Friend suggested&#151;which include giving the customer time to pay, offering alternative payment methods and ensuring that the customer is able to meet any payment arrangements for recovering the debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para41"><a name="08101749000652">Most problems that stem from customer indebtedness are resolved well before court action and disconnection. As my hon. Friend said, a prepayment meter, which allows the customer to pay for ongoing gas or electricity use and at the same time gradually pay off accumulated debt, is a common way of avoiding disconnection. I shall say more about prepayment later. Specific arrangements, in place since 2004, to which all the large gas and electricity suppliers subscribe, govern the treatment of genuinely vulnerable customers, and are designed to ensure that, as far as is practicable, no vulnerable customer is disconnected. The arrangements include a cross-industry definition of vulnerability and a safety net of measures integrated into suppliers&#146; debt management processes. Furthermore, customers threatened with disconnection can get assistance from the statutory consumer body, Consumer Focus, whose Glasgow office deals with problems facing vulnerable customers and with all threats of disconnection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para42"><a name="08101749000653">I do not want to&#151;I cannot&#151;enter into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the case my hon. Friend raises, but what is obvious is that none of the mechanisms that are in place worked, and I assume that none of the advice services was accessed. As a consequence, we have a vulnerable family disconnected and no apparent means of solving the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para43"><a name="08101749000654">Let me explain what is expected of companies. As an alternative to disconnection and loss of supply, the customer should be offered a prepayment meter, which, as my hon. Friend points out, allows close control over expenditure for the customer and the recovery of debts for the company. However, where a supplier calibrates a prepayment meter installed to recover debt, it must, under the terms of its supply licence, take into account the customer&#146;s ability to pay. It is clear that, in Michelle&#146;s case, that could have been difficult. She would have been well advised to discuss the matter with the Benefits Agency, with a view to agreeing a Fuel Direct payment, because such payments are limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81017-0013.htm_para44"><a name="08101749000655">As my hon. Friend has explained, however, the reason no prepayment meter was connected arose from the necessity to provide new pipework to the meter. As I understand it, and as she said, I think, the gas infrastructure company, Southern Gas Networks, has confirmed that the pipework is not the responsibility of the gas supplier but that of the customer or landlord. As such, I am sorry to tell her that there is indeed no obligation on Scottish Power to fund the work&#151;indeed, if it did, it would be entitled to reclaim the money from the customer.</p>

Clearly Michelle and her son cannot be left to languish without heating, hot water and fuel for cooking. There is no legal redress, but perhaps common sense and a little humanity ought to be exercised. Some energy companies have a trust fund that can be used in exceptional cases. Regrettably, Scottish Power does not, but perhaps, having heard my hon. Friend&#146;s pleas today, the company will review its position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08101749000657">Prepayment meters have been a matter of concern to Labour Members for some time. As prepayment meters are more expensive to buy and to service than ordinary meters and require an infrastructure to support them, customers using them have faced higher costs. That is why, in the Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear that the Government were prepared to consult on using their statutory powers with a view to reducing the differentials between different forms of payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08101749000658">Last week, Ofgem reported on its probe into gas and electricity markets, which included examination of prepayment charges and differentials. It found that the premium charged to prepayment meter customers is, on average, justified. None the less, the premium paid by prepayment customers varied between suppliers, between regions and between levels of energy use, and, on average, it had increased from about &#163;80 at the beginning of 2005 to &#163;125 at the beginning of 2008. Ofgem&#146;s broad conclusion was that premiums at the lower end of the consumption range, which were about &#163;80, had a sound justification, whereas those at the higher end, which were about &#163;170, did not. Between now and 1 December, Ofgem will consult on the findings of its probe, including those on prepayment meters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08101749000659">As he announced in his statement yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has met representatives of the six large domestic energy suppliers. He has made it clear that where there are problems, the Government expect rapid explanations and actions to remedy them. He will meet the companies again later this month to see what they have done. If the companies do not take satisfactory action, the Government will consult on legislation to deal with any unfair price differentials. I have to say that Scottish Power&#146;s prepayment charge is less than its standard cash quarterly tariff. Of course, Michelle does not know that because she does not have a prepayment meter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08101749000660">The fact is that we need greater fairness in electricity and gas prices, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made clear the Government&#146;s determination to tackle those inequalities. There is undoubtedly pressure on consumers, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden has said, there may be many people facing similar problems, so I should like to set out what consumers might do if they get into difficulties. First, they need to talk to the supplier. I hope that they would get an appropriate response. There might be a trust fund available for emergencies; some companies have such a fund. People should get advice by calling Consumer Direct; they will be put through to Consumer  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08101749000661">People on benefits should certainly talk to the Department for Work and Pensions and the supplier about using Fuel Direct to recover debt owed to the supplier. Consumers should also consider switching supplier. Consumer Focus&#146;s website gives details of tariffs for all main suppliers, based on low, medium and high use of gas or electricity. It also provides links to price comparison websites and can send out fact sheets for those who do not have computers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08101749000662">This debate has rightly focused on disconnection and prepayment meters, but the Government have an interest in trying to help all consumers to reduce the cost of their energy, no matter how they pay, so in September we announced a package of measures known as the home energy saving programme, which is designed to help households to reduce their energy costs, year in, year out, with the added benefit of reducing our CO2 emissions. The largest element of the package was an additional &#163;560 million under the suppliers&#146; carbon emissions reduction target to fund free or subsidised improvements such as loft and cavity wall insulation. Some 11 million elderly and low-income households will qualify for those measures at no cost to themselves. We believe that the element in question could benefit 2 million households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81017-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08101749000663">In addition, gas and electricity suppliers and electricity generators will contribute a further &#163;350 million to a new community energy saving programme. The Warm Front scheme also continues, with increased funds. It offers not just energy efficiency measures but benefit checks that help to produce, on average, an additional &#163;1,400 per household per year. Winter fuel payments have been increased from &#163;200 to &#163;250 this winter for all pensioners, and to &#163;400 for over-80s households. Our Act on CO2 campaign is currently advertising nationally to inform people about the support available. It is continuing its efforts to encourage people to compare the deals available from suppliers, to pay by direct debit and to take advantage of money-off deals on energy efficient products. For the record, its telephone number is 0800 512 012.</p>
