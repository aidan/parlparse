 (Con): What recent representations she has received on the schools building programme.  [4740]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50616-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 We receive many representations on the schools building programme. In recent months, for example, my officials have offered discussions to all authorities on their capital strategies. That will continue, as we fulfil our commitment to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in the next 15 years, and half of all primary schools from 2008&#150;09.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50616-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment to improving the quality of secondary school stock through their building schools for the future programme, but I understand that that will not have an impact in Southend before 2011. However, there is at present a limited supply of secondary school places, parents have limited choice and I understand that the allocations will benefit only one particular school. Is there any possibility that the right hon. Lady might consider bringing forward the programme for Southend, given the special circumstances there?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50616-01_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. It is really good to hear an Opposition Member welcoming the Government&#039;s significant capital investment programme. One thing is worth making clear: when the Government came to power in 1997, capital investment in school buildings was &#163;700 million. That might be said to have been a lot of money, but capital investment this year amounted to &#163;5.5 billion. I understand that Southend has already received significant capital investment, and that it is eligible under the targeted capital fund for additional investment to replace a whole school, or to receive two separate tranches of &#163;6 million for two different schools. We will announce the results of the bidding process in the autumn.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50616-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Everyone welcomes the massive expenditure and investment in our schools building programme, but does my right hon. Friend agree that the schools that we build in the future can be either awful or wonderfully well designed and sustainable? This morning&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i> contained a worrying article in which a member of her Department said that future schools&#151;and even academies&#151;could be built more cheaply and effectively using off-the-shelf designs. For me, off the shelf means that the buildings will be poorly designed and unsustainable.
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50616-01_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can guarantee that school building designs will never be off the shelf, but that does not mean that there will not be a range of designs available to inform architects&#039; design processes, and into which head teachers can have an input. However, it is important that we include an element of innovation in school design as we move forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50616-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh)</b> 
 (Con): May I support the plea for additional educational resources for Southend? Around the border between my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), there is a problem arising from the lack of secondary school places. It would be very helpful if some additional resources could be made available so that extra secondary school places could be provided. The intensive house building that has gone on in both constituencies has made the problem worse.
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50616-01_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 There is a danger that a consensus might develop across the House that capital investment in schools is a good thing. I welcome the support for the Government programme in Southend expressed by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). If they feel that this is a serious matter about which they would like to write to me, I will of course consider that representation.

Friend the Secretary of State aware that Tameside council, through the building schools for the future programme, is embarking on rebuilding seven high schools as part of the largest school building programme in the borough since the 1950s? Will she do all that she can to ensure that the    long-term investment put in by this Labour Government continues, so that excellent Labour councils such as Tameside can eventually meet their ambition to rebuild and refurbish not just seven high schools but all the secondary schools in their areas?

</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50616-01_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I will answer, and I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. It is important that we begin in those areas where educational need and social disadvantage are most acute. As we roll forward this programme over the next 15 years, we will be able to rebuild, renew or refurbish to world-class standards every secondary school in the country.

</p>


<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50616-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Children and Families  (Beverley Hughes): </b> 
 The Government&#039;s special educational needs strategy entitled &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; was published in February 2004 and sets out a clear vision for improving support and outcomes for children with special educational needs. It also sets out action to ensure that children with special educational needs receive the help that they need from schools and other services as quickly as possible. That strategy was informed by a review of special schools, and we believe that such schools have a crucial role to play in teaching children with severe and complex needs and sharing expertise with mainstream schools.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50616-01_spnew9"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that answer and congratulate her on her new appointment. Will she join me in praising the excellent work of Mowbray special school in Bedale in the Vale of York? Is she aware that there is a severe shortage of places for 16 to 19-year-olds, particularly those suffering from autistic spectrum disorder and severe learning difficulties? What does she propose to do to meet that lack of provision?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50616-01_spnew10"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Lady for her kind remarks. I am aware of the developments in Mowbray. They map out what many local authorities are trying to do in reorganising, reconfiguring and improving the quality of provision for young people with special educational needs. She has raised with me a particular shortage; I am sure that the local authority is taking that issue on board. If she writes to me I will look into the matter, but she knows that responsibility for meeting the needs of all children across the board, including those with special educational needs, rests with the local authority. Our strategy sets out how local authorities can best do that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50616-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Swayne: </b> 
 Has the Minister experienced the frustration of parents who face almost insuperable barriers in securing a statement only to find that it is so unspecific as to be virtually unenforceable, and their frustration that very few schools provide the adequate resources and capabilities required? There has to be a moratorium on the closure of these schools. Does the Minister agree?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50616-01_spnew12"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s last point I do not agree. I think a moratorium on closures of special schools at the moment would create complete gridlock in the system. It would create chaos and great uncertainty for parents, and it would create difficulties for local authorities, which are trying to go through a process of reorganising and improving schools. Sometimes that does involve closure, but if the hon. Gentleman looks across the country he will see that where there have been closures, there have almost 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>always been mergers, openings of new schools and extensions of existing schools, because local authorities are trying to provide an improved service and better provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">On the particular point that the hon. Gentleman raises, I think that there are issues with the statementing process. We know that some parents find that bureaucratic and delayed. But the best practice that we are promoting among local authorities, and which some are achieving very well, is to in a sense set aside the statementing process to intervene very early, to identify children&#039;s needs early&#151;which is what parents want&#151; and then to give the resources to schools, so that children can be supported adequately. Where that is happening, parents are not seeking statementing; very often they are seeking it as a lever for resources, and if the resources go in early they do not need a statementing process.
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50616-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. George Mudie  (Leeds, East)</b> 
 (Lab): I hear what the Minister says but a situation is developing in north-west Leeds where parents&#039; wishes are being totally ignored. The private company that a past Secretary of State put in to run education is closing the school, threatening governors and taking no notice of parents, and the children do not know where they will be going when they come back in September. We do not have a local authority to deal with education in Leeds, so I wonder whether the Minister would ask her officials to look at this, and would she care to meet a deputation of Members from Leeds to discuss this matter?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50616-01_spnew14"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Of course I am happy to meet Members of the House at any time to discuss local circumstances. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend is talking about special schools here or talking more generally.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50616-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Mudie: </b> 
 Yes. Special schools.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50616-01_spnew16"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will know that in any local authority area, whatever the arrangements, there is a robust process, which everyone must abide by, that allows local people and a local committee and, if necessary in relation to special schools, an independent adjudicator, to make decisions if there cannot be resolution at local level. I do feel that this has to be a local decision. I understand that sometimes that is very difficult for parents and that there is disagreement, but there is a robust process to ensure parental involvement and to resolve the issue in a fair way at the end of that process.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50616-01_spnew17"><b> Laura Moffatt  (Crawley)</b> 
 (Lab): In Crawley we have a brand new school for young people and children with special educational needs called Manor Green. It is proving to be one of the most wonderful innovations for parents and children in my area. But West Sussex county council has decided that because the school has moved slightly closer to many parents, they cannot now get travel arrangements for their children. Will my right hon. Friend look at that issue and find a way to compel West Sussex? Parents in my area who are trying to get three or four children to this fantastic new school, where they desperately want them to go, are finding that West Sussex has put enormous difficulties in their path.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50616-01_spnew18"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I understand that my hon. Friend wants to support parents in the changes that have taken place in her constituency, but she will understand that it is for local authorities, with parents, to decide such issues. Ministers are often berated for involving themselves too closely and for wanting to take local decisions, yet sometimes when local authorities make decisions that are not fully supported, there are calls for Ministers to intervene. I am certainly happy to discuss the matter with her, but at the end of the day the decision has to be for the locality.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50616-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Mark Prisk  (Hertford and Stortford)</b> 
 (Con): My constituent, Julie Maynard, is one of many people who feel that the whole system of special needs statementing seems designed almost to hinder parents rather than to help them. Will the review, which the Secretary of State promised during the run-up to the general election, include the statementing process, and can the Minister give Mrs. Maynard and many other constituents of mine a genuine and categorical assurance that if any policy changes are proposed and implemented they will be matched pound for pound by central Government funding?
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50616-01_spnew20"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 As I said in my first answer, there was a full review of special school arrangements in the lead-up to the formulation of the strategy that was published in February 2004. The review was undertaken by an independent working group and published its report in March 2003; it is available if the hon. Gentleman wants to read it. There was a full review of the whole process and its recommendations were incorporated in the strategy we produced a year later. The audit that is going on at present comes from that strategy; it is a specific audit of provision nationally and in local authorities for the relatively small number of children who have high and complicated needs relating to specific conditions. The audit was called for because those are the children for whom it is most difficult for local authorities to find adequate placements. As there will be only a small number of such children in an individual local authority, the first stage is to map where the provision is so that local authorities can work together more closely and find suitable places, if necessary outside the local authority area, for the small number of children with high levels of need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I have already commented on the statementing process, but I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about it. Work is going on. I understand that some parents find the process bureaucratic, but the answer is to intervene early so that we do not need a statementing process for so many children, because parents feel that their needs are adequately met at their school.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50616-01_spnew21"><b> Ms Angela C. Smith  (Sheffield, Hillsborough)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a tendency for many local education authorities to ignore the expertise of teachers in both special needs and mainstream schools? Does she agree that the same freedom should be given to special needs teachers as is given to mainstream teachers in leading improvements and innovatory practices in the education of special needs children?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50616-01_spnew22"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I certainly agree, although I am not aware that teachers in special schools universally feel 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 380</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that way. What is happening, and I very much welcome it, is that there are links between special needs and mainstream schools. Sometimes, where there are new developments and reorganisations, special schools are being built on the same sites as mainstream schools so that there can be real reciprocity and partnership. When that is not possible, such partnerships take place none the less, drawing down the incredible expertise of dedicated teachers in special schools and infusing it more widely through the mainstream system, so that youngsters with a lower level of special need who are in mainstream schools can be taught more effectively. The expertise of special needs teachers helps teachers in mainstream schools better to meet the needs of their pupils.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50616-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. David Cameron  (Witney)</b> 
 (Con): It has been very helpful to listen to the Minister&#039;s answers to the concerns expressed on both sides of the House. I am sure that she shares our concern that parents of children with very special needs should have a choice between mainstream and special schools. Will she explain why the audit, to which she has just referred, of special schools&#151;91 of which have closed in the past eight years&#151;will really consider only children with the most severe disabilities and learning difficulties? Given that schools for children with moderate learning difficulties have been threatened with closure, and some have been lost already, should not the audit go wider?
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50616-01_spnew24"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 As I set out, there has been a full review of special schools, leading up to the strategy that was published last year. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman must be aware of that. The strategy identified that a further and closer look needed to be made of the provision for the children with very high level complex needs whom he identifies. Those children present the most challenges to local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Choice is absolutely paramount. Our changes to the Education Act 1981 made the choice for parents of children with special needs more effective. There has been a great deal of debate and some misunderstanding about the current position in the law and in Government guidance. When any parent of a child with special needs states a preference for a special school, there is no presumption of inclusion in a mainstream school and the local authority has to make the recommendation for the placement on the basis of the usual criteria: the needs of that child, the needs of other children and the issue of resources. The hon. Gentleman will also know that, in addition to that and at every step of the way, there is a robust system of appeal for parents&#151;an appeal if they are refused an assessment, an appeal if they are refused a statement and an appeal if the statement does not include their preferred special school. Choice for parents is paramount, and I think that we have a system that gives parents choice and that supports that choice with a robust appeals system.

<br>&nbsp;<br>even told that they exist. Should not the audit consider such issues? We are grateful for some extra detail but we want to know who is on the audit, who is running it, who will be consulted and what the precise remit is. No details have been given to the House. In the meantime, why will the Minister not take up our clear proposal that there should be, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said, a moratorium on the closure of special schools until the audit is actually reported and discussed. She says it is gridlocked, but is it not the case&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_29"><a name="50616-01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I should have said that questions should also be brief.
</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50616-01_spnew28"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 In the interests of brevity rather than avoiding the question, perhaps I can refer the hon. Gentleman to what I have already said to the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) about a moratorium. It would create chaos and uncertainty for parents, and would take away from local authorities their responsibility for decision making. It is interesting that other parts of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party are calling for more devolution of decision making but, on this issue, they want to pull back power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I will be brief, Mr. Speaker, but it is important that the debate does not polarise the issue. It is an important, emotive and complex issue for every parent and child.   Some parents want their children included in mainstream schools, but others want a place in a special school. We need to ensure that the system can deliver as easily and accessibly as possible what individual parents want. I am with the hon. Gentleman on that. With consensus on those points at least, I hope that we can work towards that end. I think that statementing needs some improvement but, generally, that the system is working for most parents.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50616-02_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Ministers can ensure, as we are doing, that support and training are in place for our schools, but we cannot legislate for good behaviour.

</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50616-02_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Considerable extra money is being spent in our schools on supporting good behaviour and raising standards. One issue rightly identified by staff in schools is the support available to help to implement the changes that many of them are putting in place. It is easy for the hon. and learned Gentleman to take a slightly sneering approach to the support provided for schools. Of course we need to get the balance right, but many schools have welcomed the assistance provided by behaviour consultants. It is also important that we get the money for behaviour as close to schools as possible, which is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has proposed that we devolve more money and give head teachers the responsibility to collaborate to come up with new approaches on supporting behaviour and tackling disruption that could be even more effective than the current system.

 (Lab/Co-op): Good behaviour is an issue among students themselves because they recognise the disruption that can be caused. During my discussions with sixth-formers, they often identify specific problem years in their schools. I would like to go back to what the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) said about school funding. The fact that Leicestershire continues to be the lowest funded authority causes severe problems in individual schools when new initiatives come along because we are trying to catch up with existing initiatives without adding on others. I say that as a governor of a school that is having difficulties implementing the work force agreement. Funding is currently being discussed, so will the Minister look again at the funding formula to ensure that Leicestershire gets the extra pocket that would allow us to make real progress?

I also have no doubt that during the general election campaign they compared the Government&#039;s record and plans for further investment with his party&#039;s plans for cuts.

</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50616-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his response. Is he aware that there is growing anger and concern in Bexley borough that from September fees will increase, courses will be cut and concessions reduced for adult education students because of cuts in the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s funding? Does he agree that further education should be not just for skills, development and training, but for leisure learning as well? Why are the Government letting down adult education?
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50616-03_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 There is consensus about the new priorities that the Government announced in both the 14-to-19 strategy and the skills White Paper. We need to develop the skills base of our population, among 16 to 18-year-olds in particular, and among adults requiring basic skills at level 2, which is the equivalent of five GCSEs, in the work force. It is right that the current transition in FE seeks to make funding and, therefore, participation rates, among those groups much higher.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">I do not accept that being clear about those priorities means that adult education courses have to close. We see no reason why courses that people value should close. We will continue to support those on income-related benefits who qualify, but there is a discussion about rebalancing between the taxpayer, the individual concerned and the employer the issue of who pays how much and for what. Raising fee income is one way in which we can benefit colleges. Indeed, colleges might like to consider collecting some of the &#163;100 million that they currently waive on fees.

There is recognition of the funding gap between sixth forms and FE colleges. We recognise that it is an issue, and we have a commitment to close the gap, but as funding allows us to do so. That is the challenge before us.

Will he explain to the House whether it is as a result of the failure of Government policy that funds are having to be redirected towards 16 to 19-year-olds who are leaving school without numeracy and literacy, which means that funds are diverted away from adult education?

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50616-03_spnew5"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Far from being a failure of Government policy, it is the intent to shift our priorities to the country&#039;s economic needs and to support the ability of individuals, particularly 16 to 18-year-olds, to get skills that allow them to leave education and go into the world of work better qualified to get better-paid jobs for their own benefit and development as individuals, as well as for the benefit of companies and the country as a whole. We believe that those are the right priorities.

What we are doing is a clear way of implementing those priorities. That is not to say that adult education and leisure courses, in which many Members of Parliament may have participated, should not be supported, but it is right to ask about the balance in respect of who pays for leisure adult education courses. We believe that there is an opportunity to raise fees for some leisure courses where people can afford to take them, while maintaining the taxpayer&#039;s contribution to support those in poorer areas on low incomes, so that they can also participate in those courses.

Yesterday, I visited Highbury college in Portsmouth to open its new centre of vocational excellence, which will deliver the kind of skills training that the hon. Gentleman has recognised as being essential. The Liberals always say that there is a crisis in further education, but overall FE funding has increased, and nine out of 10 FE colleges have received increased funding. One in 10 FE colleges have not received increased funding for particular, localised reasons and we expect them to discuss with their local learning and skills councils managing the funding transition in a way that makes sense to the local community. The Government are committed to skills, which are the new priority for the third term.

Unless we address that by transforming the funding process, we will not succeed against countries such as China and India, which are investing heavily in skills, let alone against our European competitors.

The hon. Gentleman and I agree on that priority, and the Government are putting in more money to make the transition happen. Local colleges will manage their budgets at local level with their local learning and skills councils, but I repeat that being clear about those priorities and that transition does not mean that all adult education courses must close. Other alternatives include raising fee income and rebalancing the taxpayer&#039;s contribution to leisure courses such as Australian cake decorating, which are perfectly valid.

 The latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that there were 231,400 students from overseas in English higher education institutions&#151;an increase of nearly 40 per cent. compared with eight years ago. The Department has taken steps to encourage higher education institutions to attract more international students through the Prime Minister&#039;s initiative. We recognised in the Department&#039;s international strategy the importance of the initiative and emphasised our commitment to continue to expand the numbers of international students.

I therefore regard setting up the joint education taskforce, which will be involved in the sector, as an important step forward.

The Home Office&#039;s proposal to abolish the right of appeal for those who want to come here as overseas students will have a massive impact on several universities. What discussions has he had with his Home Office colleagues about the proposals? Will he give an undertaking that, if any impact study shows that the number of overseas students will decline as a result not only of the proposals for entry clearance fees but the abolition of the right of appeal, he will try to persuade his Home Office colleagues to think again about these absurd proposals?

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="50616-04_spnew3"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 I am in regular discussions with the Home Office on those issues. It is critical to get the judgment right in the first instance through the entry clearance system about whether an overseas student is eligible for a visa. The clear advice from the Home Office is that an appeal process often means that the time lag is too great and the course has been completed. I have dealt with such issues and I know that to be the case. It is important to get the judgment right in the first place. The fact that we have set up a taskforce to oversee those issues should enable us to keep on top of the matter.

Does he also accept that there is still much more that could happen informally, with prosecutors, the police, magistrates and members of the public interacting so that they all understand each other&#039;s problems? That would lead to more successful prosecutions.

 The Law Officers meet the DPP regularly to discuss a range of criminal justice issues, including sentencing for murder. The Government have said that we will establish a review of the law on murder, and the Home Secretary will announce the way forward shortly.

 This is a bad case. I agree that the criminal justice system owes an apology for errors made by the agencies in failing to tell the family about the reduction of the sentence. Lessons need to be learned. The Crown Prosecution Service has spoken to Mr. Finnegan&#039;s brother and sent him a written apology for the agencies&#039; failures. I met the Crown prosecutor for London yesterday to discuss the case. The Government have made it clear that victims should be at the heart of the criminal justice system, but this case provides an example of where that has not happened. We are putting new measures in place to ensure that it does not happen again. If it would help, I would be happy to meet the Finnegan family.

 It is certainly important that people who are sentenced and the general public are aware of the implications of a sentence.

 Is it not wrong for the Government to have signed an extradition treaty with the United States that is not reciprocal? British citizens can be extradited to the US on suspicion whereas the US, quite rightly, requires a higher burden of proof for its citizens to be extradited from the US to here. When are the British Government going to stand up for the rights of British citizens rather than sign unequal treaties? Will the Solicitor-General suspend the treaty until the US Congress passes into its law a fully reciprocal agreement?
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="50616-05_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I entirely disagree with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis. There are similar arrangements in place for extradition for 48 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, European countries and the US. Precise reciprocity in extradition arrangements is impossible because legal systems are different. Today, arrangements with the US are broadly comparable in most respects, including with respect to the standard of information needed for requests either way&#151;from the US or here. We now require information that is similar to the US requirement of probable cause. Before 2003, we required a prima facie case, which is a higher requirement than probable cause. We are satisfied that the balance of reciprocity is comparable now. We are doing the right thing now, and we believe that making it more difficult for those accused of crime to be brought to court, as the right hon. Gentleman wants, is the wrong approach.

 I appreciate the concern of the hon. Gentleman and of other right hon. and hon. Members, but I have set the position out clearly. It is a question of all of the political parties represented in the House making their nominations to the vacancies on Select Committees. That process, as I understand from my own party, is well under way and progress has been made. But the democracy of the House is dependent on the democracy of the political parties, and that process can sometimes take longer than some Members might like.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50616-09_spnew13"><b> Mr. Tobias Ellwood  (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> 
 May I ask for an urgent debate on the responsibility and accountability of regional assemblies? Many people in England are unaware of how powerful these bodies have become. For example, there are plans by the South West regional assembly to build 21,000 more homes on Bournemouth&#039;s green belt, yet Bournemouth council is now powerless to stop this and no longer allowed to make its own judgment as to the planning requirements needed for its area.
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50616-09_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Those are important issues. It is obviously necessary to balance the overriding requirement for decent, affordable housing for people with the consequences for local communities. Whenever those issues have come before local planning authorities, the Government have sought to ensure that before approval is given, the necessary infrastructure is available and in place to support the demand for extra accommodation. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will continue to be the Government&#039;s policy.

 Earlier today, the excellent House of Commons Library confirmed to me that the budget for the NHS for next year would be about &#163;74.4 billion&#151;something that I think hon. Members on both sides of the House would welcome. However, may we have an urgent debate as to why that money and those facilities are not getting into the front line of the NHS? I am sure that other trusts around the country are similarly affected, but when I met representatives of my local hospital trust last week with my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), they told me that they were &#163;30 million in debt and that if they did not cut back their debt this year they would not have the money to pay doctors&#039; and nurses&#039; wages. So massive cuts are being instigated across the board in our hospital health trust, and in April 2006 the blue-light facilities will be switched off at Hemel Hempstead hospital. That means that our cardiac unit, our stroke unit, our intensive care unit and our accident and emergency unit will close. Where is taxpayers&#039; money going?
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50616-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 It is going on 79,000 new nurses, 27,000 new doctors, 83 major new hospital building programmes and a range of extra facilities. By financial year 2007&#150;08, the budget for the national health service, compared with what we inherited from the Conservative Government whom we replaced in financial year 1996&#150;97, will have increased by three times&#151;a three-times increase in spending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">Alongside that increase, to deal with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s specific point, it is obviously important&#151;I believe that this was one of the valuable changes actually made by the previous Conservative Government&#151;that local authorities manage their own money, and it is important that the trusts can manage those extra resources effectively. Local control of those budgets has made a significant difference to the consequences in the local community of having effective health care, and it must continue. But I will take no criticisms whatever from the hon. Gentleman in relation to the size of the national health service budget.

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50616-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">The purpose of the Bill is to provide powers to enable the National Assembly for Wales to deliver a world-class integrated transport system for Wales. Along with existing powers and those that the Assembly is acquiring under the Railways Act 2005, the Bill will provide the Assembly with a comprehensive and coherent set of transport powers for the first time. That fulfils our Labour party manifesto commitment to deliver a further devolution of powers over transport to Wales, and will ensure that the Assembly has the powers it needs to deliver a properly integrated transport system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">A well-functioning transport network is essential for maintaining the unprecedented period of economic stability that the Government have delivered, and is critical to the future development of Wales. It plays a crucial role in the development of a diverse, competitive, high-value-added economy and is the backbone of economic growth. Set against that is the risk to business investment and performance posed by increased congestion on our roads and inadequate public transport provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_34">Transport is also key to our social agenda; for example, in regenerating communities and tackling rural isolation. The most deprived areas in Wales have low levels of car ownership, and inadequate public transport is too often a barrier to finding a job. It also inhibits access to key services, GPs and hospitals, and can have a severe impact on people&#039;s quality of life by limiting access to leisure activities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50616-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> 
 The thrust of the Bill is welcome, but on the subject of an integrated transport policy, may I draw the Secretary of State&#039;s attention to the decision, last week, of Virgin Trains to cut two Saturday services from north Wales to London during the summer, thereby undermining the tourism economy of north Wales? I spoke to Ministers about that on Monday, because I am extremely concerned. Virgin spoke to various local authorities in north Wales about the Monday-to-Friday timetable, but did not mention Saturday. The company then cut two of the five Saturday services for the whole summer period, which will damage the Welsh economy. Will the Secretary of State investigate the matter urgently?
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="50616-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am happy to do that. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern and that of other north Wales MPs, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami), who has just been muttering in my ear about the matter. I am advised that the reduction in service will be temporary, to allow the upgrading of the west coast main line, and it is expected that the services will be reinstated. I hope that advice is correct, but if it is not, I shall inform the hon. Gentleman.

<a name="stpa_35">The Bevan Foundation has identified communications as a major issue that needs to be tackled to develop the south Wales valleys. Too many places are isolated by poor communications, even though some are relatively close to the main centres of population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_36">As well as advancing our economic and social objectives, a properly integrated transport system is crucial for fulfilling our green agenda. Road transport accounts for more than 20 per cent. of all UK carbon emissions, and by reducing the need for people to travel by car, we can help to reduce the overall impact of personal transport on global warming. As a Government, we are determined to think long term about how to ensure that our transport system best serves the people of Wales and those economic, social and environmental objectives.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="50616-10_spnew4"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> 
 The Secretary of State will know that one of the problems in the south Wales valleys, where many people&#039;s journeys to work are complicated, is that much of the public transport simply goes down the valley to Cardiff. The integration of public transport systems is vital if we are to reduce economic inactivity in the south Wales valleys. One difficulty is that some public transport services continue to use old rolling stock. Does my right hon. Friend anticipate a significant improvement in the rolling stock on the valley lines?
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50616-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, rolling stock is constantly being upgraded under our Government, with record investment in railways and more rail travellers than at any time in the past 40 or 50 years. Nevertheless, he makes a valid point and, as a valleys MP, I can confirm that it is crucial to get things right. People, especially the elderly, in many pit villages in my constituency and, I am sure, in the Rhondda, do not own a car, and buses&#151;sometimes railways if they are lucky, but often it is buses alone&#151;are a lifeline in every respect. I am not satisfied that bus services in my constituency are good enough&#151;for example, in the Swansea valley and the lower Amman valley&#151;and that is probably true throughout the valleys. I know that the Assembly is seized of the need to address that problem with the bus and railway companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_37">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport recently spoke about the need to have a national debate about the future role of road pricing. I am sure that he was right to do so. As Secretary of State for Wales, I, too, am determined to think long term about our future transport needs. I believe that the Bill will enhance the Assembly&#039;s ability to serve those needs effectively. Overall, the Assembly has made impressive progress on delivering improved transport in a relatively short time, despite the limited powers currently at its disposal.
</p>





<p><a name="st_71"><a name="50616-10_spnew6"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham) (Lab):</b> 
 I am listening with interest to my right hon. Friend&#039;s observations on road pricing. At this early stage, has he held any discussions with National Assembly Ministers about whose responsibility it would be to set such charges in Wales should the scheme ever arise?
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="50616-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That is an important debate. We are talking about a programme that cannot come in for another 10 or 15 years. All those matters, including how 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 411</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Wales would fit into the scheme, will be debated and resolved, and my hon. Friend is welcome to contribute to that process. We should not fear the principle, however, and I am glad that it has been widely welcomed throughout the political spectrum and across public opinion. We must reduce congestion on our roads or they will jam up. A 4 per cent. reduction in traffic, especially at peak times, could reduce congestion by up to 40 per cent. If we can manage the situation better through road pricing we may escape the gridlock that awaits us. The Bill will make that much easier to manage in Wales&#151;if not to solve&#151;by allowing much more integrated forms of public transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_38">I rather doubt that Wales would have flexibility to set prices. Even on the basis of the White Paper, whereby primary powers on transport and other matters would be devolved, I doubt that what is in essence a fiscal issue could be a Wales-only matter. However, that is for debate.

 Does the Secretary of State agree that particular care must be taken in rural Wales, and indeed in rural parts of the United Kingdom in general, where there are no alternative public transport facilities? It would not be possible to limit people&#039;s car use.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="50616-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I fully agree. The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point as the representative of a largely rural area. There is little congestion on rural roads, which is why in any road-pricing regime the charge per mile would be very low indeed&#151;perhaps only a penny or two, as one model suggested. The reduction in other charges for car use would put rural drivers in a much better position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">These are early days, however. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has launched a national debate. It is a serious debate; we are not trying to ram a policy down anybody&#039;s throat and we shall welcome contributions from all parties, including from the hon. Gentleman and other Welsh MPs. We have to get things right for Wales, not least in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-11_para1">

 The Secretary of State seemed to suggest that the charging regime would be based on the principle of reducing congestion. However, his following comments were far from clear on whether the empowerment that he sought in the White Paper would be passed to the Assembly and allow it to have a say over the fiscal element. Has he talked to the Chancellor of the Exchequer about what now appears to be a fund-raising, rather than a congesting-beating, exercise?

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_41">To give a few examples of what the Assembly has done in a relatively few years, I refer to the fact that the Wales and Borders rail franchise has been awarded, meaning that, for the first time since the rail network was broken up by the Conservative party, all local and regional train services in Wales are provided by a single operator. The franchise is now in operation and will deliver a phased programme of service improvements over a 15-year period.

 Does my right hon. Friend foresee more joined-up thinking between train operating companies within Wales? The hon.

People are not able to make that connection. We need more joined-up thinking by the train operating companies if we are to succeed.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50616-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I was not aware of that problem, but it is ridiculous. I hope that Virgin Trains can sort it out and bring about an improvement. As I have experienced, if connections are not made, it can cost hours of time. I will certainly make sure that my hon. Friend&#039;s representations on the matter reach Virgin Trains. However, the powers provided under the Bill will give the Assembly Transport Minister a much greater ability to crack down on such absurd anomalies.

<a name="stpa_42">There has been major investment in the valley lines, leading to the restoration of rail services in some areas for the first time since the Beeching cuts of 40 years ago. For example, the vale of Glamorgan line has been reopened to passenger services and work is in hand to commence passenger services on the Ebbw Vale line in 2006&#150;07.

 Does the Secretary of State regret the Beeching cuts, which took place under the 1964 Wilson Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="50616-11_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That was a much better question than the hon. Gentleman asked me yesterday, so he is obviously on a steep learning curve. The truth is that the railways were allowed to run down under the dreadful Conservative Government of the 1950s and leading up to 1964. The whole programme was in train, if I can put it that way. The historical failure of all Governments&#151;Labour and Conservative&#151;right the way through the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was not to invest sufficiently in transport. If the hon. Gentleman concedes that point&#151;and the Conservatives were in power for the vast majority of that time; more than double the time Labour was in power if I remember correctly&#151;I will concede his point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_89"><a name="50616-11_spnew16"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 It strikes me that there is a paradox. While the Labour party takes full credit for the national health service, which was dreamed up in about 1942 by a civil servant called Beveridge, it wants to escape any responsibility for the cuts in the railways, which were again dreamed up by a civil servant prior to a Labour Government taking office in 1964. The reality is that the Beeching cuts were implemented from 1964 onwards and, if the Labour party had not wanted them to happen, it would have had the power to stop them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_90"><a name="50616-11_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was born then. His reading of political history is as dodgy as the rest of his politics. The serious point is that we had serious under-investment&#151;especially in the 1980s and 1990s by the Conservative Government&#151;and everybody recognises that. We have tried to put that right, and one of the ways that we are putting it right is by reopening a whole series of services that were cut in the past. The Welsh Assembly Labour Government and the Labour Government in Westminster deserve credit for that. I would have thought that even he in his most uncharitable mood would be prepared to give us that credit.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 415</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>On public transport, our major cities are lagging behind others in the UK where incremental improvements have been made over several years. However, the Assembly&#039;s limited and fragmentary transport powers have restricted its ability to deal effectively with the challenges that we face and deliver a first-class integrated transport system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">The lack of transport powers has long been recognised. As far back as 1997, the Welsh transport advisory group, which I chaired as a Welsh Office Minister, started examining the transport legacy that the Assembly would inherit. Subsequently, both the Assembly&#039;s cross-party Environment, Planning and Transport Committee and the House&#039;s Welsh Affairs Committee have concluded that the Assembly requires additional powers. There was thus broad agreement on the legislative changes needed to take Wales into a new transport age, which was why we brought forward the draft Transport (Wales) Bill in May last year. Following pre-legislative scrutiny as well as an extensive public consultation, the draft Bill has been refined into the Bill that is now before us.

<a name="stpa_49">There will be a new statutory duty on the Assembly to develop and implement policies for the promotion of safe, integrated, sustainable, efficient and economic transport facilities and services.

The Assembly intends to consult widely with all stakeholders when drawing up the strategy.

<a name="stpa_50">Where local authorities are already required to prepare local transport plans, the Bill will now provide a formal mechanism to ensure that those plans are consistent with the Assembly&#039;s overall vision for transport in Wales. To ensure that local transport plans are consistent with the Wales transport strategy, they will need to be submitted to the Assembly for approval. Refusing approval will be possible only with the approval of the Assembly in plenary session. I anticipate that such cases will be wholly exceptional and that the Bill will thus not mean that local transport planning will be taken out of the hands of local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_51">Another important element of the Bill is the provision to facilitate greater joint working by local authorities to produce transport plans, which is essential to make real improvements in key transport corridors. The particular geography of Wales&#151;a fact to which my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) referred&#151;means that transport issues often cross local authority boundaries and thus need to be tackled regionally. The best example of that is of course south-east Wales, which covers 10 local authority areas and contains about half the population of Wales. Here there is a pattern of travel-to-work movements from the valleys into Cardiff and Newport that is superimposed on more strategic east-west movement along the M4 corridor and, to a lesser extent, the A465 heads of the valleys road.

<a name="stpa_53">The next main provision of the Bill will enable the Assembly to provide funding for transport services directly to transport operators to ensure that unmet transport needs in Wales are met. Currently the Assembly has to rely on a patchwork of different Acts, some of which date back to 1919. For example, the new power might be used to support services that cross several local authority boundaries to implement the Assembly&#039;s long-distance bus and coach strategy. The Bill will also give the Assembly the power to provide revenue payments to airline operators or capital funding for new airport facilities, subject of course to the constraints of European Commission competition law. That will allow the Assembly to implement its policies on intra-Wales scheduled air services, for example.

 The Secretary of State will be aware that public service obligations are working well in places such as Scotland, where the mainland is linked with some of the islands and people can sometimes go on to other destinations.

 At the risk of sounding like an aviation anorak&#151;perish the thought&#151;the most sensible way to fund the scheme is, if the Minister&#039;s interpretation of the regulations is right, to provide support for the intra-Wales legs of the flight from, say, Ynys M&#244;n to Welshpool and then down to Cardiff, and for the operator to self-fund any additional journey. It would be free to fly wherever it wanted after Cardiff, but it would have to ensure that that part of the journey was visibly separated by a financial firewall from the investment in the intra-Wales network. It can be done, but it has to be accounted for carefully.

 That is masses of more money. In fact, it is double the miserable inheritance that we were left by the Conservative Government. It would stand in sorry contrast to the desperate state that transport in Wales would be in if Plaid Cymru ever got its wish and hived Wales off into independence. There are free bus passes for pensioners and the disabled. The extra subsidy for rural bus services has made a big improvement, although there is still a lot to do. There is extra road building, such as the &#163;300 million heads of the valley A465 road, and extra road upgrading. On rail, there is the Ebbw Vale and the Vale of Glamorgan lines to consider. Those advances in transport provision are on the back of the unprecedented economic stability, success and prosperity that the Labour Government have delivered for Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom.

That will encourage authorities to look ahead, open their eyes around their boundaries and introduce transport plans that do not face the prospect of effectively being vetoed by the Assembly.

It is not clear whether the Assembly will have the power to direct JTAs to work together in providing services that cross each others boundaries, which is clearly a must in delivering integrated transport, especially in areas such as national parks where public transport provision is often specialised and where there is no one owner of responsibility. That point is also important with regard to cross-border transport services.

I have always believed that they should have the opportunity, through a referendum, to say whether they want the Assembly to continue, remain as it is or be further empowered.

<a name="stpa_92">The hon. Gentleman was generous in giving way, although he gave the impression that I did not support the environmental argument. That is not the case. The planes would be light aircraft, and their use would be balanced against the cut in road journeys from north to south. Anybody who has travelled from the north-west to the south-east knows about the log jam on those roads. Alleviating that would be helpful. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the viability of air transport and claimed that there were no working models. He is wrong. If he considers the west coast of Scotland, he will see that such models work well. An hon.

 The scheme being undertaken started with the figure of 48, and there could be six to eight flights a day if it succeeds. There are 150 people in the public sector alone who travel from north-west Wales to Cardiff every day. If a third of them decided to go by plane, they would make the scheme viable, but that would be in addition to the tourism potential of the flights for bringing people to that area. If the hon.

Furthermore, the port of Holyhead now has the largest conventional ferry and the largest freight liner in Europe, as well as one of the biggest FastCat catamarans in the world, owing to Government funding and their strategy to build ports in Wales.

Member for Clwyd, West commented on the A55 not being complete. The first thing that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did as a Wales Minister in 1997 was to allow that to be complete, because the decay in the port communities of Holyhead was horrendous. During the 1990s, as a consequence of having no infrastructure in place, those communities had the highest unemployment in Wales. That is no longer the case, and I am therefore proud of this Government&#039;s record. The hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C.

 Ever since the hills and valleys of Wales were formed some time in the ice age, Wales has been difficult to get around. It has lacked a joined-up transport system. The geography of the nation together with the lack of a cohesive strategy in the past has definitely held Wales back.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_107">Previous strategies launched in the past eight years have, in my view, failed to resolve the incoherence of the Welsh transport system. We all know that when the system works, it tends to work from east to west and then back again, and that there is relatively little strategic investment in north-south routes. What little there has been has tended to go into road transportation rather than other modes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_108">It is therefore hardly surprising that the Royal Automobile Club estimates that it currently takes almost five hours to travel the 193 miles from Holyhead to Newport by road. It takes almost three hours to get from Cardiff to Aberystwyth, which is only 111 miles, and almost four hours to travel the 150 miles from Wrexham to Haverfordwest. Everybody knows that it is quicker to get from north Wales to London than from

<br>&nbsp;<br>north Wales to Cardiff. That is not joined-up transportation, and it is not helpful for the long-term strategic intentions that this Government, and any Government, would have for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_109">The importance of the transport system cannot be underestimated in the context of Welsh development. At present, Wales is in danger of becoming a two-tier nation, with parts of the south booming and areas of the north and west still heavily reliant on objective 1 European funding simply because of comparatively low incomes and comparatively low growth rates. Without proper Welsh-made transport, those without good transport access will be left behind, and we will see an increasing divide between rural and urban economic developments and between the north and south. We are already seeing resentment as the M4 corridor gets significant investment and is accessible, while other parts of the nation suffer in silence. The decline of manufacturing in areas such as Powys is a good example of the pressures experienced when transport links are not in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_110">During the general election, a recurring theme for me was the reality of car dependence in rural areas such as mid-Wales, as has been pointed out. Let us face it: there is no point in having a bus service if there is only going to be one person on the bus. In any cohesive strategy for Wales, the role of the automobile must be considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_111">Another recurring theme was the poor state of the rail services. For example, there is currently only a two-hourly service during the week between Birmingham and Cardiff. If a train is cancelled, that means a four-hour wait. Few people from that area will have escaped the problems of being left high and dry by a service terminated in, for example, Wolverhampton. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin), as I always do, and while he has been cautious with respect to aviation and so forth, I was disappointed that he did not express his opinion on whether privatisation was the single most damaging thing that any Government of the last 30 years have done to the service endured by Welsh rail users.
</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has confirmed from a sedentary position that he has a strong view on the matter. That is fair enough&#151;he is entitled to his view. I believed at the time, however, and continue to believe on the basis of the evidence that rail privatisation has decimated the service, which should have been kept intact and, at that time, in public ownership.

 At the time I did not think so, but looking back I would give anything to return to the flawed but much more coherent days of British Rail compared with what we have now. By implication, I assumed that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) and his colleagues all continue to believe that privatisation of the rail services was a good idea. It is just as well, then, that their party did not get re-elected, because if, even today, they have not learned the

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50616-17_spnew9"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Unfortunately, because of the decision made by the Conservatives at the time, it does not look feasible to return to those days and reverse their appalling decision. If the hon. Gentleman would like more detail on that, I shall be happy to have a quick session with him afterwards, including a discussion on aviation, to enlighten him on the reasons why the Conservative Members currently in this Chamber are in a minority of four on support for privatisation of rail services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_112">Another issue that we must bear in mind in relation to the integrated rail and transport strategies for Wales is that these problems cannot be addressed overnight. It would be churlish to pretend that one piece of legislation could do so. However, the Liberal Democrats feel that the Bill represents a prudent move, as it gives the Welsh Assembly the power to make some strategic changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_113">The Bill contains many good points. For example, it provides the opportunity for better and faster north-south road links. We all need to recognise that any expansion and extension of road networks must be approached with caution on account of the environmental damage that cars do. We must also recognise, however, that cars are a fact of life and that the north-south roads are nothing like as good as the east-west links, which disadvantages large parts of Wales, especially rural Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_114">The Bill provides the opportunity to modernise and improve the efficiency of the railway system that serves the whole of Wales. It contains a proper appreciation of the current transport situation in rural areas and of the need for fair treatment of those whose only option is the car. If passed, and, I hope, improved a little in Committee, it can directly benefit the economy three ways: tourism, industry and agriculture. It will enable the Welsh Assembly to take a strategic approach to the problems that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_115">As right hon. and hon. Members may have guessed, I welcome particularly the emphasis placed by the Bill on air transport services&#151;a sector with enormous, and in my view largely untapped, potential in Wales. Airports, including those in Ynys M&#244;n, Welshpool, Swansea, Haverford West, Cardiff and Caernarfon, provide a perfect opportunity to link Wales up in a fast and efficient way with minimal requirement for additional investment in infrastructure. The Secretary of State, no longer in his place, and I flew down together from Welshpool to Cardiff some years ago and my hon.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50616-18_spnew4"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 I heard a great deal during the general election campaign from the Liberal Democrat candidate about his opposition to air transport as a non-sustainable form of transportation. Is it Liberal Democrat policy to develop a regional network of air transport within the UK?

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50616-18_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 On the first point, the Liberal Democrats view emissions trading as the right approach so that account can be taken of the environmental damage that various modes of transport cause. On the second question, the hon. Gentleman will know, having closely studied the Welsh Liberal Democrat manifesto, that one of our commitments was support in principle for a regional air network in Wales. That is the jurisdiction about which I speak. We have already touched on the environment and environmental damage, and I will come to it later, if the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, because I want to deal with the issue in the context of what the hon. Member for Leominster has said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_116">Having seen the benefits of air transport at an early stage in Wales, I was surprised that the hon. Member for Leominster was so cautious in expressing a view on behalf of his party. He says that he has an open mind, but I believe that it is open to a fault. Many members of the Conservative party have, as the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) said, already committed themselves to the benefits of a regional air network in Wales. For the hon. Gentleman to say that the Conservatives do not have a position on that matter implies that he has not been looking at the facts to the extent that he should have. In fairness to him, he has said that he will consider the arguments. I have no hesitation in expressing my hope that he will be persuaded, particularly in Committee, of the benefits of having a regional air network.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_117">Some of the arguments made by the hon. Member for Leominster were rather curious. For one thing, he and the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) were badgering the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n about how many seats the aircraft would have as if that were the key consideration&#151;it is not. Partly owing to environmental considerations, a regional air network in Wales will never be a method of mass transportation. That is not what it is for: it is a method of fast transportation for the small number of people who really need to get to from one part of Wales to another quickly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50616-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Jones: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the take-up for such a service is more likely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 435</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to include civil servants, Members of the National Assembly and Members of this House? Frankly, commercial demand for that service is minimally low.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50616-18_spnew7"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has obviously done his own research, but I want to ask him what conversations he has had with Pierre Sarre. Has he even heard of Pierre Sarre? Probably not, but everyone in Montgomeryshire knows about Pierre Sarre&#039;s company Control Techniques. It employs hundreds and hundreds of people in Montgomeryshire. It is one of the most important employers in my area. Pierre Sarre needs to get in and out of Wales quickly and he often comes from abroad. He lands at Welshpool airport, he does his business, then he heads off again. He will often bring customers from around Europe into Wales specifically to seal deals that are worth millions of pounds to the mid-Wales economy. That is a classic example of the importance of having a regional and accessible air network to enable such high-valued passengers to come in and out and make an unquestionably significant contribution to the economy of Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50616-18_spnew8"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily uncharitable to me. The Bill is not about whether or not air transport in Wales is a good thing, but whether the Assembly can subsidise it. My mind is open because I believe that the Assembly must make the case when it spends the money. It is no more complicated than that; it is very straightforward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50616-18_spnew9"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The only reason I am going on about it is, if I may say so without sounding childish, that the hon. Gentleman started it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, yes he did! If he had not told us that he was sceptical about the case for regional air networks, I would not be telling him that he should be more confident about it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_169"><a name="50616-18_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Jones: </b> 
 I fully take the point that there is a demand for regional air services both coming into and going out of Wales. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the example of Pierre Sarre, but my question related to an intra-Wales service. My point was that the demand for and take-up of an intra-Wales north to south service&#151;whether it be from the valleys or Cardiff to Caernarfon&#151;was likely to be from the public, not the private, sector.
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="50616-18_spnew11"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I could provide many examples of industrialists who regard access to good airport facilities in Wales as very important. There is Carlo Sidoli, who runs Sidoli&#039;s ice cream in Welshpool. He often brings customers in and out. We all agree that that is important reason for having an aviation infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_118">As to whether civil servants or others use the network, I believe that there is a good case for having aircraft with fairly small capacity to take the small number of people who go from north to south Wales on a regular basis in an efficient fashion. The hon. Gentleman mentions civil servants using it. That may well be the case, but he must recognise that one of the things that suppresses north-south economic development in Wales is the fact that people cannot make the journey quickly. The hon. Gentleman disagrees, but I can assure him that there would be a feasibility study before any system was set up. John Pritchard of KPMG has just completed a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 436</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>feasibility study of the expansion of Welshpool airport. He took the view that there was an economic case for having an extended runway and two new hangars in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_119">I will resist the temptation to argue in any further detail about what sort of scheduled services should be set up, but it is possible to find an aircraft for every occasion. One could use an eight-seater Piper PA31 Navajo, for example, which can transport people at about 195 mph; or one could opt for an Dornier 328 or Dornier ATR42. Aircraft can be found to fulfil the demand.
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="50616-18_spnew12"><b> Albert Owen: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman knows that a study of intra-Wales air links has already been undertaken by the National Assembly for Wales. There has also been a consultation process in respect of the aviation White Paper in the House, in which I and many others had the opportunity to participate. The research has already been done, and it is surprising that the Conservatives do not know about it, particularly when one of their number was a Member of the National Assembly for Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_172"><a name="50616-18_spnew13"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Actually, there were two of them. I am rather surprised by the apparent level of ignorance of the existing information. What we do not have is a detailed assessment of what the schedules should be and precisely which aircraft should be used, but all that will be done in time. I am satisfied that enough work has been done to convince me and others that such a small aircraft network is a viable proposition for Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_173"><a name="50616-18_spnew14"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman is so convinced that it is a viable business proposition, would he be willing to put any of his own money into it?

 That is the most extraordinary question that I have been asked in the House for a long time. I am a politician, not an airline mogul. Since the hon. Gentleman asks, however, in the late 1980s I was, as it happens, on the verge of setting up&#151;jointly&#151;a charter airline operating from Newcastle to national airports. The only reason we did not do it was our realisation that owing to the bankrupt economic policies of the Conservative party, the business would have gone down the tubes. So I blame the hon. Gentleman, by proxy, for the fact that I am in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_120">Environmental considerations are very valid when it comes to air transport, but we must recognise that any intra-Wales air network would contribute a relatively small emission, because the aircraft would have relatively small engines. I return to the example of the eight-seater aircraft. It flies on about 28 gallons per hour. If there are four passengers, that works out at about 22 miles per passenger gallon. That is not wonderful, but it is an extremely small percentage of the overall contribution of aviation to pollution. I still think that the importance of emissions trading cannot be overestimated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para5">

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_122">While welcoming the Bill, we hope that the following matters will be considered seriously. We feel that the Bill attaches insufficient weight to the importance of sustainable development&#151;which, of course, includes aviation. If the Wales transport strategy is to achieve optimum outcomes at environmental and community levels, there must be a strong emphasis on sustainable development. Sustainability is mentioned in clause 1(1)(a), but I think it should also be mentioned in clause 4(3) and clause 7(2). The goals of economy, efficiency and effectiveness must be achieved in a sustainable context. One possibility that is not often mentioned in the context of transport is the elimination of certain trips that are currently necessary. All Governments should consider promoting home working from now on. Given the availability of information technology, people&#039;s quality of life could be improved in that way, while congestion on both roads and public transport could be reduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_123">Will the Minister tell us what impact he expects the Bill to have on the Welsh railway network? It is impossible to have a coherent, comprehensive transport strategy without efficient rail networks. The hon.

<a name="stpa_124">People feel that the differences in the Scottish and the Welsh arrangements have come about in a rather arbitrary fashion. I should be grateful if, either now or in Committee, the Minister would give us an idea of the differences that the Government perceive between Scotland and Wales, and of the rationale for the changes. I think it instructive to look at what has happened in Scotland.

<a name="50616-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_125">As I said in an intervention, Northern Ireland provides a very good example of a successfully integrated rail and bus system. There is also a degree of integration between Belfast city airport and the rail service, although I do not want to push that too far. Will the Minister assure us&#151;especially in view of the Secretary of State&#039;s dual role&#151;that the Government will look at best practice in Northern Ireland and ensure that the Bill we pass facilitates its implementation in Wales?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_126">Let me return to aviation. The Bill gives us an opportunity to invest in the air network. Notwithstanding the criticisms that I have made of comments by Conservative Members, I think that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West made a fair point: we must justify any money that we put into the network. Perhaps, now or when we reach the relevant clause in Committee, the Minister will explain how he thinks the Assembly would make the calculation. He may be interested to learn that Andrew Davies, the Economic Development and Transport Minister in Wales, is flying to Welshpool airport to review developments there. I believe that he too advocates a regional air network service.

It was the first time that a Committee of the House had worked formally with a Committee in a devolved Administration, but I am sure that it will not be the last.

I am pleased, however, that the Railways Act 2005 picked up provisions relating to railway services that were originally part of the draft Wales Bill, and, indeed, the spirit of the Select Committee&#039;s recommendations&#151;contrary to what the hon.

I welcome that legislation and its contribution to the integration of transport policy in Wales. That is, in fact, very much the subject of the Bill: empowering the National Assembly to develop and implement policies that will contribute to a safe, integrated, sustainable, efficient, economic transport system to, from and within Wales.

<a name="50616-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_131">The original draft Bill left the rail passengers committee and the National Federation of Bus Users in Wales as the separate representative voices of users of most public transport in Wales.

Apart from the common-sense integration

Again, the Government have rectified the omission. We also drew attention to the absence of any reference to environmental sustainability, and the Government have included that in a general transport duty for Wales. I know that that has not completely satisfied environmental and wildlife groups. Like, I suspect, the Liberal Democrats, I received a briefing from RSPB Cymru, which called for the reference to be strengthened, perhaps by direct reference to the Assembly&#039;s statutory duty under the Government of Wales Act 1998 to &quot;promote sustainable development&quot;. It also called for further references to that duty in clause 4, for better discharge of transport functions, and on clause 7, which relates to direct agreements between the Assembly and providers of public transport services. I have some sympathy for those calls, but they are clearly a matter for consideration in Committee. In any case, I warmly welcome the Government&#039;s inclusion of sustainability in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_133">The Select Committee also made recommendations to try to deal with concerns raised by local authorities and the Welsh Local Government Association about their future role under the Bill. They were worried about Assembly involvement in the production of local transport plans and the fact that councils were not specifically mentioned for consultation on the Wales transport strategy. We recommended alterations to try to address these concerns. Again, the Government have responded positively and the Bill includes an explicit duty on the Assembly to consult Welsh local authorities, and English local authorities with boundaries on the Welsh borders, in preparing for the Welsh transport strategy. They have also amended the draft Bill so that any decision to refuse a local transport plan for any reason would have to be taken by the National Assembly in plenary session. The Bill has been redrafted to make clear the central role of local authorities in the appointment of a majority of members of joint transport authorities. Those changes will help to ensure that the Assembly and local government work hand in hand to improve transport provision in Wales in the years ahead.

<a name="50616-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_134">I now turn to issues where we failed to convince the Government and issues where I hope there might be scope for further movement. The Government have rejected our call to move the transport commissioner, who has responsibility for Wales, from Birmingham to Wales. I urge that, at least, further consideration is given in the weeks ahead to establishing an office in Wales, with staff, for the transport commissioner. But my main appeal to the Government at this stage is on the Select Committee&#039;s recommendation on provision for bus franchising along the lines that we have here in London. We believe that the Assembly should be empowered to take up that option if it so chooses.

<a name="50616-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_135">From my observations in Swansea and south-west Wales, I have to say that the bus deregulation and privatisation measures introduced by the Conservative party in the early to mid-1980s were not an entirely beneficial experience, to say the least. It certainly did not take us forward to the better, more comprehensive bus networks that we needed. However, the Tories&#039; completely free market approach has been modified and the situation considerably improved with the Transport Act 2000 and the introduction of bus quality partnerships and quality contracts. The partnerships allow a deal between the local authority and the bus contractor whereby the operator invests in high-quality services, more environmentally friendly vehicles and staff training. In return, the local authority invests in traffic management schemes, bus priority lanes, bus stations and shelters, other facilities and timetable information. Moving still further away from deregulation, quality contracts provide for a licensing regime whereby operators bid for exclusive rights to run services on a route or group of routes on the basis that the local authority sets the service specification and performance targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_136">The Select Committee&#039;s proposal was to introduce a further option to be available to the Assembly&#151;franchising. That would allow for a fully regulated regime when appropriate. As with London, it would mean that all services were secured by a transport authority from private operators following competitive tendering. The authority would determine the level and structure of fares to be charged, the structure of bus routes and the frequency of operation. It would be      responsible for providing and maintaining infrastructure, promoting customer information and developing technology to ensure that operators deliver safe, reliable and clean buses. That is an alternative model that we are increasingly likely to need as we recognise that competition between bus operators cannot always deliver the services that we require. In particular, that very competition can stand in the way of our dealing with the more pressing competition between continued growth in the use of the private motor car and the alternative of public transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_137">The approach advocated by the Select Committee of giving the National Assembly the widest choice of transport tools possible to achieve its objectives, including bus franchising, fits in with our approach to the governance of Wales. If, as the Secretary of State indicated in yesterday&#039;s statement, we are looking to empower the National Assembly as far as possible in the legislation that we pass in this Parliament that affects Wales, the power to introduce bus franchising would send a very positive message, as well as being a sensible practical measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_138">My belief in empowerment of the Assembly leads me to urge the Government to resist calls from admirable organisations such as Transport 2000 and the RSPB, who oppose the provision of subsidy for air transport and therefore want clause 11 to be removed. As we have heard, that clause empowers the Assembly to give financial assistance for air transport services or airport facilities in certain circumstances. I believe that we should stick with the clause as worded, although I do have sympathy with the arguments against subsidising aviation: that it tends to benefit the better off; that air transport is a high and rising contributor to greenhouse

Member for Leominster, especially in his absence, but those are genuine arguments. The counter-case&#151;that using this power will bring real economic and social benefits&#151;was strongly and effectively argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik). For me, though, what is important is that that argument can take place on a case-by-case basis and where it should&#151;in Wales and, ultimately, in the National Assembly. If we mean what we say about empowerment, we must provide the Assembly with the widest range of choices possible.

 I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to his new role and wish him all the best in it.

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_140">With no disrespect to Members of this House and those of the National Assembly who put their efforts into debating and shaping the Transport Bill during the last Parliament, I believe that it is a modest piece of work that may do little to address the fundamental transport challenges facing the people of Wales and the Welsh economy. At the same time, it contains some proposals that require further thought.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_141">I do not object to the notion of transport planning at Assembly level, but I am sceptical of the value of grand transport strategies on paper. Hon. Members can judge for themselves what difference the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s much-heralded integrated transport strategy has really made to travel in the UK during the past seven years. Members will recall the Prime Minister declaring in his first annual report that the integrated transport strategy was &quot;delivered&quot;. Delivering words on paper is all well and good, but what matters in terms of transport is funding, as well as tough, and correct, choices over competing infrastructure projects and the ability to manage those projects ruthlessly through to completion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">Giving the Assembly the ability to provide a stronger and more focused lead on transport in Wales is not objectionable in itself, but I have three areas of concern. Let me start with what I believe to be an imbalance in the Bill&#151;the heavy focus on public sector passenger transport needs. Any successful Wales transport strategy must have the needs of the Welsh business community at its heart. The efficient movement of goods, services and people is vital to a thriving economy and, to that end, business requires reliable, affordable and safe modes of transport for staff and customers, as well as swift access to markets for freight. Based on my observations of the Assembly Government in action and the specific measures contained in the Bill, I am sceptical about whether the strategy will deliver what business wants. Certainly in my constituency, there is a fairly widespread view within the local business community that the Assembly does not always have the needs of business&#151;especially small firms&#151;on its radar. That view is supported by the Federation of Small Businesses 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in Wales, which fears that the voice of the small business sector is being lost among the voices of public sector bodies in the discussion about Welsh transport needs. That must not be allowed to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_143">The Bill is heavily focused on local authority and public transport considerations. For instance, clause 2 places on the Assembly a clear duty to consult every local authority in Wales and any English councils adjacent to the Principality in drafting the transport strategy. Clause 5(c) permits it then to consult anyone else it thinks relevant. Why does the Minister not think that there should also be a requirement for the Assembly to consult business? Why should not the private sector be seen as an equal stakeholder alongside the public sector in the drafting of a transport strategy? Given the importance of transport to the economy, dialogue with business over the specific contents of the strategy should not be optional. There are precedents for a statutory duty to consult business. Aside from the section 115 requirement in the Government of Wales Act 1998, which I understand would not cover the transport strategy, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 contains a specific clause requiring the Mayor and the Greater London authority to consult
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;those bodies representing persons carrying on business in London&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_144">Would it not be appropriate, therefore, for the Bill to contain a similar provision? I look forward to the Minister&#039;s comments on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_145">The second area of concern relates to clause 5 and the proposal to create joint transport authorities. At a time when the Welsh Assembly Government are trying, too hard, to persuade the people of Wales that a bonfire of the quangos is underway, along comes a Bill giving the Assembly powers to create yet another cluster of unelected bodies funded by a levy on the taxpayer. The Minister may make the point that those will be lean and efficient bodies, but the costings provided in the explanatory notes are weak. I do not argue with the need for local councils to work closely together to deliver integrated transport networks that match travel patterns rather than merely matching local authority boundaries, but could that objective not be met through other means? For example, my local authority, Pembrokeshire, already participates in the south-west Wales integrated transport consortium&#151;or SWWITCH&#151;which comprises four authorities working closely together and developing a regional strategic transport framework. Should not that framework form the basis on which each constituent authority can develop its own local solutions tailored to its specific needs? The regional strategy for the SWWITCH area is quite capable of providing the basis for implementing the Wales transport strategy in Pembrokeshire and the three other local authority areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_146">There is also a danger that the joint transport authorities could undermine local authorities&#039; attempts to deliver integrated transport by separating decisions on transport and access from those made by the local authority on land use planning, economic development, social services, education and leisure. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s thoughts on whether there is a potential disconnection in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_147">My third concern relates to the provisions in the Bill permitting the Assembly to subsidise air transport services and facilities, which have been discussed at length this afternoon. I want to add my voice to those in

<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 443</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>support of expanded air capacity in Wales. Over the past 20 years, air traffic in the UK has trebled and for the next 20 or 30 years it is forecast to grow by 4 to 5 per cent. each year. That will benefit the major international airports in London, Manchester and the big cities, but the outlook for smaller regional airports is also positive. There is no reason why Wales cannot also benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_148">I listened to the arguments made by the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen), which were not without merit. I would have been happier had he supplemented his more visionary arguments with some hard data and statistics about the viability of an intra-Wales air transport network. New routes and services within and from Wales must only be carried forward on the basis of sound commercial principles. The key to successful local airports is the ability to identify and exploit specialised niche markets. That is a risky business and one better left to entrepreneurs, rather than to the taxpayer operating through politicians. The history of state aid to air services throughout the world is littered with examples of subsidies being driven by politicians&#039; vanity, misplaced nationalism and economic irrationalism. For those reasons, I am wary of giving the Assembly powers to subsidise air services.

<p><a name="st_177"><a name="50616-20_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b>

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="50616-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 No, I am not saying that, but I am wary of subsidies being used. I think that they should be used only as seed funding to get a service up and running, after which the taxpayer can withdraw from the relationship, not as a long-term funding mechanism.
</p>





<p><a name="st_179"><a name="50616-20_spnew3"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 That was a helpful clarification. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman would be concerned if the funding were an open-ended, ongoing commitment, rather than pump-priming funding that could lead to a viable operation or a one-off investment in infrastructure at the airport.
</p>





<p><a name="st_180"><a name="50616-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 That is exactly my view, and the hon. Gentleman expresses it better than I did.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="50616-20_spnew5"><b> Albert Owen: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that he is not against subsidies in principle, but he is worried about ongoing funding. Does he not understand that in areas such as his and mine, that funding would give the Assembly the ability to draw down European structural funds, under objective 1, which would assist the economic wellbeing of the areas in a wider context? That is difficult to quantify, which is why I did not include facts and figures in my argument. It is impossible to quantify the economic benefits to businesses in the area, about which the hon. Gentleman expressed concern.
</p>





<p><a name="st_182"><a name="50616-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 It is not impossible to quantify the benefit. We know that &#163;2.5 million of taxpayers&#039; money has already been used in Scotland to support lifeline air services. Research can be carried out into the effectiveness of those and the impact on tourism and local economic development. It would be possible to produce greater evidence to support the arguments that you are making. In the absence of such evidence, I am slightly wary of and somewhat sceptical about subsidies for air services that would be used by a narrow range of

<a name="50616-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_149">I am puzzled by how clause 11(2) will work in practice. Perhaps the Minister could outline how the Assembly will test for whether a service would not be provided without its financial assistance. Given the existence of a pot of subsidy, would it not be rational for any company tendering for a service to demonstrate that there is a shortfall in its business plan?
</p>





<p><a name="st_185"><a name="50616-21_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I just wanted to explain why I focused so much on air transport. It is because this is the enabling Bill that will finally secure an air network in Wales. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and the House for their forbearance. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the kind of passenger who would use such services. Yes, they would be small in number and probably fairly wealthy. However, for such a service to be viable, only 15 or 20 people a day would need to go from north to south. In any case, the funding would be an enabling investment for the economy, as the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) suggests.
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="50616-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 I recognise those arguments, but it would be helpful to see further research on the matter. If companies were thinking seriously about providing such services, one would expect that they would carry out their own market research and develop the numbers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_150">I am also surprised by the wording of clause 11 (3), given the heavily constrained regulatory environment in which air transport subsidies can be made. The Bill states that the Assembly &quot;may&quot; attach conditions to financial assistance. Surely it is the case that the Assembly must attach some pretty stringent conditions if their subsidies are to comply with EC regulation 2408/92. I should be grateful if the Minister would take a moment in his winding-up speech to explain the procedure for ensuring compliance and what role the Secretary of State for Transport will play. Will the Secretary of State merely rubber stamp a public service obligation on any route requested by the Assembly Minister?

This is the first time that I have participated in a debate in this House with him, and he had some interesting things to say. If I may, I will bring this debate back down to earth by focusing on land transport in Wales, particularly in north-east Wales, part of which I am honoured to represent.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 445</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_152">When the Assembly develops transport policy in Wales, it needs to take into consideration certain circumstances that are particularly relevant to north-east Wales. That area is very strong economically under this Labour Government; indeed, my constituency now has an unemployment rate of less than 2 per cent. and a vibrant local economy. North-east Wales also has a peculiarly strong reliance on car transport, which is not a record to be proud of. My hon. Friends&#151;my good friends&#151;the Members for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) and for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) have the honour to represent the local authority with the highest rate of car usage for travel to work of any county not just in Wales, but in the United Kingdom. Wrexham has the 22nd highest rate of such usage, so north-east Wales relies intensely on car transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_153">It is increasingly evident that poor transport links are becoming not just an environmental problem, but an economic one that is preventing the local economy from becoming even stronger than its current state. When the Assembly considers how to develop its transport strategy, I want it to focus on the importance in a modern economy of public transport, its development and access to it. There are some excellent manufacturing industries and strong local employers in our area, but people who want to work for them find it very difficult to get to work. Because 24-hour shifts are in operation, they find it extremely hard to get to work other than by car.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_154">Real progress has been made, however, in north-east Wales. Thanks to a public sector option, the Deeside shuttle, which serves the Deeside industrial estate, now transports people to work there. I am pleased to say that that model has been followed in Wrexham; the large Wrexham industrial estate now has a similar service. In trying to develop that service, I discovered that a vast number of organisations on the ground needed to be consulted, such as local authorities and other regional bodies. In Wrexham, the business community was also heavily consulted. We have an excellent business forum, which was at the forefront in developing the Wrexham shuttle. I agree with the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire that it is important that business be consulted, and I am sure that, even under the terms of this legislation, that will happen. Business often coughs up and funds such projects, and this Government are amenable to funding from various sources for public transport projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_155">North-east Wales still needs to turn away from private transport in a much more profound way. Discounting the London line, we have two local rail services: the Wrexham to Bidston line, to which I shall return, and the Chester to Shrewsbury line. Both services travel the border, and both are not as regular as we would like. Progress has been made, however. Later this year, the Chester to Shrewsbury service will become an hourly service, and the Wrexham to Bidston service already is hourly. However, it is very important that the new transport bodies develop local rail policy in a much more imaginative way than has been the case in recent years.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bidston line project in particular. I have been trying to bring about the electrification of that line, which would reduce the journey time between Wrexham and Liverpool by about half an hour. A direct service would give people in Gwersyllt, Hope and other places along the line much easier public transport access to Wrexham, the largest urban centre in north Wales. They would also be able to access employment more easily than is the case at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_157">I have received a lot of help in my work, and the north Wales transport grouping Taith has provided a great deal of support. The consultation process reports in July, and we hope that the project will be taken forward as soon as possible. However, from time to time I have had the feeling that I have been wading through mud as I have consulted with different bodies about the project. There is a strong case for establishing stronger regional authorities in Wales to deal with strategic projects such as the one to which I have referred. By themselves, local authorities are too small to handle important strategic issues such as the railways.

: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point, but does it not support the concern expressed earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)?

In due course, those arrangements will affect the working of the joint transport authorities.

 I do not know that what I said supports the point made by the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin), but I agree that cross-border issues are extremely important. Earlier, I mentioned the Wrexham to Bidston line, but Wrexham is also served by the very important Chester to Shrewsbury line, which I believe should be developed to link Wrexham with the Chester business park, for example. Although that site is on the other side of the border, many of my constituents work there.

<a name="stpa_158">Under the present arrangements, it is very difficult to take that development forward. English authorities looking west are not as interested as they should be in providing services in Wales to transport people from Wales to England. Sometimes, I also feel that Wales, looking east, does not work as hard as it should to liaise with authorities in England about service access. The problem is a difficult one, but I think that the best way to deal with it is to adopt a strategic approach through the joint transport authorities.

<a name="stpa_164">For me to come here is a great honour indeed&#151;to represent the people of a great constituency like Blaenau Gwent, a constituency where we still have the great socialist and trade union values, values that some people in new Labour do not understand these days but I am very proud to represent. We believe in our fellow human beings, we believe in a sense of community and we have a warmth that extends to all about us.

<a name="stpa_165">So, being the Member for Blaenau Gwent, one has to ask, why and how could the safest Labour seat in Wales, with a 19,500 majority, disappear overnight to become an independent socialist seat with a 9,200 majority? That is a question that many people in new Labour should answer, because it is a question that many people have asked in my constituency. The explanation for that, of course, was the way in which new Labour decided to select a parliamentary candidate in Blaenau Gwent.

<br>&nbsp;<br>was very sad to see what was happening. Despite the representations that were made time and again to new Labour, we were ignored, and despite the fact that people stood up and wrote letters, asked for meetings and sent petitions&#151;not just in the Labour party but in the community in general&#151;nobody listened. That, I thought, was a very sad reflection, because people in this great constituency, who had always been there for Labour, were forgotten&#151;treated with indifference&#151;and when we asked for help there was nobody there to deal with us.

<a name="50616-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_167">It was never about women or men; it was about the right of choice. It was about the right of democracy, which is very precious to us all, because our integrity in Blaenau Gwent is as valuable to us as it is to anyone else throughout the realm, and that was the message that came from Blaenau Gwent on 5 May. It was so unfortunate that we came to that situation because nobody was prepared to listen on the new Labour party side.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_168">But we went forward and decided that we were not prepared to be taken for granted; because no one has the right to manipulate 60,000 electors, no one has the right to tell us what to do, and no one has the right to use us for a social experiment, which is what was being done in Blaenau Gwent. I was reminded at the time of that great quotation:

<a name="stpa_170">So today I stand here very humbly, and I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) is not in the Chamber, because he needs to reflect very seriously on the Blaenau Gwent result, and the 20 people who, disgracefully, have actually been expelled from the Labour party since that time because they stood up for the integrity of their own kith and kin&#151;they stood up for the people of Blaenau Gwent and will always be respected and remembered by the people. I find it strange that people in new Labour, instead of thinking carefully about that, have gone on to add insult to injury, to make sure that they cause more damage in my constituency.

<a name="50616-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_171">I am pleased to represent a very historic constituency. We go back a long way, steeped in great political tradition. My predecessor is Aneurin Bevan, the man who actually designed the health service. We are very proud of that. The design for the health service was based on the Tredegar Medical Aid Society, which was in a little town in my constituency, and of which he was a member. He was a great socialist and a great statesman. He took that blueprint and designed the NHS, his legacy for the whole of Britain and the envy of the world. It still works well; indeed, I am benefiting from it at present. The name of Aneurin Bevan is held in great respect. We are grateful for his work for the good of all the people of Britain. He is the greatest son of Blaenau Gwent.

On behalf of the people of Blaenau Gwent, I am pleased to express our

<br>&nbsp;<br>great thanks and appreciation to Llew Smith for all that he did during the 12 years that he was our Member of Parliament through his work in the constituency and in this honourable House to improve the quality of life for his constituents. He is my good friend and comrade, and a man I greatly respect. He will always have a very special place of affection in the constituency of Blaenau Gwent, and I am delighted to wish him and his wife Pam every happiness and health in their retirement.

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_173">I want to refer to the make-up of my constituency and its background. Obviously it is a working-class area and an industrial constituency&#151;mining and steel. Sadly, the mines disappeared in the 1980s, due to Conservative Governments, who smashed up part of our community, as many people, particularly in south Wales, will remember; but they did not smash our community spirit, which still exists. The warmth of that spirit can be found throughout my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_174">The other part of the industrial equation was steel. For 200 years, the Ebbw Vale steelworks was well known. It was in a valley 30 miles from the coastal area and was so important to the community that the town was built around it. It was a tragic day for us when on 5 July 2002 the Corus steel company&#151;executioners and axe men, as I described them&#151;closed that steelworks in our constituency. It had a devastating effect on us. The last 500 jobs&#151;quality jobs&#151;at the steelworks were taken away and immediately the community plummeted into another era of handouts and soup kitchens. Five hundred families lost their quality of life with the loss of those jobs and the local economy was devastated beyond belief. That was only three years ago. It has been a long haul and our local economy has still not recovered; the effect on the towns in my constituency has been devastating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_175">It was difficult for us to deal with that situation. Those great steelworkers at Ebbw Vale had only ever been guilty of productivity, quality and loyalty&#151;characteristics that had been stamped across the world during the years that the steelworks was in being. So, we lost our steelmaking industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_176">It is a sad reflection that, despite the fact that the Corus cuts were known about nationally, no Minister came to Ebbw Vale to see us&#151;not one. I wrote to the Prime Minister at the time to ask him to come to Blaenau Gwent to see us to boost our morale and to say that the Government were concerned about us. Nobody came, and perhaps that is another reason why I am standing here today as the Independent Member for Blaenau Gwent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_177">We have tried to find new industries for the future, but those industries have been very slow in coming along. They have not brought the quality jobs that we need, and I mean the quality jobs that everyone should be able to look forward to. From quality jobs cascades down a quality of life for everybody. Although I believe that the national minimum wage is a wonderful social development and that other measures have been very helpful, we must have decent jobs in the valley communities such as the one that I represent in Blaenau Gwent to provide that quality of life and to let people know that they have a place to take advantage of in the way that other people have always been able to.

<a name="stpa_178">How we deal with that issue in the future is important. Regional aid is active in Blaenau Gwent and it is very useful, but it does not provide enough new jobs and opportunity for the people. I hope that, in my work as a Member of the House, I can pursue the need for the direction of industry to places such as Blaenau Gwent. There is a need for the direction of industry if an area does not have the employment and quality of life that other people take for granted.

In my work in the House, I hope to join other Members in focusing on such initiatives and persuading the Government to take more action to deal with the domestic poverty problem that exists, I am sure, not just in Blaenau Gwent but in many other parts of Britain.

 It is customary in this place to make warm comments about hon. Members maiden speeches. I have no difficulty in admiring the delivery and aplomb of the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Peter Law) and the confidence with which he made his speech. I met him when he was a capable Labour Minister in the Assembly and I wish him well in representing his constituents of Blaenau Gwent. I am sure that he will do a good job.

<a name="50616-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_184">I would like to draw the House&#039;s attention to the background to the Bill and the unique way in which we have arrived at this point. As hon. Members have said, the Bill first appeared in draft form. I am proud that the   Welsh Affairs Committee undertook joint pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill in partnership with the Economic Development and Transport Committee of the Assembly. It was the first time that a Committee of the House had met a Committee of a devolved institution to undertake such joint scrutiny. I was pleased that the arrangement followed a previous recommendation of the Welsh Affairs Committee, which proposed joint working with the Assembly in its report entitled &quot;The Primary Legislative Process as it affects Wales&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_185">During the consultation stage on the draft Bill, the Welsh Affairs Committee and the Economic Development and Transport Committee met formally on five occasions and took evidence from 30 witnesses representing 14 different organisations. One of the main benefits of such formal joint working is that it enables Committees of the House and the Assembly to mirror the joint working that takes place between the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly Government when preparing draft Bills. It also allows for the wide scrutiny of a draft Bill from the perspective of both Westminster and Cardiff and, more importantly, avoids the unnecessary duplication of evidence gathered by Committees of the House and Assembly, which was experienced during the scrutiny of previous draft Bills.

<a name="50616-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_186">I shall mention the substance of the Bill only briefly because my hon. Friends the Members for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) and for Gower (Mr. Caton) will have covered the detail of the Select Committee report well. The Bill will enhance the powers of the National Assembly for Wales on transport to enable it to deliver an integrated transport policy for Wales. I am pleased that the Government have taken on board many of the recommendations made by the Welsh Affairs Committee in its report entitled &quot;Transport in Wales&quot;, which was published in 2003. As both the Committee and the Government recognise, there are significant economic, social and environmental benefits to be

 May I first refer to the speech made by the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Peter Law)&#151;or my hon. Friend, as I hope to say? I am pleased that he is on the awkward Bench and hope to see him here in future. I have a great deal of respect for not only him, but his predecessor, Llew Smith. Some hon. Members might be surprised to hear me say that given that my party and he disagreed so publicly on matters relating to the Welsh language and Welsh nationalism, but I always agreed with him profoundly on the matters that were important to him, such as the right to peace. We certainly agreed on the nuclear issue and I was pleased that we were as one on the virtues of democracy and socialism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">In reference to my hon. Friend&#039;s fine speech, perhaps I can mention my experience as a young political activist in the Rhymni valley in the &#039;70s. I attended several meetings in Ebbw Vale. I was working at the top of the Rhymni valley with people in Abertysswg, Beaufort, Rhymni itself and Pontlottyn, so I know the area well. I went to Ebbw Vale to attend the tragic meetings held at the time and remember a fine speech from Michael Foot, who was in the difficult position of defending development in the steel works. As my hon. Friend said, we are still seeing the effects of decisions taken at that time working out into the community that he has the honour to represent. I am sure that he will do a good job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_188">I hope that the Bill will address the historical difficulty that we have experienced in Wales as a result of the lack of an integrated transport policy and system. Plaid Cymru has long advocated what we call the figure of eight, which is a transport system that integrates the south-east and south-west of Wales with the north-east and north-west of Wales and puts a great emphasis on the public element of transport. I was glad to hear the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) stress that and agree with him entirely in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">Hopefully, the Bill will be an opportunity to co-ordinate and extend all forms of public transport. However, as much as it empowers the National Assembly for Wales, car use continues to be important in rural areas such as mine. I wish it were otherwise, but that is the case. Car use is essential in rural areas and has to be integrated. It is, of course, extremely expensive. It is significant&#151;I have said this before&#151;that the level of car ownership often coincides with areas of low income. The Welsh index of multiple deprivation, for example, shows that the highest level of car ownership is in Powys, which also has the lowest wages. Clearly, there is a complicated relationship that needs to be taken into account in any transport planning. I hope that car use will be better integrated with public transport as a result of the Bill.

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_190">I note in passing, on a personal note, that I want better and safer parking facilities in stations to encourage the use of public transport. I use Bangor station, where there are great possibilities for extending the use of land for parking and other facilities associated with a station, but it has been many years since that idea was first mooted and we are still waiting.

In August, we have the National Eisteddfod in Y Faenol, which is almost entirely adjacent to the bridges. We fear that there will be huge transport problems. I encourage the Minister to do everything he can to ameliorate those. Members of the National Assembly and this place have pressed the Government to do something about that. It needs to be done, otherwise we will have traffic jams all the way to Chester.

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_192">We also need to develop existing train services. There is great scope for integrating them now that Arriva is in charge. However, last year I tried to buy a freedom of Wales pass&#151;a useful ticket that allows four days travel out of eight at a reasonable rate. It enables me to use my favourite railway line, the Cambrian Coast line, which I have mentioned before. It is a wonderful line that goes through my constituency and others. It has many small halts and a number of stations, none of which has ticket selling facilities. The freedom of Wales pass can be bought at stations, but not on the Cambrian Coast line. Unfortunately, it cannot be bought on the train either. Despite the wonderful new ticketing machines that can provide a ticket from Pwllheli to London or wherever, one cannot buy a freedom of Wales pass, even though it is supported by the National Assembly for Wales with some money. The pass allows not only local people, but tourists, to enjoy the glorious Cambrian Coast line, the Mid-Wales line and many other lines.

 I thank the Minister for that reassurance. During the summer, we will still be down on the services. Perhaps more pertinently, when the Bill is enacted, if such changes affecting services that come into Wales from outside are made in future, will the Assembly having any way of influencing the decisions, or will it be tied down to decisions that affect services within Wales? He may care to answer that question today or in Committee, as it is extremely important. Main line services are used in Wales, even thought they may start and end in London.

<a name="stpa_194">I have already referred to the use of cars. We have a road transport system that has historically not been of great advantage to Wales. In fact, problems with the road transport system have led to economic, social and political difficulties. It has been a historical bane of Wales that roads have travelled through Wales, rather than to Wales. Useful roads such as the A5, A48, A55 and M4 are engines for economic revival on a very

<a name="50616-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_195">On north-south travel, I again hope that the Bill will empower the Assembly to make improvements. I am amazed that there are still places in mid-Wales where only one vehicle can proceed at a time in travelling from north to south. Those places might be in very rural areas where the level of traffic is not particularly huge, but it is surprising to say the least that there are such places on the main north-south road. No one is looking for a 10-lane motorway, but there is a need for a decent straightish main road, dualled where possible for passing, perhaps enabling my constituents to travel to the capital of Wales as quickly as they can travel to the capital of Ireland. It is currently a good deal easier to get to Dublin than to Cardiff. We look forward to seeing the Assembly tackle the issue with vigour following the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_196">We also look for opportunities from the Bill to improve freight rail use. The needs of businesses were mentioned, I think by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) or one of his colleagues. The House will be interested to know that there has recently been a successful experiment in carrying timber by train from north-west Wales to Chirk. That innovation proves that freight transport by rail is no more costly than road transport, and it is better for the environment, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_197">I hope to see such developments on not only the Cambrian Coast line, but the Conwy Valley line, where a possible development involves taking slate waste from Blaenau Ffestiniog for use in the building industry. However, we must ensure that the Conwy Valley line to Llandudno junction is improved to allow that development to continue. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will make the case for improvement with me and my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Earlier this week, Labour Councillor Trevor Roberts of Bermo, my hon. Friend and I had a positive meeting with the Transport Minister with responsibility for that area, and if we all pull together on that important scheme, it will provide not only an engine for economic regeneration in Blaenau Ffestiniog, but improvements on the line to Llandudno Junction. In conclusion, the local transport plans are a positive step, and I am also pleased by the inclusion of cycling in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_198">In the last Session, the Government intended to introduce a school transport Bill, about which I had tremendous reservations, because it would have introduced the possibility of charging for travel to school in rural areas. I also understand that that provision might be included in the proposed education Bill, when it is published. It is clear that transport to school is part of the wider transport system, especially in rural areas where people use the school bus to get to work. We must examine the education Bill very carefully, and local transport plans will have to take such negative steps on school transport into account.

I know that &quot;subsidy&quot; is a dirty word for some hon. Members, but we should examine subsidising innovative forms of public transport. I look forward to the proposed super buses, which will transport people from north Wales to south Wales in extreme comfort, perhaps almost as quickly as by air transport. Many people, including tourists, use the long-running TrawsCambria service, which shows that demand exists for such provision.

I therefore hope that the Welsh Assembly Government apply for European moneys to develop the air service. I think that a service from north to south Wales would carry not a large number of passengers, but key passengers from the business sector and local authorities in my area and others in north Wales to Cardiff and back. That can only be good.

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50616-24_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Si&#226;n C. James  (Swansea, East) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate on Second Reading of the Transport (Wales) Bill. I am confident that it will provide the people of Wales with a blueprint for further development of a sustainable, fully integrated modern transport system, fit for the 21st century, which will meet the needs of all our constituencies and communities, such as mine in Swansea, East.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_203">I feel qualified to speak in the debate because my interest in Welsh transport matters was gained not only as someone who relied extensively, when a young mother, on public transport, but as a former employee of the rail industry. For several years, I worked for the rail operators in Wales as an Association of Train Operating Companies representative and on behalf of individual rail operators. During that time, I was also a member of the Wales transport forum and saw the introduction of innovative schemes such as the golden telephone line to provide travellers with an easy, bilingual, one-stop service for all rail, bus and ferry timetables.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_204">I was also deeply involved in the negotiations for the single Welsh rail franchise, a plan that reduced the number of rail operators from a confusing seven to two. In that role, I undertook a great deal of cross-border work, working closely with colleagues in Shropshire, the west country, Liverpool, Manchester and even as far south-east as Sussex and the outer-London area.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">The Bill provides for great opportunities. Its aims and objectives provide a clear and coherent way forward. We want transport provision that meets the requirements of local people and is part of a joined-up transport strategy, devised and managed in Wales. I know from my work in the past that that is what people want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_206">When I worked in the industry, I travelled back and forth across Wales, meeting user groups, rail and bus operators and working closely with some of the transport forums that some hon. Members have mentioned. They were clear that a joined-up approach, which embraced wider issues such as funding, road congestion and airport development, was needed. Time and again, I listened to their comments and discussed their communities with them, and I realised that people have a pretty good idea of what they need and how services tailored to meet local transport challenges can and will enable people to go about their daily lives more easily and effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_207">I am hugely optimistic about the Bill. In the past six years, Westminster and the Assembly have worked together to deliver our aspirations. Their constructive co-operation has identified many key aims and objectives and allowed information and analysis to be shared. Together, we have created a solid base of understanding and information sharing, which I believe will form the basis of future work and development in a Wales that is fully ready to take on responsibility for all transport-related matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_208">Although I am interested in all aspects of transport in Wales, hon. Members probably realise that I am especially interested in rail services. Swansea is a rail city. It has played a major role in the development of rail services to south Wales and south-west Wales. It occupies a strategic place on the south Wales main line and the M4. It is also the terminus of an inter-city service from London Paddington. Many hon. Members rely heavily on that line, which provides a vital link for business travel, tourism and freight to and from south Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_209">I welcomed the introduction of new services to and from Paddington, but I now discover with alarm that there is a possibility of reducing those services to their original levels. The much publicised and welcomed additional First Great Western services could be cut. I know full well what those increased service patterns and improved half-hourly services at peak times mean not only to me but to my constituents on a business and tourism and leisure basis. Work, education and leisure opportunities will be severely affected. Swansea has prospered under successive Labour Governments. Further investment and development opportunities are vital if we wish to maintain that growth and provide even more opportunity for our citizens. If any cuts in service provision are allowed to go ahead, they could seriously affect future development. I am determined not to allow that to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_210">What is important here is the ability to have a service in Wales for Wales. The Bill not only proposes greater powers over rail and other modes of transport, but provides an opportunity for greater financial responsibility. If such cuts are not what we should be using our powers against, I do not know how we should be using them. Therefore, I shall be working strongly and closely with the Assembly and my local Assembly 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 457</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member, Val Lloyd, as well as my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton), my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) and others in the Swansea area. Franchisees need to be more accountable on a Wales level and must justify any proposals for cuts or changes to service patterns that they make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_211">I also welcome the proposed establishment of a public transport users committee. Again, I have worked very closely with user groups and I saw what they could achieve. Many of my hon. Friends have talked today about their concerns over cross-border issues. I have worked with many passenger user groups and support groups within the Wales and borders area&#151;organisations such as the South West Wales Integrated Transport Consortium, Taith and the South East Wales Transport Alliance&#151;and they are ready and willing to get involved. They are able and capable of growing and developing into the services that we all need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_212">I have learned at first hand how greater investment locally, the transfer of powers and proper financial provision can enable Wales to take plans to the next logical stage of development. I expect that several hon. Members might consider that this is not enough, but I can assure them that the work has been done and the plans are in place. I do not think that we will ever lose that ability to have a cross-border dialogue and to realise that, wherever services begin or end and whether they go through or stay within Wales, it is in all our interests to have a joined-up railway system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_213">Excellent channels of communication already exist and that needs to continue. I welcome the Bill, which truly reflects our commitment to the localisation of services and greater regional responsibility. This partnership approach will build on the existing work and utilise best practice, developed over several years of joint working. The services exist in many places; we now need to build on them. The Bill offers the people of Wales the tools to achieve a better, more integrated, funded and sustainable service, which is the key to improving our public transport services.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50616-24_spnew1"><b> David T.C. Davies  (Monmouth) (Con):</b> 
 I confess to having something of a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu today, first because many of the issues that we have discussed are ones that I discussed in the Welsh Assembly Economic Development and Transport Committee and, secondly, because over many years I have enjoyed bouts of verbal sparring with the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Peter Law), who is just leaving the Chamber. For a while, he was a Minister with responsibility for these issues in the Welsh Assembly, and I am delighted to see him here this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_214">I also welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s maiden speech. I disagree with some of the content, but no one could dispute the fact that it was given in the tradition of the best speeches that are made in the House. It came straight from the heart and was made without notes. He made some extremely good points. Most Opposition Members would very much agree that those who stand for Parliament should be selected on merit, not on the basis of their sex. Whatever our past political disagreements, I have no doubt about the hon. Gentleman&#039;s ability to represent his constituents.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 458</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_215">There is no doubt either that Wales&#039;s transport system needs to be greatly improved as it suffers from many problems. The Bill draws attention to some of those and is a genuine attempt to address them, although I have reservations as to how effective the proposed solutions are likely to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_216">An issue mentioned early in the Bill, but which has not yet been discussed is safety, an issue close to the hearts of many on both sides of the House. One thing that has particularly concerned me over the years is the difference in approach in Wales and in England to the designation of speed limits on trunk roads. Far too many deaths and serious injuries of pedestrians have occurred on trunk roads in Wales, yet it appears to take far too long to get the national speed limit reduced, even on trunk roads going directly through the heart of small towns and villages. In my experience, that is much less of a problem in England. Anecdotally, one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Wales is the A40449, which goes straight through Monmouth and borders a large school. Numerous accidents and deaths have occurred on it over the years, and sadly, one very serious accident occurred during the past few weeks. Despite many years of campaigning to reduce the speed limit on that stretch of road from 70 mph to 50 mph, conducted by members of all political parties and at all levels of government&#151;in Parliament, by my predecessor, by me in the Assembly, by Liberal Democrat councillors, and although we do not have many Plaid Cymru members in government in Monmouthshire, I am sure that they would also agree with the policy&#151;we have not been successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_217">I want to pay another tribute, however, to my friend the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent. A few years ago, I visited him in his capacity as a Welsh Minister, to request a reduction in the speed limit on a trunk road through the village of Llanover. At the time, he promised that that would be introduced, and he kept his word&#151;he is a man of his word. He admitted to me afterwards, however, that it is much harder to reduce such trunk road speed limits in Wales than one would expect. It is not simply a matter of signing an order and erecting a new sign. That should not be the case, however, because as one comes out of Monmouthshire into Herefordshire or the Forest of Dean, it will be clear, on any trunk road that goes through a village, that the Department for Transport in England has taken proactive measures to reduce speed limits. Why that should not be so in Wales I do not know. I would appreciate an answer from the Minister as to whether the Bill is likely to allow the Assembly to make decisions on speed limits more quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_218">As the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James) said, there is also a clear need to introduce an integrated transport policy. I would not disagree at all with that intention. I warn Members, however, that the Assembly has been talking up an integrated transport strategy for many years now&#151;one of the first resolutions that it passed was that it would develop such a strategy. It was not clear at the time that anything prevented it from doing so. We all agree that transport hubs and modes must be in the same place as far as is possible. Where is the evidence, however, that this Bill will help? In Chepstow and Abergavenny, for example, passengers arriving at the bus station who want to continue their journey by train or vice versa are faced with an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 459</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>impractically long walk to get from one station to the next. I do not see how the Bill will help to resolve that problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_219">A similar but much larger-scale problem applies to transport integration at Cardiff airport. At long last, it now has a rail link. Even that rail link, however, is far from practical&#151;it is a small-line link from Cardiff to Rhoose station, which is now renamed, rather grandly, Cardiff international station, as I understand it. Anyone travelling down from the valleys, from London or anywhere else would have to catch a train to Cardiff and then another train to Cardiff international airport at Rhoose, and would then have to get a minibus over to the airport. How many families with all their luggage, knowing that they must get to an airport at least an hour in advance to catch their planes, will choose that as a means of getting to the airport?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050616/debtext/50616-25.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_197"><a name="50616-25_spnew0"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I just muse that Cardiff international airport must be the only airport of its size that requires one to drive through two housing estates to reach it. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that is an enormous waste of resource, as it takes as long to get from the airport into the town as to fly to the airport.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="50616-25_spnew1"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 Indeed. That brings me on to why has the Welsh Assembly not developed some sort of viable road link straight on to the M4, which is only a few miles away geographically? I understand, as I have seen loads of figures on the potential costs, that a realistic estimate for such a fast road link on to the M4 would be &#163;37 million. That is a lot of money but not huge in the scheme of things when we consider what is likely to be spent on the M4 relief road going through Newport. Without a shadow of a doubt, however, such a scheme would add to the viability of that airport and even make possible the development of some of the services that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) mentioned, without the need for various different subsidies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_220">That brings me to another problem that could worsen as a result of the Bill. I have noticed a tendency over the last few years for the Assembly Administration to deal with complaints about transport by suggesting impractical and expensive headline-grabbing solutions to meet a need that does not really exist, rather than spending the money at a local level where it could make a difference. We need to ensure that the Bill does not make that even worse by giving the Assembly too many powers to subsidise such grandiose schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">A couple of years ago, I well remember that the Assembly wanted to use &#163;20 million of public money to build a futuristic monorail system, which would have transported people in driverless pods 15 ft above the ground at Cardiff bay from the Welsh Assembly Building to Cardiff city hall, which is only a few hundred yards further up the road. If that pipedream ever goes ahead&#151;I understand from an answer to a written question a few months ago that there is still a possibility that it could&#151;it could end up being the most expensive funfair ride this side of Walt Disney in Paris.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_222">The same mentality seems to be behind the idea to subsidise an air link between north and south Wales. We must remember that in January 2004, Air Wales actually axed a service between Liverpool and Cardiff. In 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 460</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>October, it axed a service between Cardiff and London&#151;not even 18 months after the service was first introduced. It is all very well giving the Welsh Assembly the powers to subsidise air routes that would otherwise not be available in and around Wales, but we should perhaps ask ourselves why those services would not otherwise be viable. The simple answer is that, although they might suit some Assembly Members and the growing army of civil servants, they would be effectively useless for the vast majority of Welsh travellers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_223">The link will fail because there has never really been the same demand in Wales to travel between north and south as there has been between east and west. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire spoke earlier about the history of Wales from the ice age, emphasising the difficulties of getting from north to south, but ever since Edward I took an interest in Wales, travel has been mainly from east to west. People in north Wales look towards Liverpool, just as those in Cardiff and Newport, where I come from, look towards Bristol and London. The M4 and the A55 were built to meet a demand that already existed, and the Assembly will not improve transport links by trying to service a demand that simply is not there.
</p>





<p><a name="st_199"><a name="50616-25_spnew2"><b> Albert Owen: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that there is no demand for transport between north and south, but I tried to explain earlier&#151;though I did not have the figures at my fingertips&#151;that about 150 people per day travel from north-west Wales to Cardiff on business by car. Surely that provides an initial demand that would stimulate developments. As well as people from the health service, members of the business community have to spend a great deal of time travelling by road or rail to Cardiff. The hon. Gentleman should not dismiss such people and should not make up stories about everyone going to Liverpool.
</p>





<p><a name="st_200"><a name="50616-25_spnew3"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 I was not suggesting that everyone goes to Liverpool, and I am not necessarily disputing the hon. Gentleman&#039;s figures, though it was interesting to hear him mention people in the health service, which is the public sector. To put that into context, we need to reflect not just on how many people travel from north to south&#151;of course, we know that people do that all the time&#151;but on how many travel from east to west every day. Only when those figures are properly established can we take a decision about whether there is a genuine demand for new transport services.
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="50616-25_spnew4"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 That is exactly why no one is recommending building a motorway from north to south Wales and exactly why a small-scale airline operation would be appropriate for business people and, indeed, the civil servants and others who need to make the journey. The hon. Gentleman keeps on making pariahs out of public servants who need to travel from north to south, but why should they not be allowed to travel quickly. We are not asking for an A380 Airbus, which the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) mentioned, but only for a little aircraft to meet a need. Why are the Conservatives so against having an effective, cheap and fairly environmentally friendly small-scale air service in Wales?
</p>





<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50616-25_spnew5"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 We are not. We are all in favour of having such a service, but we are not in favour of using 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>National Assembly money to subsidise it. If the demand were there, and if 150 people grew to 200, 300 or whatever, we could have a Boeing 747 taking them from north to south Wales every day. Good luck to whoever sets it up. Perhaps the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire could fly the planes, and Labour Members could put their money into buying shares. I do not know, but, after six years in the Welsh Assembly, I do know this. We receive a limited amount of money each year from Westminster, which must fund the health service, education and local authorities, all of which are having to raise their council taxes because not enough money is going in. Admittedly, some of the money is wasted on white elephants such as the new Welsh Assembly building, which was supported by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and his party. I agree that had some of that money been spent on a north-south air link, it would probably have been better spent. The fact is, however, that there is only a limited amount in the pot. We have no problem with the north-south Wales air link; our problem lies with the use of public money to subsidise it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_224">Let me return from those grandiose visions to what is important to most people: the Assembly&#039;s ability to deal with transport matters. I must say that its record has not been terribly good. People in my constituency are disappointed that the Assembly has thus far failed to sort out a wrangle between ELWa&#151;Education and Learning Wales&#151; and certain local authorities such as Monmouthshire over the funding of post-16 pupils&#039; school transport. As many Members will know, Monmouthshire county council received less per head than any other authority in Wales, which has forced it to make difficult decisions. One of those decisions concerns the funding of transport for post-16 pupils doing A-levels. The council has been forced to ask ELWa to fulfil its own obligations to fund post-16 education, and to pay for the school transport that is so necessary in a rural area. ELWa has so far refused to become involved, and the Welsh Assembly is not prepared to give a lead. As a result, pupils are being forced off the buses. If we pass the Bill, we should also ask the Minister to use whatever influence he has to persuade the Welsh Assembly to resolve the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_225">Let me end on a positive note. I have always opposed the idea of a Welsh Assembly. It is no irony that I was a Member of the Assembly, as most of my constituents were against the idea as well. I also believe that having been voted for&#151;albeit by a tiny minority&#151;the Assembly should be made to work as well as it can on behalf of everyone. Although I do not favour giving it any extra legislative powers, I think we should allow it make the best possible use of the powers that it has. Otherwise all of us in Wales, whether for or against the Assembly, will lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_226">I see in the Bill opportunities to allow the Assembly to make better use of its existing powers over transport issues. It must do so soon, because public transport throughout Wales is frankly abysmal. Not all of that is a result of Government policies&#151;some of it is owing to geographical and demographic factors&#151;but we should pay most attention to those living in rural areas who depend on public transport to get around and to travel to their jobs. They currently have no access to public transport, because the trains are not there and bus 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 462</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>services are so poor. They are forced to rely on their cars, although in some parts of Wales senior council officials have said that the roads are so badly maintained that some are in danger of reverting to cart tracks. That phrase was used by highways officer in one of the Welsh local authorities recently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_227">Those people&#039;s needs are not being met, because the transport system in Wales is failing at a basic level. Much more needs to be done. I do not believe that all the answers lie in the Bill, but I am prepared to view it with an open mind. Anything that will improve transport in Wales is a good thing. I recall the Deputy Prime Minister promising us an integrated transport policy for the whole United Kingdom, and I recall the Welsh Assembly saying something similar six years ago. There has been very little action so far, and I look to the Minister to reassure us that there will be action in the future.

 I too pay tribute to the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Peter Law) on his excellent maiden speech. He and I are old colleagues and friends from the National Assembly, and I know that although there is a certain amount of political distance between us, he will be an excellent constituency Member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_228">Clearly, one must applaud the aims of the Bill. After all, an integrated transport system is the holy grail that has eluded politicians over the generations, so I suppose that now is the time for Wales to pursue it. However, I must express concern as to what will be the counter-productive effects of the Bill in terms of local government. Since it was established, the National Assembly has shown itself to be an increasingly acquisitive, centralising institution. That was most recently exemplified by the absorption of the Wales Tourist Board, the Welsh Development Agency and Education and Learning Wales into the machinery of the Welsh Assembly Government so that they became, in effect, arms of government. That process continues in the Bill. It is an exercise by the Assembly in stripping local authorities of their functions in respect of local transport, but leaving them, and therefore local council taxpayers, with potentially most of the cost of any failure. That is all the more disturbing given that section 113 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 imposes a positive duty on the Assembly to sustain and promote local government in Wales. The Bill does not achieve that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">The truth is that the Bill is in many respects unnecessary in facilitating the delivery of efficient transport in Wales. Local authorities are already working collaboratively in respect of public transport. We heard earlier about SWWITCH&#151;the south-west Wales integrated transport consortium&#151;and the Minister will know about Taith in north Wales. Are the Government suggesting that Taith is somehow failing in achieving the outcome that the Assembly seeks. In what way will the proposed joint transport authorities improve the present arrangements respect of transport delivery?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">Clause 2 imposes an obligation on the Assembly to prepare a Wales transport strategy. However, the 1998 Act already empowers the Assembly to prepare such strategies as it wishes, and it can already require councillors to have regard to those strategies in

<a name="50616-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">I am concerned about the proposed composition of the joint transport authorities, for two principal reasons. First, although the Assembly must consult local authorities before making an order establishing a JTA, it will be at    liberty to ignore whatever representations those authorities make. Secondly, clause 4(4) provides that JTAs may include representatives of local authorities among their numbers, but contains no obligation on the Assembly to ensure that there is local authority representation on the    JTAs, much less to ensure that local authority representatives are in a majority for voting purposes. Those are matters that I shall wish to pursue at a later date.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">While the voice of local authorities is seriously undermined by the Bill, clause 5(10) contains worrying powers for the JTAs to impose levies on those authorities that will in due course be converted into council tax. No assurances have been given, in the Bill or otherwise, as to the resourcing of the JTAs. In that respect, I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin). It is unacceptable that council taxpayers may effectively be asked to pick up the tab for the failure of a JTA given that they may have no democratic representation on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) mentioned trunk roads in Wales. That is clearly the area where improvements are most desperately required. I remember the days when I travelled from north to south   Wales along the A470 with, frankly, horror. Unfortunately, I see little in the Bill that will improve the powers of the Assembly to pursue a trunk road building programme, which is where it should be concentrating most of its effort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_234">The subject of air travel has exercised many hon. Members today and, to mix metaphors, has been a hobbyhorse of the Secretary of State for some time. Perhaps I should say that it is a kite he has been flying. I well remember that before the 1999 Assembly elections he issued a strict injunction that the 13 Members of the Welsh Assembly from north Wales should be required to take an air service that would fly from Caernarfon via Hawarden to Cardiff to get them there safely, cheaply and quickly, as he put it. The problem was that the plane he was talking about could accommodate only nine passengers.

 It would be a useful avenue to explore, and if some economic benefit could be proved, Conservative Members would not oppose such investment.

I would, however, be prepared to support better links to   the important regional airports that serve my constituency and that of the hon.

 Indeed&#151;who knows?&#151;but the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire certainly demonstrated his wide knowledge of the subject and his considerable grasp of detail. He gave rise to an interesting debate on the question of a north-south air service, but there seems to be a slight dichotomy here. It could, as he suggests, be a small, discrete, boutique service, conveying just a handful of people daily. If so, it would by definition have a minimal impact on carbon emissions, and would give little cause for concern to those of us who are worried about the environmental impact. On the other hand, such a service could, as the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n seemed to suggest, make a useful contribution to easing congestion on Wales&#039;s ever-more crowded roads. But it cannot be both: it cannot be a lightweight service and also reduce congestion, so its advocates have to decide which it will be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_242">We are certainly not implacably opposed to such an air service, but we are worried about the Government&#039;s promoting and subsidising air travel at a time when we are urging them to be more responsible about the growth in aviation, given aviation&#039;s huge impact on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and its unchecked contribution to global warming. We recognise that such a service could well play a significant role, but we are extremely sceptical about anything that could prove to be a long-term drain on public funds.

<a name="stpa_244">My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) made a terrific speech. He is clearly going to be a champion in this House of small business and economic regeneration. He said quite rightly that he was extremely worried that the voice of business&#151;especially small businesses&#151;was being lost in the debate about transport in Wales. He asked why the private sector was not an equal stakeholder in the debate, alongside the public sector. I hope that when the Minister winds up the debate he will address that point and reassure the House that the Government are listening carefully to the business voice in Wales. That is important, because the Bill appears to be very much focused on the public sector and public servants.

Friend threw his weight behind those who are keen to expand air travel, although he cautioned against subsidy&#151;perhaps he had his business hat on again. That warning should be heeded, given that successive Governments have tried to pick winners in this sector and ended up subsidising lame ducks. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire pointed out, there is a fundamental difference between Governments providing seedcorn capital and pump-priming a new idea, and getting involved in a project that turns out to be a long-term burden on the taxpayer.

I hope that as a result of his shedding light on those problems, something will actually be done. My hon.

He warned of the possibility of significant impacts on the council tax as a result of proposals in the Bill. As he rightly pointed out, there is no democratic representation on the joint transport authorities to check their spending, and council tax payers could find themselves landed with a large bill over which they have had no say. He brought a similar common-sense approach to the issue of air transport.

We are concerned that the Bill, although it appears to be a devolving Bill, will not bring government closer to people, but will take power from local communities&#151;from county councils and local authorities&#151;that are already operating effectively and pass them up to the National Assembly and, worse still, to unelected quangos.

<a name="stpa_254">Thirdly, the Bill would empower the Welsh Assembly to subsidise to the tune of &#163;1.5 million the Swansea-Cardiff-Anglesey intra-air route. Will that really provide value for taxpayers&#039; money and will it provide a useful, environmentally sustainable transport scheme?

The European Union is also examining the matter very closely in terms of competition matters. If the Assembly makes a case to subsidise a particular route or series of routes, full regulatory impact assessments will take place. Although Members have generally supported the possible extension or development of subsidised air routes in Wales, they were concerned that they would prove to be a bottomless pit into which we would pour money. The process will ensure that that will not happen. A strong, coherent case will have to be put forward.

He is a great champion of the port of Holyhead and the services that run from there. Cruise ships are now using the port, which brings tourists to the area, who are spending money in his constituency and other parts of Wales. Ports and sea transport are not covered by the Bill because they are reserved matters and thus the responsibility of the Department for Transport. However, the Assembly will clearly recognise the importance of ports and sea transport to the economy of Wales, so I am sure that it will take that fact into account when developing the overall strategy.

As I said, although the provision is in the Bill, it does not mean that we move from the voluntary consortiums to the JTAs. The performance of the voluntary consortiums will be judged, a decision will be taken by the Assembly, and it may move to a JTA, but it is not a requirement.

He also mentioned access to Cardiff airport. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) has regularly raised that in the Chamber. The new rail service is being launched this weekend, I think. City airport in London has a similar problem because the dockland light railway is not next door to the terminal and a link has to be provided by road transport. That situation is repeated at Cardiff airport railway station.

The idea of the Bill is to get them working together in a more integrated way. They have the representation to ensure that they would have a majority on any JTA if and when it were formed.

We need to raise our game not only to keep up with the pace of change, but to make real advances. In order to respond to that challenge and to start to deliver the Assembly&#039;s vision for integrated transport, we have to ensure that the Assembly has the right tools to do the job. In the past, the Assembly&#039;s limited and fragmentary transport powers have restricted its ability to take forward its strategic transport agenda. The Bill gives the Assembly the powers that it needs to meet that challenge. I urge the House to support the Bill.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">The background to the direction will be familiar to hon. Members. The matters to which it relates have been debated here on a number of occasions. I therefore intend to be brief, but it may be helpful to the House and to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, if I summarise the key events before turning to the substance of the direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">The direction follows the Independent Monitoring Commission&#039;s fourth report, laid in Parliament and published on 10 February, which covered the Northern bank robbery and other crimes that it attributed to the Provisional IRA. The IMC&#039;s report, at paragraph 14, said that Sinn Fein must bear its responsibility for the incidents to which it referred, and it recommended that the Secretary of State consider exercising the powers that he has in the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly to impose financial measures on Sinn Fein.

<a name="stpa_283">The House will recall that the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), made a statement in the House on 11 January, in the immediate aftermath of the Northern bank robbery. That statement set out the impact of the robbery on the political process and its damaging effect on the Government&#039;s efforts to restore the devolved institutions. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend for his work as Secretary of State in support of the Northern Ireland Office during his time in office. I worked with him previously as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Welsh Office, and I know his integrity and commitment to the job.

<a name="stpa_284">My right hon. Friend made a further statement on 22 February after the publication of the IMC report. He said that having reflected on the IMC report, he had concluded that it would be appropriate to make a direction to remove Sinn Fein&#039;s entitlement to financial assistance and that the direction would be for 12 months, the maximum period permitted under the legislation. As required, he would take into account any representations made by Sinn Fein before reaching a final decision. Having provided Sinn Fein with an opportunity to make representations, my right hon. Friend decided that it would be appropriate to make a direction, and he did so on 1 April. A further debate took place in this House on 10 March on the separate matter of the suspension of Sinn Fein&#039;s entitlement to Westminster allowances for 12 months.

<br>&nbsp;<br>12 months from 29 April 2005. It is the second direction against Sinn Fein, because a similar financial penalty was imposed from 29 April 2004 to 28 April 2005 following the IMC&#039;s first report in April 2004. That report attributed an attempted abduction to the Provisional IRA, and the IMC recommended that financial measures be imposed on Sinn Fein.

<a name="stpa_286">In the various debates that I have mentioned, there was general support for action against Sinn Fein. The need for the direction reflects the problems&#151;ongoing paramilitary activity and criminality&#151;that have blighted the political process in Northern Ireland, and both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have made it clear that that must stop in order for progress to be made.

<a name="stpa_287">It gives me no pleasure to have to bring this matter before the House.

On the assumption that such movement occurs, the IMC will continue to play an important role in attesting that the reality matches the Provisional IRA&#039;s commitments. Moreover, it has a responsibility in relation to all paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland from whatever source.

 I thank the Minister for setting out the background to the motion, which, as he has made clear, extends the financial penalties against Sinn Fein at Stormont for a further 12 months by giving effect to the direction signed by the former Secretary of State on 1 April this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_289">As the Minister said, the IMC reports on the relationship between Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA provide the background to the debate and the continuing involvement of that republican organisation in crime and paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. It is worth reminding ourselves of the first IMC report published in 2004, which made plain what the members of the IMC considered to be the relationship between the two parts of the republican movement. In respect of the leadership of Sinn Fein, it stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;Some members, including some senior members, of Sinn Fein are also members, including, in some cases, senior members of PIRA&quot;.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">Since last April, a further four IMC reports have been published.

It repeated the point that had the Northern Ireland Assembly been

 Does the hon. Gentleman remember that the Chief Constable recently reported that, short of killing members of the security forces, the Provisional IRA was engaged in all the other forms of paramilitary and terrorist activity? That adds further weight to his comments about the IMC report.
</p>





<p><a name="st_226"><a name="50616-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_292">The IMC&#039;s views have been supported not only by the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland but the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana. The most recent report, which was published in May and to which the Minister referred, concluded that the Provisional IRA continues to carry out paramilitary and criminal activity and that it is still recruiting, training and gathering intelligence.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_296">The Conservative party therefore has no hesitation in supporting the motion.

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_297">The debate takes place against a backdrop of intense speculation about the IRA&#039;s response to the speech made in April by Gerry Adams. The debate and the IMC reports on which the measure rests are a salutary reminder of how far the IRA has to go. If there is to be progress towards an inclusive Executive, the IRA response must be clear and unambiguous, not only in words but in deeds. There can be no further room for fudge or ambiguity. If there is ambiguity, I fear that the blunt truth is that there will be no agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_298">There needs to be an end to all forms of criminal and paramilitary activity. There has to be complete decommissioning and republicans must accept the legitimacy of the police and the criminal justice system and support those institutions rather than try to undermine them.

<a name="50616-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_299">The IRA must be disbanded as an effective paramilitary organisation. That will need to be transparent, and effectively and independently verified. I realise that the Government do not feel comfortable with the word &quot;disbandment&quot;, although I note that the Minister for Justice in the Republic of Ireland is a bit less shy of using the term. Ultimately, the process must be about that.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_300">I want to probe the Government on a final point. If, when the IRA statement is made, they believe that it and the IRA&#039;s subsequent actions amount to sufficient evidence that the organisation has gone out of business, surely their logic would lead them to ask whether that was also a sufficient basis for de-proscribing the Provisional IRA as an illegal organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. The logic would be that if the Provisional IRA had ceased to be a terrorist organisation, the need for it to be illegal would no longer exist. Conversely, if the IRA had not done enough to merit de-proscription, how could it have done enough to merit inclusion in a devolved Executive? It would be very strange to have Ministers in government inextricably linked to an organisation that Governments in London and Dublin believed had to remain illegal even though it had moved into what has been termed a new mode.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_301">We genuinely wish the Government well in their efforts to secure a comprehensive agreement and restore devolved government to Northern Ireland, but inclusivity can be based only on all parties accepting the same standards of democracy.

<a name="50616-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_303">Looking back, I remind the House that I was frustrated and somewhat annoyed when we were told to take on trust the fact that the IRA had conducted the Northern bank robbery, but subsequently it has become quite clear from the comments of the Independent Monitoring Commission and others that the IRA seems to be responsible for that robbery. In addition, the murder of Robert McCartney has caused the most recent crisis in the peace process. Only further action from paramilitaries can help to move the process forward again by positively demonstrating that they are committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. While we generally think of the IRA in that context, it obviously applies to all paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.

<a name="50616-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_304">As the House will recall, I raised an interesting proposal from the Alliance party on 10 benchmarks, which might be helpful in measuring more objectively the distance the paramilitaries have come.

<a name="50616-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_305">I suggest to the House that the 10 points are worthy of brief consideration, and the Alliance party says that they should be used to assess the sincerity with which the principles of the peace process are being adhered to. First, paramilitaries must declare an end to all involvement in any paramilitary and criminal activity, and through exclusively lawful means ensure that their activists desist immediately. Secondly, where individual republicans are involved in paramilitary or criminal activity, others must pass on any information to the lawful authorities and urge others to do likewise. The IRA must accept that obstruction of justice is a crime.

<a name="stpa_306">Thirdly, the republican movement must accept the full legitimacy of both the northern and southern states with respect to policing and criminal justice, including definitions of what constitutes a crime. Fourthly, all IRA front organisations and organised crime networks must be dismantled.

<a name="50616-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_307">Fifthly, the IRA army council must end all recruitment, training and intelligence gathering, and stand down all its rank and file members. Once that is carried out and weapons are decommissioned, the organisation, including all command structures, must disband. Sixthly, the republican movement must renounce the right to engage in    community policing or what is termed &quot;internal housekeeping&quot;. There must be an end to all paramilitary beatings and shootings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_308">Seventhly, the practice of exiling both inside and outside Northern Ireland must come to an end. Crucially, assurances must be given to those exiled that they can return to Northern Ireland in safety. Those assurances must be carried through. Eighthly, all illegally held weapons and explosives must be decommissioned under the aegis of the Decommissioning Commission. Ninthly, republicans must co-operate fully with the commission for the disappeared and both police services in recovering the remains of the disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_309">Finally, republicans must give a commitment not to export their terrorist techniques and expertise to other organisations internationally, either through direct training or other consultancy services, in line with the Terrorism Act 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_310">I accept that there will be different views about those 10 points. I hope, however, that the Minister can indicate that he recognises the benefit of having objective measures that consider not just the front-line violence that characterised the troubles for so long but the underlying and ongoing violence about which anybody involved in matters relating to the Province knows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_311">In that context, I counsel the Minister not to allow a recurring error in dealings with the IRA to happen again. On several occasions, it seems to me that unilateral deals have been done with paramilitaries, excluding the pro-agreement parties. Understandably, that has been frustrating for those parties that have consistently shown commitment and good faith in the process. It would be extremely unhelpful if, following some sort of statement from the IRA, it looks once again as if the Government have decided to do a back-door deal without involving all the other parties involved in the peace process. Will the Minister assure me that he will not allow that to happen again?

Until a significant change occurs on the part of the paramilitaries, and particularly the IRA, and especially with regard to the underlying violence that continues in the Province, we must recognise that these financial sanctions need to be in place. I am pleased and find it helpful that Sinn Fein has a small staffing presence on the premises, which I find useful in terms of understanding their thinking and what is going on. That is a separate matter, however, and for now I feel that the Liberal Democrats are obliged to support what is a regrettable necessity.

However, the problem is that the Government have never made it clear that the train will leave the platform without them. I issue a solemn warning to the Government, as I did personally and brutally frankly to the Taoiseach yesterday: if the Taoiseach and Mr. Blair try to make something out of an IRA statement that is not in it and if the statement is not followed with immediate action to prove its veracity, the situation will be even worse because people will say that the Governments are not prepared to stop this and that they are with those men and their activities.

<a name="stpa_333">The Government attempted to bring the republican movement along by bringing it in to the political fold. They hoped that they could wean republicans off violence and criminality and that republicans would be so grateful that they would become new-born democrats. The reality, of course, has been very different: they have come into the fold, but they have brought their bad habits with them. They have not given up their past. They hold on to their weapons, continue with paramilitary activity, and still have the largest criminal empire in the whole of these islands. Those are the facts and to this date, nothing in connection with that behaviour has changed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_334">The IMC&#039;s 5th report makes it clear that the Provisional IRA is an active paramilitary organisation, that it is still engaged in all types of paramilitary and criminal activity, and that it has a high state of readiness for paramilitary action. It is in the light of that reality that the Government must look not just at this issue, but at a series of issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_335">During the House&#039;s original debate on this issue, we argued that if the Government were serious in wanting to impose a penalty on Sinn Fein, they would have to consider a meaningful one. I find it difficult to think of any penalty that will have less impact on the republican movement than a fine of &#163;100,000 or so. In just the past six months, this organisation has carried out a bank robbery, driving off with &#163;26.5 million. It engages in ongoing racketeering, fuel smuggling and the sale of all manner of counterfeit goods. It has its operations along the border. It intimidates developers and builders, who have to pay it regularly. All that has gone on consistently. When I was a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, we gauged that some &#163;10 million a year was probably coming in from such activity. These republicans also license drug dealers, whom they permit to sell drugs in their area, and they punish savagely those dealers who do not pay them for the right to sell drugs in their area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_336">So we are talking about organised crime of a type that we have never seen before in the United Kingdom. It is major business, and the Government&#039;s hope and expectation is that the lure of government places in a Northern Ireland Assembly might be sufficient to wean the republican movement away from this major business. Anybody who looked at what happened last December should have learned a lesson. Last December, we were negotiating with Her Majesty&#039;s Government, and having talks with the Government of the Irish Republic on matters pertaining to the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Moreover, meetings were taking place principally between Sinn Fein and the Government of the Irish Republic, but also Her Majesty&#039;s Government.

While they talked to Ministers about ending criminality, they were considering the details of their next criminal exploit. Does that not indicate something of the mindset of the organisation with which we are

It indicates clearly that these people&#039;s hope, expectation and intention&#151;whatever the wording used on that occasion&#151;was to give up certain elements of their paramilitary activity, but not those which allow them to keep control of their areas. A knee-capping here, an exiling there&#151;they still want to be able to carry out such activities, to keep their rule imposed on the people in the Catholic enclaves. The one thing that they will never give up is their criminality.

<p>
<a name="50616-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_338">The republicans do not consider themselves to be involved in criminality, as we know. According to their theology, they are the legitimate Government. As the Assembly Member for Foyle said, activities carried out in the name of that Government are legitimate, not criminal. To take one specific case, the McConville murder was therefore not considered to be a criminal event. The republican organisation feels that it has the legal authority to rule on the whole of the island of Ireland, and that everything that it does is therefore legitimate.

No action has ever been taken against them under the law.

Conveniently, during the rest of the election campaign we were told that that was a powerful statement made by the president of Sinn Fein, that we should all warm to him as a result of it, that it had great promise and that there was cause for hope. The election, of course, is out of the way. A statement from the IRA responding to Mr. Adams&#039;s remarks has still not been made.

We were all supposed to be convinced that the IRA had done something of real import on the basis of that report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">If people are to be convinced, they need to have all of the weapons completely destroyed. They need it to be done in a way that is obviously, from the point of view of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, done in a verifiable way, but we need a transparency that we have not had to date&#151;a transparency that we have argued must include the presence of witnesses and the existence of photographs to show every stage of that operation. That is an essential component if the IRA wants to convince people that it has turned over a new leaf and that the weapons are gone for good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">People talk about the requirement to get the IRA quickly into government, as we heard yesterday; they say that there should be no vacuum. However, there must be an absolute requirement that nothing must happen until people are convinced that the republican movement has changed. It must change by handing over its weapons to be destroyed in a way that convinces people. Unless it does so, it will take longer for people to be convinced, and it should be clearly warned about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">The second issue is paramilitary activity. Even as we speak, the IRA&#039;s paramilitary structures continue. The IMC report refers to the training that is still going on; young people are being trained in the use of firearms in what we are told is a peacetime situation. The report states that there have been new discoveries of ammunition, which indicates that new weaponry has been brought into the Province&#151;hardly the action of an organisation that has moved into a new mode of entirely and exclusively peaceful means. Obviously, the IRA must end the exiling of people from Northern Ireland and the targeting of members of the security forces and key people in Northern Ireland. The requirement is that it should dismantle and disband its whole organisation. That is what will be needed to convince people in Northern Ireland that the IRA has gone, and gone for good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_352">The third issue is criminality. When we met the IMC, its members made it clear that they would need six months to assess properly whether criminality had come to an end. It is essential that the IMC is given all the time it needs so that it can report that its work is at an end and criminality is a thing of the past. However, we shall not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>use only the IMC as our judge as to whether that has happened; the people whom we represent are better placed to tell us about the activities of republicans locally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_353">In conclusion, although we shall support the measure, we believe that it is inadequate and less effective than it could be. If the Government want progress in Northern Ireland, the real way to do it is not to try to bring Sinn Fein along by enticements and concessions, but for everybody else to move on and force Sinn Fein to catch up. The surest way to get movement from the republican movement is to show its members that they no longer have a veto and that they cannot hold back the process of democracy in Northern Ireland. When the rest of the democratic world moves on, Sinn Fein will have to follow and it will do so on the terms of the democratic world, rather than the democratic world making concessions to bring Sinn Fein on board.

There were some people who said that we could not do it, that the electorate would turn against me for stealing their votes, but the electorate gave their response.

That is important when we are considering the issues before the House.

: Is that not disgusting given that the Justice Minister of a foreign jurisdiction acknowledges that two of the leading members of that terrorist organisation, Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, are members of the army council? Instead of parading them in and out of Downing street, surely justice demands that they be paraded before a court and found guilty of crimes.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I am delighted to see him back in the House again representing South Antrim. I wish him many years in that position. He is absolutely right. It is absurd that two Members of this House refuse to take their seats. They are Members of Parliament and Members of the Assembly, but also senior members of the IRA army council. They are feted by this Government and the Irish Government as some kind of statesmen. The Irish Prime Minister tells us that he has met them on five occasions in recent times to discuss the political process in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_360">Negotiations seemed to be going on during the election. The Prime Minister&#039;s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, flew into Belfast to hold secret talks with the leadership of Sinn Fein-IRA. However, all the time my party, which represents the majority in Northern Ireland and is the largest political party in Northern Ireland, is constantly told that it cannot put forward a democratic way of moving the political process ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_361">The issue was last debated in the House on 22 February, when the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), said that suggestions had been made in some quarters that the Assembly should be restored and that if it failed to take action to exclude Sinn Fein, he should take action himself using the powers available to him to do that. It is in the gift of the Government to deal with the issue and move the political process forward in Northern Ireland, so I simply ask why they are not doing so.

 I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that there can be no fudging whatsoever on the whole decommissioning issue. Will he join me in condemning the targeting and intimidation of members of the Royal Irish Regiment and their families, and of members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and their families? Not a month goes past in my constituency without members of the security forces, along with their families, being intimidated. Their children cannot go into shops, or go to school in different areas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_244"><a name="50616-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)&#151;it has been a while since I have been able to make that particular comment. He is of course absolutely right. During Northern Ireland questions yesterday I raised the way in which the Royal Irish Regiment Home Service battalions are being treated. There is uncertainty about their future and their morale is low. They are being kept in the dark, yet at the same time their members are targeted and their members&#039; families are intimidated. I understand the difficulties involved in thinking ahead about the future deployment of the regiment and the Home Service battalions, but will the Minister understand at a human level the difficulty of the situation for the soldiers and their families because uncertainty surrounds them, yet they still face threats and intimidation? At the same time, they watch the political process and see how the people responsible for such threats and intimidation continue to be treated as though they are democrats.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_362">It is time to remove the veto that the IRA has over the political process. I am told that the statement we were promised will be delayed until perhaps August&#151;when the parade season has ended. There is a desire to see how the summer goes before the statement is made, so we will have yet further weeks and months of delay and procrastination. Why does one have to delay to become a democrat? One either is a democrat, or one is not, but on the basis of the IMC report, Sinn Fein-IRA clearly are not democratic in their entirety or committed to exclusively peaceful means. I tell the Minister that the Secretary of State should take the initiative. He should recall the Assembly. The Assembly should then move to exclude Sinn Fein, but if it is not excluded, he should use his powers to do that. The Social Democrat and Labour party is absent from the House today, and also absent is its courage to step forward and enter a voluntary coalition with the rest of the democratic parties. Perhaps it is time to put things up to that party as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_363">I want to touch on two other issues on the subject of the financial sanctions, which the Minister has announced will be continued. Between 1999 and 2004, some &#163;14 million was given to ex-prisoners&#039; groups in Northern Ireland through funding for various projects. Now that is a lot of money. The majority of it has gone to republican ex-prisoners groups. I could list those, but I am afraid that my grasp of the Irish language would fail me. Suffice it to say, we are talking about a great deal of public money going into ex-prisoners groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_364">Contrast that with the treatment of some of the victims groups. Families Acting for Innocent Relatives is based in south Armagh. It received a letter yesterday from the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister saying that its application for peace and reconciliation funding for its memorial centre in south Armagh had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 491</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been rejected. FAIR was looking for &#163;200,000 of capital funding for the purchase of that centre, which provides valuable support to the victims of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_365">South Armagh has been described as bandit country. It was a hotbed of IRA activity. Many people were murdered there. I think of atrocities such as Kingsmill, where 10 Protestant workers were lined up against a minibus and shot down in cold blood, and the attacks on Tullyvallen Orange hall and Darkley gospel hall. I could go on. There is a litany of atrocities carried out by the IRA in south Armagh. FAIR is a victims group, representing a large number of those victims and their families. It applied for &#163;200,000 of capital funding for a project for a memorial centre and it was turned down. Yet &#163;14 million has gone to ex-prisoners groups since 1999. Surely there is an inequity that the Government need to consider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_366">If the Government are in the business of applying financial sanctions and are not prepared to fund the victims, they should have the decency to cut off the funding to the ex-prisoners groups. When we consider some of the activities covered by the IMC report, we find that the people on the front line of those riotous situations who order the beatings and shootings are often the people who were released from prison and who are benefiting from the funding from the ex-prisoners groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_367">My final point is on released prisoners and sanctions. When the Government included in the Belfast agreement the provision for the early release of terrorist prisoners in Northern Ireland, it was an emotive issue. We deeply opposed it. Provisions were built into the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 which enabled the Sentence Review Commission, established by the Act, to review the release of any prisoner who was deemed to represent a threat to public safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_368">The Minister may be aware of the recent situation involving one of those released prisoners, Sean Kelly&#151;the infamous Shankill bomber&#151;who, along with his accomplice Thomas Begley, murdered nine innocent people on the Shankill road. When Kelly was imprisoned, the judge said that he should spend the rest of his life in prison. He was convicted of nine murders and given nine life sentences, but he was released after just seven years in prison under the terms of the Belfast agreement. That is less than one year in prison for each life Kelly destroyed. Yet on three occasions, he has been pictured in the Ardoyne at a riotous situation. I am not going to go into the detail of what Kelly may or may not have been doing. I simply pose the question to the Minister: has the Secretary of State, using his statutory power, referred the case of Sean Kelly to the Sentence Review Commission?
</p>





<p><a name="st_245"><a name="50616-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dodds </b> 
: The Ardoyne is in my constituency. My hon. Friend is right to make the valid and correct point about that infamous IRA killer, who only two weeks ago was pictured in the front line of a riot when attacks were made on Protestant homes in the Twaddell avenue area. It is essential that the Minister addresses that as a matter of urgency and provides reassurance to my constituents in particular.
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="50616-34_spnew5"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>constituents in north Belfast, particularly on the Shankill road, about the manner in which Kelly continues to be present at riotous situations while the Government turn a blind eye.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_369">I contrast that with the case of Ken Barrett, who was recently convicted with the murder of the solicitor Pat Finucane. Barrett is alleged to have been one of the Ulster Defence Association team that murdered Pat Finucane&#151;the Ulster Freedom Fighters team. Recently, Barrett applied for early release under the terms of the Belfast agreement, as his crime had been committed before 10 April 1998. He was therefore eligible to apply for early release. His application was rejected by the Sentence Review Commission on the basis that he was a danger to the public. I simply pose to the Minister, and through him to the Secretary of State, this question: how is Ken Barrett more of a danger to the public than Sean Kelly? I think that we are entitled to an honest answer to that question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_370">I am not here today arguing for the release of any prisoner: let me make that absolutely clear. It is the double standards that are the issue. If somebody murders nine Protestants on the Shankill road, they walk free; if somebody murders a Roman Catholic solicitor in Belfast, they stay in prison. Is Pat Finucane&#039;s life worth more than that of one of the children whom Sean Kelly murdered in that fish shop on the Shankill road? I do not think that the people of the Shankill would accept that the life of one of those children whom he murdered is any less valuable than that of Pat Finucane, so why do the Government act as they do, through the Sentence Review Commission, which is supposed to be independent? We just wonder why it happens to be that the people who are returned to prison or stay there happen to be those who murdered republicans, and that those who murdered Protestants are those who are set free&#151;and when they are free, they seem to be able to engage in whatever activity they wish, without any sanction. I hope that the Minister will address those issues.

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="50616-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Paul Goodman  (Wycombe) (Con):</b> 
 I am extremely grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate, in which I want to tell the story to date of my constituent, Helen Wilkinson, and her medical records.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_384">The story raises profound issues in relation to civil liberties, especially privacy and confidentiality. Before I tell it, I want to set out for hon. Members&#039; benefit only one of the possibilities that it raises. I want hon. Members or anyone who reads the debate to imagine that they have a medical problem, such as a sexual dysfunction problem. The person concerned goes to see a doctor, who enters notes about the problem on his or her computer. The problem is successfully treated. Years later, a senior receptionist at another practice meets the recovered patient socially. The receptionist thinks, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t mind finding out a bit more about this person.&quot; The next day, the receptionist&#151;unethically and illegally&#151;accesses the recovered patient&#039;s doctor&#039;s notes, which are held on a national NHS computer database and ferrets out private and confidential details, to whatever end, without, of course, the recovered patient knowing anything about the breach of privacy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_385">I could suggest myriad other disturbing possibilities that the story of Helen Wilkinson raises. I sketched out one simply to give a flavour of them. Without further ado, I shall tell Helen&#039;s story so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_386">Helen works as a national health service practice manager. Indeed, she has worked in the NHS for some 20 years. So when it comes to the NHS, NHS offices, staff, patients and records, it can fairly be said that she knows what she is talking about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_387">Some time ago, Helen discovered that the University College London Hospitals trust had sent computer records of every hospital medical treatment that she had ever received to a private company, McKesson, which holds a mass of NHS records. Those records are then passed on, as Helen&#039;s were, to computer systems used by the NHS. Helen&#039;s records thus became available to several NHS bodies, such as the Thames Valley strategic health authority, Wycombe primary care trust and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_388">Helen asked to see her records under the Data Protection Act 1998, as she is fully entitled to do, and she discovered when she examined them that there was a serious mistake in them. She was effectively and, I repeat, mistakenly, registered as an alcoholic. Helen resolved, given her anger about the mistake, her concern about the many people who have access to even the correct parts of her record, and her anxiety about the even larger number who might well have access to it as the NHS computerisation programme proceeds, that she wanted her records removed from NHS systems altogether.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_389">It is important to explain that, as matters stand, NHS patients have the right to object to data about them being held in a form that identifies them, but only when that causes or is likely to cause substantial or unwarranted damage or distress. It is not clear, if those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>data are held by a number of NHS bodies, as Helen&#039;s are, who decides whether damage or distress is caused or is likely to be caused.

</p>





<p><a name="st_255"><a name="50616-36_spnew0"><b> Mr. Goodman: </b> 
 I asked the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness to grant Helen&#039;s request. I received a reply from him dated 5 November that explained:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;The removal of patients from the systems that Ms Wilkinson has identified is neither simple nor straightforward&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_391">It added that the ethics advisory group of the Care Records Development Board was considering the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_392">Helen then took a drastic decision, but the only proper decision that she believed was open to her. She decided to withdraw from the NHS as a patient altogether so that her records&#151;including, of course, the mistaken registration of her as an alcoholic&#151;could be removed from NHS computer systems. So, in summary, my constituent argues that she has had to withdraw from the NHS to protect her privacy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_393">I want to ask the Minister some questions that relate   specifically to my constituent. On the &quot;Today&quot; programme earlier this year, her predecessor, the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, said in relation to my constituent:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;It must be possible to correct this&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_394">namely, the mistake in Helen&#039;s records. That Minister went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;There is not a problem here.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_395">So, may I ask this Minister whether it would have been possible to correct the mistake, considering the large number of NHS bodies to which the mistaken information was distributed, as so many different bodies held it?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_396">The then Minister also said on the same programme:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;Mrs. Wilkinson does not have to have a national care record if she does not want one.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_397">May I ask this Minister whether that is correct? How can it be correct when a patient has the right to have such records removed only when they are judged to be causing, or to be likely to cause, that patient substantial and unwarranted damage or distress?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_398">In a further letter to me dated 5 May, the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;I have directed officials to ensure that her data&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<a name="stpa_399">that is, Helen&#039;s data&#151;

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;is removed from those systems for which the Department of Health is legally responsible as data controller&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_400">May I ask the Minister whether that has happened yet? If not, by what date will it happen?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_401">The former Minister wrote to me in a letter dated 30 November:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;While your constituent may have opted not to seek NHS care, NHS services have not been withheld&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_402">On that point, can this Minister clarify what would happen were my constituent to be, for example, taken suddenly into hospital? Would any notes made go into NHS computer systems? If so, would my constituent have to leave the NHS, so to speak, all over again to get any new records removed from those systems&#151;not that she would have taken any decision to re-enter the NHS in the first place?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_403">I want to discuss some wider issues raised by Helen&#039;s story, which I tried to illustrate at the start of my speech. I said that Helen&#039;s story raises profound issues in relation to civil liberties&#151;in particular, privacy and confidentiality. It does so partly because her evolving story is bound up with the evolving story of the NHS computerisation programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_404">Helen&#039;s records, like those of others, are held partly on paper and partly on computer. Obviously, not all NHS staff throughout Britain have access to the paper records and not all NHS bodies nationwide have access by means of their computer systems to the computer systems of other NHS bodies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_405">That situation will gradually change. As I understand it, the last seven years-worth of records held on the NHS-wide clearing service, or NWCS, which is a hospital computer system, and records held on GP computer systems will eventually end up on the NHS care record service, or NCRS, into which information from NHS Direct will also flow. At this point, it is important to grasp that the Care Records Development Board, to which I referred earlier, is recommending that patients should, in future, as the fully functioning NCRS comes on-stream, not be able to opt out of having a national care record. That is indeed a potential challenge to privacy and confidentiality, with serious civil liberties implications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_406">Other NHS patients will be as concerned as Helen&#151;some media discussion on the matter has already occurred&#151;about the confidentiality of their records, if those records end up on a national system that a large number of NHS bodies and individuals, including social workers for example, can access. After all, those records will hold data set down by nurses, health visitors, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, laboratory staff, sexually transmitted disease and addiction workers, ambulance crews and so forth. It is a long list. Those records will contain information about such sensitive matters as sexuality, ethnicity, genetics, mental health, intellectual impairment, illicit drug use, imprisonment, abortion, contraception, impotence, paternity, infertility, HIV, personal relationships, domestic violence, rape and abuse in childhood&#151;again, a long list.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_407">The right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness set out in his letter to me, dated 4 May, apparent safeguards, which will, in future, he claimed, protect patient privacy and confidentiality. He set those out under certain headings such as legitimate relationships, role-based access control, the patient&#039;s sealed envelope, opting out of information sharing, stop noting, and so on. I do not have time, and perhaps it is not my function, to explain to the House what those safeguards are in detail, but I would like to ask the Minister some 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 498</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>questions about them, and perhaps if she does not have time to answer all of them tonight, she might indicate that she would be willing to write to me in due course.

 I see the Minister nodding, which indicates that she will write to me if she has to do so.

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para17">
<a name="stpa_408">Will there be the computer facility to withhold part of an individual&#039;s record from NCRS, as I have seen it argued that there will be no such facility? What trials, if any, of the envelope software in clinical settings have taken place, and what did they find? In his letter to me, the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said that in certain circumstances, health professionals will be able to break the envelope seal. He wrote that

<a name="stpa_409">Who, therefore, will decide whether the patient is notified, and how?

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para20">
<a name="stpa_411">Under what circumstances precisely can they do so? Is my constituent correct in asserting to me that third parties will be able to access a patient&#039;s data without that patient having the right to know whether third parties have accessed their data and whom those third parties were? The story that I sketched out at the beginning was an illustration of the claim that my constituent has made to me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para21">
<a name="stpa_412">What assessment will the Department make of the effect on the nation&#039;s health of significant numbers of people, potentially, withholding important information from their doctors or from other health professionals because of concerns about confidentiality? What assessment will it make of the possibility of hackers altering data held on the NCRS and falsifying medical or other records? Will the NCRS and the proposed identity cards database be linked and, if so, under what circumstances is it proposed that the police or other agencies will have access to the records held on NCRS? Finally, what assessment of the clinical need for an NCRS has the Department made?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para22">
<a name="stpa_413">In conclusion, I recognise that serious issues about patient confidentiality and privacy arise under the current part-computer, part-pen-and-ink system, so the concerns that I raise are not entirely new. I acknowledge that a national computer system might, in some circumstances, help treat patients quickly who would otherwise not be treated so quickly. I realise that Governments of any colour have a difficult task in striking the right balance between, say, developing patient treatment on the one hand and protecting patient privacy on the other. Above all, I concede that new technology itself throws up new challenges to confidentiality and privacy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-36_para23">
<a name="stpa_414">I remain concerned that there are, in respect of NCRS and as my hon. Friend the shadow health Secretary said, &quot;serious unresolved issues&quot; on patient confidentiality. I have tried to raise some of those issues in the context of the story, which is still unfolding, of my constituent, Helen Wilkinson.

<p><a name="st_258"><a name="50616-37_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Caroline Flint): </b> 
 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) on securing the Adjournment debate today. His purpose has been to do what he can, quite properly as a constituency Member, to voice the legitimate concerns of his constituent. I fully understand those concerns. In many areas of life&#151;whether in relation to banking, criminal or health records, for example&#151;there is a requirement on the Government and the agencies with which they work to ensure that they maintain public confidence in the development of new technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_415">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that the best intentions lie behind these new developments. We want to ensure that people can get the best possible health care, and it is important to recognise that health care can be offered in a number of different environments, which involve different sorts of health professionals in both primary and secondary care. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that our intentions are right, but that there is an important task for us all in ensuring that we have the public&#039;s confidence in what we are trying to develop.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_416">I want to put on record my sympathy, which I am sure is shared by everyone who has heard about the distress experienced by Ms Wilkinson, for her distress at finding an embarrassing error in the record of her NHS treatment. I am very pleased to be able to confirm that that error has now been expunged and that we have respected Ms Wilkinson&#039;s further request that all her patient data be removed from the existing national database, although we have certain reservations about the consequences of doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_417">We recognise that there will be some people&#151;Ms Wilkinson is, I think, the first, but no doubt there will be others&#151;who feel so strongly about what they see as threats to the confidentiality of their personal health information that they will seek to remove any possibility of this information being shared within the NHS. Let me make it clear, however, that we do not envisage any circumstances in which patients who choose to have some or all of their records deleted will be &quot;deregistered&quot; from the NHS or otherwise denied NHS care against their wishes. That is an important point in the light of what the hon. Member for Wycombe said in his speech this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_418">What we cannot do, of course, is provide people who do not wish to be part of the new joined-up care records system with the benefits that an electronic record will provide. I would now like to focus on the new system of electronic records that we are in the process of introducing through the national programme for information technology, and the benefits that it will bring. In doing so, I hope to touch on some of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised. If I cannot respond in full now, I shall certainly write to him in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_419">Some health records are already held on computers, but much&#151;I would suggest too much&#151;is still kept on paper. Records on paper can present challenges in respect of security of information. The shortcomings of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 500</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the NHS, as it continues to depend in the 21st century on record-keeping and communication systems invented in the 19th century, are all too transparent. Records are not always available to staff providing care; handwritten entries in the record may be difficult to read; and important information may be missing. Patients themselves are often inconvenienced or put in a difficult position by having to tell staff the same information over and over again. Ms Wilkinson&#039;s distressing experience and the embarrassment that it caused her highlight the need for improvement in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_420">We have committed quite unprecedented sums of taxpayers&#039; money&#151;&#163;6.2 billion over last year and the next nine years&#151;to revolutionise the way health information is accessed and shared. The key reasons are that electronic records and clinical communications will improve the safety and quality of care, underpin choice for patients, and increase the productive capacity of NHS clinicians and staff, potentially saving huge sums in unnecessary treatment and wasteful litigation costs. I think it will also help us to build a patient-led NHS, give us opportunities to consider how we can better safeguard information and give patients rights relating to it, and&#151;this is important&#151;create mechanisms to prevent some of the scenarios described by the hon. Gentleman. It will deal with questions of who will and will not have access to the information, and give patients some choice about who those people should be. It should also allow for electronic identification of people who may gain access to the system when they have no right to do so. That is important in any system involving information, whether it is held on paper or electronically.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_421">The new system will give health care professionals secure access to patient information, and the means to update a patient&#039;s care record where and when that is needed. Errors will thus be more easily identified and corrected. From the outset, the system will hold records on an individual&#039;s care in a national computer system so that wherever care is sought, health care professionals can have access to the most up-to-date information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_422">The hon. Gentleman opened his speech with an example of what might happen. A receptionist might meet someone at a party, then go back to the practice and try to gain access to the person&#039;s records. I am informed, and I believe, that access rights will not enable those who are not involved in the provision of care to see records. Unauthorised access will be marked on the system, and therefore subject to audit. That is one of the opportunities granted to us by an electronic system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_423">We have provided the most stringent safeguards for security and confidentiality. We hope that anyone who is concerned about information will be reassured by them. The new system will allow patients to determine whether information recorded in one organisation can be seen elsewhere in the NHS: it will be their choice. Even when patients permit such access, only those involved in their care will have access to their records or to information that identifies them, and they will see only the parts of the record that are needed to inform care. That answers some of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points about the whole health record, and about the possibility that some people might have access to information that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 501</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was not appropriate. The system is designed to tackle that. Everyone who may have access will be authorised appropriately, and will need a smart card as well as a password. Crucially, the system will register the identity of everyone who looks at the records. That is important as a safeguard and as an audit trail to check that unauthorised access is not being allowed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_424">The way in which the new system protects patients&#039; interests is explained in the care record guarantee published by my noble Friend Lord Warner on 25 May. Before the NHS care records service becomes operational, it will be made available to every household in the country. The guarantee makes 12 commitments to patients on their records, relating to matters such as access to records for NHS staff and how it will be limited. Patients will be able to block access to parts of their records to prevent them from being shared by anyone in the NHS except in an emergency. They will also be able to prevent their records from being seen by anyone other than the NHS organisations that recorded the information, although they will have to accept that that may sometimes affect the quality of care&#151;which, again, is part of engaging patients in their care in the first place. Identifiable patient information will not be shared with any organisation outside the NHS unless patients give consent, the law requires disclosure, or there is evidence that failure to disclose the information might put others at risk. Child protection cases are an example of that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_259"><a name="50616-37_spnew0"><b> Mr. Goodman: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for giving way. I will not intervene again, because she is short of time. She spoke of an audit trail, and the possibility of tracing the details of anyone who has looked at a patient&#039;s records. Will patients have an automatic right to know who has been looking at their records?
</p>





<p><a name="st_260"><a name="50616-37_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I understand that they will. The hon. Gentleman referred to a sealed envelope. I understand that the sealed envelope will be opened only when health professionals are convinced that not doing so would put the patient&#039;s health at risk. The Caldicott guardian, who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Jun 2005 : Column 502</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is a senior clinician in a trust responsible for confidentiality, will decide in those circumstances if the patient needs to be informed, but patients can ask at any time to know who has looked at their record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_425">The right to have inaccurate data rectified or erased, or to have any concerns about the processing of data seriously considered, is enshrined in statute. We are currently considering how such concerns can be practically addressed. We recognise that a transparent process needs to be established for people with concerns, and clear and applicable criteria for dealing with requests. It is not a simple matter, as there are significant medico-legal implications in deleting health information, even where it is incorrect, if someone has relied on it to make a decision. Part of the reason for that, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will understand, is to protect the patient from people who might want to change records that could have implications in the future if the patient wanted to complain about their treatment or about how they were treated in the health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_426">I also need to make the important point that, should people choose not to be part of the joined-up care records system, that will not only constrain how the NHS can help them but prevent the NHS from learning and improving on how it manages the care of others with similar conditions. That is not in order for people to know who the individual is, but to look at the case management of people with serious illnesses and diseases. We are determined to engage the public in understanding the benefits, both personal and system-wide, of the electronic care record and the way in which it will lead to a more efficient NHS, improve the quality of care and increase choice. That is why we published the care record guarantee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_427">I hope that my remarks will be of some assistance to the hon. Gentleman, to whom I will reply on any matters that I have been unable to deal with. I also hope that what I have said tonight has been a real opportunity to outline, in a public forum, some of the reasons why we are moving in this direction and how seriously we take the issues of confidentiality in the new system.
