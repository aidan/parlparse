I realise that non-partisan does not mean non-controversial, but there is support for the Bill in all parts of the House.

It would be a tragedy, almost an abuse of the procedure, if the Government were to take any action today to deny the House the chance to examine the Bill&#146;s allegedly controversial aspects&#151;and I hope that the Minister, who I welcome to the Dispatch Box, will not do that.

The entertaining and informative book by David Prerau, available in paperback&#151;I hasten to add that I bought my copy, but I am happy to give it a plug nevertheless&#151;traces back the campaign for changing the clocks to Benjamin Franklin. On a visit to Paris, where his custom was to lie in bed until midday, he discovered that half the hours of daylight had already gone by before he was up. He calculated that a huge saving in energy, at that time in the form of candle power, would result from a change in the French clocks. More recently a series of former Prime Ministers, including Winston Churchill and Arthur Balfour, have supported various attempts to make the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70126-0001.htm_para8"><a name="07012681000098">I pay particular tribute to colleagues in both Houses who have fought the cause. Eleven years ago last Friday, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), who sadly is not in his place today, introduced a Bill that, like mine, had plenty of cross-party support. It foundered, as the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) said, because of Government fears about the reaction in Scotland. I cannot imagine that, in the face of Scottish elections four months hence, such considerations would enter into the minds of Ministers. I am looking forward to the Minister making it clear that the present Government&#146;s position is far more robust, and that they will decide their policy on the merits of the argument.</p>

At the beginning of the19th century, different parts of Britain had different time zones, and that caused problems at the advent of the railways. Passengers were not always aware ofthe time zones according to which the times of the trains were calculated. In 1840, one timetable hadto point out that London time was four minutesahead of Reading time, five and a half minutes ahead of Steventon time, seven and a half minutes ahead of Chippenham time, and so on down the line.</p>

Greenwich mean time became the legal time for all of Britain in 1880, and over the next few years many other countries around the world based their time on GMT&#151;sometimes ahead of it, sometimes behind it. Predictably however, one of the last countries to come into line was France&#151;long after the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most European countries. Only in 1916 were the French persuaded, and even then they could not bear to acknowledge that Britain was in the lead. They called Greenwich mean time</p>

That would mean that all the year round the time would be one hour later than it is at present. For example, this afternoon it would stay light until six o&#146;clock, giving many Members time to reach their constituencies in daylight&#151;or perhaps to enjoy some of the healthy sporting activity that Ministers now recognise we need to encourage to tackle the growing obesity crisis. In effect, the time would be GMT plus two hours in the summer, and GMT plus one hour in the winter.</p>

Gentleman agree that the Government, who pride themselves with some degree of justification on evidence-based policy making, should welcome the fact that there is an opportunity for an experiment, where measurements can be made on the data? There is clearly a case for trying this out first: if the objectives are set out in advance the data can be tested against them, so all Members should then be satisfied that they know whether it is a good or a bad thing to do. That is one of the strongest arguments in favour of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill.</p>

It would be nice to think that the Government always adopted an evidence-based policy-making process, but in a number of cases it appears to me to be a policy-based evidence-making process. However, I hope that that will not happen on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="07012681000111"><a name="70126-0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="07012681000823"><b>Mr. MacShane:</b> The hon. Gentleman should be trying to keep Members on side.</p>

It is hard to believe now that less than 25 years ago that was regardedas a highly controversial proposal. The experimental procedure was used then, and it was successful, because people quickly became accustomed to wearing seat belts&#151;and, more importantly, they soon recognised the benefits of wearing seat belts in terms of lives saved and injuries avoided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para1"><a name="07012681000114">I am confident that my Bill will achieve similar benefits, but I accept that not everyone is yet convinced. For that reason, clause 4 provides for the appointment of a review panel, which after the first two years of the experiment will examine the effects of the Bill and report publicly on them. To ensure the independence of that panel&#151;not that I am suggesting that the Government would ever try to exert influence in respect of appointments of that kind&#151;the Bill explicitly provides for one of the panel&#146;s members tobe nominated by the Royal Society, one by the Government&#146;s chief scientific adviser, one by the chief medical officer and one by the Office for National Statistics&#151;and, of course, some by the Secretary of State as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000115">The Bill requires the panel to report specifically on changes in the number of road traffic accidents, the level of energy consumption and the level of ill health, and on any other areas that the panel believes have been directly affected by the alteration in the clocks. The importance of that panel is that it will give the public unbiased information on which to form a view about the advantages and disadvantages of the change. It will then be for Parliament to decide whether to continue the three-year experiment, and whether to make the change permanent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000116">When the last experiment took place almost 40 years ago, it was abandoned after over-hasty examination of inadequate, and possibly misleading, evidence on the impact of the change. The decision to abandon that experiment was a seriously wrong judgment. In any event, we must now judge the issue on the basis of what it does in today&#146;s conditions.</p>

The confusion I referred to arose where there were lots of time zones with odd differences between them; a five-and-a-half minute difference between one part of the country and another can be quite confusing. Plenty of countries have more than one time zone within their borders, but invariably the differences in time are organised in multiples of half an hour or one hour&#151;I do not think that any country still has odd-minute differences. The evidence from other countries is that it is workable to have separate time zones.</p>

The benefits of the change that I am proposing would be considerable, and would apply to all parts of the UK, but because I recognise that this issue is more controversial issue in some parts of the UK than others, I also believe that the relevant bodies should have a chance to decide for themselves.</p>

Broadcasting, which is obviously a much bigger factor than it was 40 years ago, is a good example of how time zones are almost irrelevant in the modern world.

I happen to believe that the same applies to Scotland, but I dare not attempt in my Bill to force my views on Scotland; I want it to decide for itself. I hope, in return, that Scottish colleagues in this House will not deny England the benefits of this change by casting their votes on an issue that affects only England, at a time when the Bill is not even proposing a change in Scotland.</p>

I am aware that the proposal is more controversial in the case of Scotland, but it is a logical consequence of devolution and of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament that any decision about Scotland&#146;s time zone should be made in Scotland.</p>

While it is hard to be absolutely preciseabout the numbers, I note what the Minister with responsibility for road safety, the hon.

the Minister says, these figures are widely accepted as the best current estimate, and the House should be willing to give this change a try, at least. The number of lives that would be saved is similar to the number that are saved, it is claimed, through the operation of the speed cameras to which the Government are so addicted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para9"><a name="07012681000140">Given that the cost of the changes proposed in the Bill is virtually nil to the public sector, it would be extraordinary if the Government did not back this very simple step. Let us suppose&#151;heaven forbid that this should happen&#151;that this weekend, an accident occurs somewhere in the transport system in which 100 lives are lost. A public inquiry would immediately be set up. Let us also suppose that that inquiry found that it is absolutely certain that a similar accident will occur every year, with similar loss of life, unless Parliament takes the simple step of changing the clocks. There would be a public outcry if we did not take that step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para10"><a name="07012681000141">That is exactly the position that we are in today. It is not a surprise, therefore, that many organisations have announced their support for the Bill. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70126-0002.htm_para12"><a name="07012681000143">I turn now to the environmental case. A recent study entitled &#147;Policy inertia on UK daylight saving: the cost in accidents, energy and emissions&#148;, by Dr. Elizabeth Garnsey and others, of Cambridge university, showed that both peaks in demand for electricity and actual energy consumption would be lower under single/double summer time, particularly throughout the winter. At my recent meeting with the National Grid, its management confirmed that the peak in electricity demand would be lower, enabling the country to operate with a lower level of capacity at all times throughout the year. The Cambridge study estimated that carbon emissions would be cut by 170,000 tonnes annually, at no cost to gross domestic product. That is equivalent to approximately 0.1 per cent. of total annual carbon emissions from the UK.</p>

When he was a Member of this House, he was respected by both sides for speaking his mind and pioneering several policy changes.</p>

introducing this change would mean that whatever surges take place, in the day, evening or night, the overall peak at any one time would be lower than if we did not make the change.</p>

Furthermore, there have been several changes in the 40 years since the previous experiment that are material to the Bill. The most important of those is the much greater concern today about the importance of saving energy and cutting carbon emissions, an issue that was neither understood nor of concern in the late 1960s. Secondly, as has been mentioned, many more British people now travel regularly to the continent of Europe, and they would find those journeys more convenient after the change&#151;a particularly important advantage for the business community.</p>

One of those industries, widely but wrongly thought to be hostile to the change, is agriculture, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) mentioned a few moments ago. This week, I received a letter from the National Farmers Union, which stated:</p>

The Government could not get much more unjoined-up than that. However, there is time for the Minister to become the hero of the hour and say that at least the Bill should go into Committee where it can be examined in more detail.</p>

arguments from that entertaining book about why we put the clocks forward. I did not pay for my copy of the book; the author handed it to me personally last year and signed it for me. He is a most entertaining gentleman to meet and to talk to about the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para11"><a name="07012681000180">Before I cover some of the same ground as the hon. Gentleman in explaining why I support the Bill, I have two preliminary points: first, it is legitimate to legislate about time and, secondly, to do so would not create any more daylight, but merely distribute it differently between the start and end of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para12"><a name="07012681000181">On the first point, there was a great debate about daylight saving time in the United States in 1993. As <i> Time</i> magazine pointed out, &#147;chaos of clocks&#148; reigned because states operated daylight saving time at different times, or did not use it at all. Some Senators put notices on their doors saying, &#147;This office operates on God&#146;s law&#148;, referring to when there were no clocks and we relied on the sun and the shadow it cast to determine the time. We first interfered with God&#146;s, or natural, law when we introduced mean time with the development of mechanical clocks. Astronomical studies showed that each day of the year was not the same length in every part of the world, so the first artificial adjustment was to adopt a mean time such that the length of an hour was the same throughout the country according to the clock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para13"><a name="07012681000182">As the hon. Gentleman noted, the second artificial interference was in the 19th century when standard time was adopted. Typically, noon was set on public clocks around the world by the height of the sun in the sky over each clock, which is why even within Britain there were many time zones, because the sun reaches its height at different times of the day in different areas. The great explosion in railway travel and difficulties in compiling meaningful timetables caused pressure to adopt a standard time, so everybody measured time by Greenwich mean time.</p>

<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="07012681000183"><a name="70126-0003.htm_spnew11"><a name="07012681000862"><b>Mr. Russell Brown:</b> Does not my hon. Friend realise that the Bill would be divisive? Different times in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland would create timetable chaos for rail travellers in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="07012681000184"><a name="70126-0003.htm_spnew12"><a name="07012681000863"><b>Mr. Kidney:</b> I recognise that argument. If the Bill were successful, and if a Scottish Parliament were considering whether to keep to the time zone in England, it would take that factor into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para14"><a name="07012681000185">A third, but still incomplete artificial change, was the adoption of daylight saving time. The hon. Member for South Suffolk mentioned the first great campaigner in this country, William Willett, who produced, published and distributed at his own expense the pamphlet, &#147;Waste of Daylight&#148;. He wanted to provide more time for exercise in the open air at the end of each day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para15"><a name="07012681000186">It is now fashionable on the Labour Benches to be proud of and respectful towards Winston Churchill. He certainly had a good turn of phrase. At the beginning of the 20th century, in debates on the early Bills, he said that William Willett did not propose a change from natural time to artificial time, but rather that we substitute a convenient standard of artificial time for an inconvenient one. That puts our proposals in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para16"><a name="07012681000187">We are proposing not to add more daylight, but to provide more usable hours of daylight, which was the original motivation for such proposals. The first time that nations adopted daylight saving time was during a great challenge to the whole world: world war one. Many countries in Europe and in other continents&#151;eventually 31 countries in four continents&#151;adopted daylight saving time due to economic pressures. Their war efforts required more usable daylight hours. Although the UK never abandoned daylight summer time, we adopted double summer time during the second world war for increasingly longer times between 1941 and 1944, which gave us, in effect, what the Bill would provide. At that time, the National Farmers Union registered the strongest possible protest to the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para17"><a name="07012681000188">In modern times, in America in the 1950s and 1960s, for example, we have seen that without a co-ordinated move to daylight saving time, there is clock chaos, as <i> Time </i>said. We have experimented with changing our time to try to make better use of daylight hours. There was a three-year experiment from 1968 when we adopted what we called British standard time, which was Greenwich mean time plus one hour all year round. Then, at the height of the oil crisis in 1973, the United States adopted daylight saving time all year round under the Emergency Daylight Saving Time Energy Conservation Act 1973&#151;a two-year experiment. Of course, the European Union has weighed in to make the time at which we put the clocks forward and back each year uniform across the EU. Most recently, the US adopted the Energy Policy Act 2005, which from this year onwards changes the times at which the clocks are put forward. It will now be on the second Sunday in March, and the clocks will be put back on the first Sunday in November. Those are some examples of countries legislating to change their hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para18"><a name="07012681000189">My reasons for supporting the Bill reflect those put forward by the hon. Member for South Suffolk: energy saving and climate change; road safety; trade and industry; and health and generally feeling good. Energy is the most important, as reflected in the title of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill. The resulting gain should be the greatest with respect to energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para19"><a name="07012681000190">When our clocks were first put forward for daylight saving time in 1916, Parliament appointed a summer time Committee to evaluate the effect of doing so. A year later, it reported a 20 per cent. reduction in power for electric lighting equal to 1 per cent. of total coal use for the whole year. The next time that daylight saving time was adopted widely around the world was during world war two, but I have been unable to find any formal evaluations of the energy savings that occurred then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para20"><a name="07012681000191">I move forward to the 1968 experiment in this country and the subsequent Home Office and Scotland Office review of British standard time in 1970. That contained a report from the power industry saying that there was a shift in electricity demand from evening to morning which, if continued, would allow a saving in the capacity required for the evenings&#151;the peak demand time&#151;equivalent to one whole power station and a capital cost of about &#163;100 million. That paper was by the Central Electricity Generating Board&#151;the precursor of today&#146;s National Grid&#151;and the hon. Member for South Suffolk confirmed that, in his  <br>

discussions with today&#146;s National Grid Company, those arguments still stand. It is important for us to take that into consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para21"><a name="07012681000192">Let us think why the United States adopted daylight saving time all year round in 1973. It was becauseof the oil and energy crisis. The US Department of Transportation analysed the effects of the first year of adopting that time all year round and concluded thatit probably resulted in a decrease in electricity consumption in the order of 0.75 per cent. for January and February and 1 per cent. for March and April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70126-0003.htm_para22"><a name="07012681000193">In 2001, the state of California appointed an energy commission to look into the problem. We should remember that there was such a crisis there at the time that they could not even keep the lights on, which shows how crucial energy is to a modern society. The commission conducted a study that is reported in a Library research paper for the Bill. It states on page 20:</p>
<a name="70126-0003.htm_brev6"><a name="07012681000708"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Both Winter Daylight Saving Time...and Summer-season Double Daylight Saving Time would probably save marginal amounts of electricity&#151;around 3,400 MegaWatt hours...a day in winter, (one half of one per cent. of winter electricity use) and around 1,500 MWh a day during the summer season (one fifth of one per cent. of summer-season use).&#148;</p>
</ul>

Furthermore, the US Energy Policy Act 2005, driven again by high oil prices, included a requirement forthe Department of Energy to assess the actual contribution to energy conservation that the measure makes and report it to Congress.

The number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads has fallen year after year. However, that leaves us today contemplating a situation in which there are about 3,400 deaths and about 10 times as many serious injuries on our roads every year. Are we really saying that a gain of reducing by about 130 deaths a year&#151;the equivalent of an average-sized primary school in my constituency&#151;is to be sniffed at, rejected and to be considered not worth taking? Since we stopped the British summer time experiment in 1971, more than 3,000 lives have been lost on the roads that might not have been lost had we carried on with the experiment.

Gentleman made the same case as my hon. Friend. However, even though I accept what my hon. Friend the Roads Minister said, the figure of 100-plus for those who may have been saved is small compared with the figure of 3,000-plus who have died. A bigger impact on reducing deaths would be achieved by better driver behaviour, better roads and a better awareness of safety and the highway code. The evidence from the experiment in Portugal is that the number of accidents rose when summer time changed between 1992 and 1996.</p>

The number of casualties on the roads goes up on dark mornings; it is just that the number of casualties goes down far more if there is light at the end of the day. Overall, there is a saving. I do not say that there would not be dangers in the mornings. In fact, ROSPA makes a special point in its briefing paper that much more work would need to be done about safe travel to and from school in the mornings if the Bill were adopted. However, I note in passing that the Education and Inspections Act 2006 gives local authorities a wider power to provide for school buses. That is partly a solution. Equally, inareas such as Staffordshire, we have a good numberof walking buses that organise the safe walking of children to school with supervision. I will support such measures in future.</p>

According to the Tourism Alliance, tourism was worth &#163;73 billion a year to the UK economy in 2002, earning &#163;14 billion in foreign exchange every year, contributing 5 per cent. of our GDP and employing an estimated 2.1 million people. In the west midlands alone, 102 million tourism trips are taken each year, earning about &#163;4.4 billion for the region and resulting in the employment of 130,000 people. In 1993, the Policy Studies Institute estimated that single/double summer time would benefit the tourist industry by another &#163;1 billion a year. Some people now inflate that figure to &#163;2 billion or even&#163;3 billion, but although it is an old figure, it is a big one and I will stick with it.

Alton Towers in Staffordshire is probably the pre-eminent visitor attraction in Britain today. It has millions of visitors every year. It is in quite a secluded area of Staffordshire. It is surprising how successful it is, given its location. Most people arrive mid-morning, so it is light, but clearly quite a lot of light has passed by the time they arrive.

I had my election photograph taken on the platform of Alton railway station. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The right hon.

Shugborough says that if it could open for longer in the evenings and later into the autumn, it could extend its season, employ people for longer, encourage more visitors to the area and earn more income.

We are, whether we like it or not, the promoters of the Olympics 2012 in London and we want British competitors to be successful in those games. Part of their being able to practice and train for those games requires us to give them not just the training facilities, the money and the time off work, but the chance to go out after work or school to train. That is what lighter evenings would allow us to do.</p>

The fact of the matter is that rugby was not generally played too much out in the open in that way. Football was played out in the street and in the parks. I do not remember too many people in the parks of Glasgow playing rugby. Would it not be better if we put money into playing surfaces for winter use or into indoor facilities?

there will still be outdoor playing facilities. If we think of the thousands of playing fields in this country, I cannot imagine us covering them all over or taking them indoors. Although some of us might think that some of the well-paid footballers in the premiership might not be particularly strong in their characters when it comes to resisting the cold weather, I still think that they turn out for matches when it is cold, wet and windy.

Energy is a much stronger focus today than it was then. The forthcoming energy White Paper will discuss at length security of energy supplies and high gas and oil prices. As I have explained, there is a strong focus on climate change today, but it was probably not even mentioned in the 1971 debate. Certainly, in respect of road safety, the necessity of further cutting the number of casualties remains as strong today as it ever was. On trade and industry, probably the biggest single change that I have noticed is that farming was then a significant industry, and it opposed the measure. Tourism was fairly quiet, and its voice was not heard. Today, the size of the farming industry has shrunk, but in any case it now supports, not opposes, the change. Tourism has become much more significant to our economy, and it strongly supports the measure.</p>

Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), because I was once lucky in the private Members&#146; Bill ballot and introduced the Energy Conservation Bill, and he was most sympathetic to it and took a constructive approach. Unfortunately, he temporarily departed from office and his successor was extremely obstructive. The Bill failed in that Session, but we got our revenge, because the then Member for Christchurch took the same Bill through its stages as the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. To complete the circle, I am now married to the then Member for Christchurch, which is the happiest of happy endings. So the legislation that the hon. Member for South Suffolk and I both supported was enacted&#151;but I cannot promise such an outcome on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000253">One aspect of the Bill&#151;the double summer time element&#151;accords with Liberal Democrat policy and has been widely advocated, particularly by my hon. Friends who represent west country constituencies in which there is much tourism, and much interest in tourism. In particular, my hon. Friends the Members for North Devon (Nick Harvey) and for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) stress that the tourist season in the west country would benefit considerably. Many outdoor activities could go on until late in the evening in the summer. The Bill could have a marked effect on tourism, particularly in the south-west, but also in other parts of the country. There is not much of a downside to that aspect of the measure, apart from the two-hour change that will be involved if we do not alter the winter time. For some of us, the change would not make much difference, as we live in parts of the country where it is light until 11 o&#146;clock in the summer. If it was light until midnight, it would not be problematic&#151;indeed, in some ways it might be quite attractive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para4"><a name="07012681000254">However, there are downsides to two aspects of the Bill, and two ways in which it does not accord with what the Liberal Democrats advocate. Those aspects are the winter time change and the prospect of having different time zones within the United Kingdom. I shall start by dealing with the winter situation. It is a basic fact that the northern half of Britain gets much more daylight in the summer, and much less daylight in the winter, than the southern half, so those who live in the northern half have a particular concern about the impact on our lives of the changes proposed in the Bill. Adding an hour in the winter would greatly increase the number of mornings in which people go to work in the dark.</p>

I do not propose to try to explain the mathematics of that. I do not argue that there are not advantages to be had from light evenings, but the key issue for most of us in the north and in Scotland is the increased number of dark mornings, which would mean that people had to go to work or school inthe dark.</p>

Would it not lead to difficulties for a considerable part of the country if there were a two-hour shift in the clocks, as it would mean that for at least a month, we would go back to darker winter mornings?

It is Government policy to discourage the practice of driving children to school, and to encourage them to go on foot or to cycle, organising help, if necessary, so that they can travel in groups. That is sensible, and there are good health and environmental reasons for such a policy. The number of cars on the road, for example is reduced, as there are fewer vehicles taking children to school.

There is a tendency, of course, to extend the school day at both ends. In the morning, for example, children may go to school early to attend a breakfast club, and in the evening they may take part in after-school activities, or there may be arrangements in place so that their parents can collect them after finishing work. The school day has changed so that children less often go home at the hour mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. Similarly, they more often go to school while it is still dark in the morning.</p>

Many of my constituents&#146; children and children in other rural constituencies wait for school buses at the end of farm roads and at crossroads on dark mornings. Some of them are dropped off from one form of transport only to wait for another. Some children will be taken to primary school, while the middle school children are dropped off at a bus stop to wait for a bus to take them to their school. Expecting them to wait for transport on more cold dark mornings is both an imposition and a danger&#151;and that danger extends beyond road safety concerns. Pupils who are over 16 have to pay &#163;360 each for the privilege of travelling to school by bus in Northumberland, which is an atrociously high charge. As I travel around my constituency in the early morning between 8 and 9 am, I see many children waiting for buses at farm road ends and at crossroads. Under the proposals, they would far more often have to do so in the dark. The change would therefore pose a serious problem in significant parts of the country.</p>

There will be costs for the railway industry resulting from different time zones, such as the need for timetables to explain such changes, and computer programmes that take account of them. There are therefore a series of practical problems, and my non-cynical assumption is that the hon. Member for South Suffolk does not really believe that his Bill would introduce different time zones, because he thinks that the Scots, whatever their concerns about the impact of the Bill on Scotland, will have no choice but to follow suit.</p>

Many of my Scottish colleagues, with whom I have discussed the matter, believe that Scotland would be bounced into a decision that the Scots would not otherwisevote for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07012681000279">I commend the hon. Gentleman for bringing us back to this decennial subject of debate and for presenting his case so well, but I do not think he has fully understood all the problems that it would present in northern England and Scotland, or the problems that would result from two time zones. Those would be a high price to pay for a Bill that includes a change that many of my colleagues would support&#151;double summer time in the summer months.</p>

When I left Edinburgh Waverley at about 8 am it was pitch dark, the wind was howling and the rain was pouring&#151;it was that horizontal rain which those of us who live on the east coast of Scotland have learned to love over the years, as no doubt did those before us. At that moment, I did not relish the thought that if the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) were enacted, I would have to wait not an hour or two, but two or three hours until it got lighter. That is the initial reaction of many Members from Scotland and the north of England, and I know that it is also the view of many of my constituents.</p>

Gentleman for his Bill could have some merit in Scotland as well. As has been pointed out, we would not lose an hour of daylight, were the measure to be passed. It is a question of where the hour goes, and how the balance between darker mornings and lighter afternoons and evenings works out. I recognise that some of the benefits which, it is argued, the Bill would bring apply as much to Scotland as to other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

each year and there were 100 few injuries on the roads as a result of the measure, I would regard that in itself as a justification for the Bill. Almost anything that saves a life on the roads is worthwhile considering. I have been lobbied by those from the tourist sector in my constituency who see the benefits for tourism, entertainment and other venues that would result from lighter evenings for a greater part of the year. In an area where there are a large number of businesses with international links with the rest of the European Union, there would be business advantages if, in effect, we adopted central European time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para16"><a name="07012681000283">There are several arguments to show why the Bill would be beneficial to my constituency, Scotland and the rest of the UK, but there is also a danger of its supporters making claims that are somewhat excessive. The idea that people would be happier because they had lighter evenings, discounting the fact that they might get more depressed because of darker mornings, suggests a rather one-sided analysis of the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para17"><a name="07012681000284">Opponents of the Bill also adduce arguments that seem somewhat excessive. It is suggested, for example, that with lighter evenings, children would stay up later at night, would more be tired and would achieve worse outcomes in their schooling. If we are worried about children not getting to bed early enough because of lighter evenings, perhaps attention to the TV switchor the computer switch might achieve the desired objective. It is important to consider the argumentsin a reasonable way, rather than to allow excessive arguments to influence the debate for or against the proposed change.</p>

For much of the year it is still light until 10 pm or 11 pm, and younger children would be in bed by then anyway, so I am not sure the extra hour would make a difference either way. It is important to examine the arguments in as reasoned and rational way as possible, and not to make excessive claims for or against the proposed change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70126-0005.htm_para18"><a name="07012681000287">The fact that there are arguments for and against, and the fact that the level of support for and against is fairly evenly split suggests that one&#146;s perspective on the Bill depends on one&#146;s personal circumstances. We heard that an opinion poll suggested that in the UK as a whole 54 per cent. were in favour of the change, but in Scotland only 40 per cent. were in favour and 48 per cent. were against. I suspect that in my constituency the split might be 50:50, as the further south one lives in Scotland, the more likely one is to support the proposal, by contrast with constituencies further north.</p>

a few, and they were quite thoughtful responses. The views were fairly evenly balanced for and against a change, but marginally in favour. I would be happy to see the Bill go into Committee to allow further discussion and consideration of the arguments for and against, and to allow me to conduct a more detailed consultation among my constituents to find out their views on the issue. There are dangers, as I said,in exaggerating the supposed benefits arising fromthe Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70126-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07012681000291">There is great merit in examining the Bill in more detail. Some of the claims made for it seem excessive. On the road safety issue, for example, I would strongly support the Bill if it could be shown that it would have the benefits that are suggested. In my constituency, most primary schools finish during daylight hours and that would not change if the Bill came into effect in Scotland, but they would face darker mornings on80 more days in the year, which could have a negative effect on road safety. However, the road safety benefits may not be just in relation to children coming home from school. Secondary school pupils come home later, of course. Consideration needs to be given to other activities that take place in the latter part of the day, which might have an impact on the road safety figures as well. I would want to consider all these factors in detail. I would therefore be happy for the Bill to proceed to Committee, if it makes progress today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70126-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000292">As my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) pointed out, in its present form the Bill would have no automatic impact on my constituents because it would allow the Scottish Parliament to decide on the matter. The possibility that the Bill could create four new time zones in the UK is one of the aspects that makes it difficult for me to support it. In the consultation that I undertook, that was the one point that led to almost universal opposition from those who responded. I was surprised at how strongly my constituents who responded opposed that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70126-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000293">Obviously, it would not be impossible to have time zones in Scotland that were different from those in England. It is not the same as having different time zones in every town or city in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it would cause inconvenience, especially to business and, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said, to travellers. The Bill&#146;s sponsors cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that one of its benefits would be bringing us into line with central European time, thus helping business, but not accept that separate time zones in different parts of the UK would have a negative effect on business in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70126-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07012681000294">I appreciate that the Bill does not require Scotlandto have a separate time zone: it would give that power to the Scottish Parliament.

I assume that the hon. Member for South Suffolk, who is neither a rabid Scottish nationalist nor a rabid English nationalist, proposes the opt-out to give the Bill more chance of passing through the House, but that provision will make that more difficult.</p>

When devolution was introduced, the reservation of UK policy to the UK Parliament was fundamental to the concept. It was agreed that we would retain a single market and a single economic zone in the UK. Decisions about time are fundamental to business and the economy in the UK. I therefore have great difficulty with clause 6. As I said, if that can be tackled, arguments would apply equally well to Scotland as to England and the rest of the UK.</p>

However, I take on board the apparent willingness of the hon. Member for South Suffolk to remove it later. I hope that that clause will be deleted in Committee.</p>

happy to sponsor. The House is grappling with a basic chronometric question: do we value daylight more highly at the beginning or the end of the day? To put it in the religious terms that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) used, how do we best realign the hours of daylight that the Almighty has given us with the human activities that we undertake now that we are no longer constrained by whether it is daylight? It is my modest observation that more human activity takes place at dusk than at dawn. It therefore follows that realigning daylight hours along the lines that my hon.

Of course, that generality does not hold for some minorities. For example, we heard about agricultural workers and I shall deal with that point shortly. However, as my hon. Friend and the hon.

One can contrast the relaxed attitude of the NFU today, as exemplified in the extract from the letter read out by my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk, with the strong views of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers, as reported in 1970 in Hamish Gray&#146;s maiden speech.

According to one estimate, tourism earnings could increase by &#163;3 billion were the Bill introduced. Mention has also been made of obesity, which was simply not an issue the last time that the House considered the matter. Were there a free vote on the Bill today, I believe that the outcome wouldbe dramatically different from that of the free votein 1970.</p>

morning when I was a teenager, going on to the red blaes hockey pitch and being whacked across the shins by a hockey ball or hockey stick. It was incredibly cold. I agree that that is not necessarily a reason for people not to take part in sport, but very few of us are willing to go out in the depths of winter, and very few sports can be played then.

I think that the present arrangement is a very satisfactory compromise between the wishes of those who prefer lighter mornings and those who prefer lighter evenings. The fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) put the case for the other side of the argument is an indication that the issue is not about north versus south, but about the fact that some people prefer lighter mornings and others prefer longer, lighter evenings.</p>

In my opinion, that way lies disaster and the Bill should be opposed for that reason alone, although, as I have said, I oppose it principally because this is not a huge issue and we should not be spending a great deal of our time on it.

Member for South Suffolk appeared on the Radio 4 &#147;Today&#148; programme to discuss the issue, and there was a clear divergence of opinion among those listeners who responded, for instance by telephone or e-mail. I think that most Radio 4 listeners come from down south&#151;&#147;Good Morning Scotland&#148; takes precedence north of the border. Therefore, it is clear that there is a divergence of opinion across the country; there is not necessarily a north-south divide on this issue.</p>

It might lead to a reduction in road deaths, which is always to be welcomed, but it will also do something else that is crucial: it will address driver behaviour. We have to get the message on that across. There has been a reduction in serious injuries and road deaths over the past few years. That is due to a range of developments such as better road design and safer cars. However, there are far too many deaths and serious injuries from road accidents. One change would make a huge difference in that respect: if we could educate people to drive properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70126-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07012681000351">The biggest issue&#151;recent results show that it is present in almost every accident&#151;is alcohol.

They would have to go to work two hours later, for example, and because they were still at work on the other side of the border, they would miss being with their children when they are put to bed in the early evening.

As for the broadcasting argument, perhaps some Members never watch Sky News, CNN or BBC News 24, but it does not really matter whether they are watching at 5 o&#146;clock or 6 o&#146;clock.

I was the Minister with responsibility for roads and road safety and I heardthe same arguments as the current Minister with responsibility for roads, which have been repeated today. The fact that we can prevent another 200 deaths a year and a further 200 serious accidents seems to me  <br>

to be a very good reason that we cannot ignore, especially when we have advice from such august bodies as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the Child Accident Prevention Trust and the National Association of Head Teachers. We would do well to listen to them. The fact that the Bill will save lives is a really important consideration.</p>

Frankly, I am more interested in that evidence than in what happened in Portugal a few years ago.</p>

The fact is that the Greenwich meridian almost goes through Bordeaux and Madrid, and I would much rather be aligned with all the major economies of Europe. As the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000395">My next reason for supporting the Bill is that it saves energy. The evidence is there that we can save 3 per cent. of our energy. Whether or not we are in favour of nuclear power, windmills or whatever, what actually matters is that we use less energy. As the experts tell us, the Bill will encourage us to use up to 3 per cent. less energy. The peaks of energy consumption will belower, we will reduce carbon emissions and we will cut fuel bills.</p>

England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rather than fly off to the sun. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would embrace that, but he doesnot seem to be encouraging such tourism in his constituency, which surprises me&#151;but there we are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07012681000399">My next reason for supporting the Bill results from the impact that it will have on business. I am astonished that Scottish Members of Parliament here today seem to think that the financial services industry in Scotland would not benefit from coming into the same time zone as the rest of its major competitors, notably Frankfurt, and that it does not suffer from the current muddle that disadvantages the City of London and Edinburgh. People in the United States, China, India and all around the world simply cannot understand why the major financial capital of the world can be in a different time zone from other European financial capitals, such as Frankfurt.</p>

It is very straightforward. I would rather we went in the direction proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07012681000402">I also want to take head on the argument about farmers. I am sure that if you represent farmers, Madam Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate that they do not pay any attention to clocks. They pay attention to the time that the sun rises and sets and to the needs of their stock. That, not what the clocks says, determines when a farmer gets up, and we need to bear that in mind. It is significant that the National Farmers Union has changed its view and now supports the Bill. We should bear in mind that very great change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07012681000403">On the Scottish question, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I was working during the last trial between 1968 and 1971. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk was working too. I was working in Scotland&#151;I was a teacher in Musselburgh. In the winter before the trial took place in Scotland, there were no games in the afternoon. We could not hold them; it was dark. When the trial was on, teachers across Scotland were able to organise sports, coach athletics and, above all, get children outside and exercised. I am proud of being a Scottish-registered teacher, but when I came to teach in England, I found that doing all that was so much easier. I look back with horror on the dark afternoons when there was no sport for hundreds of thousands of children in Scotland. The proposal would be of enormous benefit to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07012681000404">Of course, Scotland could opt out, and my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk has introduced a sensible arrangement for that. I doubt that it will. It is important to remember that there will always be far fewer hours of daylight in Scotland in winter than in England. It does not matter whether we get our six hours of daylight from 8 am to 2 pm or at any other time, except for the statistical arguments in favour of things such as safety and energy consumption.</p>

The evidence from the previous experiment on which the Bill is predicated is clear and sound. As has been stated, the measure is backed by a number of authorities. It seems to border on the immoral to pass up the opportunity of saving more than 100 lives a year&#151;not just any lives but, predominantly, the lives of children&#151;and, given our emphasis on climate change, to pass up the opportunity of saving, at a conservative estimate, at least 170,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

school, would be delighted by it, because in this term of the academic year, they would love to be able to go out and play sport after school. One reason why this term is difficult for many schools is the lack of opportunity to take part in activities after school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para16"><a name="07012681000418">It is evident that many expert groups outside the House have opinions on the subject, and support the Bill. I received a letter from GEM Motoring Assist, which is based in my constituency. It used to be the Guild of Experienced Motorists, and has some 65,000 members. The letter says:</p>
<a name="70126-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07012681000718"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;100 lives and around 400 serious injuries would be saved each year if the scheme were adopted.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para17"><a name="07012681000419">We should recognise the importance of such contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07012681000420">However, the decision should be taken nationally, and must not fragment the country. There are serious dangers threatening the union of the country. Issues such as those dealt with in the Bill could increase the pressure for fragmentation, and we must be wary of that. Some of the arguments that we have heard focused exclusively on the advantages of lighter evenings, but did not address the disadvantages of darker mornings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para19"><a name="07012681000421">We heard some thoughtful speeches. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) made a well-researched speech, in which he paid much attention to detail. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who is no longer in the Chamber, spoke about postal deliveries. Many of us visited our post offices and delivery offices over the Christmas period, and we saw the people who get up at or4 o&#146;clock or 4.30 every morning in order to be at their offices at 5 o&#146;clock. They certainly would not welcome an extra hour of winter darkness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07012681000422">One of the few mischievous comments in the debate was made by the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who said that the great advantage of the measure for him was that it would put us in the same time zone as the rest of Europe. That was probably the least persuasive argument that he could have thought of, in terms of encouraging people to support us. The fact is that, of the other countries in the EU, two have the same time frame as we do, 14 are on central European time, and eight are two hours different from us, so there is significant variation. To suggest that this is a European issue is a bit misleading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70126-0008.htm_para21"><a name="07012681000423">There has been an element of over-claiming, too. The suggestion was made that the change would solve the problem of obesity, and I found that slightly far-fetched. It would be a wonderful way of dieting, and we could simply change the hours now and again. I would be delighted to find such a simple solution to the problem, but I think that it was an over-claim. As for the suggestion that the Bill would make us all happier, I checked the greatest indicator of unhappiness&#151;the suicide rate&#151;and discovered that Sweden and Finland have the highest suicide rates in the world. Intriguingly, however, more suicides take place in those countries in spring and summer, so people are most dissatisfied and more likely to commit suicide when there are more hours of daylight. We should therefore be careful about making a connection between human happiness and the setting of clocks. Too much was claimed, too, about the effects on tourism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70126-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07012681000426">We are all keen to encourage tourism, but it is over-optimistic to expect Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt in Stuttgart to say over breakfast one morning, &#147;Look dear, we must go to Britain this year, because it has changed the clocks.&#148; Equally, I do not expect Mr. and Mrs. Smith in Solihull to say, &#147;Hey, now they&#146;ve changed the clocks, we won&#146;t pop off to Tuscany this year. Let&#146;s stay in Britain instead.&#148; Of course we want to encourage people to stay in Britain or to visit, but they will be persuaded to do so by the quality of the accommodation and the welcome that they receive, and those are the issues on which we should focus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70126-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07012681000427">I listened with great interest to the argument about the contribution that the change would make to road safety, and we must take the evidence from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents very seriously indeed. We would expect a correlation between the hours of daylight and the number of deaths on the road, but across Europe no such correlation exists. The safest places to drive in Europe are Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, despite the much longer hours of winter darkness in those countries. The biggest contribution to road safety has resulted from improvements in roads and in driving standards, the requirement to wear seat belts, and a range of other things. The change could have benefits, but we must be careful not to overplay them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70126-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000428">I was intrigued by the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk that we move to a system of flexi-hours in school. That would be fraught with complications, because there would be cross-boundary issues. For example, some people would be sending one child to a school with an 8.30 start, and another child to a secondary school with a 9.30 start. The change would lead to significant complications for parents, especially if they have teenagers, who seem to live in a completely different time zone. I have come to the conclusion that from the age of 15 or 16 teenagers should make a continental shift to the west, because their body clock is about five hours out of kilter. They go to bed five hours after the rest of us, and they get up five hours later, too, so if they moved one continent to the west, we could address that issue. I accept, however, that it is not what we are considering today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70126-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000429">We are all trying to encourage &#147;walking buses&#148; in our constituencies, which are good for the environment and for children&#146;s health. If we wish to encourage children to walk to school, we must be cognisant of the danger facing young children if they more often walk to school in darkness. The growth of before-school clubs poses challenges, too. Parents may drop their children off at 8 am when they go to work, although school does not start for another hour and a half or two hours. I accept that my hon. Friend introduced the concept of flexible hours to deal with a particular issue, but it gives rise to significant complications.</p>

A great advantage of the City of London is that it straddles the time zones of the east and the west. One of the reasons why so many companies have chosen to come and invest in the UK is that they can work with continental Europe, with some of the countries in Asia and with the US.

There would be great celebration, particularly in Dublin, following such a change. To every American company looking to invest in Europe, Dublin would say, &#147;We have a unique selling point. We&#146;re closer to your time frame than the rest of Europe. It&#146;s 3 pm in London before offices in the US open at 9 am, whereas it&#146;s only 2 pm in Dublin, so if you want to maximise the shared working time, come to Dublin rather than London.&#148;</p>

only three with constituencies north of a line between the Wash and the Severn, and none from Scotland. The Minister suggested in an intervention that one of the reasons for the Conservative electoral meltdown in 1997 was that we had blocked a similar Bill. I think the factors were slightly more complicated than that. Presumably the conspiracy theorists would go on to say, &#147;Look what happened to that nice Mr. Nigel Beard.

Apparently their only genuine objection to the Bill is the opt-out for the Scottish Parliament. May I encourage my hon.

My hon. Friend the Minister gave an indication of how strongly it was opposed. It could be argued that time has moved on and that after nearly 40 years it is time for another experiment, but, like the hon. Member for Wealden, I think that we need much more discussion before we can think about launching one. If there is a further experiment, it may not take place for some years. Any changes in the United Kingdom&#146;s time zone, including the adoption of central European time or single/double summer time, would need to take full account of the effect on business, transport links with other countries, health and safety issues and social and community life.</p>

As someone who lost a member of my family in a road traffic accident a number of years ago, I know that that hits families very hard.

Portugal of how bad the situation was&#151;it may have been more extreme here&#151;and it is coming round again after a 40-year period. I confidently predict here and now that if this change were to occur, we would see ourselves changing back again after three years. It would be the fourth unsuccessful experiment on the changing of time zones in western Europe. Do we really have to go through it one more time? Cannot we look at the experience of Portugal twice and of the UK once rather than mess about in a way that is not practical or sensible?</p>

I look at the extreme fringes of the UK, starting in London. This morning, London&#146;s sunrise was at about 7.49 am. In Shetland, it was 8.35 am. In the north and west part of my constituency in Stornoway it was 8.44 am and in the south end of the constituency it was 8.46 am. Already, the latitude lottery winning is evident and it is heartening for the south-east of England, which has an earlier morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70126-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000511">It is also instructive to reflect on the times of sunset. It is 15.58 in Shetland, 16.30 in Stornoway and 16.36 in London. Again, it is already clear that the day is longer in the south-east of England. When one different area has already won on the latitude lottery, it seems particularly small minded further to impose on the Scots&#151;though not just the Scots, as it applies north of Manchester&#151;a day that does not start at 25 minutes to 9 or quarter to 9 in the morning, but at 25 minutes to 10.

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07012681000613">I return to my original question. Why are we doing this? Against my better judgment, I quite enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry). I thought that the friendly scepticism that he directed at the Bill&#151;I will not call it opposition&#151;was reasonably measured. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) introduced a topic that I did not really want to pursue&#151;the Scotland-England issue. Perhaps I could expand it and say a little about Northern Ireland, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07012681000614">We talk of Northern Ireland as having had problems in the past, yet we say we want to keep the Union and keep it in the same time zone. The hon. Member for South Suffolk said that he would accept an amendment to remove the separate provisions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland. If that does not happen, old sores&#151;and, in some instances, not-so-old sores&#151;may be exposed again. The Republic of Ireland may end up in one time zone while Northern Ireland is in the same zone as the south-east of England.</p>

Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who dealt ably with the Scotland-England question. Does not the 285 majority in favour of abandoning the 1968-71 experiment demonstrate that there was a strong consensus in the House at the time? It was not just Members from Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north of England who believed that the experiment had not worked; the consensus must have been much broader. That figure of 285 is important, and we should bear it in mind.</p>

Therefore, you should not be laughing. You did something that the people of Scotland did not agree with&#151;we were used as guinea pigs. You forced something on us that we did not want.

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000621">It is important that the Conservative party realises the kind of splits that such a Bill can cause. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for South Suffolk has introduced the Bill with the best intentions and honestly believes that it is the right thing to do, but it will be perceived by people north of the border, in Northern Ireland and in Wales as derisory. If the Conservative party in England wishes to become the English Conservative party, it should say so.</p>

Member for Wealden made a good point about people from the south of England. When we look at some of the cities in the north, there is not a big difference between the north of England and even Cardiff, which is not exactly the north of England, and the borders of Scotland. The difference between Aberdeen and Newcastle is not great. Therefore, Conservative Members have not thought about their own representation within England, let alone Scotland. It would be much better if we were to look at the matter in the round as a United Kingdom Parliament. We should accept or reject the Bill today on the premise that we are voting for a Bill for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

I have said before in a speech that there is only one Unionist party in this Parliament and it is the Labour party, because the other parties have shown on many occasions that they disregard other parts of the United Kingdom, not just Scotland, and it has come backto haunt them. They need only look at their representation in Scotland and Wales to see how the Welsh and Scots feel about them. If they want to reverse that, it is time they started to look at themselves&#151;as they did when I was a young boy&#151;as the Conservative and Unionist party. It is still the only party in Scotland that ever got more than 50 per cent. of the vote in a general election. That was in the late 1950s. By the 1990s, it was gone. They have to ask themselves why. It is Bills such as this that is causing part of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07012681000629">The Scottish question is a real one. It was dealt with effectively in the constructive contribution of the hon. Member for Wealden. It is true that the Union is under threat but, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) mentioned, even the Scottish National party opposes this measure. It might have been sympathetic towards it if it had thought that it might help to secure its final objective of independence for Scotland. However, the suggestion from the nationalist Benches that the hon. Member for South Suffolk was Darth Vader in another guise might have been stretching the compliment too far.</p>

One of the reasons for that is that night flights into London cause misery to millions of west Londoners in particular, with such flights arriving at 4.30 am. The Bill would have the effect that they would arrive at 5.30 am, thereby giving millions of Londoners an additional hour&#146;s sleep.

In winter, it would not be possible even to commence morning prayers until about 8 am, which might very well lead to people being late for school or work, bearing in mind that prayers can last up to an hour.

In fact, it is so worthy of consideration that we tend to examine the same, or a similar, proposition every few decades&#151;and we are discussing it again today. If there was any disappointing aspect of his speech, it was his glossing over of the last substantial vote in the House on this issue in 1971. I have referred to that in a couple of interventions. There was a free vote and it resulted in a majority of 285 in favour of abandoning the experiment that had been taking place. There must have been some weight behind that decision if, after having lived through the experiment for three years, so many Members in all parts of the House were persuaded to say, &#147;We want to go away from it&#148;&#151;and Portugal did exactly the same after it experienced four years of such an experiment.</p>

I thank him for his attendance and I look forward to his response to my concerns and suggestions. He is a fine, fair-minded and able Minister, and I am sure that we will have a constructive debate. I am very pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) is here to give his views to the Minister, if he catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He works tirelessly on his constituents&#146; behalf, and I note that he, too, has grave concerns about the rising level of unemployment in north Northamptonshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07012681000652">I should say at the outset that I am not trying to score party political points through this debate; I merely want to highlight the facts to the Minister and urge the Government to take action to reverse the rise in unemployment in north Northamptonshire. In the Wellingborough constituency, unemployment has risen by 19 per cent. since this time last year. Unfortunately, 42 other constituencies in the United Kingdom saw an even greater increase last year. Some 1,536 people in Wellingborough now claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;2.8 per cent. more than did so in December 1997. The facts are there, and it is clear that unemployment in Wellingborough is higher now than it was in December 1997. The same is true of 82 other constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07012681000653">The Labour party&#146;s 1997 election manifesto stated the following:</p>
<a name="70126-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07012681000722"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will attack long-term unemployment...Our goal will be educational and employment opportunities for all...Our long-term objective is high and stable levels of employment...Labour&#146;s welfare-to-work programme will attack unemployment and break the spiral of escalating spending on social security...We will co-ordinate benefits, employment and career services, and utilise new technology to improve their quality and efficiency.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07012681000654">There is nothing in that that I would disagree with. The present Government inherited a healthy and growing economy. As the Chancellor likes to point out at every opportunity, the economy continues to grow. Sowhy do we have rising unemployment in north Northamptonshire? Something has gone wrong somewhere: if a Government have inherited a healthy economy, unemployment should not continue to rise. Labour&#146;s 1997 manifesto promises have not materialised in Wellingborough, for whatever reason. We have a problem, and it is time for the Government to recognise it and do something about it. I am not interested in hearing Government spin and rhetoric on these clear facts; I just want to know why things have gone wrong and what we can all do to reverse this worrying trend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07012681000655">Of course, there is one clear and major explanation for rising unemployment in Wellingborough&#151;the decline of the manufacturing industry.

jobs over the years. Manufacturing industry is, of course, the engine house of the British economy. Without it, there could be no public services&#151;the very public services of which the Government like to boast. None the less, because of the rapid decline in manufacturing jobs under this Government, those jobs are no longeravailable to the workers of Wellingborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07012681000656">In 1991, 32 per cent. of employees&#146; jobs in Wellingborough were in manufacturing. In 1997, that figure had fallen by only 1 per cent., to 31 per cent. However, by 2005 only 19 per cent. of employees&#146; jobs were in manufacturing industries in the constituency. That huge decrease has had a knock-on effect on the number of people unemployed and those on jobseeker&#146;s allowance in Wellingborough.</p>

But it is clear that growth will remain totally inadequate. Hopes of manufacturing recovery have so far been bitterly disappointed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07012681000658">In December of last year, in response to the October 2006 manufacturing output figures, the BCC stated:</p>
<a name="70126-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="07012681000724"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The manufacturing figures remain weak by historical standards and the recovery is fragile and vulnerable.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07012681000659">It is clear that manufacturing industry will continue to decline in this country, and will do so even more given the recent increase in interest rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07012681000660">The Government needs to take manufacturing industry seriously and create an environment in which it can expand rather than contract. One of our problems in Wellingborough is that we do not have many large companies. Instead we have many small to medium-sized companies. When one of those closes down, it causes a faint ripple through the county, but does not appear on the national stage and therefore no major action is taken. But after a series of medium sized companies have closed, the effects gain momentum and have huge implications for employment in the constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70126-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07012681000661">Small and medium-sized companies are much more affected by the bureaucracy and red tape of Government regulations than their larger counterparts are. Businesses in my constituency are suffering and failing because they are being strangled by the enormous amount of bureaucracy and red tape imposed on them. Labour&#146;s election promise in 1997 was to cut unnecessary red tape for small businesses, but I am often approached by people with businesses in my constituency that are struggling.</p>

However, that argument does not wash, because of the Government&#146;s willingness to do  <br>

anything that the European Commission wants rather than stand up for the interests of British business. That leads to unemployment in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07012681000663">Thanks to the British people, we have stopped the Government taking us into the euro, so we perform much better than many of our European Union colleagues. But because of the Government&#146;s actions, our manufacturing industries cannot stand up against the competitiveness of China and India, and the economy of the United States. We need to look urgently at attracting to north Northamptonshire new labour-rich businesses that will bring with them a wealth of jobs and opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07012681000664">It has never before been so important to look into the employment situation in the area. That is because of the huge housing expansion that is taking place in north Northamptonshire, which will see 167,000 extra dwellings built in the county by 2016. Many of the plans for the huge increase in housing have been in place for years. However, there is little planning for infrastructure and employment opportunities to support that massive growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07012681000665">I run the &#147;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&#148; campaign, which seeks the views of local people in regular surveys, forums, meetings and visits. As an MP, I hold well-attended weekly constituency surgeries where I regularly meet constituents who have concerns about unemployment, or who are dissatisfied with the service received from Jobcentre Plus orthe local Department for Work and Pensions. Unfortunately, Wellingborough Jobcentre Plus has a performance rating for customer service of only77.5 per cent., which means that about a quarter of all the people who use the service are dissatisfied. That is unacceptable. I have arranged a meeting with the corporate management team of Wellingborough council and the district manager of Jobcentre Plus to discuss the concerns of my constituents about unemployment and the effectiveness of the service they receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07012681000666">Rising unemployment is a big issue for all the authorities in my area and we are all committed to alleviating the problems. Just before the debate, I opened 12 Sheep street, 23,000 sq ft of modern office accommodation. The interesting point about that development is that it was a public-private partnership. Invest Northamptonshire put in half the capital and Ciel Developers put in the other 50 per cent. The development will attract jobs to Wellingborough, but the problem is that Invest Northamptonshire has just found out that the Government have severely cut its budget. We have an initiative in my constituency that will work well, but the funding for it is being cut. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07012681000667">I am a little disappointed by the Government&#146;s response to my letters; I felt that it was rather complacent. I want a constructive debate, so I am sure that we shall not hear Government spin on Labour&#146;s employment record in the Minister&#146;s reply. I wanted simply to lay bare to the Minister the facts about what is happening in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07012681000668">I have three suggestions to make to the Minister. If he could meet all three, it would help my constituents enormously and reduce unemployment in north Northamptonshire. First, I invite him to visit Wellingborough to see the problems at first hand so  <br>

that he can be more responsive to the needs of my constituents. Perhaps he could help to organise a multi-agency response to a serious unemployment problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07012681000669">Secondly, the employment landscape of Wellingborough has changed. Because of the expansion of house building, we are becoming a commuter town, and are only50 minutes away from London by rail. The Government often talk about relocating some of their Departments to the regions. Why not bring a Department to Wellingborough? It would create jobs for people living in north Northamptonshire, and the town is only50 minutes away from London, which must be a major benefit for a Department that is relocating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07012681000670">Thirdly, I have repeatedly argued for a community hospital in the constituency to cope with the growing needs of the local population. A new hospital would create local jobs, while providing a vital service to the ever-growing population of north Northamptonshire. As Wellingborough is in the worst funded primary care trust in the worst funded strategic health authority in the country, by reference to the national capitation formula, if the Government invest in Wellingborough the money they say that they should invest, we could have such a hospital. I am asking not for more Government expenditure, but for our fair share of Government expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07012681000671">It is vital that we all work together to encourage new business and industry to come to north Northamptonshire. Now that the expansion programme is under way, this is a perfect time to do that, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) on securing this important debate and I praise him for his tireless work for constituents on so many issues of crucial importance&#151;not least, unemployment. Kettering is next door to Wellingborough and many of the circumstances that my hon. Friend described are also pertinent to my Kettering constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07012681000673">I would like to place on the record the current stateof affairs regarding unemployment in Kettering. In December 1997, 1,235 unfortunate people were claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance, compared with 1,232&#151;a staggering reduction of three&#151;in December 2006. Last year, an extra 219 people found themselves without work, which is a staggering increase of 21.6 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07012681000674">If we compare Kettering with the other 645 constituencies in the UK in respect of the percentage change in unemployment between December 2005 and December 2006, it was worse in only 21 other constituencies. On the figures since December 1997, the situation was worse in only 83 constituencies. Indeed, there has been an increase in unemployment since 2001. That year there were 781 unemployed people claiming benefit in the Kettering constituency, which has since increased by 451&#151;well above 60 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07012681000675">The increase in Kettering&#146;s unemployment far outstrips that for the east midlands as a whole, and for Great Britain as a whole. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough said, the reason for that is the decline in the manufacturing base. In 1997 Kettering had 9,000 manufacturing jobs, compared  <br>

with just over 7,000 today. Instead of 27 per cent. of the work force being employed in manufacturing, there are now just 17 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07012681000676">Somehow, constituencies such as Kettering have, unfortunately, been overlooked in the Government&#146;s efforts to tackle unemployment. Although the overall unemployment rate of 2.4 per cent. is low, the shift in the figures over the last five or six years is alarming to many of my constituents. The overwhelming reasonfor the change is, as my hon. Friend said, the increase in red tape faced by manufacturing businesses in Kettering and also the knock-on effect of the Government&#146;s increase in the rate of national insurance contributions. Although the money may have gone into the national health service, it has also piled on costs for manufacturing and other employers in Kettering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07012681000677">North Northamptonshire faces a huge challenge over the next 10, 15 or 20 years. The Government want to build 52,100 new houses, but in their plans they allow for only an extra 43,800 new jobs. We already have an unemployment problem, and if the Government are not careful, it will get a lot worse.</p>

Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) on securing the debate and I thank the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) for his comments. They both spoke up effectively for their constituents. I will address most of my comments to the hon. Member for Wellingborough, who initiated the debate, but much of what I say also applies to Kettering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07012681000679">The hon. Member for Wellingborough is right to say that unemployment in his constituency has increased recently. On examining the reasons for that, I noticed that over the last year, three companies made substantial lay-offs in his constituency&#151;Carlsberg, Avon and Golden Wonder. None of them comes under the label of traditional manufacturing, however, and I notice that he sought to lay the blame for the increase in unemployment on the decline in manufacturing employment. The situation is more complex than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07012681000680">I would like to take this opportunity to undertake a forensic examination of both unemployment and employment in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency. First, let me clear up how things stand now as opposed to May 1997 when this Government came to office. He referred to that in his speech, so I will respond. I know that he had a disagreement with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this issue in the House a short while ago, so here are the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07012681000681">In May 1997, when the Government came to office, the claimant count in Wellingborough was 1,826. Last month, as the hon. Gentleman has said, it was 1,536. I accept that that is an increase over the position a year ago, but I hope that he will also accept that, notwithstanding the recent increase, the claimant count is 290 lower than it was in the month that the Conservative Government left office. It represents a fall of 16 per cent. in his constituency. Furthermore the current claimant count represents 2.4 per cent. of his local work force. That is low by any standards and better than the United Kingdom average. He may be interested to know that the claimant count for the  <br>

<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>26 Jan 2007 : Column 1751</b><br>
whole of Northamptonshire in May 1997 was 9,522; it is currently 6,886&#151;a fall of 28 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07012681000682">The hon. Gentleman may also be interested in the wider historical perspective. I should point out that, for most of the 1990-97 period, unemployment in Wellingborough remained stubbornly above 2,000 and, in the depths of the 1992 recession, it was closer to 3,000. That was the second Tory recession. Duringthe first Tory recession in his constituency, the unemployment figure was more than 3,000. I offer the hon. Gentleman all that to put the current situation in context and not in any way to minimise at all the challenge faced by his constituents who are unemployed nor to dismiss the fact that the claimant count in Wellingborough has recently risen. I regret, just as much as he does, the loss of any job by any of his constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07012681000683">In a dynamic economy, even one such as ours which is now in a record period of sustained growth, there will be job losses. Some markets will decline, some firms will close, some will move, some will get taken over and job losses will result. The crucial questionsfor the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents and those in Kettering who may suffer job losses as a result of those trends are as follows. First, will there be another job for them to move to? Secondly, will it take them long to get that other job and, thirdly, if they need help to prepare for getting that job, is that help available? I want to look at those three questions in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07012681000684">The first question is whether there will be another job for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents to move to. The answer is yes. Last year, 4,695 of his constituents registered at some point during the year as unemployed, but 4,425 moved off the register in his constituency in the past year because they had found work. Furthermore, last year, no fewer than 6,300 job vacancies were notified to his local Jobcentre Plus. All that speaks of a dynamic local economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07012681000685">The second question his constituents need to have answered is, if they encounter unemployment, will it take them long to find the next job. The answer is that it certainly does not take as long as it used to. If we go back to December 1996, as the hon. Gentleman did, we find that, of the constituents who were then unemployed, 345 experienced unemployment for more than a year. Currently, the number of his constituents waiting more than a year to find a job is 60. He referred in his opening comments to the Labour party&#146;s commitment to eradicate long-term unemployment.As he will see in his constituency, long-term unemployment has declined dramatically. Now, more than two thirds of unemployed people in Wellingborough find a job within six months. Long-term unemployment in Wellingborough has fallenby 73 per cent. since 1997. Long-term youth unemployment has fallen by 52 per cent. Overall, there are now 4,700 more jobs in his constituency than there were in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07012681000686">The hon. Gentleman will recall that the third question was: is there extra help on hand for those who are seeking another job? The answer is yes. To start with, his constituents have been helped hugely by the new deal. Since it got under way, 2,130 people in Wellingborough have been helped into a job by the new  <br>

deal, including 860 young people and 980 lone parents. His party opposed the new deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07012681000687">There is also additional help. Basic skills support is available right across Northamptonshire. Four regional and two local European social fund contracts are available, targeted at longer-term unemployment. Job preparation courses are available through his local Jobcentre Plus office, supported locally by Wincanton, DTS, Morrisons, Milbury Care, Shaw Health Care and Asda. Work is also being done through the Wellingborough Prosper Group. I know that the local employer engagement manager at Jobcentre Plus has written to him to supply him with further details of local schemes to assist people who are seeking work. Pathways to work is already proving very successful. It will be implemented in his area next year. As he will also know, Wellingborough is part of the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area, which is forecast to create more than 13,000 further job opportunities by 2021.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07012681000688">The hon. Gentleman and I, and the hon. Member for Kettering, all want to see the claimant count in his area coming down. There is no debate whatsoever about that. For that to happen, the right macro-economic policies must be in place, which they are.We have a stable, growing economy that is creating jobs&#151;2.5 million across the country as a whole so far&#151;and attracting investment. Domestic business investment is strong and foreign investment in the United Kingdom is exceptionally strong. All that helps to deliver increased levels of employment. There is a labour force participation rate of 74.6 per cent., which is one of the highest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That situation is delivering lower levels of unemployment&#151;it has declined in every single region of the United Kingdom. It is also delivering a plentiful supply of job vacancies: there are 600,000. Long-term unemployment is down by three quarters. Long-term youth unemployment is down by two thirds. We also require the right strategy for the future, to build on that stability. That is why we are now aiming at an 80 per cent. labour force participation rate and why welfare reform that is now being implemented will introduce the employment support allowance and the extension of the pathways to work programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70126-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07012681000689">As with all other hon. Members, including myself, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s task is to work alongside all the key stakeholders in his area to ensure that the strategy locally means that his area is well positioned to take advantage of the strong national economy. There is a key role for his regional development agency, his local Jobcentre Plus office, local authorities, employers, colleges, the Connexions services, and many others. Get all that right and he will find that he can keep a steady flow of new jobs coming into his constituency. That is necessary to absorb the fact that, unfortunately, some of his constituents will from time to time, for a variety of reasons, find that they lose their jobs. If we want to be able to deliver further growth in employment for the future on top of the 4,700 extra jobs that have already come to his constituency since 1997, the crucial thing is to continue with the economic policies that we already have in place.</p>
