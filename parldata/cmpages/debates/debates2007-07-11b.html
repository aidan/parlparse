 I have in the past had the opportunity to visit Gaza and see for myself the real burdens and suffering experienced by many Palestinians. It is with regret that I say that, even since the visit I paid a number of years ago, the situation has deteriorated. We should bear in mind, for example, that amidst the economic growth that is being witnessed in many areas of the world, the Palestinian economy contracted by 10 per cent. last year. If I recollect the most recent figures correctly, the gross national income for the Palestinian Authority is about 7 per cent. of that of its neighbour, Israel. That shows the scale of the challenge faced to secure the economic development that all of us in this House want to see as part of finding a way forward in the middle east. My immediate travel plans are still being formulated, but I assure my right hon. Friend that I will give consideration to visiting the Palestinian territories, along with other areas.</p>

 I am at one with my hon. Friend in recognising the difficulties that are being experienced at Rafah.

Indeed, between 400 and 700 people are receiving help from Bedouin in a deserted area around Rafah. The tragic death of a mother of four children occurred recently, and that has added a specific poignancy and urgency to trying to find a way forward on Rafah. When my right hon.

thirdly, we need to continue to address the immediate humanitarian challenge while recognising the social and economic development needs of the Palestinians. It is right to place on record the fact that restraints on movement and access are a severe constraint on the capacity of the Palestinian economy to grow. Although, of course, it is necessary to provide humanitarian assistance with immediate effect, there is no substitute in the longer term for a sustainable, developed Palestinian economy. For that to happen, we need the restrictions on movement and access to be removed.</p>

 Following a decision that the former Foreign Secretary made on 18 June, we are now working to put in place practical and financial assistance to establish normal relations with the Palestinian Authority. That will inevitably take time and it is entirely appropriate for the EU to have reached a recent judgment that we should continue the temporary international mechanism until September. We have provided &#163;15 million to the temporary international mechanism to date. That support was necessarily provided to both the Gaza strip and the west bank. While we are in the process of transition, and given that the position continues to be fluid, I support the actions to extend the temporary international mechanism to September.</p>

As Bolivia is a middle-income country, our bilateral programme with it is relatively small.

 It is very interesting that the leader of the Conservative party did not ask anything about the married couples allowance or tax credits and that it has been left to the leader of the Liberal party to pick up the baton. Tax credits are the most successful policy in removing child poverty in this country: 6 million families benefit from tax credits. Yes, there was computer error to start with, but it is being substantially reduced and the right hon. and learned Gentleman should admit that 600,000 children are not in poverty today because they are receiving tax credits.</p>

The child tax credit was &#163;27 and it is rising for the poorest families to more than &#163;70, compared with &#163;28 when the Conservatives were in power.

 For over one and a half centuries, the annual Gracious Address has been drafted inside Government and agreed by the Cabinet far from the public arena, but I believe that it is right, in the interests of good and open government and public debate, that each year the Prime Minister make a summer statement to the House so that initial thinking, previously private, can be the subject of widespread and informed public debate. Today, in advance of final decisions, the Leader of the House is publishing details of our initial list of proposed legislative measures, inviting debate on them in both Houses this month and making provision for region-by-region deliberation and responses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07071161000166">To respond to the rising aspirations of the British people we must deliver new and better opportunities in education, employment and the provision of housing and health care, and ensure that in a fast-changing world there is opportunity and security not just for some people, but for all British people. A new educational opportunity Bill will mean that for the first time not just some but all young people will be able to stay in education or training until the age of 18. The new pensions Bill will ensure that, for the first time, not just some but all working people have the right to a workplace pension, with a duty on every employer to contribute towards it.</p>

Let me tell the House the scale of the new opportunities for home buying and to rent that we are proposing. In two eras of the last century&#151;the inter-war years and the 1950s onwards&#151;Britain made new house building a national priority. Now, through this decade and right up to 2020, I want us, in environmentally friendly ways, using principally brownfield land and building eco-towns and villages, to meet housing need by building over 250,000 more homes than previously planned. That would be a total by 2020 of 3 million new homes for families across the country. For England, we will raise the annual house building target for 2016 from 200,000 houses a year to 240,000 new homes a year.</p>

Similar discussions are being undertaken with the Department for Transport, the Highways Agency and the British Railways Board residuary body, and the Department of Health is undertaking an urgent review of surplus land owned by NHS organisations and trusts. I can announce that in total over 550 sites owned by central Government are now being examined for housing development, with the potential for up to 100,000 new homes. In addition, we estimate that another 60,000 homes can be built on brownfield land currently owned by local authorities.

We are committed to building a broad consensus on the right balance between protecting our national security and safeguarding the civil liberties of every individual in this country, so the Home Secretary plans to consult on, and we will seek an all-party consensus on, new measures to ensure more successful prosecutions against terrorist suspects and increased penalties for terrorists charged with other criminal offences. We will consult on, and hope to achieve a consensus on, the period of pre-charge detention where, for terrorism alone, exceptional circumstances in my view make it necessary, while ensuring rigorous judicial oversight and parliamentary accountability, that we extend the time.

Just as with the challenge of securing justice and security for all, the challenge for the Government and the foundation of next Session&#146;s legislative programme is to support all parents with children, not just some; to invest in the educational chances of all young people, not just a few; to offer more people the chance to get on the housing ladder for the first time; to help more people into work; and to give all patients the best health care. In this way, we respond to the rising aspirations of the British people, by ensuring that the opportunities that are today available to only some are available to all.

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07071161000180">The Prime Minister says that he wants to build more homes, but did he not say that in 1994, 1998, 2005 and 2006? Is it not the case that every year the Government have built less social housing than was built in any year under their predecessor? Was not the announcement about building on MOD land made in May 2006, and again today? He says that he wants 25-year mortgages, but did he not first announce that four years ago? He wants apprenticeships and universal education after 16, but I have checked the record and he told us that in 1996&#151;a year before he even came to office. For 10 years he has plotted and schemed for the top job, but all we have got is a sort of re-release of the 1997 manifesto. The country has moved on, but he simply has not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07071161000181">Let us deal with whether the Prime Minister is really listening to people&#146;s priorities, which is what he told us on the radio this morning. Some 86 per cent. of people in this country want a referendum on the European treaty, so where is the Bill for a referendum? Does that not show that his promise to listen is a complete and utter sham? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 Let us take a look at the areas where we agree. As I have said before, we shall work with the Government on anti-terror legislation to make this country safe from terrorists. I am glad that the Prime Minister has agreed to my proposal for the Privy Council committee to consider the use of intercept evidence. He has also taken up our idea of interviews after charge. He has said again today that he is considering our border police proposals. Will he confirm that they could be introduced in the Queen&#146;s Speech this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07071161000184">Let us look at other proposals. On housing, the Prime Minister says that it is difficult for people to get their foot on the housing ladder, but who does he think is responsible for that? It was his Government who doubled the council tax, restricted the right to buy and increased stamp duty, including for first-time buyers. Will he confirm that as a result, home ownership in Britain is actually falling for the first time since figures were published? Is that not Labour&#146;s record on housing? As Chancellor, he launched the planning gain supplement in a great blaze of glory, but is he not back-pedalling on it today? As he broke the housing ladder, why should anyone think that he is the right person to mend it?</p>

Today, we have an NHS in which nurses are being sacked, accident and emergency units are closing and junior doctors are having to leave the country to look for work. A week ago, the Prime Minister announced a fundamental review of the NHS. Today, he is promising fundamental legislation on the NHS. Either the review is bogus or the legislation has not been thought through, or&#151;knowing this Government&#151;probably both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07071161000188">Ten years ago, the Government said that education was their priority, yet 10 years later almost half of our 11-year-olds cannot read, write or add up properly. The number of young people not in work, education or training has actually gone up under this Government to over 1 million. The one change that the Prime Minister and his new Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families are making seems to be going in entirely the wrong direction. Does not the Prime Minister intend to dilute the reform agenda by giving academies less independence? What we need is more freedom for schools, more power for head teachers and more choice for parents. While the previous Prime Minister was beginning to move in the right direction on education, is this one not moving in the wrong direction?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07071161000189">The Prime Minister has talked about the constitution. We proposed, and will support, measures that genuinely strengthen Parliament and decentralise power. However, real change means giving the House of Commons the right to determine its own timetable; real change means a proper bill of rights to replace the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;and, I have to say to the Prime Minister, real change means addressing the West Lothian question. I ask him again: where is the fairness in allowing Scottish MPs the right to vote on hospitals, schools and housing in my constituency, while no MP is allowed to vote on hospitals, schools and health in his constituency?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70711-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07071161000190">So much for what was in the draft Queen&#146;s Speech; let us see what was left out. There was nothing in this speech to address Britain&#146;s broken society. Where are the measures to address teenage pregnancy, drug addiction and personal debt? Where are the measures to strengthen families and marriage? Where is the package to tackle the highest rate of family breakdown in Europe? The Prime Minister knows that he cannot tackle social breakdown because he has presided over social breakdown.</p>

First, he says that there will be a pensions Bill. Will it give faster help to the 125,000 people who have been left with no pension under his Government? Secondly, will he announce a moratorium on A and E and maternity unit closures, and an end to the top-down targets that are leading to NHS cuts? Thirdly, will he give the British people a referendum on the European constitution, which they all want? Three straight questions; let us have three straight answers.</p>

 The answers to the right hon.

We have instructed a review of the assets of bankrupt companies and their pension funds, and we believe that we will be able to move the 80 per cent. guarantee that we have given further towards to 90 per cent.

I would have thought that he would be gracious enough to support that move. On his third question, on the European referendum, I think that he should listen to some other voices in his own party. The debate within his own party is raging at the moment, with Lord Heseltine saying that, as a result of our achieving our red lines in the negotiations, if we can secure the amending treaty, there is no case for a referendum.

Parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of facilities to divert young people from involvement in antisocial behaviour in the first place. I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s determination to use dormant money to improve youth services, and I would ask for two particular things. First, this money should be additional to the resources that councils currently make available. Secondly, councils should be encouraged to engage with the local community before the money is freed up. It is crucial to engage the local community.

 One of the great causes of the next decade will be to improve youth facilities and amenities in all our communities. As I go around the country, I meet people who rightly say that we must be tough on antisocial behaviour, but people also tell me very clearly that there is little for many young people to do. The law-abiding decent majority of young people need better facilities, and we have to do something about that. That is why the unclaimed assets Bill will provide additional money for youth services and facilities. At the same time, there will be improvements in the method by which the money can be dispensed. As the hon. Gentleman probably knows, in a previous Budget we set up youth budgets for local areas, whereby young people themselves can take decisions about how the money is spent. We will review how that is working and take a decision on the best way forward. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend&#146;s views on how we can best achieve that.</p>

<a name="70711-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07071161000451"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to establish a national compulsory proof of age scheme for persons aged between 16 and 21 years in connection with the purchase of alcohol, tobacco, knives, air weapons and other items; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07071161000282">Because of the current absence of a national biometric identity card, the Bill is necessary for reasons I shall set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07071161000283">Every day in Britain, hard-working shop workers ensure that we can get hold of everything from A to Z&#151;from apples to cuddly zebras&#151;and are involved in millions of transactions, many of which involve age-restricted items such as alcohol, cigarettes, knives and airguns. Conflict does not usually arise over sales of apples or cuddly toys but, sadly, it all too frequently arises over the sale of age-restricted items. Research shows that the refusal to sell age-restricted products is the most common cause of verbal abuse towards shop staff and that it can also provoke physical violence. It is believed that as many as 90 per cent. of shop workers have suffered some form of abuse, and many of them do so daily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07071161000284">As well as verbal abuse, shop workers are often subjected to physical abuse, ranging from being spat at to violent assault. For example, a shop worker who refused to serve a bottle of beer to someone whom they thought was under age was told that they would be knifed. Other shop workers report being beaten up for refusing to sell alcohol to young lads. Thankfully, according to the most recent figures, incidents of violent abuse against shop workers have declined. That is in part owing to initiatives such as the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers&#146; successful &#147;Freedom from Fear&#148; campaign, and USDAW is today celebrating its &#147;respect for shop workers&#148; day. I pay tribute to it for its work in raising the profile of the millions of shop workers who serve us each and every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07071161000285">One way of addressing the problem of assault on shop workers is to foster a culture of &#147;No ID, no sale&#148;, so that customers know that if they look under 21, they will need to show proof of age. That would help to defuse tension and reduce opportunities for confrontation when a customer is challenged about their age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07071161000286">I fear that the problems associated with selling age-restricted products will peak this autumn when the age at which tobacco products can be sold rises from 16 to 18. Many young people who are approaching their 18th birthday will have been buying cigarettes legally for almost two years but will no longer be able to do so. Similar increases in the minimum age for purchase will rightly apply to knives, airguns and crossbows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07071161000287">I am particularly concerned about the availability of so-called pendant knives. They look like a piece of jewellery, but they contain two blades that fold out. I was horrified to learn that that item can be sold legally as it is not a concealed blade and the blades are not long enough to make it illegal. I fail to understand how  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2007 : Column 1470</b><br>
such items can be justified, but I look forward to the date when at least no one under 18 can buy one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07071161000288">The Bill has two key points: it proposes that we have a nationally recognised, Government-controlled proof of age scheme, and that that be compulsory for those aged 16 to 21 who wish to make restricted purchases. Let us be clear about what we are addressing. Tobacco and alcohol are not the only items whose purchase is age-restricted. Other age-restricted products include fireworks, which can cause great misery in the hands of people who misuse them, DVDs, videos and solvents&#151;the problems associated with solvent misuse have been raised with the Prime Minister. Other items include aerosol paints&#151;young people sometimes use them to put their tags on walls&#151;lottery tickets, petrol and crossbows. It is right and proper that such items are sold only to those who are deemed to be of a suitable age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07071161000289">It would be wrong to claim that there are no voluntary schemes already in place to train and support shop workers in order to help them meet their legal obligations and check the age of customers. Many Members will be aware of the pass scheme, and I pay tribute to all involved in that, including the drinks industry, which plays an active role. The pass scheme is supported by robust audits carried out by trading standards bodies, and only accredited cards may bear the registered hologram. About 2 million such cards are in use, and where they are applied, their use is beneficial. However, as well as the four national card schemes that are accredited by a pass, there are also about 20 local authority entitlement cards, which also provide proof of age, and numerous other non-accredited schemes. More worryingly, there are cards showing false details that can be downloaded and printed from the internet. Furthermore, in some parts of the country it is more usual for young people to use passports or driving licences to prove their age. I understand that it is estimated that about two thirds of those aged 18 and 19 have passports, and that a similar proportion have driving licences. Inevitably, there is a significant overlap between those two groups, so perhaps a quarter of all those aged 18 and 19 do not have some form of official Government proof of age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07071161000290">Apart from the costs involved, what are the dangers in carrying around such documents? Identity theft dangers are heightened. Passports and other documents can easily be stolen when people are on a night out. Replacing them is both costly and time consuming. It is an administrative burden for the young person, the police and the passport agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07071161000291">There is currently a variety of proof of age cards and documents, and, although the pass hologram should be widely recognised, a young person who visits elsewhere in the country&#151;perhaps a person from Stoke-on-Trent visiting a friend in Portsmouth&#151;might find that his proof of age card is not recognised there. A single, national, Government-run scheme would simplify the position on proof of age by removing the myriad schemes. Its establishment would also raise the profile of the single scheme in the minds of customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07071161000292">If we were to have compulsion, that would help create the culture we need to foster whereby anyone who looks under the age of 21&#151;I can only wish that that included me&#151;automatically shows their proof of age when purchasing age-restricted items. If showing a  <br>

proof of age card is compulsory, that should take off the shop worker the pressure of having to ask to see such proof. That in turn should lead to less scope for confrontation and less abuse and assault of our shop workers. Regardless of how well a voluntary scheme might be run, I do not believe that it would stop abuse of shop workers. The scheme must be compulsory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07071161000293">Although we may no longer be described as a nation of shopkeepers, we should celebrate the work our shop workers do&#151;often at times when the rest of the population is not at work, such as early in the morning, late in the evening, at weekends, and during holidays and bank holidays. Our shop workers deserve the greatest respect, and to be treated properly. My Bill would add to the protection of those hard-working men and women. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

Unfortunately, I cannot prefer their amendment to our motion, because the latter faces up to the reality of international comparisons in stroke care and the wide discrepancies and deficiencies in it across the UK. I wish that we could have had a combined motion, because the purpose of this debate is not to engage in partisan argument, but to raise the priority of stroke care.

There are voluntary organisations, including patient representative groups such as the Stroke Association and Different Strokes, and national organisations, such as the Royal College of Physicians, which through the National Sentinel stroke audit has brought forward much vital information about the quality of stroke services and helped to push forward the improvements that have been occurring. I do not want to leave out clinical leaders such as Tony Rudd at St. Thomas&#146;, Peter Rothwell in Oxford and Gary Ford in Newcastle, or the work of the Department of Health in the past 18 months, led by Roger Boyle, the national clinical director, and the team of officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07071161000302">Nor should we ignore the role of the National Audit Office. The report that it produced in November 2005 was a remarkable example of the value of the NAO, not only in considering issues of value for money and public expenditure, but in examining how services can be improved in ways that have radically changed attitudes in the Government about what can be achieved in stroke care.</p>

 My hon. Friend kindly mentions the NAO report and I am proud of the work that it and the Public Accounts Committee have done in this area. I hope that we can do for stroke what we did for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in bringing it to the forefront of the political agenda. I hope that we are now doing that for dementia, as well. Will he comment on our particular view that so many people are left debilitated, and therefore become an increased cost to the NHS, because of the lack of early scans in hospitals?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the work of not only the NAO but the Public Accounts Committee, which has followed up on the issue in the same way as it followed up the original inquiry into health care-acquired infections. It revisited that subject and made further important recommendations, which have helped to raise the importance of the issue. He makes an important point: one of the NAO&#146;s recommendations was the need for immediate access to screening.</p>

Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) spoke, Professor Anthony Rudd outlined the 2006 National Sentinel audit results and explained that across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 226 hospital sites were offering CT scanning, but only 18 per cent. were able to provide scanning within four hours. On weekdays, the vast majority of trusts were able to do a scan within 48 hours, although 7 per cent. could not. However, at weekends, 35 per cent. were taking longer than 48 hours. So scans for stroke patients are being delayed, even though we know that time lost is brain lost in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07071161000306">At that same conference, Professor Norrving from Lund university in Sweden said that his country had a virtually 100 per cent. delivery rate for CT scans within 24 hours and Professor Bladin from Melbourne, Australia described how all patients at his hospital have immediate access to scanning. Those international comparisons should serve to demonstrate to us what a dramatic difference there is in the quality of stroke care being provided in this country compared with some of the leading examples across the world.</p>

 My hon. Friend is rightly concentrating on acute care, but does he agree, given his stated interest in public health, that it is important for the health and welfare of the nation that, wherever possible, we avoid stroke incidents at source? There is still a huge national problem of undiagnosed, undetected and unremediated hypertension. Will he encourage the Department to do everything possible, through GPs and otherwise, to ensure that that is tackled, alongside the acute services to which he rightly draws attention?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was not intending to dwell on that important point, but the evidence, not least from Stroke Association surveys, is that the public have far too limited an awareness of what stroke is. They have become confused about the issue and perhaps just a bare majority understand that a stroke is a brain attack. Even fewer have a clear understanding of what leads to a stroke. In recent examples, such as the Food Standards Agency&#146;s campaign on salt reduction, raising the public awareness of the need to reduce salt intake has been focused on the risk of a heart attack. That is valid, but it was done on the basis that the public did not understand the relationship between salt intake, hypertension and stroke. In fact, in terms of mortality and morbidity, stroke is the greater risk, so we need to work harder on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07071161000309">The quality and outcomes framework for general practitioners rightly includes the management of hypertension, but&#151;as my hon. Friend suggests&#151;many people do not yet know their blood pressure and, in cases in which it is appropriate, are not properly monitored or attempting to address the problem through diet and exercise or even medication. We need to make that happen, because reducing the incidence of stroke must be one of our key priorities. The awareness of stroke and how to prevent it should form part of our strategy, and the NAO made that clear.</p>

 My hon. Friend draws attention to the need for better care for stroke sufferers. Some 110,000 people suffer from stroke each year, and last December I was among them. I was extremely lucky, because I received excellent care from the specialist stroke unit at St. Mary&#146;s hospital on the Isle of Wight. I owe them so much for that and would like to thank them all publicly for it. Does my hon. Friend agree that other people in other places need care as good and as local as ours is on the island?</p>

 I am delighted, on behalf of colleagues on both sides of the House, to welcome back my hon. Friend. I know that he has already been active in his constituency, but we are delighted to have him here. I share entirely his view, and we should not forget the many staff working in stroke care who are delivering excellent care. However, we need to be aware of the lack of stroke physicians and services. As the Sentinel audit recently made clear, we have limited numbers of consultant nurse posts and a quarter of hospitals have no specialist stroke nurses available. Those are essential parts of the process of delivering high-quality stroke care. However, I entirely share my hon. Friend&#146;s view about the need to match what has been achieved on the Isle of Wight.</p>

Wales are more likely to die from stroke, and that, if they do survive, they will have higher levels of disability than patients in England or Northern Ireland. Does that not reflect the lamentable state of affairs in Wales and a failure on the part of the Welsh Assembly Government?</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. I was about to come to the findings of the 2006 National Sentinel audit of stroke care. The first of its top 10 recommendations is that</p>
<a name="70711-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07071161000453"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Welsh Assembly Government, Commissioners, Managers and Clinicians should urgently address the growing divide in quality of stroke care between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. The highest priority should be given to the development of specialist stroke services, both in hospital with full provision of stroke units and in the community.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para21"><a name="07071161000316">I am afraid that it felt compelled to say that the very low rate of stroke unit admission in Wales was unacceptable. My hon. Friend, given his responsibilities, will be pressing for precisely that priority to be given in Wales. It is important for us to recognise that today&#146;s debate&#151;from our point of view&#151;is about stroke services in the United Kingdom, not just in England. I hope that the Government hear that message and communicate it to the Welsh Assembly Government. I know that my hon. Friend will do exactly that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para22"><a name="07071161000317">In looking at the Sentinel audit, I do not want to diminish the progress that is being made, in part, precisely because stroke physicians have been pressing for it. For example, there has been an increase in the number of specialist stroke units in hospitals in England&#151;up to 91 per cent. from 79 per cent. in the previous audit&#151;but only 62 per cent. of patients are admitted to a specialist stroke unit. However, that is an increase on previous figures. There has been an increase in the number of neurovascular clinics, which means that transient ischaemic attacks&#151;mini-strokes, as it were&#151;are increasingly followed up in clinics. However, we need to do more. As I said, there are too few stroke physicians and too few specialist stroke nurses, and only 22 per cent. of hospitals have an early supported discharge team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70711-0007.htm_para23"><a name="07071161000318">One central issue in the development of stroke care is acute care&#151;treating stroke as an emergency. Here, I pay tribute to the Stroke Association, which ran a campaign entitled &#147;Stroke is a medical emergency&#148; and uses the FAST protocol&#151;the face, arm, speech test protocol&#151;developed by Gary Ford and his colleagues at Newcastle university. The publishing and dissemination of such developments across the country is a vital part of raising awareness of the fact that stroke is an emergency.</p>

structures required have become increasingly clear; indeed, on visiting other places throughout the world&#151;the NAO visited Australia&#151;one can see precisely how they can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07071161000320">The Sentinel audit tells us how far we have come. In Australia, after immediate CT scanning, all those patients for whom thrombolysis is appropriate get access to it. About 10 per cent. of stroke patients get such access. According to the audit, however, in the preceding year 218 patients in this country were thrombolysed, representing 0.2 per cent. of all such patients. That is an enormous disparity. Some 18 per cent. of hospitals in this country still have no specialist acute stroke unit, and only 10 per cent. of hospitalised stroke patients are admitted directly to an acute stroke unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07071161000321">Those two elements are central: patients should be admitted directly to a unit capable of undertaking immediate CT scanning; and, where appropriate, they should undergo thrombolysis. In any case, such patients should be admitted directly to specialist stroke units, and should in virtually all cases spend their time in hospital in such a unit. We have known about these issues for some time, but we have by no means made sufficient progress on them. The NAO report was clear on the benefits that could accrue from treating such cases as emergencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07071161000322">The point was brought home to me some three or four weeks ago, when I attended the memorial service for Sir Arthur Marshall. After the service, a gentleman named Ivan came up to me and said, &#147;You&#146;re interested in stroke and involved in Westminster&#146;s all-party group on stroke&#151;I&#146;d like to help. I used to work at Marshall Aerospace, and I woke up one night a year or so back and I couldn&#146;t speak, couldn&#146;t feel anything and couldn&#146;t move the left side of my body. I was taken to Addenbrooke&#146;s hospital&#148;&#151;Addenbrooke&#146;s is in my constituency&#151;&#147;and I had a CT scan straight away and I was thrombolysed.&#148; Presumably, he is one of the 218 patients to whom I referred earlier. I looked at him and said, &#147;Well, it&#146;s clearly gone very well.&#148; The extent of his subsequent loss of brain function is that occasionally he has pins and needles in his left hand. Previously, he would probably have had full left-side paralysis. So, dramatic differences have been made, and we need to be aware of the scale of what we can achieve if we take such steps.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a very good point. It is absolutely critical that we get patients scanned as quickly as possible, but in rural areas such as my own in Devon, that is not always possible. Will he join me in congratulating Devon air ambulance on its continuing work? It gets no money from the Government whatever, but it plays an absolutely critical role in getting people from remote areas to the hospitals that can treat them quickly.</p>

The health service supports the paramedics and the other medical and clinical aspects of the service, but putting the helicopter in the sky and maintaining it is funded entirely from voluntary support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07071161000325">The NAO report makes certain things very clear. For example, it estimates that admitting stroke patients to, and treating them in, a stroke unit could save up to 550 lives. It says that transient ischaemic attacks should be followed up rapidly in a clinic, given that there is a 20 per cent. risk of a stroke immediately following a TIA. Such action can forestall and prevent major strokes. For many patients who suffer from artery occlusion, sclerotic artery surgery produces benefits within 14 days. Interestingly, the PAC and the NAO identified that such changes, which would substantially improve outcomes for patients, would not cost the NHS more. If all those measures were implemented, there would be an overall saving to the NHS, not an additional cost. The aim is a change in the design of services, and to get the NHS to respond by prioritising service delivery, which would be better for patients and better for the NHS in value-for-money terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07071161000326">Where do we go from here? One purpose of the debate is to raise the profile of the issue of stroke. Another purpose was to try to make sure that the Government publish their consultation on a national stroke strategy before the House rises for the summer, but I am delighted to say that the Secretary of State did that on Monday, which means that we can debate it. Happily, plenty of Opposition Members are present, and a few Labour Members are too, but I hope that more colleagues are listening to the debate, or will read it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07071161000327">I want to encourage colleagues in all parties to include in their constituency engagements a visit to their local hospitals to talk about the stroke services that are provided. In addition, I hope that hon. Members with a branch of the Stroke Association in their areas will talk to its members&#151;for myself, I am patron of the Stroke and Dysphasia Association in Cambridgeshire. We should all make sure that we have conversations with everyone involved over the next three months, as the consultation on the national stroke strategy ends on 12 October, which means that the scope will be limited when we return after the recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07071161000328">I welcome the Government&#146;s publication of the document &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148;. Clearly, it was a very inclusive process, and many of the people I know to be leaders in the field were engaged in the working groups that led to the document. It is very important that the Government show that priority is now attached to stroke. Unfortunately, a top-down system such as the NHS needs to show top-down priority, so it is important that the Department of Health has published a document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07071161000329">I do not want to be at all churlish but, although the document published on Monday sets out very well the sort of ambitions that we must have for a stroke service in the future, there were few surprises or novelties on top of what the National Audit Office produced 20 months previously. I am therefore slightly at a loss as to the purpose of having a consultation on a national stroke strategy now, given that the document makes it clear that the Government know what they think the stroke service should be like. As I understood it, the  <br>

Government&#146;s document was intended to turn the NAO recommendations of 20 months ago into an action plan. It was supposed to show how we should get from here to there, but in many respects the document that has been produced does not achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07071161000330">As some of my hon. Friends made clear earlier, the availability of CT scanning is absolutely fundamental. Does the national stroke strategy make clear how, for example, diagnostic contracts and the like will be used to ensure that CT scanning is available 24/7? The strategy presents the model of a hub-and-spoke system, as we always knew it would, but its parameters are still too wide. For instance, we need to be clear about the scale of population to be covered by such a system, and the length of time that people will stay in each hyper-acute stroke unit. We also need to be sure that such questions are followed up in individual locations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07071161000331">A month ago, Manchester started work on producing its local service plan. The document that has been produced there says that patients admitted to a hyper-acute stroke unit should be scanned and given immediate treatment&#151;including thrombolysis, if necessary&#151;and also be given access to the earliest possible rehabilitation. However, what is interesting is that the document suggests that people need spend only 24 hours in such a unit. I have visited many places across the country, and talked to a lot of senior managers. They tend to imagine that creating better acute care for stroke sufferers will involve concentrating stroke units into larger units at specialised hospitals. In contrast, the people in Manchester have not adopted that approach. Instead, they seem to be saying that the hyper-acute phase needs to be concentrated, but that patients should be referred back to their local hospitals 24 or 48 hours later; each such hospital should have a specialist, multi-disciplinary stroke unit, where hospital treatment can be concluded and people discharged early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07071161000332">That is different from the approach adopted by many in the NHS around the country. Sir Ara Darzi&#146;s report, &#147;Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action&#148;, does not appear fully to have taken on board the thinking in Manchester, as it continues to propose a limited number of specialist stroke units in a limited number of specialist hospitals. That does not have to be the structure at all.</p>

<p><a name="st_o184"><a name="07071161000333"><a name="70711-0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="07071161000669"><b>Mr. James Gray (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making an extremely interesting point. In my area, Chippenham hospital has one of the best stroke rehabilitation units in the country, and it recently won the Sentinel award for the best in England. However, it is not in the same PCT as Swindon&#146;s Great Western hospital, which is where the acute unit is located. A number of patients have been stuck in the acute unit because Wiltshire PCT cannot afford to move them to the rehabilitation unit down the road. Is that example not especially worrying?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, as he has illustrated very well the point that I hope I was making.

we want to achieve. For some time we have argued that unbundling the tariff&#151;that is, dividing the acute phase from the subsequent rehabilitation phase&#151;is important. The Department of Health has done that, but the structure proposed in Manchester would require dividing the tariff into three phases: the hyper-acute first 48 hours, the subsequent initiation of rehabilitation and support, and then rehabilitation in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07071161000335">The tariff is anything but clear about how it will support and incentivise the process of commissioning. Unfortunately, if it does not reflect the best possible standard of care, it can substantially inhibit the introduction of such care. For example, a manager at Kingston hospital told me that his hospital wanted to be able to provide acute stroke care in the form advised, but that the tariff did not support that. We therefore need to concentrate on the tariff: although I hesitate to talk about something that can be a preoccupation for NHS anoraks, it is very important that we get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07071161000336">The document &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148; contains many elements that read extremely well and are clearly the right things to do, but one or two criticisms remain. For example, GP protocols for the referral of patients after a transient ischaemic attack were set out first in the national service framework for older people in 2001. They were supposed to be implemented across the country by April 2004, but now they are being repeated in a document published in July 2007. It is not good enough for policy makers to publish documents which reiterate the standards of service that we want to achieve but find that progress is inadequate and that the available levers to ensure that those standards are achieved are not being used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07071161000337">Obviously, the Secretary of State cannot add very much to a document that he published on Monday, but his foreword says that it is the &#147;first step&#148; to a national strategy. It is not the first step&#151;it is about the 13th, and we need the strategy to be turned, rapidly, into action. I have talked to ambulance service staff across the country, and they know that in a few months they will be delivering emergency patients in acute need to hospitals. That is already happening in some places, but it will be no good if the NHS fails to treat patients as emergencies from that point onwards. The evidence is absolutely clear that such patients must be treated in specialist units, and that subsequent support by multi-disciplinary rehab teams in the community is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para15"><a name="07071161000338">Too often, stroke patients tell us that they feel that going out into the community is like falling off the edge of a cliff. They leave a supported service in a hospital context and move to a place where the social services and the NHS services do not join up and the necessary teams do not exist. From the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report, we know that six months after leaving hospital 50 per cent. of patients feel that they are not getting the standard of care they should, and that 12 months afterwards the number has risen to 80 per cent. Half the stroke patients who want to be involved in a local support group are not; 28 per cent. feel that they are not getting help when they need it to deal with mobility problems; 49 per cent. do not receive help with emotional problems when they need it; and  <br>

26 per cent. feel they are not given help with speech problems when they need it. It is tragic that large numbers of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists cannot find jobs in those services when they leave college, even though we know there is a specific need for them to provide such therapy for stroke patients. Their participation is needed in community multi-disciplinary teams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para16"><a name="07071161000339">At the risk of borrowing a phrase, the purpose of the debate is to say that a lot has been done, but there is a lot more to do.</p>

International comparisons tell us just how far we need to go and how important it is that we make rapid progress. Even on adjusted mortality data, there are differences of between 10 and 30 per cent. between the UK and a range of European countries. We have higher than predicted levels of mortality from stroke, so we need to bring the rates down and match the best in Europe and, in this context, the best in countries such as Australia. We need to do it now.</p>

Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) for his work over many years, both in a personal capacity and as chair of the all-party stroke group, in raising awareness of the terrible impact that strokes can have upon individuals and their families. He was kind enough to point out that we pay tribute to his work in our amendment, but he rather modestly neglected to mention the all-party group in his motion. I welcome the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman opened the debate. This is an issue where parliamentarians can get together to move things forward. There are many such subjects in health, but this is one of the most important on which we need to find consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para22"><a name="07071161000348">On behalf of Members on the Government Benches, I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welcome back to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner). We have missed him since December and are pleased to see him back looking so fit and well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07071161000349">Every year, 110,000 people in England have a stroke, which is one every five minutes, so given the time available for this debate, between 15 and 20 people could have a stroke during its course. With 50,000 deaths, strokes represent the third biggest killer after cancer and heart disease&#151;killing three times as many women every year as breast cancer. Strokes are the greatest cause of severe disability. More than 300,000 adults in England suffer lasting disabilities as a result of a stroke. The cost to our economy runs to billions&#151;but that is, of course, immaterial when set against the terrible turmoil that befalls survivors and their families, whose lives can be devastated, literally overnight, by such attacks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07071161000350">I disagreed little with the comments of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire; his analysis was right, in terms of both the debilitating nature of strokes and, more important, the need to give stroke prevention and care much greater attention and priority. It is true that the Department of Health has focused particularly on cancer and heart disease, which are the country&#146;s two biggest killers, and we have made huge progress. Cancer deaths are down by 15.7 per cent. since 1997, saving more than 50,000 lives; while cardiovascular deaths are down by almost 36 per cent., saving almost 150,000 lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70711-0008.htm_para25"><a name="07071161000351">At the same time, attention has been paid to the third major killer. In 2001, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, we published the national service framework for older people, pledging that every trust in England would have a specialist stroke service&#151;a necessary target that has been achieved. We have also helped to improve standards. A recent study by the Royal College of Physicians showed that 95 per cent. of stroke units now have most of the necessary elements for a good-quality service, compared with just 72 per cent. in 2001. Our efforts to improve public health&#151;on smoking, fitness and obesity&#151;have played a vital role in our quest to reduce the number of strokes. Since 1993, deaths from strokes have fallen by 30 per cent. for over-65-year-olds and are down by 23 per cent. for those under the age of 65.</p>

We are able to build on strong foundations. We now possess far greater knowledge about lifestyle factors and how they can cause strokes than we did 10 years ago. We have learned more about techniques in rehabilitative long-term care and how acute care can be managed in the community. Technology has advanced considerably, particularly for brain imaging and scanning, so we can now dramatically reduce the number of people killed or left severely disabled by a stroke.

Member for South Cambridgeshire to use the impending recess to contribute fully in their constituencies so that we can produce a final strategy by the end of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07071161000355">I do not believe that improving our performance in this area is related purely to funding. As the hon. Gentleman said, England spends more on stroke services than many other nations, both in absolute terms and as a share of total health spending, and yet we do not get the best results. Many hospitals and primary care trusts, such as King&#146;s College hospital, which I visited on Monday, are already achieving great things. We know that clot-busting thrombolytic drugs can make the difference between someone who has suffered a stroke leaving hospital on their feet or in a wheelchair. However, overall in England last year, a tiny percentage&#151;less than 1 per cent.&#151;of patients received thrombolysis. King&#146;s has already achieved rates of 18 per cent. this year. The hon. Gentleman referred to Australia, which is achieving 10 per cent. As a result of a dramatic reconstruction along the lines suggested in the consultation document, Ontario is now achieving 37 per cent. thrombolysis, which is up from 3.2 per cent. just four years ago.</p>

 I think that I am right in saying that there are 640 patients per stroke consultant, compared with 360 patients per cardiac consultant. Does the Secretary of State hope to reassess and address that figure in some way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="07071161000357"><a name="70711-0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="07071161000675"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 Yes, it is absolutely essential that we do that. I will come on to say something about that when talking about the report. That is obviously a mismatch. I believe that Professor Roger Boyle says in his report&#151;he certainly said it to me&#151;that the whole stroke area is where heart disease was 10 years ago. We need to bring it up to today&#146;s levels, particularly in terms of the number of consultants and clinicians who specialise in the area. The key to success will be ensuring that more people do the right things at the right time at all stages of the patient pathway. Strokes, perhaps more than any other illness, are time-critical, so speed is of the essence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07071161000358">There are three elements to the consultation report. First, there is prevention. Historically, strokes have been a poorly understood condition. They are inevitably linked to the over-65s and to old age. In the past, the fatalistic approach was to wait until a stroke occurred and then deal with the consequences afterwards&#151;at great personal cost to the victim, and, incidentally, greater expense to the health service. About one in four long-term beds in the NHS are occupied by stroke patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07071161000359">Some strokes have genetic causes, but many people suffer needlessly because they do not recognise that they are risk or know what they can do to lessen that risk. Early action can help to prevent many strokes. We must ensure that better co-ordinated support is available for those at risk so that they are encouraged to monitor their blood pressure and cholesterol, take regular exercise, stop smoking and reduce their salt intake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07071161000360">We must refute the myth that strokes affect only older people. One in four victims are under 65. We must also promote awareness among communities that are most at risk. People from African, Caribbean or south Asian backgrounds are twice as likely to suffer a stroke as the rest of the population. We have already funded some pilot publicity campaigns, together with the Stroke Association, and will look very carefully at the results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07071161000361">Some people do not know how to recognise the symptoms of a stroke, either in themselves or in others. That can prove tragic when someone has suffered a minor stroke&#151;known as a transient ischaemic attack or TIA. TIAs indicate a serious problem: part of the brain is not getting enough blood. Without treatment, around one in four people will go on to have a full stroke&#151;most within the following few days. Provided that people are aware of that, it can be prevented&#151;sometimes with something as simple as aspirin and sometimes with an operation to unblock the arteries in the neck. We need a radical transformation of attitudes and actions to prevent strokes from occurring. The consultation document sets out an ambitious new vision: people who are assessed as being at high risk of a stroke should be seen by specialists and scanned within 24 hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07071161000362">Secondly, we must ensure that there are quicker emergency treatments for those who have suffered from a stroke. Advances in technology mean that we can  <br>

dramatically reduce the number of people who die or are left with severe disability after a major stroke&#151;again, provided we get to them quickly enough. There is a window of only three hours in which patients must be seen, scanned and treated. With 2 million neurons lost for every minute of delay, we need a much faster pathway to treatment, as identified in Professor Boyle&#146;s report. With all paramedics properly equipped to identify the patients in greatest need and proper specialist care readily available, we can resolve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07071161000363">On Monday, I saw the impressive speed with which people were moved from the accident and emergency department to a stroke unit at King&#146;s, having been seen by a specialist and given a scan on the way. Professor Boyle says that if strokes were treated as emergencies, more than 1,000 stroke victims every year would regain independence, which makes a compelling case for reconfiguring acute services to ensure that highly specialised care is concentrated at centres that can offer round-the-clock expertise.</p>

<p><a name="st_o191"><a name="07071161000364"><a name="70711-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="07071161000676"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 That is an interesting point. I was talking to the chair of Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Trust, which does not directly serve my constituency, but serves people around Cambridgeshire. The service design that he and people in a number of other places are looking for is direct admission of emergencies to the acute specialist stroke unit. I know that in Addenbrooke&#146;s hospital in my constituency, people are brought to the accident and emergency department and then transferred to the specialist unit, but direct admission is what we should be aiming for. It does not make sense for the specialist team to have to go down to the accident and emergency department to collect somebody.</p>

<p><a name="st_o192"><a name="07071161000365"><a name="70711-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="07071161000677"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 That is interesting, as was the view expressed about Manchester. King&#146;s has a triage nurse in the accident and emergency department. I guess that, in effect, the system means that someone is in the stroke unit as soon as they come in, although it happens to be located in a different place. The philosophy is to get people through the system as quickly as possible, making sure that scans are available and that TIA is taken into account if appropriate. Having specialists available 24 hours a day, seven days a week is the key issue at King&#146;s and other such centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07071161000366">We should also look at improving ambulance response times. We are consulting about upgrading strokes from category B to category A events so that ambulances arrive within nine, rather than 18 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07071161000367">Thirdly, we must ensure that there is better aftercare for those who have suffered strokes. The best way to improve care for such people is by engaging with them and ensuring that they feed into the consultation, which is why we have produced an easy-to-read version of the document for stroke survivors who have communication difficulties. Often, stroke survivors say that they wish to be at home during the rehabilitative stages. Early supported discharge schemes get people home more quickly, provided that there is better rehab care available.</p>

providing them with action plans and progress reports. There is still a huge gap between the number of cardiologists and the number of stroke specialists, as was mentioned in an intervention. We need to increase the work force capacity to resolve that, and we have already worked with the Stroke Association to fund an additional three specialist posts. We will invest in training 10 further specialists this year alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07071161000369">Having brought about huge reductions in cancer and heart disease, we must now promote the treatment of strokes to become our top priority. In the 1970s, England was the heart disease capital of Europe, but that has changed. We can, will and must ensure that a similar transformation takes place in this area. With record investment, new technologies and health professionals who are already gearing up to tackle this challenge we will succeed, thus truly transforming the lives and prospects of thousands of people and their families who are affected by this debilitating condition. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

 Well, I was going to start on a positive note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07071161000374">According to a recent audit by the Royal College of Physicians, the death rate from stroke in a range of age brackets has fallen by approximately a third, which must be good news. Well over 90 per cent. of English hospitals now have a dedicated stroke unit. The vast majority of health boards and NHS trusts have achieved their targets, and stroke registers have been established in more than 60 per cent. of GP services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07071161000375">Now comes the &#147;but&#148;. We have heard about the problems caused when stroke patients who are admitted to hospital receive insufficiently rapid access to a stroke unit. I shall outline problems all along the patient pathway later, but there are general problems that have a great impact on stroke services. For example, people have difficulty accessing therapists and social workers. Although we are training loads of physiotherapists, we are not deploying them where they could benefit patients. It has been pointed out that the tariff for supporting stroke patients is inappropriate and there is no financial incentive for hospitals to provide stroke services subsequent to initial treatment. Most importantly, there is little public awareness of the problem. A quarter of hospitals have no form of senior stroke nurse specialist, yet the national clinical guidelines on stroke say that specialist stroke services should be available in the community as part of an integrated system of care to facilitate early supported discharge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07071161000376">The new Health Minister who will sit in the other place recently had something to say about stroke services. In May, he pointed out that of the 30 hospitals in London providing stroke services, only four treated more than 90 per cent. of patients in a dedicated unit. He said that although patients should receive a CT scan within three hours, in only seven out of 30 hospitals did 90 per cent. of patients receive a scan within that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07071161000377">The number of patients receiving clot-busting drugs has been highlighted. My immediate assumption was that the situation was due to a lack of resources, but as hon. Members have pointed out, &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148;, which the Department released on Monday, rebuts that because, importantly, Professor Roger Boyle states:</p>
<a name="70711-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07071161000456"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As a nation we spend more money than most on stroke services&#151;and a greater percentage of our health budget&#151;yet, overall, we have worse outcomes.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07071161000378">That raises serious questions. Given that the money and the national service framework for older people have been in place&#151;a whole chapter of the NSF is dedicated to stroke services&#151;what went wrong, and why was the money not targeted properly? We have hospitals such as King&#146;s that provide a brilliant service, so why have stroke clinicians and workers in other parts of the country had difficulty getting together and achieving the same sort of outcome? Have they been blocked by hospital management, or was there no initiative on the ground? If we are to move forward positively, it will be worth considering such basic questions to determine what has happened and how we can learn from the mistakes that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07071161000379">The problem with the NSF for older people was that no funding was attached to it. Perhaps money was in the system, yet people did not know how to access it. I surveyed several PCTs to determine whether stroke targets were being met. It was clear that a number of proactive people had used the NSF as a lever to get local health commissioners and PCTs to go a little further. Such a thing can be done, but we need to learn why in many cases that has not happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07071161000380">The real tragedy is that, according to the Stroke Association, approximately 80 per cent. of strokes are preventable.

It would be nice to have official notice of which Minister is responsible for public health and their specific responsibilities<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I welcome the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), to her job. It is difficult when people do not quite know which Minister to go to about what.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07071161000381">The public health aspect of stroke is important because there are many simple steps that can have an impact on outcomes relating not only to stroke, but to heart disease and cancer. According to the National Stroke Association, about 20,000 strokes a year could be prevented if health professionals and the public gave sufficient attention to awareness of people&#146;s blood pressure, determining whether people have a normal heartbeat, and stopping smoking. Other steps that can be taken are the usual culprits in messages on public health and healthy living: cutting down on alcohol, keeping cholesterol under control and following a healthy diet.

 I cannot resist mentioning this. Will the hon.

It is a great shame that the service has been cancelled, but perhaps she can influence the leader of the council.</p>

 I notice that the programme was aimed at children, among whom the rate of stroke is low. I understand the Secretary of State&#146;s point about establishing healthy eating patterns, but I would like to know whether the meals were being eaten, because if healthy meals are not eaten, we have to look at the problem in a different way. If he sends me more details, I will follow that up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07071161000384">Exercise is another factor. It is worrying that only 37 per cent. of men and 25 per cent. of women meet exercise guidelines. Even moderate activity can reduce the risk of stroke by up to 27 per cent. As has been suggested, people need to recognise the symptoms of stroke, so a public awareness campaign is needed. It is obvious when someone has had a full-blown stroke, but TIAs can result in minor symptoms. Patients who have had a TIA need to be examined by a doctor, because if they are treated properly we can reduce the overall impact of stroke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07071161000385">We see the problem when we look at the timeline. A patient will first seek a GP appointment. The good news is that patients are supposed to be able to get an appointment within 48 hours. Although there can be problems if people do not ring their surgery at a certain time of day, access to GPs has generally improved. However, if a patient is not aware that their symptoms could be serious, they might write them off as something not worth worrying about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07071161000386">There can be a lack of awareness among GPs. Even among GPs who are aware of the symptoms, a fifth do not refer TIA patients for further investigation, as was revealed in a recent survey. There have been attempts through the quality and outcomes framework to improve the situation, but things do not seem to be working at the moment. Only 55 per cent. of GPs say that they would refer TIA patients immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07071161000387">If a patient is referred, there can be delay in accessing a clinic and getting the requisite tests. Only a third of people with TIA are seen in a clinic within 14 days, but the recommended time set out in most clinical guidelines is seven days. Attention is being given to improving patient pathways, but I hope that the obsession with the 18-week target, which in itself is a good thing, does not mean that attention is diverted away from the seven-day target, which also needs to be reached.</p>

 I understand that the hon. Gentleman has not been here for the whole debate. I do not know whether he was here for my opening comments, but his point was acknowledged: some places are beacons of excellence, and we should work towards ensuring that their standard applies in all places. If he has an excellent service locally, he is one of the lucky ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para26"><a name="07071161000390">To return to the subject of the clinics to which patients who have had a TIA are referred, many of them are now run as one-stop shops. That can be a good thing, but sometimes, once tests have been performed, there is a delay in communicating the results to the GP. That is another part of the pathway that needs looking at. If attention is paid to the pathway, there is a strong chance that we will significantly reduce the number of people who have to call an ambulance because they have had a stroke. I, too, pay tribute to the Stroke Association for its campaign to have stroke treated as a medical emergency. In Hampshire, all the hospitals, the ambulance service and community nurses are working together to try to ensure that services are much more joined-up. They also work with groups that come into contact with patients soon after they have had a stroke, including St. John Ambulance and the Red Cross, to make sure that they are aware of the FAST&#151;face, arm, speech test&#151;campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para27"><a name="07071161000391">People have to recognise that they have had a stroke, and that can be a problem in itself. More public awareness would be helpful. Once the patient&#146;s condition has been recognised, there is still the problem that only 10 per cent. of hospitals have a system, like that at King&#146;s, which enables thrombolytic drugs to be administered quickly enough. As that system saves lives, we should really focus on it when considering how we can improve our services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70711-0009.htm_para28"><a name="07071161000392">The clinically optimal model for stroke care is for care to be delivered in a specialised stroke unit, but we need clarity about what a stroke unit is. That might sound an odd question, but many stroke units have a high proportion of rehab patients, and a relatively small proportion of their resources are used to treat patients in their first couple of days in the unit. All the evidence seems to show that treating patients early delivers much better outcomes, so in many hospitals it may be a case of shifting attention or of providing slightly more resources for treatment at the earlier stage, because when the impact of the stroke is minimised, the long-term costs are reduced. According to Professor Boyle, that would make financial sense.</p>

A third of acute stroke patients are left dependent or moderately disabled and our aim must be to reduce that figure, and taking some of the steps outlined earlier in the debate would make that possible. During their hospital stay, patients have access to help and care, but when they go home, they must suddenly readjust their lives. Figures for south London show that three to 12 months after discharge, only 26 per cent. of patients in need received physical and occupational therapy, and 14 per cent. received speech and language therapy. If an individual cannot do the things that they are used to doing, or cannot communicate properly, it is very frustrating for them. That leads to problems with depression, and to problems for other people in the house who have to adapt to the condition, too. We have a network of local stroke clubs that do excellent work in helping people to feel that they are, in many ways, once more part of society, and I pay tribute to them.</p>

Some of our local clubs are well funded by the people involved, but I appreciate that in other areas of the country that arrangement is not feasible or practical. Anything that helps the rehabilitation process should be considered. Often, there are rooms available that are not being used, and they could be used for such purposes. I ask that attention be given to aftercare. Perhaps we could use more therapists; we should consider carefully whether more of them will be needed for the future. The Select Committee on Health recently produced a report on work force planning, which highlighted the fact that there does not seem to be much in the way of such planning. The recent example of the training, and lack of recruitment and use, of physiotherapists highlights the problem. We also need to assess how much occupational and speech therapy we will need in future. We must ensure that people have access to those services, so that they can live a full, proper and useful life.</p>

that there was a time when people did not understand that; we have come such a long way since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07071161000399">I suffered a mini-stroke some three years ago, a month after I played Kenny Dalglish off the football field as part of the parliamentary team; I remember that well. It showed that strokes can happen to people who are fit and lively and that people do not see them coming. I did a lot of things that I should not have done; I say that now that I know first-hand what a stroke can look and feel like. After a hectic, busy week, in which I remember voting in the House on fox hunting&#151;for the 20th time or something like that&#151;I dashed off to Tel Aviv. I travelled overnight and had no sleep, and then I found myself out in Gaza with my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), who is now Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. We were shown around, and at night we dined and sang a few Irish songs; it was quite a jolly occasion. I went to bed wobbling a little, but I knew that that was not down to drunkenness. I absolutely knew what the problem was, but I thought, as all men do, &#147;I&#146;ll sleep it off, and then I&#146;ll be okay again.&#148; The next morning, I had a little problem shaving and so on. I phoned up my right hon. Friend, and then the fun really started.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07071161000400">I remember that we were in Ramallah at the time and were heading out to visit the Gaza strip. There was a bit of a hoo-ha&#151;a fight&#151;about which ambulance I should travel in. I instinctively wanted to be in a Palestinian hospital and ambulance, for various political reasons. We went through several checkpoints with guns pointed at us, and I was taken out of the Palestinian ambulance and stuck into an Israeli one. I have never seen anything like it&#151;when we went into the Palestinian hospital at gunpoint with Israeli soldiers, the whole accident and emergency department emptied immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07071161000401">The treatment was amazing, with an immediate scan, although we had probably taken about four hours to get from the hotel, through the checkpoints and so on. It was marvellous to meet UK surgeons who had given up their holidays to work with young people with heart problems who came in from the Gaza strip. The House can imagine the difficulties that that causes. We are fighting hard to get a heart unit in that Palestinian hospital, because those surgeons still go out there.</p>

It was one of the first PFI hospitals and it takes a lot of knocks, but the service is amazing, particularly in the stroke unit. I speak to the consultants quite often. I was lucky, given the delays in my treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07071161000403">Norfolk and Norwich university hospital&#146;s excellent 36-bed stroke unit was set up in 2002. It services about half a million people in the Broadland district, Norwich and south Norfolk. Before it opened, patients were scattered in various surgical wards. In the short time it has been open, the unit has brought them all together and it offers language therapists, physiotherapists and specialist nurses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07071161000404">The unit has a great record for treating TIAs&#151;mini-strokes. Major strokes after TIAs are quite likely in a small percentage of cases. They are medical emergencies and should be treated as such, just like an acute coronary  <br>

syndrome of some sort. Immediate, co-ordinated care, is essential on those specialist wards, and I am pleased that we have such a unit in Norwich. It is ambitious, and I shall speak about its plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07071161000405">Access to the unit and assessment is an interesting point. I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s recommendations in &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148;. We have some fantastic services in the UK, and that will add to them, and to the one in Norwich, in particular. It is time to build on our successes. Stroke must be treated fast. Time is of the essence, and the document highlights the fact that the fastest access to treatment will lead to the greatest success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07071161000406">Like most hospitals, Norfolk and Norwich university hospital admits stroke patients via their GP or accident and emergency, so patients may be assessed several times before they see a stroke specialist. An experiment is being conducted at Edinburgh university, where the specialist stroke nurse carries a portable phone and exchanges information with those in the ambulance. Attempts are being made to staff ambulances with people who understand strokes and can diagnose and even treat them immediately by administering drugs. The nurse at the hospital can be ready for the specialist process of stroke triage and can administer the first line of defence&#151;clot-busting drugs&#151;and arrange for CT scans before the patient arrives. About 30 patients have been through the procedure, which is highly successful. The experiment, which involves no great expense, is just a better way of doing things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07071161000407">Other research programmes are under way at the hospital. At present it is thought that stroke treatment must be administered within three hours. An international stroke trial is investigating whether that period can be extended.</p>

Another member is Sir Richard Branson. If one knows the right people who are interested in this area, it is possible to collect &#163;90 million overnight, from great champagne merchants and so on. We are trying to induce the Medical Research Council to talk to us about conducting joint experimentation and joint assessment of treatments. I think that that will eventually work out, after a few initial problems.</p>

There is great hope that stem cells might be one way forward. That is why I am so pleased that the House has passed legislation, which has proved difficult in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07071161000410">Work is also being done on atrial fibrillation irregularity&#151;the abnormal heart rhythm that the previous Prime Minister, for example, had. That can often increase the risk of stroke. Much exciting work is going on in the UK. We are examining the effects of increases and decreases in blood pressure. Amazing rehabilitation work has been done. I missed only one day of work after my mini-stroke, but I went to the rehab unit to see how it worked. Amazing treatments are available, both in hospital and in the community, depending on the patient&#146;s requirements.</p>

The people involved are passionate about their work. The unit works with a unit for older people, and the combination of services, which is a small initiative, seems to help to produce results. The system will be a roaring success with such dedicated, highly trained people working in those units. Much good work is being done but much more, as we have heard, is still to be done. With the services of the scientists and medics in this country, we are just about world class. When we have the debate next year, I think the Opposition will have to admit it.</p>

 I join in the universal gratitude in the House at seeing my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who has just absented himself. He is the living evidence that with the right medical care and the right mental attitude, one can recover pretty quickly from a stroke. It is great to see him back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07071161000415">The word &#147;stroke&#148; is perhaps the wrong word to describe a terrible affliction. It afflicts people in different ways, and some doctors now refer to it instead as a brain attack, which better conveys the severity of it. It is a cruel and tragic affliction, and I very much welcome what we have heard about the change in the perception of sufferers. Most European countries rightly regard strokes first and foremost as a neurological condition rather than as an older people&#146;s condition, but we still have a considerable way to go in trying to raise awareness. Three times more women die of strokes than of breast cancer each year. When one thinks about the excellent publicity generated about the appalling disease of breast cancer, it is clear that strokes have not had the same attention to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07071161000416">I want to make a couple of points about the need for speedy medical treatment and the importance of suitable rehabilitation facilities. I am extremely glad that the Minister, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), who is now also Minister for the South West, is in his place, because he will no doubt wish to support me in what I say about many of our local facilities, some of which are in his constituency rather than in mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07071161000417">My first point concerns the need to get patients and stroke victims to a place where they can be assessed and treated as quickly as possible.

important work of the Devon air ambulance service, which can get people from any part of the county into a hospital within about 15 minutes. It would be most welcome if Ministers at least acknowledged the work of air ambulances, which are funded entirely by voluntary contributions, and perhaps looked at how they can be supported in the longer term. Air ambulances are enormously expensive to run and maintain. Other charities in the county will say that it is more difficult for them to raise money because Devon air ambulance requires so much, but if one lives on Dartmoor or Exmoor or in the other more rural areas of our part of the world, one is very glad to know that it exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07071161000418">There is a difference in the statistics on the treatment of stroke victims in the county. Torbay and Newton Abbot hospitals in south Devon have won awards for their stroke treatment. It is interesting to note that on average they CT scan 60 per cent. of their stroke victims within 24 hours. Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, which is in the Minister&#146;s constituency, scans only 30 per cent. of its patients within the first 24 hours, although it is in the upper quartile for stroke care. That postcode lottery is simply not acceptable. We need some assurances that the Minister will look closely at seeing how that disparity can be erased as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07071161000419">Secondly, I want to talk about the shortage of acute stroke units. In my own constituency of East Devon, there is no acute stroke unit, just an eight-bed rehab unit in Budleigh Salterton. There was talk of having another one in Honiton, but that might not now happen, despite the fact that the county has a higher prevalence of strokes, at 2.8 per cent., than the national average of 1.57 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said that only 22 per cent. of hospitals have early support discharge teams. We need to consider that carefully in terms of Devon&#146;s provision. Does the Minister agree that an average wait of between five and 24 hours for a CT scan, rising to 25 to 48 hours at weekends, is unacceptable, given that CT scans offer the best chance of a successful rehabilitation?</p>

Heather wrote to Mary asking for her opinion which concluded with Mary saying that I could get better &amp; possibly back to &#145;normal&#146;, I realise there are no guarantees but I&#146;m too young to give up &amp; I don't believe the trust should either. I have asked for alternative help i.e. a referral to another nearby trust that could possibly help or funding so I can do whatever &amp; however much I feel I can do.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70711-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07071161000423">What we have heard from Ministers is welcome. I am glad that we are taking strokes and the issues surrounding them seriously and giving them the publicity that they deserve. However, we should not congratulate ourselves too much. I said that the problem is not necessarily age related, and the case that I cited is living proof of that. However, I represent a constituency with a large elderly population, and it is important that they get the same treatment&#151;the same access to scans and, vitally, the same aftercare&#151;as people in other parts of the country. There was much talk at one point about using some of our community hospitals. I am fortunate to have community hospitals in Budleigh Salterton, Sidmouth, Seaton and Axminster, all of which have dedicated staff and good facilities. Perhaps it is to them that we should be looking for this kind of post-care treatment. I am not talking about people going in one or two times a week&#151;there is often 24-hour care, certainly in the early days. The more quickly people come to terms with their disability, however temporary, caused by a stroke, the more quickly they learn how to live with it, combat it and overcome it, and the more quickly they recover and the fewer strains will ultimately be placed on the NHS and local services.</p>

There is not much politics in it; it is too serious for that. I hope that the Under-Secretary will have a word with the Minister. As I said, he is now also Minister for the South West and will no doubt wish to ensure in that new capacity that we in my part of Devon are treated the same as those in Torbay and south Devon, so that we can reach the extremely good figures that are being achieved there.</p>

Almost one third of patients die in the first month after a stroke, with about one in 20 surviving stroke patients needing long-term residential care.

treating strokes. Overall, they cost the wider economy about &#163;4.2 billion in lost productivity, disability and informal care. I fully recognise what has already been achieved, but we need to ensure that the public are fully aware of the dangers of strokes and of the crucial need to call 999 immediately if someone is suspected of having a stroke.</p>

That obviously puts a particular strain on hospitals in London. The risk of stroke increases with age, but each year around 1,000 people under the age of 30 suffer a stroke. I recently met some and was quite shocked by how young they were and how debilitating the condition would be for years to come. I hope that they will be fully cured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07071161000430">The key question that needs to be answered is: what can be done to address the shortage of health professionals with stroke training, which the Public Accounts Committee highlighted as a limiting factor in stroke care provision? If patients are not scanned on the day of admission, they normally have to wait until the next working day. That is a particular problem if they are admitted at the weekend. The sad fact is that only 22 per cent. of victims have a scan on the day they suffer the stroke, and most patients end up waiting for two days or more. In the first few crucial hours after suffering a stroke, it is vital that victims have rapid access to scans to diagnose their condition fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07071161000431">It is not acceptable that only half of all patients receive rehabilitation services that meet their needs in the six months following discharge from hospital, and that after a year that figure falls to a quarter of patients. The Department of Health should evaluate the merits of early supported discharge initiatives and other ways of improving access to treatments. The Department should promote the early adoption of treatments that can be shown to reduce hospital stay and improve patients&#146; chances of recovery. Rehabilitation services must take into account the needs of stroke survivors who live on their own. They may be vulnerable to being overlooked by health and social care services.</p>

<a name="70711-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="07071161000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as we&#151;like all developed countries&#151;struggle to defuse the obesity &#145;time bomb&#146;, we cannot afford to be complacent about the threat these diseases pose in the future.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07071161000434">We could see vast increases in strokes over future years. Professor Boyle suggested that changes in treatment for heart disease also need to be considered for stroke victims. The report noted that if strokes were treated as an emergency, more than 1,000 victims a year would regain independence, rather than dying or being left disabled. Although not all local accident and emergency units are best placed to treat stroke victims, we need to have services on the doorstep or as close as possible for victims.</p>

King George hospital is only 13 years old, but it now faces the prospect of losing some of its key services. That would have a detrimental effect on my constituents. We heard earlier from the Prime Minister that no decisions had been taken, but I have a document, which I am willing to make available to the Under-Secretary, saying that unfortunately certain decisions have been made regarding my local hospital. It is an internal document, given to me by somebody who obviously wishes to remain anonymous, but I would be happy to pass it on to the Under-Secretary, because I am sure that the Prime Minister would not have said what he said if he had been aware of it.</p>

Perhaps we could see twinning with that facility, to help prevent people from having to suffer such a terrible condition and to lead to a better future for all.</p>

Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) said about world-class services, there are only odd islands of world-class services in this country, and we are very far from having a world-class service throughout the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07071163000004">The questionnaire should be used to say to every primary care trust responsible for commissioning services and to every acute trust responsible for providing them, &#147;We want your response in the light of what is in the document prepared by Roger Boyle over quite a long period&#148;&#151;although as we have heard, Professor Boyle has been working on strokes for only a year, whereas he worked on heart disease for a much longer period. If we can get a response back from everyone who is responsible, that will at least mean that they will have read and studied what is in the document. Many of those things have been said before in documents, but I should like the Minister, when she replies to the debate, to give an undertaking to try to ensure that there is a response from all those responsible for commissioning and providing services.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will have seen that one of the proposals in &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148; is, in effect, that there should be clinical networks for stroke. From his knowledge, derived from the Health Committee and elsewhere, he will be aware that clinical networks made a considerable difference to cancer services, but I am sure that those involved in cancer clinical networks will have told him that they had access to ring-fenced resources for that purpose. Does he share my view that we need to think about whether that is the right way to go? Simply to wish for clinical networks to come into being but not to give them an opportunity to shape services will probably not be successful.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There is no doubt that clinical networks have made a real difference in cancer services. The fact that funding was available focused minds and gave them the funds to spend for that purpose. This obviously works. The trouble with having too many priorities, however, is that nothing ends up being a priority. I have had personal experience of a stroke, and it is important to me&#151;and, I think, to many stroke sufferers&#151;that there should be the money available to ensure that the services improve quickly. Otherwise, people who are being asked to commission these services are simply going to say, &#147;Unless we get more money, what are we going to spend less on in order to make the funds available?&#148; Extra funds would therefore be useful. I am conscious, however, that large amounts of extra funds have been put into the NHS over the past 10 years, and a higher proportion is still going in now than ever before. We must ensure that those funds are used wisely, so the hon. Gentleman has made a good point. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07071163000007">I want to make two further points. First, an early scan is essential, as we have heard. Quoting statistics on the percentage of cases scanned within 24 hours is not useless, but it is not much use. What we need is a three-hour target, and it needs to be met to improve our use of thrombolytic drugs. We must also have 24-hour working, seven days a week, to achieve that. In my opinion, any unit that does not offer that should not have the right to call itself a specialised stroke unit.  <br>

In many if not most cases, rehabilitation can and should begin within a few days of the initial event.

 I, too, welcome the debate today. Stroke is often forgotten, and placed at the unglamorous, unsexy end of health care. I trained as a nurse and worked in the NHS for 25 years, and I am only too aware how great the suffering can be, not only for those who have suffered a stroke but for their friends, relatives, neighbours and other carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07071163000011">We have heard many statistics today, and statistics really do matter. They are our only means of emphasising the importance of stroke. It is the third most common cause of death, and the leading cause of disability in adults. Just under 1 million people in this country are living with the after-effects of stroke, and about 300,000 are dependent on others for help with their day-to-day activities. We should remember that for many of those people, even putting on their socks in the morning, or having a piece of toast, cannot happen without the assistance of someone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07071163000012">The Secretary of State has apologised for not being able to be in the Chamber at this moment. He talked about the national service framework for older people, in which stroke is mentioned, but stroke is not just about older people. Twenty-five per cent. of the people affected by stroke are under the age of 65. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) referred to the fact that the national service framework did not recognise stroke as a neurological disability. It is recognised as such in most countries, but not here, and that has an impact on services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07071163000013">I have no doubt that the Government will tell us how much things have improved, and, in the spirit of this debate, it has been important to listen to other Members congratulating the Government, where congratulations are due, on the improvements that have taken place. However, service provision is very patchy. The 2006 National Sentinel audit showed that almost three quarters of people with minor stroke are not being managed in specialist units. Only 15 per cent. of patients are admitted to a stroke unit on the day that they have the stroke, and only one tenth of patients are scanned within three hours. These are all crucial indicators for giving people the level of care that they need to improve their outcomes. Some of the work that needs to be done to improve the figures is recognised in the Government&#146;s report, but, despite the successes, we must understand how poor some of those figures are.</p>

Early intervention by the non-medical professions is crucial to the outcomes of people following stroke. Those with communication problems can wait up to seven days for that treatment, and it can be even worse for those who want physiotherapy, occupational therapy or a social worker. We are talking here about the acute phase following stroke, not the chronic phase that follows.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned that 80 per cent. of people were unhappy with the services and care that they were receiving a year after stroke. Some of our rehabilitation hospitals are doing a superb job, and I make no apology for mentioning Milford hospital, near my constituency, which is threatened with closure, but is held in considerable affection because of the fantastic work that it has done on rehabilitation.</p>

It would make frustrating reading for people who are battling away to get the services that they need. I am not making a party political point, but I was a district nurse in the early 1980s, and I remember doing a dissertation at college about discharge from hospital, yet here we are, 25 years on, still saying the same things, and wishing, hoping and fighting for changes in the care of people who have had a stroke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07071163000018">Improvement after a stroke continues well beyond the first year. Access to services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and advice from dieticians, psychologists and psychiatrists all form a vital part of the care. I would add to that list the housing requirements of people who have had strokes, such as adaptations of people&#146;s homes. People can wait up to three, six or even nine months to have a stair rail put into their house, which can transform their ability to manage at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70711-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07071163000019">A much disregarded part of care following a stroke is people&#146;s mental health, which can be a significant factor in the outcome of someone&#146;s illness. Depression, both acute and chronic, can be as debilitating as physical mobility problems. There is also the inability to speak or communicate. The frustration of knowing what word it is one wants to say, but not being able to say it out of one&#146;s mouth, is immense, and cannot be understood by any of us who have not suffered it. Depression over the physical limitations on one&#146;s body while one&#146;s mind remains active can be extremely severe. That is much overlooked and under-diagnosed, and is very rarely treated.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing up those crucial groups that are out in the community. To some extent, they have arisen because of the paucity of provision for people to form social networks, and they have a significant impact on the outcomes for people following stroke. With regard to the question of mental health, people have to believe that there is life beyond a stroke. If a person is disabled or unable to communicate, it is only those groups that give that ray of sunshine&#151;that light at the end of the tunnel&#151;to make them believe that that is possible.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, which we discussed earlier, about long-term care following a stroke, and the importance of rehabilitation being something that goes on 24 hours a day, and is not just hit and miss. Once the patient has undergone care, more often than not they go home. That is where their partner, or anyone they live with, has to take on the burden previously undertaken by the hospital or the rehab unit. Depression is an important matter, but is my hon.

 I share my hon. Friend&#146;s alarm that carers are not receiving the needs assessments they require&#151;an issue that has been raised with me by carers groups. Frequently, such an assessment is referred to as a carer&#146;s assessment, and unfortunately carers often feel that they are being assessed, when it is actually the carer&#146;s needs. I hark back to personal experience; we have been talking about caring for the carers for decades, and it is crucial. We have talked about the mental ill health of people who have had a stroke, but we must also consider the mental health of those caring for people who have had strokes.</p>

 Indeed, the left hand and right hand both have to know what the other is doing. We have talked about partnership working, joint planning and integration, which are all terribly &#147;Government-sounding&#148; words, but we want joined-up services on the ground. The only arbiter of whether that is working is the care that people receive in their homes. Whether the services are joined up enough will be well  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07071163000039">I would particularly like to praise the group&#146;s chairman, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). We joined the House at the same time and have shared many a discussion on the Health Committee. I am pleased to join the team and look forward to further health discussions in future. I think that all members of the all-party group made generous contributions to the document launched by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on Monday. I particularly commend the work of Professor Roger Boyle, as members of the group wanted me to thank him and his team for the excellent work they did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07071163000040">As the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) mentioned, stroke may not necessarily be the best description. I agree that it is really a cerebral-vascular accident, which is how I was trained to describe a stroke. &#147;Brain attack&#148; and other terms used to characterise this serious condition should also be considered&#151;perhaps as part of the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07071163000041">The all-party group has raised many important issues for my Department to reflect on for its new strategy. &#147;A new ambition for stroke&#148; is now on the  <br>

table for consultation. I understand why the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked about the continuation of the consultation. In fact, we now need champions to go out and promote the work because there is so much to do and we need to realise that there are different ways of treating this condition. Much good work can be done if we have those champions in place&#151;and I believe that that will develop out of the consultation. We can build on the good progress made by cardiac units. We need to reflect on the arrangements and positioning of cardiac units, which helps to explain why they have been so successful. That is important for future treatment of these emergency brain accidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07071163000042">We are determined to reduce the impact of strokes through our new strategy and to ensure that those who have experienced strokes are well supported through the months and sometimes years of rehabilitation and recovery. That demands a transformation of attitudes. We need to end the pessimism associated with stroke and recognise that it is a preventable and treatable condition. As I said earlier, the courage of hon. Members here today has marked the beginning of the end of that pessimism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07071163000043">Medicine is very dynamic and has moved on tremendously. We now know that if we can diagnose strokes quickly and treat them appropriately, there is every chance of helping people to a good recovery. That is why it is important to act now. We have seen a reduction in mortality from strokes and an increase in stroke specialist services. Those achievements and a strong evidence base for stroke care mean that we are now in a position to drive forward improvements in stroke services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07071163000044">Modernising the services will not be a quick or easy task. We have a lot to do on prevention, commonly described as &#147;lifestyle.&#148; We are now smoke-free across the countries of the UK, we have obesity and exercise programmes and we are looking at a genuinely healthier lifestyle. People need support to change their lifestyle; it is not easy. People cannot be lectured at, and they need help and assistance. I hope that we continue to provide positive and reasonable health education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07071163000045">We need to raise awareness of symptoms and improve action on risk factors. We must ensure rapid diagnostics&#151;something that many Members mentioned. We need to improve integration across health and social care, a point raised by the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton), particularly in relation to integration with social services. That is absolutely critical and my ministerial colleagues and I will be working together on it. Much work has been done for carers and I am pleased with the Government&#146;s approach in terms of flexible working for carers who are in work, training, a new deal and even pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07071163000046">The hon. Member for Guildford tried not to make a political point in referring to her time as a district nurse. I, too, nursed through the 1980s and 1990s and I, too, do not wish to make a political point, but many of my patients and families were very cold because they did not have a heating allowance. Their pensions were miserable. Many were trying hard to rehabilitate   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 July 2007">

themselves on small incomes and they did not know whether to put on their heating or to eat. Many of the rehabilitation services were not in place. I hope that we share enthusiasm for change and for the improvements that the Government have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07071163000047">Change is difficult and we need leadership to bring it about. Much has been said about the organisations providing stroke rehabilitation and care. I want to mention a nurse consultant in Portsmouth, Jane Williams, who had the confidence to close an in-patient ward and transfer the resources to community care. She had the confidence, over three years, to win the hearts and minds of more than five organisations, and did it because it made patients feel better to be in their own homes. Care is now provided nearly 24 hours a day, from 7am till 9pm, seven days a week. Those involved work within an inter-professional team and have a better success rate in Portsmouth than they would have achieved in-house. I am sure that the whole House would want to congratulate Jane and her team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07071163000048">Ours is an ambitious programme and we know that success is possible. Greater Manchester was mentioned by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, but clinicians have already agreed a strategy to ensure that every stroke patient has the chance to benefit from the clot-busting treatment. Today in London my colleague Professor Ara Darzi has published proposals to develop hyper-specialised stroke centres serving the whole capital. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott), who raised important points, may like to participate in the review to see how his local services might be affected. We have asked officials to look into the matter and I will get back to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07071163000049">It is right to be ambitious as there is overwhelming enthusiasm for the new strategy, not only in this House but from the stroke community. Many people have helped us to develop the consultation document, and I thank all of them. Throughout the country, people with first-hand experience of stroke&#151;survivors, carers and professionals&#151;have told us in no uncertain terms what needs to change. The consultation exercise gives us a chance to listen to a still wider range of voices. I urge Members to contribute and to encourage their constituents to give their views. I will attend my centre at St. Paul&#146;s church in Brentford, to which I am a regular visitor. That exercise should give us the opportunity to launch this coming winter a strategy that truly galvanises the revolution in stroke care that we have discussed today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07071163000050">Much has rightly been made of the audit report. It says:</p>
<a name="70711-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07071163000636"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Stroke clinicians, managers and politicians can feel proud of the advances that have been made over the last ten years&#151;there are few other conditions that have progressed as rapidly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07071163000051">We can all be proud of that, and I hope that Members will refer to it when we are in our constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70711-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07071163000052">Jane Williams made the bold decision to go forward with changes in five organisations over three years. We can only imagine how difficult a task that must have been for a nurse consultant. She told me that she did it because it was right for patients&#151;that it was the right way to progress in the management of care. It is now up to all of us to take up that challenge and to do right by patients.</p>

Much of our country is in splendid condition in many ways.

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70711-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07071163000574">In our country, more than 1.2 million young people aged between 16 and 24 are not in work, education or training. The UK has a higher proportion of children living in workless households than any other EU country. That is a really important indicator&#151;I want to come back to that&#151;because, as we should all be able to agree, work is the crucial way out of poverty. I do not think that there is any remaining difference of view between the parties about that. Work is fundamental, so worklessness is fundamental, and the worklessness record is not good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70711-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07071163000575">It is true that the Government have managed to move some people&#151;a noticeable number of people&#151;out of poverty, as measured by the 60 per cent. of median income line. However, unfortunately, if one looks at the figures carefully, one can see that in general the movement has involved people going from rather slightly below the line to rather slightly above the line. The problem is that, over the past seven or eight years, the number of people living in severe poverty&#151;defined as less than 40 per cent. of the median income&#151;increased by 600,000. In a way, that is the less important point, because it is a point about what has happened recently. The point about our country is that there are now 3.1 million people living on less than 40 per cent. of the median income. That figure is from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Whatever view one takes of what has been done and is being done, that cannot be right. It cannot be where we are trying to be as a country. To be fair to Members on the Government Front Bench, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), the former Secretary of State for Health, was perfectly open about that and said that poverty had become more entrenched. That is a real problem for our country.</p>

If the hon. Gentleman thinks that we are not seriously committed to tackling it, he is wrong. We are. We would not have bothered to do the work that we have done on the issue if we were not seriously committed to tackling it. Moreover, we would not be making the argument that I am making, which is that this is the single most important thing we can tackle, unless we intended to tackle it. Just as a matter of political prudence, it would be slightly odd for a party to set itself up to try to tackle something and make that a priority if it thought that it was not going to spend any time or effort trying to tackle it and did not care whether it succeeded or  <br>

Gentleman and others who wish to be in a partisan position to acknowledge that we may have joint aims&#151;although we may disagree about means&#151;but the truth is that that is the position that we are in, so we ought to recognise it.</p>

He and many others have pointed out that, despite what are no doubt the best of intentions, the new deal has, to a very considerable degree, failed&#151;in the sense that a large number of the people for whom it finds work unfortunately move back out of work extremely quickly. It has cost about &#163;1.9 billion, but the number of unemployed young people has increased by about 70,000.</p>

Gentleman: I remember learning about this from him 10 or more years ago&#151;who thinks that it is satisfactory that there are roughly 2.7 million people on incapacity benefit in Britain. That cannot be the position that we ought to be in as a country, especially when many of those people might be able to work, would like to work but are not working.</p>

 I completely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. It is distressing that nearly one in five people of working age in my constituency are on incapacity benefit. What we have been doing over the past couple of years has had some success. The programme to get people off benefits and into jobs, through Jobcentre Plus, is expensive. There are all sorts of complex reasons involved, particularly in former mining constituencies. I would be interested to hear whether he has any ideas about how one would cut that number. There is no point in just bewailing the situation; one has to have concrete ideas that work in practice.</p>

 Yes, we do, and I will come to those ideas in more detail in a moment. However, let me answer the hon. Gentleman so that he does not think that I am evading his question. The proposition put forward in the social justice policy group&#146;s report, which is the foundation of our thoughts about these matters, is that we should move to an arrangement under which welfare to work is handled by agencies&#151;whether social or voluntary agencies, or those in the private sector&#151;that are paid by results. Those results should be long-term, not short-term, work. In other words, the agencies should receive remuneration related to the benefits saved when people move into work and stay in work for a considerable period, so that there is an incentive to help people to remain in work. It then becomes a sensible financial proposition for those enterprises to invest in helping people to become able to work either by trying to do something about their health, or by trying to find them things that are appropriate to their health condition&#151;or both. As a matter of fact, I think that we might be able to achieve some consensus in the House on that. We are certainly considering the proposition seriously.</p>

in many of our constituencies? Ministers on the Treasury Bench might be thinking about what to do centrally, while Conservative spokesmen might be thinking about what to do through voluntary organisations. Why do we not set the claimants free? We know perfectly well that most of our constituents on incapacity benefit will never be interviewed, or have anything happen to them, if we are the agents of change. Why do we not say to them, &#147;Those of you who can, try to get a job in the next year, but keep all your benefits, including housing benefit. Come and tell us when you&#146;ve got a part-time job, and we&#146;ll try to help to build it up into a full-time job&#148;? Those people would then become the agents of change, and it would not be us&#151;whether the state or the private sector&#151;doing good for them.</p>

 I am in the embarrassing position of not knowing whether the social justice policy group&#146;s report makes that very recommendation because the right hon. Gentleman gave evidence to it, which I know he did, or whether the group invented it. However, I am happy to tell him that we are looking at that possibility seriously. Clearly, part of the answer must lie in not penalising people on benefits who would like to move into work when they try to get work and fail, and come back out of work and try again. We need a much more flexible system.</p>

 It is not just a matter of failing. Quite a few of our constituents who have been on benefit for a long time are hesitant to take the risk of moving into work because things might go pear-shaped. If we could say to them, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. Here&#146;s a year&#146;s money, and whatever you do will be in order,&#148; many of them, although not all, would be able to make that journey without any of us having to interfere in their lives.</p>

The hardest part of the process is helping people to apply for a job and to go through an interview so that they get sustainable employment.

 Is my right hon. Friend aware that, at the last count, there were no fewer than 2,063 young school leavers in Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Milton Keynes not in education, employment or training, 1,000 of whom were in that position because they suffered from the hidden disability of speech, language and communication impairment, which had not been treated? Does that not underline the crucial significance of early intervention to tackle those problems, in the interests of both the economy and the fulfilment of individual potential?</p>

 Happily, I am in a position to reply yes, absolutely. The issue is not just worklessness; the structure of things is somehow wrong, too. That is partly to do with the couple penalty, an issue to which we have drawn much attention in the past few days. Indeed, the Minister for the Cabinet Office and I discussed it in a broadcast yesterday evening. The Institute for Fiscal Studies sets out a case in which the husband, or one partner, earns &#163;15,000, and the wife, or the other partner, earns &#163;5,000. It calculates that as a couple, they would get benefits and tax credits worth &#163;2,317&#151;those are not my figures, but those of the IFS&#151;whereas the wife on her own would receive &#163;7,785 from the state. That is a difference of &#163;5,000. I neither know nor care whether those figures, calculated by the IFS in March 2006, are currently exactly correct. The point is clear, and it is repeated by a wide spectrum of people on low incomes: there are significant incentives in the system against admitting to being a couple. That is why we find cases of people living apart together, as it is mysteriously and rather horribly called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70711-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07071163000590">The issue is not just poverty, worklessness or odd and misaligned incentives in the system. There are underlying critical problems about lifestyle that we have to face as a country, and here we are bound to be on common ground, because we are simply talking about facts. More than 300,000 people in Britain are drug addicts; I think that the figure was 327,000 in 2006. That is a little under 10 people per 1,000. Must we regard that as an inevitable feature of life that we must deal with and accept, or is it something that we could be more optimistic about&#151;something that we could actually cure? In the Netherlands, three people per 1,000 are problematic drug users, and in Sweden the figure is 4.5 people per 1,000. I do not know every respect in which the Netherlands and Sweden differ from the UK, but the report for which my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green is responsible makes it extremely clear that there are significant differences in the way in which we think about rehabilitation and treatment, and I am sure that that is part of the explanation. In any event, it is clear that something needs to be done about the levels of addiction.</p>

What we have to do is try to lead people, or enable people to lead themselves&#151;it is a reconstruction of personality and ability that we are talking about&#151;out of the condition of addiction into a non-chaotic lifestyle where they can work and be part of the mainstream. So harm reduction is an important goal, but it is not enough.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend who, as usual, is making a lucid and intelligent speech. Is it not the case that when young people addicted to drugs, make the brave decision that they need help and want to come off their&#151;typically&#151;heroin addiction, it is no good saying to them, &#147;That&#146;s fine. Come back in a month and we will find a place for you,&#148; or, &#147;You will have to join a queue for treatment in five or seven months&#148;?

 With distinction or otherwise&#151;I spent a lot of time going around treatment centres here and in other countries. What I saw is exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) says&#151;that in order to be effective, treatment must be available at the moment when the addict is ready for it. It is part of the same conundrum that explains why it is often the case that only those who have been through addiction can lead others out of it effectively. So awful is the condition into which people are drawn that they need to relate to somebody who has been through it. For the same sort of reason, the condition is so awful that if there is the prospect of a wait, hopelessness sets in. We must be able to tackle the problem directly.</p>

 As my right hon. Friend was rising to answer the previous intervention, there was the usual commentary about an expenditure commitment. I understand that. We have a lot of fun and games about that in this place. However, one of the problems is that we have continued to debate the drugs issue in the House like children. I did not include in the report the costs that we calculated for the deaths due to drug addiction in this country or the unknown number of lost lives. We should rise above the ludicrous games that are played. The Minister may look at the matter from the party standpoint and whether the Government can incorporate it, but I hope that the whole House will think carefully about it.

 I entirely agree with that. Throughout the work on the report and our consideration of the issue, we need to take into account that the phenomena that I am describing do not just have a social cost and a cost for individuals and families&#151;they also have huge economic costs. Drug addiction is among the largest causes of economic cost, and we ought to be able to balance that in a mature way.</p>

 Before the right hon. Gentleman moves on, will he expand a little on a fundamental point that he slipped in, which is mentioned a number of times in the section of the report on addictions&#151;that treatment should be carried out by people who have direct experience of addiction? He said so a moment ago and it is specified in the report. Can he give an example of another country that bases its drug treatment system on that premise? How would it affect the 400 former addicts in my constituency whose treatment has been through GPs and the NHS, none of the GPs having had a prior addiction problem with the substance?</p>

 No, the hon. Gentleman misunderstands. I am not saying, nor is the report, that no good can be done by people other than those who have previously been addicts. What I discovered when I went to the Netherlands&#151;it is echoed in many parts of the report&#151;was that what is true in some rehabilitation centres in the UK today is true there. Alongside medically qualified professionals work people who have been through the experience and come out on the other side. That combination is an enormously powerful tool for enabling the addict to find a way of reaching genuine rehabilitation, but we are not suggesting that it is the only tool. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not still think, as I noticed him saying at an earlier stage on the radio or in a newspaper, that this is somehow an attack on GPs&#151;it is not. It is a question of trying to add a layer of rehabilitation that is not currently available.</p>

Will he confirm that the Netherlands is the only country in the world to have adopted what it describes as the &#147;liberal&#148; approach to drugs, and that in Sweden, the other country cited in the report, exactly the opposite is done and medical professionals, not those who have had a prior addiction problem, treat drug addiction and do so exclusively?</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend, who is being extremely generous. Will he take on board the importance of drug use prevention? No amount of drug rehabilitation treatment and harm reduction will work unless it is balanced with prevention. Otherwise, for every addict who is cured another one will come along&#151;it is like pouring water into a hole in the sand.</p>

 My hon. Friend is obviously right that drug use prevention is enormously important&#151;the report deals with that at some length&#151;but we should not delude ourselves that it will ever be enough.

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70711-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07071163000615">There are other factors. The report deals pretty thoroughly with the question of how indebted our nation is, with not only many people who can afford to be in debt but, unfortunately, many who cannot. On survey evidence, some 7 million to 9 million people in Britain today report themselves as having a serious debt problem. That is a bad situation for the country to be in. By most measures, social mobility is lower in Britain than in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, France or the United States, while family breakdown is higher than in almost any other European country.</p>

problem that we need to grip. I do not know, but I hope that that, too, is a shared analysis. I hope that the Government accept that the problem is not just one thing or another, but a combination of things and the cycle of deprivation that they create. Addiction, indebtedness, worklessness and family breakdown all combine to create not just poverty, but entrapment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70711-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07071163000617">If we accept that analysis and accept that, while the vast majority of our population is of course mercifully free of that trap of deprivation, we have a moral, social and economic duty to do something about that deprivation, the question then becomes&#151;what? The analysis ought to be shared up to that point, but now we come to the difficult question of how we get at the problem. I certainly do not say, and I never will say, that the Government have not sought to address the problems. It is manifest that they have sought to address them. Therefore, I take comfort from the thought that we share much of the analysis. However, it is equally manifest that the Government&#146;s actions have not produced the hoped-for results, because if they had, the picture would not be as it is today, but as it was some years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70711-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07071163000618">To a rational observer, that suggests either a pessimistic conclusion&#151;that it would take almost incalculable efforts of the kind that the Government have been making to achieve those results, or that they or any successor Government will not be able to achieve them&#151;or a much more optimistic conclusion: that there is something deficient about the Government&#146;s approach that, if changed, could change the situation. That is the analysis of the report. I hope that I shall not embarrass the right hon. Member for Birkenhead if I say that much of the thinking that lies behind the report is thinking that he was doing 10, 15 or 20 years ago. There has been a long chain of thought about the issue that has not been translated into action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70711-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07071163000619">I would characterise that thought like this. Approach A says, &#147;Let&#146;s do a series of discrete things. Let&#146;s spend money on those things and let&#146;s ensure, above all, that we get money to people who haven&#146;t got it.&#148; The Government have tried to do that, nobly and necessarily, but it has not produced the hoped-for results. The alternative approach is to say, &#147;Okay, we&#146;ve got to do that, but we&#146;ve got to do more. We&#146;ve actually got to change the way people feel about themselves and their lives, and how they conduct their lives if they&#146;re entrapped.&#148; Like a judo player, we have to use their weight, so to speak, to achieve the hoped-for result, rather than assuming that top-down action by the Government will achieve it by itself. That is a fundamentally different perspective, and it might be one on which the Minister and I profoundly differ.</p>

 I think that I am with the right hon. Gentleman so far on much of the analysis, but he is coming to the interesting bit about the policy prescriptions and whether his are better than those that are marketed elsewhere.

 I do not speak for the specific options put forward in the report, which we shall consider along with other options. However, I do speak for the principle that if the state, representing society, makes it clear that it recognises the value of stable relationships to society and does that by recognising marriage in the tax system, over time that will have an effect on people&#146;s conceptions&#151;albeit not in a way that we can calculate with certainty and project on computers&#151;and will therefore help us to move in the right direction. Personally, I believe that the removal of the couple penalty that I spoke about earlier is even more important, because that involved a direct disincentive to people, who could not afford such a disincentive, to stay apart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70711-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07071163000622">I have long believed that changes in culture, even though much slower and less direct, are more important than direct measures. An example is drink driving. Of course, there are laws against drink driving and enforcement mechanisms in place, but the fact is that over the past 20 or 30 years the culture in regard to drink driving in this country has utterly changed. There was a time when journalists&#151;to pick a particular profession&#151;would wander out of the King and Keys in Fleet street, having drunk I do not know how much, and think that it was a fine thing to get into their cars and drive away. Nobody thought the worse of them for that. Today, we would think that that was the wrong thing to do. We are right, and they were wrong then. Whatever the truth of the matter, there has certainly been a culture shift, and it has been much more powerful than all the policemen and breathalysers in the world put together. We are talking today about achieving direct results and cultural shifts, and I believe that the cultural shifts matter.</p>

 I have some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points about tax credits, as he knows.

 I have an enormous amount of sympathy for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. This is an inter-generational matter, and it will take an enormously long time to change. I do not know whether his estimate of a 20-year span is right; it might take longer. We could achieve significant effects quite soon, but there is no doubt that the greatest effects will take time to materialise. Yes, we need a shared analysis, to the extent that we can get one. I also agree that this is a question of tackling causes, not symptoms; we need to have that as a shared principle. It is inevitable that some of the views on the mechanics of addressing the causes will differ between the parties; that is a tolerable position for the country to be in. It would not be tolerable if there were no agreement on the need to tackle the causes, or on the centrality of the issue, because that would result in the matter simply flip-flopping and our never achieving the consistency required to make real changes over a long period.

I strongly believe that there is a parallel with the argument we all had in the 1970s and 1980s about whether the route to prosperity was through planned economies or free markets. That debate has passed. We all agree that the regulated free market is the engine of prosperity, and thank God for that. It is a huge advance for humanity and for this country. We have to get to a similar position in this case, where we recognise that we are talking about the liberation of energies far beyond those that currently exist, however brilliant a group of Ministers and civil servants there is in Whitehall.

Secondly, we need a strategy for the future, and I want to explain briefly the way in which we would like to approach that. Thirdly, we need an honest debate about where and why we disagree.

However, my problem with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, and to some extent with the document that was produced yesterday, is the lack of a proper sense of balance about the genuine state of Britain. The report rightly states that the way out of poverty is work. However, worklessness has not increased but decreased in the past 10 years. The number of children who live in workless homes has decreased by 400,000 and the number of people in work has increased by 2.5 million since 1997.</p>

 Does the Minister acknowledge that the distribution of employment in the past 20 years has become much more unequal?

 The hon. Gentleman makes the comparison with Europe, but the right hon. Member for West Dorset talked about the number of workless households. They have decreased from 18 per cent. in 1997 to 15 per cent. today. Progress has been made.</p>

However, I do not want to get into that. Does he believe that debating whether the Government have been successful serves any purpose? The key is where we are now.

 The right hon. Gentleman asks an important question, and I shall tell him why it serves us to discuss whether we have been successful. The question is whether we change course because we believe that the Government have not succeeded in the past 10 years, or whether we acknowledge the gains that have been made. If we do the latter, we build on the strategy and do not reverse it. The debate on the condition of Britain is therefore important.</p>

We can all agree that education is the key to opportunity, and I am pleased that the report acknowledges that investment in the early years is particularly important. That is why we have invested, and why we will continue to invest, in the early years. That is why we intend to reach our goal of having 3,500 children&#146;s centres by 2010.

Since entering the House, I have campaigned on the issue of youth services, which is one of the important keys to the issues that we are debating. Indeed, I know that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, have taken a keen interest in that issue in the past. When I was chairman of the all-party group on youth affairs, I was struck by the number of hon. Members who told me that inadequate youth services were a very serious problem. Here, I agree that the voluntary sector and social enterprise can play an important role. The truth is that we have not invested properly in youth services for something like 40 years, since the Albemarle report was published in the 1960s. That marked a big increase in the amount of investment in youth services. In the next few weeks, the Government will produce a strategy on how to invest in the future, which I very much hope will command all-party support.</p>

At the same time, we also need to focus extra help on those who need it most. That has been the focus of the social exclusion unit&#151;now the social exclusion task force&#151;and it has led to reductions in rough sleeping and improved support for older people.

 There are nowhere near enough drug and alcohol addiction services in this country, but it is sometimes felt that there is a prejudice against faith-based organisations involved in these areas. Although faith-based solutions might not be right in every case, there are many cases in which a church or church-based organisation can make a dramatic difference.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. When I was Minister with responsibility for the third sector, I met a number of faith-based organisations who told me that they did not want to proselytise or convert people. It was faith that drew them to the work they did on drug addiction, but they were not trying to impose their faith on people. It is often hard to get public authorities and others to understand that. I have no problem with faith-based organisations helping to provide those services, as long as there is no conditionality in terms of converting people.</p>

 May I take my hon. Friend back to the point made by the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) on drug prevention? We need to change the culture in this place and in Government about how we view prevention. People do not get many brownie points, or tick many boxes in their local area agreement, for prevention. One can find it difficult to measure the product of prevention. Will my hon. Friend, and the House, seek to make the big cultural shift&#151;in the Government above all&#151;to recognise prevention and measure it effectively? If so, we will be spending much less money&#151;an argument that he can deploy with the Treasury&#151;on the consequences of failure and a little bit more on making sure that as a result of drug prevention, we get productive youngsters.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is a double-funding problem; we have to spend to deal with the consequences of failure, and it is difficult to shift money away from that because we need to continue to deal with the problem. Many of the programmes launched in the past 10 years, such as Sure Start, are precisely about prevention, as are youth services. My hon. Friend is also right to say that the issue of outcomes is difficult. We need to show that we are getting results from public money, but these outcomes are often difficult to capture. Perhaps we can draw on my hon. Friend&#146;s experience in this area.</p>

 To his great credit, the right hon.

It is not the result of the last 10 or 20 years; it is the result of the last 35 years of policy by all parties, who have been excessively defensive about their policies. In 1971 there were 1,000 drug addicts. There are now 280,000. Should not we start by recognising that failure, and then go on to look for solutions in other countries that have achieved great successes?</p>

 The Minister rightly emphasises that faith-based organisations can play an important role in tackling drug and alcohol dependency. However, there is much less scope than some of their advocates propose for faith-based approaches to tackling problems such as the high rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The truth is that it is no good preaching at people about abstinence; what we need are decent sexual health services and contraception provision. There must be a practical approach, rather than one based on religious fervour.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes the point far more eloquently than I could, and I completely agree with him. I think that he has also said that good sex education is important. Our teenage pregnancy rate is high compared with those in the rest of Europe, but it is lower now than it has been for 20 years. That is partly because of the approach of the past 10 years, which has involved more sex education than previously.</p>

we want to support small organisations that make a particular difference. The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green and I have talked in the past about the role that small organisations play as part of the social glue of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70711-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07071186000045">I also believe that we must enable charities to campaign, because real social change&#151;which is needed in many of these areas&#151;comes not just from above but from below, and from the campaigning work and advocacy that third sector organisations can do. We must be careful, however. The voluntary sector can play an important role in helping to deliver services, but it must never be used&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter) says&#151;as a way of abdicating the state&#146;s responsibility to fund public services adequately. That is a cautionary note, if I may say so, for the Opposition in particular.</p>

 It is important that when the state, whether national or local government, engages the third sector&#151;and especially small and successful organisations&#151;it does not then try to wrap the third sector in so many terms, conditions and specifications that it is prevented from doing its job. Does the Minister agree that third sector organisations must be given their head so that they can continue to do the job they were doing before they were contracted by the Government?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes the strong point that we need large and small organisations active in the sector and helping to deliver services. Does he detect in the report that we are discussing a strong bias against larger organisations, and does he agree that the delivery of the digital hearing aid strategy, for example, could not have been done by a small organisation? It was delivered by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, working closely with the Government. Has he also noticed that if the Conservative party manifesto commitment to fund the four pillars of the lottery equally&#151;25 per cent. each&#151;were to be implemented, it would cut the amount of lottery money going to small organisations&#151;currently 35 per cent. of lottery funding&#151;by &#163;60 million, which is the equivalent of the awards for all budget?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to post a warning, because anxiety about large organisations is a theme in the report. If that is simply about the fact that we need to ensure that small organisations are properly involved and their skills and talents are tapped into, that is right, but many large charities do an extraordinary job in many different ways. I agree with my hon. Friend that we should not have a prejudice against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07071186000051">There are, however, two areas in which I feel that I must part with the tempting consensus that is breaking out. In an intervention, the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said that we should not engage in point-scoring on public spending and how much a policy costs. I agree with that, to an extent, but we would not be discussing the spending implications of this report, which amount to billions of pounds, and I do not criticise the right hon. Gentleman for that, were it not for the fact that the Opposition are committed to cutting public spending as a share of national income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07071186000052">I welcome the fact that Opposition Members have come to this debate saying, &#147;We do think that poverty and social justice matter, and that the issues that our society faces are important.&#148; However, I fail to understand how they can also say, &#147;As a precondition of deciding our strategy, the one thing that we know is that public spending must fall as a share of national income.&#148; I am not asking them to say that it must rise as a share of national income. All I am saying is, do not tell us that we need more spending on dealing with drugs and alcohol, more spending on special needs, more spending on people with learning disabilities and more spending across the board&#151;we share many of those views&#151;yet then say, &#147;But we must cut the state as a share of national income.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07071186000053">That is the problem for the Conservatives. They are caught between their new-found embrace of social justice, which we welcome, and what their hearts tell them they believe in&#151;the smaller state. The right hon. Member for West Dorset is in transition, if I may put it that way. In 2001, in a famous&#151;or infamous&#151;episode, he told the<i>  Financial Times</i> that we should cut the share of national income to 35 per cent. of GDP. He then disappeared, and reappeared in a toga in his constituency. I notice that he has not being saying that for the past six years, which I very much welcome. However, we cannot have the grown-up debate that the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green wants following his report if the Opposition say, &#147;We know we need a smaller state to achieve the outcomes that we want,&#148; when nothing in the speech of the right hon. Member for West Dorset suggested that the smaller state was the key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07071186000054">That is what is remarkable about this debate. I will be honest&#151;I expected the right hon. Gentleman to say, &#147;And here&#146;s why we need to cut public spending. Here&#146;s why cutting public spending as a share of national income is the answer to the social problems that we face,&#148; but he did not do so. So I suppose I am urging him to go that one step further in his transition, and to say, &#147;Well, look&#151;that is probably not the right approach. It probably isn&#146;t right to pre-judge the size of the state in that way. It&#146;s probably right to say that in fact, that is an old ideological hang-up from 2001 and the toga episode.&#148;</p>

Crime costs the state &#163;60 billion a year, and family breakdown &#163;24 million, while failed education, together with drug and alcohol abuse, are also huge costs to the Exchequer and the taxpayer. Is he arguing that they are good and should be kept, or is he trying to reduce them? If the latter, I wonder whether he would agree that we should reduce the size of the state.</p>

The report is a valuable contribution to the debate and I recognise a lot of the characteristics of today&#146;s society that are identified in it&#151;in particular, the breakdown of family life in this country over the past three or four decades. The social consequences of that breakdown are important and are issues that all the parties need to think about carefully.

Gentleman&#146;s report. To me that indicates that there is nothing inevitable about the nature of the problems that we have in this country, in their widest sense. If having greater family fluctuation and breakdown than in earlier years, or less social mobility, or more drug and alcohol abuse, were simply characteristics of any liberal society, we would expect to see those problems replicated across a lot of advanced countries, but we do not. The United Kingdom does extremely badly, and that is a challenge to us to think about what we can do to have some influence in those areas.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a half-reasonable point. The factors that he points out would affect particular measures in the UNICEF report; they certainly would not affect others. Any fair analysis of the Government&#146;s record would recognise not only that they have sought to do a tremendous amount since 1997, or perhaps more accurately 1999, but that, so far, the results are mixed and that it is too early to say quite how successful they are going to be. These things obviously take a considerable amount of time to work through. That is true of areas such as social mobility, where we are commenting on figures that relate to an earlier time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07071186000088">Before I move on to the Government and the present situation, I would like to say that I particularly welcome the fact that the Conservative party is taking an interest in these issues. In fairness to other parties in the House&#151;I am sure that the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) would be the first to acknowledge this&#151;although some of the problems identified in the report relate to family breakdown that may have nothing to do with any Government, many of them relate to the problems of unemployment, homelessness and economic breakdown that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, when his party was in power, and are not unrelated to Conservative party policies. If the report reflects an acknowledgment that the Conservative party must focus on not only economic efficiency, but a fairer society and social mobility, that is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07071186000089">Let me turn to the present situation before I comment briefly on several of the proposals in the report by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green and some of the issues that we want to be flagged up. The Government have a record of enormous commitment to tackling many of these problems, even though there is marked ambiguity about their attitude to the breakdown of the family. The Minister&#146;s speech did not really touch on whether the Government believe that family breakdown is an enormous cause of social problems and on whether they take the view that they simply do not have any mechanisms to influence that. If we look at what has happened over the past few years, while there are certain signs of improvement as a consequence of the Government&#146;s policies, there are big unresolved, challenges and areas in which things have moved backwards. When the Minister defends the Government&#146;s record, I hope that he will not understate the enormous problems of social breakdown that remain unresolved because if he does, he will be giving up the leadership that his party has displayed over the past few years by failing to recognise how bad some of these problems are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70711-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07071186000090">Let me draw the Minister&#146;s attention to a few specific problems, such as housing. As the Prime Minister acknowledged today, we have gone backwards with regard to access to affordable housing and the number of people on the homeless list since 1997. We now have more children in overcrowded accommodation and outside a stable home environment. Those factors must be enormously important for determining whether someone will do well.</p>

employment rate compared with several others, but we also have an enormously unequal employment situation. Many double-earning couples are doing quite well, but a huge proportion of people have been out of the work force completely for a long time. That is why, although this country has a high employment rate, it manages, bizarrely, to be the EU country with the largest number of children in workless households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07071186000092">When we look at employment over the past few decades, we see that the Government&#146;s record on the employment rate has been flattered by the fact that female employment has been increasing over the past 10 or 15 years. Male employment is now 10 per cent. lower than it was in the era of Harold Wilson. An enormous cohort of people&#151;many of whom lost their jobs in the 1980s and 1990s and some of whom went on to incapacity benefit&#151;are still out of the labour market. The fact that almost the same number of people are on incapacity benefit 10 years on from 1997 should worry a Government who came in with a pledge on welfare reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07071186000093">The breakdown of family life is yet to be reversed&#151;hopefully there are signs that the situation is not getting worse, but it is certainly not getting much better&#151;and there is a much greater concentration of deprivation in deprived neighbourhoods. As John Hills recently reported, while the employment rate in social housing estates was almost two thirds a few decades ago, it has plummeted to something like a third. People in deprivation are now more likely to be living with people in those same difficult circumstances. Their children are attending the same schools as other children in such circumstances, which reinforces disadvantage. As the UNICEF report indicated, when young people have little hope and few skills, they are far more likely to take the option of having children at an early age and staying out of the labour market, thus resulting in cycles of deprivation. The situation out in the country is slightly gloomier than the Minister allowed for. When he defends an extremely impressive record of commitment, he should not underestimate in any way the problems that exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07071186000094">Let me turn briefly to several of the proposals in the report by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green. It was inevitable that a few of them would dominate the media coverage. When I scanned the report as rapidly as I could today, I noted that some of the most interesting proposals were those that would attract the press rather less, owing to their very nature. We all know that that happens when we try to get coverage on policy matters. I have no doubt that we&#151;and the Government&#151;will go through the report carefully to see what we agree with, what we can pinch, and what is a good idea. I have no doubt that we will find a great many good ideas in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07071186000095">My concern about the drift of Conservative social justice policy is that it seems to rely on two things, and the Minister for the Cabinet Office touched on one of them in his comments about public expenditure. He mentioned that the Conservative party has got hooked up to a rule that involves reducing the public expenditure growth rate even further than the Government already have to. Investment in public services, whether through the public sector or the  <br>

private and voluntary sectors, will be that much more difficult for a Conservative Government who stick to that rule. That means that some of the big gains and savings that the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green has mentioned a couple of times in his interventions will be that much more difficult to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07071186000096">As I have seen in my constituency, voluntary and private sector groups can play a big role, either as an add-on to state services, or working completely separately from them, but there may still be many cases, including in relation to employment services, in which the state will have to fund the voluntary and private sector provider. If there are rigorous controls over public expenditure growth, it will be very difficult to square the circle, and to fund the proposals properly while still investing in education and health. That is one concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07071186000097">The second concern is that many of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals rely on the hope that the Government can, by pulling various levers, encourage families to stay together. I do not underestimate the possibility of people, particularly those on low incomes, responding to economic incentives. Indeed, that idea is the basis of some of the Government&#146;s tax credits; the idea is that people will go to work because there is a working tax credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07071186000098">There is a problem with tax credits, and if the Minister looks again at the report on fraud and error in tax credits that was issued this time last year&#151;there will be another one tomorrow&#151;he will see that the Government reported that almost &#163;400 million-worth of fraud and error in tax credits was simply due to the discrete problem of people who lived together misrepresenting their position, and pretending to live apart. There is no question but that there are problems to do with whether people have incentives to misreport their position. It is more difficult to know whether people are deciding not to couple on the basis of tax credits. As I know from my advice centre, the economic incentives are significant, and should not be underestimated for people on low incomes; the right hon. Member for West Dorset cited that point earlier. We should consider that issue carefully, and although the Minister danced around the boxing ring a bit on that one, I am pleased that he did not completely rule out action; perhaps we will see measures on that issue in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07071186000099">I am less optimistic about some of the other proposals in the report produced by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green; I do not think that they will strengthen the position of married couples in the way that he thinks they will. Earlier today, I spoke to the Institute for Fiscal Studies about transferable allowances, which have been mentioned briefly, and one of the hard facts that it pointed out to me immediately was that most of the cost of the transferable allowance will be spent on people who have no children. The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal would cost &#163;3.2 billion, and &#163;1.7 billion of that would go to families with no children, whereas his concern, obviously, is to get the money to children.</p>

offer the allowance to those with children below a certain age, to all couples, or to couples with caring responsibilities. It depends on what we wish to do. All the figures that the hon. Gentleman gave are not exactly correct. I actually set out the IFS figures in the report.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="07071186000101"><a name="70711-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="07071186000761"><b>Mr. Laws:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman is right that the allowance can be salami-sliced, but there are other problems. Today, I looked at the figures relating to the individuals who might be entitled to the transferable marriage allowance. About 25 million people in the United Kingdom are in married couples, and of those individuals, about 5 million are retired, so the allowance is of limited relevance to them, on the whole. There are 18.7 million people of working age in couples, and 11.6 million of them are part of a couple in which both people work. As I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would acknowledge, they would get no benefit at all from the proposal, because they are already using their allowances to the full. There are 2 million households where nobody is working at all. So only 20 per cent. of the 25 million married couples in the United Kingdom would gain anything, and 80 per cent. of people would be totally unaffected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07071186000102">Other groups would be affected in ambiguous ways. I was interested to read that there are 1.1 million married couples living apart in separate households. That raises the challenging question of whether we would give, and how we would administer, transferable allowance based on marriage to two people who had split up, especially where the person who gained from the transferable allowance could well be the man, who had left his wife and the children. Such situations would present great policy challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07071186000103">As the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green is aware, the issue was considered in the 1980s by Lord Lawson who, I believe, was quite sympathetic, but when it went out to consultation at the time, there were other big objections. One of them was cost. We have to consider what the other priorities are if we are to spend &#163;3 billion. Administratively, it would be immensely difficult because we would have to track two incomes for two individuals at the same time throughout the tax year. The proposal would be a disincentive for the second individual in a married couple to work, for reasons that are obvious, although the right hon. Gentleman may be less worried about that if he is happy for one of the individuals in a couple to stay at home looking after the children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07071186000104">One must also question whether a &#163;20 incentive for only 20 per cent. of married couples will cause people to change their behaviour. I know of no economic evidence that suggests that. The right hon. Member for West Dorset, who is a thoughtful, fair-minded and intelligent man, was suitably cautious and circumspect when he responded to me earlier, probably because he knows that there is no evidence. I acknowledge his point about the proposal being a signal, but signals are important only if people ultimately respond to them. We do not know whether they would.</p>

 That sounds like an echo of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) who, when he was beginning to phase out the married couples allowance in the 1990s, said that he knew of many reasons why people got married, but the existence of the married couples allowance had never been one of them.</p>

There are also some serious issues&#151;Ministers have sought to raise them&#151;about the effect of sending out that signal on the children whom we are indirectly trying to affect.</p>

That is, in some ways, what we are saying. We are willing to penalise some families and children and reward others on the basis of those choices. It is a difficult issue. This country has a massive problem with the breakdown of marriage and stable relationships, and I understand why the right hon. Gentleman has given the proposal priority.</p>

 Surely the juxtaposition of married units against unmarried units is all wrong. There can be a very compelling case for giving targeted assistance to households where there are children, whether the household is based on a married couple, an unmarried couple or a single parent, but for the life of me I cannot see is why one should give a prize to people with no children, simply because they happen to be married.

 Anyone can make a case that others are being excluded, which is nonsense as regards this proposal, which offers a very focused sort of support.

If it were to go wider, it could also help those who may choose to look after their mothers when they get older. As the hon. Gentleman may or may not  <br>

know, some of the greatest problems for couples arise when they are having to make such choices balanced against the amount of money that they can have. This would not generate an immediate desire for people to get married, but it recognises something that came up endlessly when we produced the report&#151;that many people out there, beyond our own world, have jobs, not careers. If someone is eviscerating chickens on an assembly line in Bradford, that is not a career&#151;they make that choice because they have to, because they cannot afford to bring their family up otherwise. This would be one way of allowing them to make a choice; there may be others.</p>

 I understand why the right hon. Gentleman feels so strongly. My main argument against this specific proposal is that I do not think that it would work. I do not underestimate the significant penalties for couples, particularly in relation to tax credits and for people on very low incomes, and it is worth considering a couples premium. Many other elements in his report, for example on good parenting practices and encouraging strong families, should also be looked at closely. I recognise that on the basis of not only the national picture but my constituency experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07071186000114">I should like to raise several other points about the major proposals in the report, but I fear that I will try the patience of the House if I do so in too much detail. Let me just say, in general terms, that although I am delighted that the right hon. Gentleman and his party have produced a report of such quality&#151;and there may be some very good ideas in it&#151;they have to deal with two further challenges in this area: first, the public expenditure challenge and the question of priorities that the Minister raised; and, secondly, whether the proposed policies, particularly on taxation in relation to marriage, would make the difference that they envisage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07071186000115">I shall finish by highlighting a few of the challenges that Liberal Democrat Members think that the Government and those in other parties should be addressing. One of the risks with the Government&#146;s policy, if one were to stereotype it, is that there is too much emphasis, in public expenditure terms, on getting people above an arbitrary poverty line instead of getting them permanently out of poverty and giving them the opportunities that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70711-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07071186000116">I want briefly to touch on four areas. The first is education, which is obviously vital. In its report, UNICEF, which is not a body that would be inclined to vilify lone parents, stressed that, as a general rule, children growing up in stable families, usually with two parents, do far better. It was concerned that, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, many youngsters take a decision to get pregnant, or do so very early on. That is partly linked to aspirations and skills, as it offers a far more plausible, and even attractive, option to people with no skills and no prospects than to people who expect to have a career. We should focus on dealing with the very significant problems of educational underachievement. Instead of setting broad and unachievable targets to deliver private school levels of funding on some unspecified time scale, we should  <br>

concentrate on delivering those levels of funding to pupils in real need&#151;for example, through a pupil premium such as that in other countries, which targets additional money directly at the pupils in greatest need. That would mean that schools in certain parts of the country that often have much greater problems in terms of their catchment areas but similar funding to schools in other regions would have greater funding in future.</p>

Unquestionably, as the right hon. Member for West Dorset indicated, we still have much too high a level of worklessness in this country. We have made totally inadequate progress on getting people on incapacity benefit back into work. The lone parent figures are still disappointing, as is the number of young people out of the labour market. We ought to be looking at how we can use the voluntary and private sectors to get many more people back into the labour market.</p>

In Stanley Grove primary school, the teachers were teaching music on the stairs, while in Manchester high school for girls, there were sound-proofed rooms for teaching the violin. That was the difference; that was the society that was broken by the Tory party.</p>

We have smaller classes, we have computer suites in schools where the kids used to learn with the rain coming in through the roof, and we have free fruit and vegetables in pretty well every primary school in my constituency&#151;where before that previous Tory leader who said that there was no such thing as society had even taken away their milk. Abbey Hey primary school has a fruit stall every Friday afternoon, which sells fruit and vegetables to the children and to the neighbourhood. In Gorton, we have an educational village. Mellands school and Cedar Mount school are part of an educational village in what used to be one of the most deprived areas of my constituency. St. Kentigern&#146;s school&#151;a faith school of the kind that the Tories and the Liberal Democrats tried to destroy through their destructive amendment on quotas&#151;has some of the highest Ofsted ratings in the entire country. </p>

This November, the licensing system for private landlords will come to my constituency and, as a result, there will be controls and fines for antisocial landlords. Under the antisocial behaviour legislation, which the Liberal Democrats opposed, the police can now close down pubs and other premises where drugs are being sold.</p>

However, we were one of the most deprived constituencies in the country, and now we no longer have situations such as the one that existed during the period of the Conservative Government, when a man in the Fallowfield area of my constituency, a security guard, came to me and said, &#147;My employers have increased my working hours to 64 hours one week and 72 hours the next, alternating, with no overtime. They have also reduced my hourly wage.&#148; That was what life was like in my constituency under that lot who want to mend the broken society. When I wrote to the then Secretary of State for Employment and asked her what could be done for that man, she wrote back to say that he could resign from his job. With no jobs available in the constituency and no national minimum wage, that would have meant his forfeiting even his redundancy benefits, such as they were.</p>

 So much for the consensual tone of the debate so far. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) referred to the original proposed title of the debate: &#147;Mending the Broken Society&#148;. When we use the phrase &#147;broken society&#148;, we at least begin to get close to how many people instinctively feel about the condition of our society today.</p>

We can argue about definitions of poverty, talk about the language&#151;whether we describe it as social exclusion, deprivation or poverty&#151;and discuss the measuring sticks we use to assess the extent of it, but at the end of the day most Members of the House know what we are talking about. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) talked about the number of head teachers who referred to problems in their schools resulting from family and social breakdown. Many of us see the consequences of that in our surgeries on a Friday, and if we do not see it there, we should see it in social action projects in our constituencies, or at least read about the consequences of the phenomenon in the newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07071186000131">When I was flicking through the social justice policy group report last night, I was reminded of a book I read 10 years ago, which made uncomfortable reading for Conservatives at the time. It was a book called &#147;Dark Heart&#148; by a left-wing journalist called Nick Davies, who had spent two years travelling around some of Britain&#146;s most deprived communities. He saw teenage boys who had made the passage from local authority care into teenage male prostitution, girls who had been abused as young children and who had gone into prostitution, and people in cycles of substance abuse and addiction&#151;people living on the fringes or outside the law. Flicking through that book, I wondered what he would see if he went back to those same communities 10 years on. I do not pretend that everything has got worse, but on the housing estates which I am familiar with in Walworth, Peckham, Bermondsey and south Hartcliffe in Bristol, or on some of the smaller estates in west Wales, poverty has become more entrenched for many and the situation has got a lot worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07071186000132">After 10 years of this Government, let us not pretend that the blame is all to be laid at their door. We have a shared responsibility, and there has been discussion about how long-term some of the challenges are. I was reminded recently of some girls I met on the youth offending wing of Eastwood Park female prison in Gloucestershire. Those girls would have been six or seven years old when this Government came to office, but by that time the course of the lives of many of them would already have been easy to predict. A lot of them would have been victims of abuse and deeply scarred inside. At the age of 16 or 17, many of them have deep, messy scars on their wrists; they wear ugly home-made tattoos and carry expressions of deep hopelessness and despair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07071186000133">I found that the most prevalent factors in the lives of those girls were exactly the same for a group of lads in Cardiff prison. The common factors throughout their lives are family breakdown, educational failure, worklessness and substance abuse, and it is those themes that my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) and his group sought to address in their excellent report. I welcome the contribution that the report makes to the discussion. It must be taken seriously on the Opposition Benches, and on the Government Benches too. It provides some hope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07071186000134">In the short time that I have left, I would like to make a few points. First, I make a plea to my party&#146;s Front Benchers to consider seriously the report&#146;s findings and not to allow caution, especially on spending commitments, to prevent them from adopting many of its recommendations. There must be up-front investment to provide some of the solutions, and we need to be ambitious. We might be cautious and afraid of opening up little holes in our public expenditure plans, but the truth is that there is a whopping great hole&#151;a bleeding great hole&#151;in our public finances, which is the &#163;102 billion cost of social breakdown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07071186000135">My second plea is to Government Front Benchers for positive engagement on the issue. I know that the Minister has a powerful intellect and a good heart, and I welcome his positive engagement. Too often, when I  <br>

have raised such issues, Ministers have refused to engage and provided answers to completely different questions. For example, when Ministers have been asked about the number of young people not in education, employment or training, who are doing nothing constructive with their lives, too often they trot out statistics about the fall in youth unemployment. It is a completely different subject. The cohort of 16 to 20-year-olds who fall through the net has been growing at a time when, demographically, the number of 16 to 20-year-olds has been shrinking. In Wales, 12 per cent. of young people are not in education, employment or training. I therefore appeal to the Government to start to engage positively on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07071186000136">Thirdly, let us consider alcohol misuse. At the weekend, there was discussion in the media about one or two recommendations in the large report about tackling the curiously British problem of widespread alcohol misuse and the proposal for a tax hike on alcoholic drinks. The alcohol industry&#146;s response was predictable and depressing&#151;it simply dismissed the suggestion out of hand. I do not know whether that policy solution is correct; I would need to consider evidence for elasticity of demand and availability of alternatives and so on. However, we need the drinks industry to respond positively and join the discussion as it has not done up to now. We should tell it like it is&#151;it is not the drinks industry but the binge drink industry. It makes its money not from people having a pint of beer after a round of golf, but from all the young people who go out on a Friday and Saturday night and get hammered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07071186000137">In the past 10 or 20 years, the industry has progressively ramped up the alcohol content of the drinks it sells. A pint of beer nowadays is not the same as a pint of beer 20 years ago. It is now common to buy a pint of beer that is 6 proof; 20 years ago, it would have been 2.5 or 3 proof. That is one reason why alcohol consumption, especially among young people, causes so much damage and devastation. I encourage hon. Members to spend an evening with their local police or in the accident and emergency department of their local hospital, if they still have one, to ascertain the sheer volume of cases that are a direct result of alcohol misuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07071186000138">There has been much discussion of family policy and whether the proposals in the Conservative report will have the suggested impact of encouraging more couples to stay together. There is much more discussion to come. Family breakdown was the most prevalent factor in the lives of the young people I met in Eastwood Park prison and Cardiff prison. Often, their parents were not divorced&#151;they had simply been raised by a lone parent. We do the children of this country a huge disservice by trying to cling to a pretence that we can be neutral about different family structures. A huge body of social science research shows that a child from a broken home or a lone parent family is far more likely to fail at school, turn to crime, be a victim of crime and fall into alcohol and substance misuse.</p>

prevent dissent and disagreement about specific policies, but the tone is much more attractive to the public. We need to achieve that tone on the subject of today&#146;s debate. We must avoid the petty tribalism and partisanship that will get us nowhere. If we are to make progress and tackle deep-seated, entrenched problems, we need to achieve a consensus on the aims. We can have a robust discussion about how we get there, but we need to change our tone and start engaging with a much wider audience. Perhaps that would also help restore faith in this place.</p>

 There has been a lot of talk about consensus in today&#146;s debate, but it is important to test the breadth and depth of that consensus. I am afraid to say that I, for one, am not convinced of its sincerity and I intend to test it in my contribution today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07071186000141">The good news for the Opposition is that the <i> Daily Mail </i>is delighted by their rehashed Mary Poppins agenda, but the bad news is that their recently beatified patron saint Polly Toynbee is fully depressed by it. I welcome their attempted apostasy, but like the British people I do not believe it&#151;simply because, on the basis of today&#146;s comments, there is no evidence to support it. With that in mind, I care too much about the progressive cause, improvement of society and social democracy to turn away willing converts, but any such conversion must recognise past social policy mistakes and the root causes of them. If there is to be a consensus, we must test it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07071186000142">My point is that if society is broken, Opposition Members should recognise that it was they who broke it. A strong society needs strong social policies. Key elements of our currently effective social policy include the national minimum wage and the record-breaking increase in public spending on our nation&#146;s schools, hospitals and other public services. That must be recognised&#151;those investments not only strengthen the bond of our society, but are the glue that keeps it together. If the Opposition are serious about social cohesion, they must recognise that the failed policies of the past&#151;including lower taxes paid for by less public spending on public services&#151;inevitably resulted in worsening public services and social decline. Those policies were unwanted and unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07071186000143">Logically, if the Opposition recognise that truth, they must jettison their proceeds of growth rule, which underpins all that they sought to achieve in office and would also lead to a repeat of the failed policies of the past and their consequences. If they really wish to help improve society, they should commit to its betterment with actions rather than words. To go further, they should support us and support our public expenditure policies.</p>

I did not marry for the benefit of society and I do not believe that the Government should incentivise lifestyle choices.

order to subsidise honeymoon travel&#151;I think that might work. It is a curious juxtaposition when someone claims to want to mend society while creating social divisions between the married and the unmarried.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07071186000145">It is surely perverse to ask the state to make a judgment on the value of people&#146;s unique relationships both within and outside marriage. Would such incentives apply to gay marriages and civil partnerships? If the motivating factor behind such a move is, in part, consideration for the well-being of children, why discriminate against children from relationships and in families outside married relationships? How many children&#151;the innocent parties and unwitting victims of those proposals&#151;would be disadvantaged by this move? As a married father, I have no wish for the state to reward my children for my relationship choice and I do not think that their classmates, whose parents are not married but clearly enjoy stable and loving relationships, should be penalised because of the state&#146;s view of their parents&#146; actions. That cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07071186000146">The Opposition are absolutely right to highlight the effects of drug use on our society. Here again, however, I must take issue with them because their prevailing mindset seeks to penalise certain behaviours among the lower social orders while ignoring those same vices or lifestyle choices among the more affluent sections of society. That manifests itself in a particular way in current Conservative thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07071186000147">The Leader of the Opposition recently announced that he was in favour of lowering the classification of ecstasy from a class A to a class B drug. In the same week, the police in my constituency seized a huge haul of ecstasy. The market for that drug was clearly children and teenagers, whose safety and well-being should not be sacrificed in a desperate search for modernity or, still worse, a headline for the Conservative party. I do not doubt the sincerity of the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) or the intentions of the Opposition more widely, but they must be consistent. If they care about the effect of drug use on our society, the Leader of the Opposition must recant his views and drop his double standards. Talk is cheap&#151;but by their deeds shall we know them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07071186000150">I can also draw upon 11 years of work as a criminal solicitor dealing with many clients who were addicted to drugs and alcohol. We should be concerned both about the 300,000 people with an opiate or cocaine dependency and the increasingly younger people who are being affected by the misuse of alcohol. It is important to look at individuals and, in my years as a criminal solicitor, I have learned that the characteristics of those affected are that they are drug addicts, often with a learning difficulty. They may have come from single-parent homes and had little or no contact with the father or any role model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07071186000151">My first client at Enfield police station, who also ended up as my last client, graduated through crime to become one of the most prolific burglars in Enfield, sometimes doing 100 burglaries in a weekend. He is now serving a stretch at Pentonville, but he had become disconnected from society and consumed by his addiction, which affected those most dear to him. There were times when he connected with society, mainly when he was in his role as a father and he suddenly realised that he had a relationship with society and those around him. It is important for policy makers to capture such individuals at those times and to ensure that they realise that they have a role in society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07071186000152">The Government want such people to stop committing crimes, but that is it. They are happy in many ways to see such people parked up on a methadone programme and not going any further. However, we have higher expectation&#151;we want them to recover, become part of society and take their responsibilities seriously as fathers, citizens and employees. Such individuals are parked up in prisons, but some are in other institutions such as hostels, child care facilities and the like. They are most at risk of never getting out of the cul-de-sac they are in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70711-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07071186000153">The Government have approached that matter by throwing money at it. We talk about public spending, and &#163;7 billion has gone into the fight against drugs. That is no mean amount, but how has it been spent? It has been spent to the detriment of the funding of alcohol dependency treatment, which accounts for only 6 per cent., while the money is spent primarily on methadone prescribing; &#163;111 million&#151;one third of the pooled treatment budget&#151;goes into prescription. That is a concern for those in the field, addicts and recovering addicts. In many ways, the expectation has not gone beyond methadone prescribing. There is a place for methadone prescription, but it has to be part of a supportive programme.</p>

The steps towards a solution to the tensions in our society should include building on examples such as Drove primary school&#146;s excellent community outreach work and reputation.

 There is a pressing need for us to rethink how we relieve poverty in this country and how we tackle social injustice. At present, 5 million people of working age in Britain are not working. There has been an alarming increase in the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training, and others have spoken about the impact of family breakdown. The most disturbing statistic of all, to me, is the appalling fact that 55 per cent. of families with a disabled child live in poverty.</p>

In short, he did less&#151;or rather, he got central Government to do less, so that local state government could do more. He devolved; he de-federalised; he localised responsibility for welfare. It was so successful that the number of families on welfare fell from 5 million to 2 million. Some 1.6 million fewer children were in poverty as a result, and minority groups, particularly African-Americans, benefited from the changes.

should devolve control of welfare to local welfare officers. Is there a need to reassess the assumption in the Beveridge report that the welfare state should necessarily be built on universality? Does that not create centralism? Does universality not preclude flexibility and the need to take into account the different conditions of individual people in this deeply imperfect world? As it is centralised, the current system is all too often devoid of compassion. Applying Mr. Clinton&#146;s logic, could we not localise control over welfare? Could we not give local budgets to local agents and give them discretion? Politicians in this place constantly talk the talk of localism&#151;of giving local government a greater role. Why not do it? Why not pilot some welfare projects that give them responsibility?</p>

 I begin by congratulating all three Ministers on their new appointments. I know that the two Ministers responsible for today&#146;s debate have a long-standing and genuine interest in the matters under discussion. I am an optimist about our society. For many years now, our society has been getting better for most people. We are generally more prosperous, and people have opportunities they used not to have. Our culture is now such that racism, sexism and homophobia, for example, are increasingly unacceptable, which has meant a material improvement in lives that were previously subject to harassment and misery. In many ways, we are becoming a gentler and better society.</p>

Given that most of us are experiencing improvements in our life chances, we have a particular obligation to take account of those who are struggling and being left behind. I am not going to trade statistics, of which we have heard plenty in today&#146;s debate. The report of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) contains many expert and erudite analyses of the problem.</p>

Whole communities were abandoned when they were in power. Groups such as lone parents were stigmatised and scapegoated by the Tories, so I agree with my right hon.

Six hundred thousand children have been lifted out of poverty. Unemployment has gone down dramatically and 2.5 million more people are in work, including many more women. Pensioners have not been mentioned in the debate, but 2 million of them no longer live below the poverty line. The number of children living in workless households has dropped. Teenage pregnancies are at their lowest level for 20 years.

Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) breaking ranks with his Front Bench. He called for more public spending, clearly opposing Conservative Front Benchers&#146; commitments to cut funding by &#163;21 billion.</p>

There are some useful suggestions in the Conservative proposals, some of which will appear familiar to my hon. Friends&#151;not least because they are lifted from our policy documents. Imitation is of course the sincerest form of flattery, so I welcome the support in the document for the measures we are already undertaking to support the third sector, about which I shall say a little more later.</p>

my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office said, the Tories, would be taking more than &#163;3 billion from public services and support for families to help married couples who pay tax, most of whom do not have children &#151;at the expense of children who are growing up in low-income families&#151;the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) forensically took apart the Tory proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70711-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07071186000202">I must admit that before the debate I wondered whether others on the Opposition Benches would be happy to support proposals for changing the tax system that would mean that only 3 per cent. of the benefit would go to the poorest 10th of the population. I was delighted that the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) made it clear in his intervention that he thoroughly disagreed with a proposal that would clearly stigmatise and penalise children in the most disadvantaged families. The Tories have chosen to spin this aspect of their report as something that makes them &#147;the great party of marriage&#148;, but as we have seen today they are hopelessly divided among themselves on the proposals. They have no answers to the forensic demolition of what are socially unjust proposals, given the impact that they would have on children in need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70711-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07071186000203">The truth is that families come in all shapes and sizes and that the Government must support all families, irrespective of their structure. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) was right to say that it is not the role of the state to say what type of family is best. The real focus of our efforts to tackle inequality should not be on family structures; it should be on supporting children so that they can grow up in loving, stable and supportive families, whatever their circumstances. The issue is about income for those children. It is about financial support through increased child benefits, which the Tories froze when they were in power, and the working families tax credit, which the Tories opposed when they were in opposition. There is the issue of giving children more time with their parents through increased maternity and paternity leave and giving parents that time to be with their children in those crucial early formative months and years. There is also the issue of giving greater support to parents through better access to child care. There are new children&#146;s centres and new programmes covering parenting skills and giving advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70711-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07071186000204">We do not have a massive problem of family breakdown and it is simply not true to say that we do. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon made that point. The vast majority of families are doing well. Parents are doing an excellent job and the outcomes for their children are getting increasingly better. Our challenge is to concentrate our help on those families&#151;about 2 per cent.&#151;who experience multiple family disadvantages and who have not been reached by the growth of our universal services. We might at least have a consensus on that and on the role of the third sector in meeting those needs. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who is not now in the Chamber, made an important point about early intervention and preventive work with those families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70711-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07071186000205">That takes me on to the importance of the third sector. The report states that one of the Conservatives&#146; objectives is to increase the role of the third sector in  <br>

tackling poverty. As the Minister with responsibility for the third sector, I wholeheartedly agree that voluntary organisations, charities, community groups and social enterprises make a vital contribution. That is why, over the past 10 years, the Government&#146;s public support for the third sector has risen from &#163;4.5 billion in 1997 to more than &#163;10.5 billion in 2005. In practical terms, that is reflected in the thousands of community groups and local voluntary organisations that are involved in programmes to support families, communities and those with disabilities. We heard from the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) about those who work with people with addictions. The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire mentioned those who work with young people in and out of custody. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon&#151;a real champion in her community&#151;described the work of the Drove centre in her constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70711-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07071186000206">It has not been possible to acknowledge properly all the contributions made by hon. Members. However, warm words about social justice from Conservative Members cannot hide the facts of their party&#146;s record in office and voting record in opposition, or the reality of the stigmatising impact that their party&#146;s proposals would have on children in most need. A shiny new faade&#151;</p>

We now discover that the agreement that appeared to have been arrived at does not in fact exist. That will be the subject of this debate.

Gentleman referred, is what is the appropriate way for the Bill to deal with deaths in custody. The Government have considered the position extremely carefully. The hon. Gentleman was right, in the sense that the Bill was due to be debated in the other place on 2 July&#151;but the debate there was postponed for a week, to provide for the new Government to consider the issue further. However, after that period of further reflection, and having given further careful thought to the concerns raised in this House and another place, the Government have concluded that we have gone far enough. The Government have offered considerable movement in response to the concerns that have been expressed.</p>

 I, too, welcome the Minister. It is unfortunate that she is making her maiden speech in her new role on such a controversial matter. In fact, Lord Ramsbotham said in the Lords that there had been an agreement that had been withdrawn. However, whether or not that is so, is she aware that some Labour MPs, including me, are very unhappy&#151;I said that I was last time, and I remain so&#151;that the Government will give no indication whatever of a time when the Prison Service will be included? I hope that my right hon.

I can assure the House, including those who have expressed concerns and those who will no doubt speak later in the debate, that we have considered the issue further.

deal with a specific problem in attaching liability for gross corporate negligence to a corporate body. It addresses that problem against the backdrop of a number of failed prosecutions of large corporations over the years, as hon. Members present know. The Bill seeks to improve the prospects for a manslaughter prosecution in cases of that nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07071199000028">In dealing with that problem, the scope and application of the offence have been considered carefully at all stages. In debates in Committee and on Report, this House considered whether the offence should apply more widely than just to corporate bodies, and be extended to certain unincorporated bodies. We have made those changes in response to the concerns that have been expressed and the application of the Bill has, in that sense, been widened. Debates have also considered the penalties available for the offence, and whether that aspect of the law should be improved. Again, the Bill makes advances in that direction, too, providing for an entirely new sort of sentence&#151;a publicity order.</p>

 I shall deal with the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s points in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07071199000031">From the outset, the Government have recognised that it would not be enough to apply the new offence to organisations in the private sector, and have tackled the principle of Crown immunity, making provision for the new offence to apply to Departments. But against that background, the Government have always been clear that it would not be right to apply the new offence to the exercise of certain public responsibilities. That position has been widely endorsed in both places, in most respects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07071199000032">We have been prepared to reconsider that position in the light of the debates that have taken place in this House and the other place on the issue of deaths in custody, and we have offered considerable movement in response. I recognise that not all hon. Members accept that we have moved far enough, but they should accept that there has been movement. The amendments in lieu put forward by the Government explicitly recognise the principle of the Bill applying to deaths in custody, and set out a mechanism for bringing this about. That is absolutely right, and it represents considerable movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07071199000033">Nevertheless, there remain strong concerns about the practical implications of lifting Crown immunity. This brings us to the point that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) has raised. The prosecution of Government Departments will represent an entirely new departure, and there are significant questions about the consequences of extending the criminal law to the management and organisation of activities that involve a high degree of public policy, and responsibilities that fall uniquely on the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07071199000034">There has been a good deal of recognition that it would be right to provide more time to consider the extension of the offence to custody.

 I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say, but I am not sure that the logic of her argument suits general Government policy. The Government have been quite happy, through the Attorney-General, to prosecute battalion commanders for ostensibly vicarious responsibility for offences allegedly committed by soldiers under their command in Iraq&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>Someone from the other side of the Chamber says, &#147;Rightly so.&#148; Why, then, is there any distinction in principle that would affect the practice that touches on deaths in custody?

If the Minister is arguing that it is right in principle to do this, but not today, what is the difference that makes it right in principle tomorrow but not right in practice today?</p>

 I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying. I thought I had made it clear to the House that we have accepted the principle that the law could be extended&#151;at the appropriate time&#151;as those who object to putting the Bill on to the statute book without that extension have requested. However, there are large issues of practical application involved. It would not be correct for the Government to go ahead and agree to a timetable before we had had a chance to have a proper look at how the practical applications would impact on Departments and their functions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="07071199000037"><a name="70711-0021.htm_spnew12"><a name="07071199000618"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 The more the hon. Lady goes on, the more I worried I get, because the original amendment, which provided for the introduction of this measure by statutory instrument at a later date, suggested that the Government had accepted the principle and that it was a matter of timing. Listening to her now, however, I am beginning to detect the signs that it is a matter of this year, next year, sometime, never. I suspect that the objections have come from the police&#151;a matter that I shall comment on later&#151;and that the resistance to this perfectly sensible proposal is now so great that the Government wish to duck out of it.</p>

 I would not accept that as a correct interpretation of what I am saying. The Government have clearly accepted the principle of the offence extending to custody, and we have provided a means in the Bill to bring that about. However, we think that the right way to balance the concerns of practicality against the desire to make progress is to provide for an order-making power in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07071199000039">I would like briefly to explain a change in the drafting of the amendment in lieu before the House. The power to extend the offence applies slightly more widely than to those strictly in custody or detention, and includes people on specified premises. This ensures that the order-making power will be sufficiently wide to cover local authority secure accommodation where residents are not necessarily in custody, for example. It might also be desirable to cover certain other  <br>

The Bill has been a long time coming and many people are anxious to see it on the statute book. The Government have offered considerable movement to those who want to see the Bill extend to deaths in custody, opening the door to achieve that, but that is as far as the Government consider it right for the Bill to go. Therefore, I hope that on the basis of a further clear signal from the House today, the other place will recognise that the time has come to allow the legislation to pass on to the statute book.</p>

 I am sorry for the Minister, that her first outing at the Dispatch Box on such a matter should be so unsatisfactory. Listening to her reminded me of when my children were smaller, and engaged in what psychologists call displacement activity: when they are confronted with something about which they do not want to hear, they start parroting off about all sorts of other topics in the hope that we will be distracted from the main issue by their words. I listened to her tell us all about the merits of the Bill and how it was introduced to deal with large corporations, and all of that is very fine indeed.</p>

Everyone was willing to co-operate to ensure that the legislation worked in all areas&#151;so it really is a subject of the deepest regret that we are now in ping-pong with the other place because of a major disagreement. Indeed, there must be a serious threat that the Bill could fall completely unless the Government decide to extend the time, which I believe expires on 19 July. The ball is very much in their court.</p>

Having seen his intemperate behaviour at the Dispatch Box on the matter, and his intemperate words on the subject in general, I was hoping that with the arrival of the new Prime Minister and the right hon.

other place, the date for the debate was moved. Lord Ramsbotham, who has been the great proponent of including deaths in custody, was informed that the Secretary of State for Justice was minded&#151;and I emphasise that word&#151;to include custody in the Bill and asked whether he would be happy if there were a delay while that was considered. Everyone, including myself, rejoiced that at long last we would have a sensible outcome. We expected the sensible outcome to be that the Government would say that they wanted a long lead-in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07071199000047">As the Minister will know, if she has read the <i> Hansard</i> reports of previous debates, we were prepared to agree a long lead-in time, because we accept that when a culture change is being brought about, with possibly rather recalcitrant organisations, providing time for them to prepare is very sensible. In fact, that agreement collapsed. I hazard the suggestion, to which I hope the Minister will respond, that the cause of the collapse came not from the Ministry of Justice but, interestingly enough, from the Home Office&#151;and, I suspect, from the police. I regard that as a rather shameful matter.</p>

 I am worried that the opposition should have come from the police. Perhaps my hon. Friend will forgive my making this point: some 40 years ago, when I was practising at the criminal Bar&#151;and on a separate occasion when I served as a special constable&#151;I saw in custody unreasonable force being used on people who were detained by the police. It was not fatal in those cases, but it was undoubtedly serious, and the sort of thing that we must guard against.</p>

 I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend. We have said it before, but it is worth repeating: 2,000 deaths occurred in custody of one form or another between 1995 and 2005. I am sure that many were inevitable, sad events, for which no one is to blame. However, there have also been 10 verdicts of unlawful killing in that period, and deaths have taken place in police custody that appear to be worrying and give rise to concerns that there has been at least gross negligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07071199000050">We are considering a legitimate subject for concern. In the circumstances, it is especially important to include deaths in custody in the corporate manslaughter regime. The Under-Secretary said that the measure was aimed at large corporations but, in the context of governmental organisations, the Prison Service and the police are exactly that. I am at a loss to understand how the national health service can be prosecuted for gross negligence and corporate manslaughter for the death of patients who take their own lives in mental hospitals, when the Prison Service, the police and other custodial environments are exempt, as special hospitals would be under the provisions.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have taken a specific interest in this issue.

 I am aware of the problems of collective responsibility, but it would nevertheless be useful to have some clarification of the source of the objection. Last week, we understood that the Secretary of State for Justice was minded to accept the proposals, presumably with a long lead-in time. If I may say so, that was greatly to his credit. The impression that I derived from anecdotal evidence was that the objection came from the Home Secretary, who was repeating the objections that the previous Home Secretary had so emphatically made. However, the previous Home Secretary&#146;s objections were made when he was responsible for the police and the Prison Service, but the Secretary of State for Justice is now responsible for the Prison Service. Let us consider the matter logically: if the Home Secretary is making vociferous objections, the reason for that must lie in opposition from the police. I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), as a Government Back Bencher on an inside track, may have further information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07071199000053">This is a question that we want answered. Where is the problem? If it is a question of a long lead-in time to give organisations time to adapt, the Secretary of State must know that he will find us conciliatory and willing to help; we always have been. However, listening to the Minister this evening I began to feel much more anxious that although the power may reach the statute book, it will only be able to be invoked by the Government, if they wish to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70711-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07071199000054">Given that the instincts of the Secretary of State for Justice appear to be have been superseded by the views of others, I detect that in some quarters there is no intention of allowing the measure to appear on the statute book. I am convinced that it is needed and will contribute to exactly the same culture change for which the Government have argued so forcefully in respect of large corporations and their attitude to negligence. I am also convinced that, in most cases of unfortunate deaths in custody, nobody need worry about the possibility of prosecution. However, there will be some cases when prosecution is entirely justified.</p>

 My hon. Friend seeks, in his polite and kind way, to acquit the current Secretary of State for Justice from the charge of objecting to the change in law that we require, and to heap the blame on the current Home Secretary and the previous Home Secretary, who had responsibility for both the police and prisons. However, bearing in mind the current dangerously overcrowded state of our prisons, and the fact that since January 2006 about 100 people have taken their own lives in the prison estate, might not the current Secretary of State for Justice and his Ministers of State be scared witless that if the Bill were adjusted to include responsibility for corporate manslaughter within the prison system, the Attorney-General could be knocking on their door with a summons?</p>

 That is possible, although the initial reaction of the Secretary of State for Justice when he first came to office was&#151;very encouragingly, as I have said&#151;to ask for a delay while he considered something that I suspect he found quite reasonable. I am detecting that the right hon. Gentleman might be wanting to intervene; if so, I shall happily give way to him.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is doing his best to provoke Government Front Benchers to engage in tittle-tattle about what he has heard might have gone on last week, following the postponement of a debate. The Government were prepared to consider further the serious issues raised during the course of these debates, which was a sensible course that shows a certain degree of flexibility. There was no agreement of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has speculated upon, and our conclusion was that the movement that had already been made was movement enough. The hon. Gentleman knows that he will not draw me into saying anything further than that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o362"><a name="07071199000058"><a name="70711-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="07071199000630"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 I would have thought that I could legitimately draw the hon. Lady into indicating where, among those who have custodial charge of individuals, the greatest objections to these proposals lay. That must be a legitimate question of debate, and it seems to me that it does not touch on collective responsibility at all. The Minister can answer that question, and I very much hope that she will do so at the end of the debate, or in response to my interventions or those of other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07071199000059">What I can say to the Minister is this: without the inclusion of deaths in custody, the Bill is seriously flawed. The other place has made its position crystal clear and it is, I believe, going to continue to send the Bill back to this House until reason prevails. The Government&#146;s position is unreasonable. I believe that many loyal Government supporters also believe it to be unreasonable. The Minister&#146;s current position worries me much more than when we first started this ping-pong process, because I am left with the uncomfortable sense that the promise made was an entirely hollow one. I urge the House to support the Lords amendments and to put the Bill on the statute book with deaths in custody included.</p>

 I welcome my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to her place on the Front Bench for this debate. I am afraid that it is rather a difficult job to pick up after such a long gestation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07071199000061">It is important to recognise the concessions that the Government have made, the most important of which was to extend the Bill to include Crown immunity. I recall our debates over the issue of deaths in custody and I believe that the Government made some significant concessions, which we should acknowledge. The question is whether they go far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07071199000062">The statutory powers of the prisons and probation service ombudsman are now in a Bill before the House, there is the review of the preventing deaths in custody forum, and the Government&#146;s proposals the Bill. Those are all very positive measures and are sufficient, from my point of view, to represent a compromise. Unfortunately, however, we are left with the question of the date. I am afraid that I have to agree with the House of Lords on that&#151;and, indeed, with what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) had to say about it. I shall support the Government tonight, but with reluctance, because there is strong merit in the argument that we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07071199000063">To develop my earlier intervention, I would be very surprised if it was the police who raised the objections, as this issue has been floating about for some time. My  <br>

understanding all along was that the police were quite laid back about the extension of the Bill to them. I would be very surprised if their position had changed. The difficulty always was the Prison Service, and I recall that several years ago&#151;long before this Bill came before the House&#151;I had a meeting with the present Attorney-General, in her former guise as a Home Office Minister, to discuss plans for previous legislation. I later learned that everything had fallen apart because of the objections of the Prison Service even then&#151;before we got into the sort of debates that we are conducting now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07071199000064">I suspect that the problems still emanate from the Prison Service. If so, it is the wrong position for the service to adopt. A well-run prison has nothing to fear from the extension of the provisions covering deaths in custody to the Prison Service. A well-run Prison Service has nothing to fear from that either. The Bill is not about prosecuting people, but about acting as a deterrent to make sure that things are run properly in the first place. We know that the Bill would apply to only a very small number of cases and we hope to see a lever to improve standards, rather than prison managers being prosecuted, which is not the intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07071199000065">If there has been a change, it may be because some people have misunderstood the Bill. It is about not individual liability, but management liability. There is no question of an individual prison officer or police constable facing prosecution under the Bill; the senior management would be held to account. Maybe some of the opposition stems from a misunderstanding of the Bill.</p>

I have had representations from a senior manager in the health service who tells me that prison hospitals will be the responsibility of the health service and not the Prison Service, yet she cannot get changes made in prisons and keeps warning the service about that. If death in custody extends to the health service, those involved could be charged when the fault lies with the Prison Service, which has responsibility.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right and highlights an important anomaly in the Bill. People in custody in a mental institution may not be prisoners&#151;they probably will not have been convicted&#151;but he makes an important point. The examples, while not identical, are similar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07071199000068">We come now to the question of the date and there are lots of different ways in which this problem could be dealt with. We could change the wording of the Government amendment from &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;, which indicates an intention to legislate rather than a permissive power. That would make a significant difference. I would not even press for a date to be in the Bill. We are looking for a target date to which the Government will work to bring the Prison Service up to scratch. It would then know the date by which it has to be sure that it is dealing with the issues properly. A measure tabled along those lines would go a long way towards satisfying the other place. I know that Lord Ramsbotham suggested 1 January 2009, less than 18  <br>

months away. That is a rather ambitious timetable, but Ministers naming the day is more important than the specific date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07071199000069">My hon. Friend should also resist the suggestion from the other place to extend the deadline for the Bill from 19 or 20 July. Frankly, I cannot see any point in that; either we resolve the issue or we do not, and extending the date will make no difference to the forceful arguments that have been made. We are getting to the constitutional limits of the debate and perhaps if the House finds the Government&#146;s case persuasive&#151;sadly, I do not, but I will support the Government because of the reasonable concessions that have been made&#151;the Lords will accept that the elected Chamber should prevail. The Government may win the vote but I do not think they have won the debate. I hope that even at this late stage, my hon. Friends will seek the sort of compromise that appeared to be on offer before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07071199000070">Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain what Lord Ramsbotham meant when he said that an offer had been made and then withdrawn? What was that offer and why was it withdrawn? That is a serious point.</p>

 The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) has left us with a constitutional conundrum. He says that the will of this House must prevail and that that requires the confidence of this House in the Government&#146;s arguments. However, he has no confidence in their arguments and yet he will support them to demonstrate the will of the House. That suggests to me that the other place should pay more attention to the arguments in this House than to how it votes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07071199000072">I should start by welcoming the Minister to her post. I regret that in her first outing she has to put such a tawdry argument to Members. I regret even more the Government&#146;s obstinacy in maintaining a position that has no logical credibility in terms of what they say they want to achieve. It betrays an unfortunate dog-in-the-manger attitude in the face of what has clearly been demonstrated to be broad support for both the Bill&#146;s general principles and the measure under discussion. Many Members felt when the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid) set down his heavy burden that there might be an opportunity for progress; we are disappointed that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07071199000073">The Government&#146;s position is to accept the arguments made in all parts of the House that death in custody should be part of the remit of the Bill&#151;and they trumpet that as being a great concession&#151;but then to say that they are not prepared to give any indication of when or if the part of the Bill applying to death in custody will ever be implemented. Therefore, the Government are in the same position as St. Augustine of Hippo&#151;they want to be chaste, but not yet. What is the reason for that delay? What is the conceivable purpose in saying, &#147;We think it is wrong to allow gross negligence of a corporate nature in the management of the prison or police services that results in death in custody when a duty of care should apply, but we will let a few people die in the meantime while we think about whether we will implement this measure?&#148; That is, in stark terms, what the Government are saying. They are saying that they will accept a position where such corporate negligence   <br>

is okay and they will not put a date on the implementation of the death in custody measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07071199000074">The point made by the hon. Member for Hendon is important. This is a corporate manslaughter Bill. It is not individuals who will be found wanting in the execution of their duty; it is management, policies and the structures that are in place. For how long must we expect to wait before an adjustment is made so that we have Prison Service policies that do not allow deaths in custody when they can be avoided by better management? What is the obstacle to the Government going ahead at the fastest speed possible to achieve that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07071199000075">The Government say that they want to send a clear signal to the other place, but a clear signal is being sent to them. They should listen to what Back-Bench Labour Members have had to say, not only tonight but on every occasion. Has a single word been uttered from their Benches in support of their position? No, they have been roundly condemned by every contributor to the debate because their position is absurd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07071199000076">The statutory basis for a prison ombudsman is welcome, but that measure is in a Bill that is yet to receive its Second Reading and which will be carried over into the next Session, when I am sure that there will be many other issues that will take a long time to discuss. Therefore, that is not an immediate mitigating factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07071199000077">We have offered a number of ways in which the Government could discharge their responsibilities in this respect. We have not said that this must be implemented tomorrow, or even next year. We said to the Government to name their date&#151;any date. If they cannot put it in the Bill, they could just name a date in debate. They could say that they intend to ensure that our Prison Service and police service are in a state in which they are no longer grossly negligent in the execution of their duties by whatever date they choose&#151;2009, 2010 or even 2020. If the Government named a date, the House would be satisfied. The obstinate refusal to name a date is what makes people so very irritated with the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07071199000078">I wish to raise one specific issue about the amendment in lieu. I hope that the Minister will explain how we should construe the two parts of amendment (c). It is important that we have a clear statement in subsection (1) of the proposed new clause of the power to extend the meaning of &#147;relevant duty of care&#148;. If that takes precedence over subsection (2), I have no problem. But if subsection (2) is a &#147;however&#148; section, so that even if subsection (1) were to be implemented, it could still be reduced in its effect by the exceptions and exemptions in subsection (2), we are no further forward. Can the Minister confirm that the power to extend is the first principle and that anything within subsection (2) is subordinate to subsection (1)? That is an important point, because it will tell us whether there is doublespeak even within the concessions that the Government propose today. I hope that the Minister will reply to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07071199000079">The Government should have resolved this issue a long time ago. This is an absurd argument and a waste of everybody&#146;s time and effort. The concession has been made, so let us get on with it and get it  <br>

implemented. If the Government cannot do it tonight, surely they will do it at the other end. If we reach 19 July and we still have not resolved the matter, the Government should come back with an extension. That would be absurd and unnecessary, but if it would achieve a resolution of this matter, please let us do it. The best thing we can do is ensure that this Bill, in its entirety, including the duty of care for those in custody, passes through both Houses of Parliament. It could do so tomorrow if the Minister would simply say the right words in responding to this debate.</p>

 The Lords are entirely right. Perhaps the House will forgive me if I say that I have a little personal experience of such matters. Many years ago I was a police Minister, and for about 18 months to two years I was Minister for prisons. I have also been a special constable, and for the last 40 years off and on I have practised at the criminal Bar. As I said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), on at least two occasions when I was in the cells&#151;once in my capacity as a special constable and again as a criminal barrister&#151;I saw police officers using force of a wholly unacceptable kind. We know that it happens, and I have also dealt in chambers with cases in which unreasonable force was unquestionably used by police officers. When I was prisons Minister, I was very concerned by some of the standards of behaviour and systems that I saw. I am much reinforced in my view by the fact that Lord Ramsbotham, the former inspector of prisons, is such a strong advocate of this provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07071199000081">I shall not speak for long, as I know other hon. Members wish to speak, but I wish to make some general points. The first is that prisoners, whether in prisons or police cells, are in an extremely vulnerable position. There is very little outside monitoring and, often, very little outside concern. The truth is that, but for a small community of people, our fellow citizens do not care very much about what happens in prisons or police cells. They put it out of their minds. It is a terrible thing that that should be so, but it is so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07071199000082">Death or injury in prison or police cells can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, it can happen because of a breakdown in systems. There is the person who is suicidal but not properly watched. There is the person suffering from drug withdrawal whose condition is not properly managed. That constitutes a serious breakdown in the system. Deaths can occur because of dangerous premises&#151;for example, because the authorities, be they the police or the prison authorities, simply have not addressed properly the condition of the premises. Death or injury can occur by reason of the action of fellow prisoners against the deceased person, in cases where the police or the prison authorities should have guarded against that, but did not. Of course, deaths can also occur because police or prison officers act in an irresponsible and gross manner. In that latter category, it is certainly true that the individual officers concerned can be liable under the ordinary principles of common law, but if there has been insufficient supervision, the managers should be responsible as well.</p>

There is no indication whatsoever of when the provision will be introduced. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, in that I suspect that it will be a very long time in coming, if it comes at all. Secondly and differently, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is right in thinking that subsection (2) enables the Minister to &#147;restrict or disapply&#148; the exceptions. My own belief is that it is an additional and overarching measure that is not subordinate to subsection (1).</p>

First, it does not have to be introduced at all. Secondly, through the application of proposed new subsection (2), the safeguard can be so restricted as to be no proper safeguard. That is no compromise. I have spoken for long enough, and I shall sit down as other Members want to speak.</p>

This is an otherwise thoroughly worthwhile Bill, and although I acknowledge that some progress has been made on this issue, I express disappointment at our being unable to resolve it. There is a great deal of good will in all parts of the House, and no one is making unreasonable demands.</p>

However, we do not understand why it is not possible, as was said earlier, even to refer in debate to the kind of timetable that the Government have in mind, in order to put people&#146;s minds at rest. There is a suspicion that we have reached deadlock and that this is never going to happen unless it happens now. There is no better time than now to set out a timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70711-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07071199000088">The problem in a nutshell is that we face a mighty vested interested&#151;certainly in the case of the Prison Service. That mighty vested interest is going to be against its inclusion in the Bill&#146;s provisions now, next year, in five years&#146; time, in 10 years&#146; time or whenever the Government get round to trying to include it. Things will change for the better only when we have the political will to face it down. That is what Ministers are for, and what many of us on the Labour Benches are looking to Ministers for. I foresee that this will go on for a very long time, with no satisfactory resolution. I tell Ministers that there is no better time than the present to resolve the issue, at least in terms of setting some sort of timetable.</p>

 I agree with what the hon. Members for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) had to say about the arguments involved, although I am disappointed by their decision as to how they will vote. I think that Ministers would listen all the harder to what they have said, given their separate experience and reputations in this area, if they were to translate their arguments into votes against the Government this evening. I appreciate that that is a difficult thing for them to do, but the risk is worth while on occasions such as this.</p>

Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said&#151;and he has said it probably two, three or four times now&#151;not every death in custody will render the organisation to which we are referring liable for corporate manslaughter. There are plenty of accidental and self-inflicted deaths, as well as deaths by natural causes, in the custodial estate under the control of the Ministry of Justice, but they would never render it or its subordinate organisations liable for corporate manslaughter under the criminal law.</p>

I suspect that only a very few cases will be caught by the law, and they will not only be of the type described by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) from his previous experience. In cases such as he set out, in which a police officer goes over the top, that officer could be personally liable for assault, or something worse.</p>

date into the distant future. If we analyse what the Government have said, both here and in the other place, in an attempt to understand their responses to the arguments put to them, it is clear that there is no principle involved in their decision. There may be some element of political expediency, but that is not a principle to which our country&#146;s courts would be attracted, and it should not be described as such by a Minister of the Crown. As a politician, I fully accept that political expediency plays some part in how we organise our affairs, but to raise it to the level of a matter of legal principle is a mistake, and a mistake that the Government seem to make more and more often.</p>

I am sorry, because I had thought better of the hon. Lady who is now dealing with the arguments on behalf of the Government, but I have to suggest that when she read out her speech she was reading it for the first time; if a woman of her calibre had thought about it more carefully&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>The duty of the Whip is to keep quiet&#151;occasionally to listen, and perhaps to learn, but to keep quiet. The duty of the Minister is to learn from experience and from the mistakes that the Government made in their previous guise&#151;before the changeover from last time.</p>

To give proper effect to extending the custodial functions under clause 2, certain exemptions in the Bill need to be disapplied. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was correct when he said that proposed subsection (2) provides for exemptions to be disapplied, but it does not provide for exceptions to be made to the forms of custody to which clause 2 is extended. Proposed subsection (2) provides no power to restrict the duties to which the offence is extended under proposed subsection (1).

 I do not want speculation. I would like the House to know where the problem lies, because plainly there is one or the Government would have implemented the provisions immediately. Is the problem with the Prison Service, the police, some other organisation or the bureaucrats in the Departments? Who are the people saying that the Government should give no finite date for the implementation of the provision?</p>

 All Members should remember that the Government have accepted the principle of the offence extending to custody and have provided a means in the Bill to bring that about. There are always practical difficulties. We are ending Crown immunity for the first time, so organisations will have to deal with significant changes. It is not sensible to try to rush such things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70711-0023.htm_para7"><a name="07071199000105">A number of organisations responsible for custody have publicly expressed concerns about the extension of the offence. The Government clearly set out their views during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. The Association of Chief Police Officers expressed similar concerns in its evidence. Therefore, concerns have been publicly expressed on the record during the progress of the Bill from its draft stage through to the ping-pong that we are now engaged in. I do not wish to go any further than saying that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70711-0023.htm_para8"><a name="07071199000106">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) made some points about deaths in prison hospitals that I want to reply to. The offence as it is currently set out applies to the supply of services, which would include the supply of medical treatment where a death relates to gross corporate negligence in the provision of that treatment. The offence would apply wherever the death occurs, whether in prison or otherwise. To that degree, I hope that I can reassure him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70711-0023.htm_para9"><a name="07071199000107">What the Bill excludes is the exercise of certain uniquely public functions, such as the management of prisoners in custody. However, we have not said that we will never extend the Bill in the way that hon. Members on both sides have indicated that they would like us to. We want to do things properly and in the right way. We need to make sure that we do that. Now is not the time to put a stop to the Bill in total.</p>

 In this the 25th anniversary year of the British liberation of the Falkland Islands, I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak before the House about the islands, and in so doing to remember that victorious day on 14 June 1982 when the Union flag was once again raised above Stanley following the surrender of Argentine forces who had illegally occupied British territory. As well as reflecting on the events of 1982, I should like to highlight the importance of the Falkland Islands to the United Kingdom today as a British overseas territory, and also the enormous progress that the Falkland Islands have made in economic development a quarter of a century after the conflict ended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para3"><a name="07071199000542">On 2 April 1982, the Falkland Islands were illegally invaded by Argentina on the orders of the ruling military regime in Buenos Aires. As hon. Members will recall with pride, that invasion was defeated by a taskforce of brave men and women from Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces, sent to liberate the islands by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who instinctively knew that it was Britain&#146;s moral duty to free the islanders. She never doubted that victory and liberation would be achieved by Britain&#146;s courageous fighting men and women. It was because of Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s decisive, measured and unwavering resolve that the loyal British subjects of the Falkland Islands are today able to live in freedom and continue to call themselves British, as all Falkland islanders do with immense passion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para4"><a name="07071199000543">Britain&#146;s victory in the South Atlantic not only restored freedom to the Falkland Islands but directly led to democracy in Argentina, which then spread throughout Latin America. It also restored our nation&#146;s self-confidence. I could not put it better than to quote the words of Lady Thatcher:</p>
<a name="70711-0024.htm_brev4"><a name="07071199000593"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The members of our Task Force restored our nation&#146;s spirit, they restored our nation&#146;s standing, and they gave us back our nation&#146;s sense of pride and purpose. We remember them. We salute them.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para5"><a name="07071199000544">Those British troops who made the ultimate sacrifice did so protecting British people&#151;just like you and me, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;who, although 8,000 miles away in the South Atlantic, are our kith and kin and had every right to expect Her Majesty&#146;s Government to come to their rescue, which they did so gallantly. I also pay tribute to all the personnel who serve today on the islands at Mount Pleasant airbase, continuing to defend the territory 365 days a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para6"><a name="07071199000545">I welcome the fact that all Governments since the 1982 conflict have upheld the rights of the people of the Falkland Islands to remain British and consistently refused to discuss the sovereignty of the islands with Argentina. I am grateful to Her Majesty&#146;s Government for remaining steadfast and urge them to continue to rebuff all the hostile and illegitimate claims of the Government of the Argentine Republic.</p>

Nicholas Winterton). In that capacity, I have been privileged to attend many ceremonies and commemorative events over the past month to mark this important 25th anniversary. Most particularly, they have included the liberation day commemoration hosted by the Falkland Islands Government at Lincoln&#146;s Inn, the dinner hosted by the lord mayor of London at the Guildhall in the presence of Lady Thatcher and, of course, the official Falklands 25 commemoration at Horse Guards parade on Sunday 17 June. Her Majesty&#146;s Government should be commended on the organisation of such a great occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para8"><a name="07071199000547">All those commemorative events and many others held this year have rightly shown a sense of jubilation and celebration for the Falkland islanders, in being able to determine their own sovereign path. Those events have also provided a fitting opportunity to remember those 255 magnificent British soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilians who, tragically, lost their lives in the conflict of 25 years ago. We should also not forget the sad loss of life endured by Argentine forces, all of which could have been avoided if the Government of Buenos Aires had chosen the path of democracy, rather than illegality and aggression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para9"><a name="07071199000548">Today, the Falkland Islands are a modern, self-confident and prosperous land, proud of their status as a territory of the United Kingdom and determined to uphold their right to choose to remain under the Crown, but increasingly self-assured in running their own affairs and making their own decisions about the future development of the islands. I pay tribute to the Falkland Islands Legislative Council and all its elected Members. They are making great strides in securing economic prosperity and a modern economy for the islands, as well as embarking on many forward-looking policies to develop them for trade, fishing and tourism, while ensuring the protection of the environment and wildlife that lives in abundance on the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para10"><a name="07071199000549">I should also like to put on the record my thanks to the Falkland Islands Government representative in the United Kingdom, Miss Sukey Cameron MBE, who works tirelessly to promote the interests of the islands here in London and ensures that the Falkland Islands are never forgotten by hon. Members in all parts of the House. The Falkland Islands Association also continues to do sterling work in supporting the Falkland Islands, under the chairmanship of David Tatham CMG, who served as Governor of the Falkland Islands between 1992 and 1996. Every year in December, I attend the Falkland Islands battle day parade at the Cenotaph in Whitehall organised by the association, and I thank it for all the wonderful work that it does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para11"><a name="07071199000550">Now that we have celebrated Falklands 25, I hope that we can also celebrate the Falkland Islands as they are today&#151;a modern democratic society, thriving on the fruits of its own ingenuity and enterprise&#151;and that we in the House, together with Her Majesty&#146;s Government, can all support the islands as they grow and develop in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para12"><a name="07071199000551">I have been lucky enough to visit the Falkland Islands on two occasions, the most recent of which was in 2005, when I travelled to the south Atlantic as part  <br>

of my tour of duty with the Royal Air Force and the armed forces parliamentary scheme. On both occasions I could not fail to be struck by one unique feature of the Falkland Islands: the nature and the magnificent wildlife of land, sea and air. I am sure that hon. Members are aware of my keen interest in wildlife, conservation and animal welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para13"><a name="07071199000552">With that in mind, I should like to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to a project that is under way on the Falkland Islands. Falklands Conservation needs help with an exciting project to establish a wildlife centre in the heart of the islands&#146; capital, Stanley. A permanent home for Falklands Conservation in this special year is, I believe, an appropriate and positive initiative, which will provide a real and lasting benefit to the islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para14"><a name="07071199000553">Falklands Conservation hopes to expand and capitalise on the growing tourist economy that the islands are enjoying. People from across the globe are attracted to the islands by their natural beauty and exceptional wildlife. While such an active, growing and thriving tourist economy is welcome, we must consider the implications of a developing industry for future generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para15"><a name="07071199000554">I ask the Minister to meet representatives of Falklands Conservation to discuss how Her Majesty&#146;s Government might be able to provide assistance to the islands and help in the development of this excellent project. I believe that a wildlife centre in Stanley of the kind sought by Falklands Conservation could provide the necessary base where tourists, visitors, scientists, naturalists, schoolchildren and the islanders themselves could work together in the best interests of conservation throughout the Falklands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para16"><a name="07071199000555">One project spearheaded by Falklands Conservation is the albatross protection programme. The Falkland Islands hold the world&#146;s largest breeding population of black-browed albatross, as I am sure the Minister is aware. Sadly, however, many of these majestic birds are being killed by long-line fishing. In fact, so many have died as a result of that industry that they are now listed by Birdlife International as an endangered species. The Falklands fishing industry is doing its best to reduce its impact on this migrating bird, and has dramatically cut the mortality rate in Falklands territorial waters, for which it should be commended. Falklands Conservation needs to undertake long-term studies to discover more about the scale of this problem and pinpoint where it is occurring. I urge the Minister to work with it and other international groups to reduce illegal fishing in the south Atlantic and to encourage fishing nations in the locality to adopt proven mitigation methods and legal practices under international guidelines, for the sake of protecting the species.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para17"><a name="07071199000556">May I also ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government to work with local conservationists on the islands to help to promote and protect the indigenous penguin population? In particular, there has been a significant decline in the number of rockhopper penguins, whose numbers on the island today are only a fraction of those of a century ago. This is especially worrying when we consider that the Falkland Islands still have the world&#146;s largest concentrations of rockhopper and gentoo penguins.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para18"><a name="07071199000557">I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the change in the law that has rightly strengthened the position of Falklands fishing companies by allocating 25-year licences, thus allowing attractive investment opportunities over the long term, especially in the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para19"><a name="07071199000558">I am glad to say that further investment in the islands&#146; future appears likely. The prospect of oil and development drilling work now appears to be on its way. This is a positive step, and I commend the Falkland Islands Government on their decision not to allow any future prospecting to distort the islands&#146; natural beauty, wildlife or conservation projects by insisting that any oil must be loaded offshore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para20"><a name="07071199000559">It is unfortunate that I should have to return to the issue of Argentina&#146;s false and illegal claims to sovereignty of the islands. Given the forthcoming presidential elections in Argentina, however, hot air is rising out of Buenos Aires again, which has made the Falkland Islands a topic of debate in Argentina once more. An example of this can clearly be seen in the decision to bar any company fishing in Falklands territorial waters from trading with Argentina. I hope that the Minister will reassure the House and the islanders that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will not in any circumstances enter into any discussions or debate with the present, or any future, Argentine Administration on the subject of sovereignty. Furthermore, does the Minister agree that the Falkland Islands flag should be flown on Horseguards Parade every year for trooping the colour, alongside those of Commonwealth nations? Sadly, it was absent on 16 June 2007, even in this 25th anniversary year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para21"><a name="07071199000560">Does the Minister agree that a Falkland Islands representative should be invited to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday each year, alongside representatives from the other British overseas territories and Commonwealth nations, to mark their valuable contribution and to remember those who lost their lives in the protection of Her Majesty&#146;s realms and territories?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para22"><a name="07071199000561">I hope that the Minister accepts that those two small gestures would send a positive signal from Her Majesty&#146;s Government to the people of the Falkland Islands, and a clear message of pride and patriotism to those who seek to undermine the British Falkland islanders&#146; right to self-determination, their right to remain subjects of the Crown and their right to have the same liberties and freedoms that we, as residents of the British isles and United Kingdom, cherish and defend.</p>

The 25th anniversary provided a fitting opportunity for us to remember the determined efforts of our armed forces in 1982, and the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to restore freedom, democracy and the right to self-determination to the islands. It also provided an opportunity for Falkland islanders to demonstrate to the world their successful development of the islands over the past 25 years, exactly as the hon. Gentleman described. As he will know, the Falkland  <br>

Islands Government held a well-attended showcase conference in London in April, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), in his capacity as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, was able to attend and set out again the Government&#146;s commitment to the islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para24"><a name="07071199000564">More recently, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram), former Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence, had the opportunity to see matters at first hand when he visited the islands last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para25"><a name="07071199000565">The Falkland Islands today are a modern, thriving society&#151;self-sufficient in all matters except the cost of defence. The islands have developed a sustainable fisheries industry, tourism continues to grow and the prospect of a hydrocarbons industry remains real. I might return to that point if time allows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para26"><a name="07071199000566">The economy has been carefully managed by successive Falkland Island Governments. Revenues have been put to good use in the development of education and health services, roads and communications, and most recently a wind farm, which will provide 20 per cent. of the islands&#146; energy requirements. It is regrettable that the Argentine Government continue to put economic pressure on the islands and political pressure on the UK in an attempt to force us to negotiate sovereignty. That will not work. Our position is clear: we support the islanders&#146; right to self-determination and we will not discuss sovereignty unless and until they wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para27"><a name="07071199000567">However, we are keen to foster a constructive relationship with Argentina in the south Atlantic. We have made practical proposals to strengthen the mandate of the South Atlantic Fisheries Commission, including renewing efforts to establish a multilateral high seas fisheries arrangement in the region, in line with best international practice on sustainable fisheries. We have continued our joint work on de-mining, undertaking a feasibility study, and we expect to publish the final report soon. Falkland Islands councillors have agreed that members of the families of Argentine armed forces who fell can hold a special commemorative event at the Argentine cemetery at Darwin later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para28"><a name="07071199000568">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind comments about the work of the Government and all those who put effort into the UK commemorations. They provided an opportunity for us to commemorate the conflict in a fitting and respectful manner, remembering the fallen on both sides. We are delighted that a national commemorative event held on Horse Guards Parade on 17 June was attended by more than 10,000 veterans and members of their families, and that it was watched by 2.3 million viewers on television. The live video link to commemorations on the islands was especially poignant and the weather at San Carlos served as a reminder to us all of the conditions that our forces faced in 1982.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para29"><a name="07071199000569">The hon. Gentleman asked about flying the Falklands flag, and I am informed that it is not our practice to fly the flags of any of our overseas territories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para30"><a name="07071199000570">The South Atlantic Medal Association 82 and Combat Stress organise opportunities for British veterans to return to the Falkland Islands. In 2007, approximately 200 veterans will be able to travel, with priority given to those who have not been back to the Falklands. The pilgrimage will take place in November,  <br>

during the Falklands summer, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence will accompany veterans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para31"><a name="07071199000571">As the hon. Gentleman said, it is important to remember that the Argentine people also suffered heavy losses in the conflict. We extended an invitation to Argentina to join a separate commemorative event in London, on a date that was acceptable to both parties. We regret that the invitation was declined. We have now, with the agreement of the Falkland Islands Government, offered members of families of the Argentine armed forces who fell in 1982 the opportunity to travel to the islands towards the end of 2007 to hold a private commemorative event at the Argentine cemetery in Darwin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para32"><a name="07071199000572">The hon. Gentleman mentioned several industries that now exist in the Falkland Islands, including the Falkland Islands fisheries. Since opening the conservation zones in the waters around the Falkland Islands in 1987, the Falkland Islands Government have developed one of the world&#146;s best managed and most sustainable fisheries. Islanders hold long-term property rights for maritime resources and have established joint ventures with partners across the world to catch illex and loligo squid and fin fish. Revenues from fisheries now account for more than 40 per cent. of the GDP of the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para33"><a name="07071199000573">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about Falklands Conservation, which works specifically with the Falkland Islands Government to safeguard the unique environment of the islands. We support the  <br>

project through the overseas territories environment programme fund and I am happy to receive representatives to discuss that. Indeed, tomorrow, I am meeting some Falkland Island councillors and will happily discuss any issues in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para34"><a name="07071199000574">The hon. Gentleman asked about hydrocarbons. Seven companies currently hold licences for the second round of oil exploration that is under way in the waters around the Falkland Islands. One of those companies is now in a position to commence exploratory drilling and hopes to secure a rig soon. We support the offshore prospecting policy pursued by the Falkland Islands Government, which is entirely consistent with the United Kingdom&#146;s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para35"><a name="07071199000575">I reassure the hon. Gentleman and all hon. Members that the Government take seriously their responsibilities to the overseas territories. We are committed to their security, good governance and economic and social development. We have no doubt about our sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and we will continue to uphold the right of Falkland islanders to self-determination. At the same time, despite potential diplomatic challenges, we will continue to look for opportunities for co-operation between the islands and their neighbours in South America.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="70711-0024.htm_para36"><a name="07071199000576">Falkland islanders can be proud of their achievements. The sustainable way in which they have developed the islands is an example to us all. If the islands continue to develop confidently and sustainably, islanders should be optimistic about the future.</p>
