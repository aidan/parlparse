 Primary care trusts continue to make good progress in securing more than 100 new GP surgeries in under-doctored areas and 152 GP-led health centres, to be open to patients 12 hours a day, 365 days a year. Those services will improve access, extend choice and complement existing family doctor services.</p>

 According to a recent survey of people attending a mental health day centre in south Birmingham, 85 per cent. did not have a GP.

However, the confusion about the rules on expanding those services is not so welcome. Will my right hon.

 My hon. Friend is right. Incidentally, we now have the latest figures. Since concluding the agreement with the British Medical Association in April, in which we sought the extension of provision in the week and on Saturdays&#151;we expect 50 per cent. of GP surgeries to offer that extended provision by the end of the year&#151;we have already moved in the first couple of months to 28 per cent. coverage. That is what patients need, not least in the constituency of my hon.

 Although the GP centres in under-doctored areas are welcome, does the Secretary of State agree that he has missed a trick on the GP-led health centres, which have been imposed on PCTs? If PCTs had a little more time, they could have consulted local communities and probably placed the GP-led health centres in areas where they were needed, and people would not feel quite so put upon.</p>

 I do not accept the hon. Lady&#146;s point. There is a genuine problem with capacity&#151;we are not considering a zero-sum game. From next year, we want all men and women between the ages of 40 and 74 to come in on a call and recall basis under a vascular screening programme. When we announced that earlier this year, the BMA said it did not have the capacity. There is a genuine need for those services. Each PCT must consult on the new GP-led health centres, and they will be welcomed.

 Although the extra Government investment in GP services is most welcome, why is there not the flexibility to allow existing GP practices to expand to meet the need, rather than having to create a new practice, which could have the effect of destabilising existing GP services? That is a real concern to GPs in my constituency. This should be done in that way only if the primary care trust wants that, but the PCT in my area blames the Government; it says it would like to do it another way, but the Government will not allow it to do so.

may be numerous PCTs which are trying to duck this issue by blaming the Government, they are wrong. We are talking about the provision of care for their patients. My hon. Friend is talking about under-doctored areas, and they have been under-doctored for 60 years. If that was just a matter of handing over the money to the British Medical Association, which is what its political representatives on the Opposition Benches argue for, it would have been resolved years ago. We are saying that the new GP services are important for these areas as they are in the interests not only of patient care but of something I know my hon.

We in this House all agree that there must be the highest standards of patient care, and the Darzi report rightly highlights the lack of accessible information about some GP practices, which hinders patient choice. However, this issue was identified in a previous Government report that was published two and a half years ago in January 2006, yet to date there has been minimal progress. Will the Secretary of State explain how patient care is to be improved, specifically via all-important innovation, when GPs do not have, and will not have, control of real budgets, the centralised target culture is to be maintained and extra tiers of regional bureaucracy are to be created via this report, instead of a responsive, patient-centric, outcome-based service?</p>

 There is obviously an audition on the Opposition Front Bench. There will be a reshuffle soon by the Leader of the Opposition, and with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) away, this is the other shadow Ministers&#146; chance to audition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o0"><a name="80722-0001.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000056">Let me unpick the question a little. The argument that the hon.

There are issues around improving patient care on which we agree with the BMA, and we are working closely with it to resolve them. The point about a bureaucracy emerging from the Darzi review is nonsense. The Darzi review takes into account the views of thousands of clinicians across the country, and it is about the opposite of this kind of bureaucracy. It says that with the right metrics&#151;I apologise for using that dreadful term, but they use it&#151;in place, quality can be measured and thus improved.</p>

The fact that that will be 18 weeks maximum by the end of this year is a tribute to the NHS, but a necessary part of achieving that was the introduction of those targets.</p>

Has my hon.

 Yes indeed. As I am sure my right hon.

He cites one example, and I could give one from my constituency&#151;my local foundation trust&#151;where the engagement of local people has led the hospital to have objectives of eradicating all waiting by 2010, introducing single rooms for those who want them by 2012 and completely eradicating avoidable infections by 2010.

Equally, if existing groups of staff in the NHS feel that they can offer a better, more innovative and flexible service through a social enterprise, we want to give them the right to ask the question and have their proposal seriously considered by a primary care trust.

The new NHS constitution makes it clear that any organisation providing NHS services in the future will have to take account of the fundamental non-negotiable principles it contains.

 It is not my job actively to encourage one model against another.

As part of Lord Darzi&#146;s report, we have, for the first time, given staff the right to request the chance to set up a social enterprise. We have also introduced new arrangements for pension provision for existing staff who wish to become part of a social enterprise. Essentially, we have removed many of the obstacles and the barriers that in the past have prevented staff who wanted to take that option from doing so. We will certainly look at the model that the hon. Gentleman mentions, and where we can learn from it we will share best practice.</p>

There are 10,000 pharmacies, and the issues are to do with access to those services. I am sure that he would accept that, while wanting to protect dispensing GP services where there are no other services available, which makes those services essential to the rural area, it would be quite remiss of the Government not at least to look at the rules concerning circumstances in which a GP dispensing service is on the opposite side of the road to a pharmacy.

In fact, he must have raised it in his constituency, as the rates of MRSA and C. difficile infection in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust were in decline in March this year. All health staff in the area are to be congratulated. We have reduced infection rates significantly for MRSA and C. difficile. Latest data from the Health Protection Agency for January to March show that MRSA bloodstream infections are down 33 per cent. from the same quarter of last year, and by more than 49 per cent. from the 2003-04 monthly average. The same is true for C. difficile infections: in the most vulnerable group of those aged 65 and over, the rate is 32 per cent. lower than in the same quarter of last year. NHS staff work extremely hard to drive down the number of infections. I agree that we must not take our eye off the ball, but we must also recognise such significant improvements.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer. Following yesterday&#146;s very successful and well-attended debate on children and young people, may I ask him specifically about adults? The estimates are that more than 250,000 adult stroke survivors have speech and communication difficulties. The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists is based in my patch, and a survey that it carried out found that more than half of adult stroke survivors say that either they did not receive services quickly enough or that they were not given enough therapy. Will the Secretary of State look at that problem, as resolving it would enhance the quality of life of people who survive stroke and who want, as anyone would, to go back to living a full life?</p>

That is always the case, because the figure includes the winter period when more older people&#151;these are post-65 statistics&#151;go into hospital.

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80722-0003.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000163">Let me start by paying tribute to the British servicemen and women who have served in Iraq with distinction since March 2003; in particular, I pay tribute to those who have given their lives in service of our country. I know that the whole House will join me in honouring the memory of the fallen and saluting the courage of all our military and civilian personnel. The House will also want to know that during my visit I had discussions with Prime Minister Maliki about the British hostages who have been unjustifiably held for more than one year. We want them released immediately, and I will continue to update the House on progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80722-0003.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000164">As I set out in my October statement, our objective is the creation of an independent, prosperous, democratic Iraq that is free of terrorist violence, secure within its borders and a stable presence in the region&#151;something that is firmly in Britain&#146;s interests and in the interests of the world as a whole. To achieve this, we have sought with America and other allies to support the Iraqi Government as they now take on greater responsibility for their own security and safeguarding their new democracy, challenging those&#151;whether terrorists, insurgents or militia&#151;who threaten their citizens and undermine the rule of law. We have also sought to foster democratic and accountable government and support national reconciliation, giving all of Iraq&#146;s communities a genuine say in the future of their country, and we have worked to help the Iraqis build their economy and give their people an economic stake in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80722-0003.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000165">In the last year, this has led us to pursue the strategy of overwatch, which is to move from a combat role to the training and mentoring of the Iraqi forces and the Iraqi police, to encourage the development of local government and to work with the Iraqis on a Basra economic development strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80722-0003.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000166">In recent months, conditions in Basra have shown a marked improvement. Incidents of indirect fire against British troops in the Basra air station have fallen from 200 a month at their peak last summer to an average of fewer than five a month since April this year. As the all-party House of Commons Defence Committee, which has visited Iraq recently, says in its report today, the security situation in Basra has been &#147;transformed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80722-0003.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000167">As General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker confirmed to me in Baghdad at the weekend, thanks to operations by Iraqi and coalition security forces, violent incidents right across Iraq are at their lowest level since 2004. Sunni groups have now joined the Iraqi and American forces in driving al-Qaeda from areas where it had been able to terrorise the population, and Iraqi troops, with British and American support, have had success against the illegal Shi&#146;a militias, giving the Government of Iraq more control over the country. Of course, this progress&#151;often fragile&#151;cannot be taken for granted. Millions of Iraqis are still refugees, either inside Iraq or in other countries; and the two car bombs that were detonated at the gates of an Iraqi army recruitment centre on 15 July remind us that there are groups still determined to inflict violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000168">The most important development is that the improvements that we have seen have been increasingly Iraqi-led. Security responsibility for 10 of 18 provinces has now transferred to Iraqi control, including all four provinces in Britain&#146;s area of operations. Iraqi security forces are now taking the lead in maintaining security and confronting all those who perpetrate violence, including acting decisively against Shi&#146;a militia in Basra, Sadr City and Amarah; and they have been supported by local people from across Iraqi communities&#151;Sunni, Shi&#146;a and Kurd. Britain has already helped to train more than 20,000 Iraqi army troops, but I want to pay credit to Prime Minister Maliki, his Government and the Iraqi security forces, who have shown bravery and leadership in tackling the terrorists and militias threatening the stability of their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000169">The improved security situation has provided a platform for further, essential progress on reconciliation. We have seen not only increased co-operation between Sunni communities and the Iraqi Government in areas such as Anbar and Mosul, and the return of the Tawafuq Sunni party to the Government, but the passage of key legislation that is helping to embed democracy, including the accountability and justice law, the provincial powers law, and now the 2008 budget. The next stage will be provincial elections, reinforcing the political progress made at the national level. Our message to the leaders of all Iraq&#146;s communities, and to parties right across the country, is that they must continue to make these right long-term decisions to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000170">It is also important, as we move forward, that we see Iraq&#146;s neighbours playing a constructive and responsible role in Iraq&#146;s future. In particular, Syria should clamp down on the movement of foreign fighters. Iran must stop the provision of arms and training to those who attack a democratically elected Government in Iraq or the coalition forces in Iraq, and the Iraqi people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000171">We will also continue to focus on helping the Iraqi Government to rebuild their economy and ensuring that the Iraqi people all have a stake in the future. British-led projects in southern Iraq have now helped to deliver enough electricity to supply 800,000 people and water supplies for over 1 million people, with this year another 120,000 people due to get power and 250,000 to gain access to direct supplies of water. Our funding has helped the UN and World Bank to repair and re-equip 1,000 health centres and more than 5,000 schools, and to train nearly 150,000 teachers. With British training and equipment, including upgrades to air traffic control systems, lighting and firefighting, Iraqi personnel are regularly handling more than 20 civil flights a week at Basra airport. British mentoring and support has helped Basra provincial council to gain access to $400 million in central Government funds&#151;money that, in line with the council&#146;s increasing ability to take the lead itself, it is now able to spend further to improve infrastructure and to provide the essential public services of power, water, health and education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000172">Last week, the Basra development commission agreed an outline economic strategy for Basra that sets out plans to encourage private sector and foreign investment. Britain is supporting the new Basra investment promotion agency, which I visited at the weekend, and supporting the Basra development fund to provide loans to small and start-up businesses, which will be key drivers of economic growth and job creation. I am grateful for   <br>

the work of Mr. Michael Wareing, a leading British businessman, who co-chairs the Basra development commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000173">Nine months ago, I set out the key elements of our strategy for handing over security in Basra to the Iraqis and set out the stages for completing the tasks that we have set ourselves. We completed the initial phase on target, handing over Basra to provincial Iraqi control in December. This allowed us to reduce troop numbers in southern Iraq from 5,500 in September to 4,500. After the Iraqi Government launched Operation Charge of the Knights to enforce the rule of law in Basra against the militias, as my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary explained to the House in April, the military advice was that we should pause the further planned reduction so that British troops, together with US forces, could support the Iraqis in this crucial operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08102355000001">Since then, we have responded to changing needs and embedded more than 800 UK personnel within the Iraqi command structure&#151;at divisional, brigade and battalion level. The focus of the 4,100 forces still in southern Iraq is now on completing the task of training and mentoring the 14th division of the Iraqi army in Basra, and it is right that, as we do so, we continue for the next few months to provide support at those levels. Other remaining military tasks&#151;agreed with the Government of Iraq and in close consultation with our US allies&#151;include finalising the preparation of Basra airport for civilian control, and continuing to develop the capacity of the Iraqi navy and marines so that they can protect oil platforms, territorial waters and the port, which are all critical to Iraq&#146;s economic future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000174">It is now right to complete the tasks we have set ourselves. We expect the Basra development commission to publish its detailed economic development plan in the autumn. We hope that local government elections will take place by the end of 2008. Subject to security conditions on the ground, our military commanders believe that the Iraqis will be able to take over development of Basra airport by the end of this year. They also expect the first stage of the general training and mentoring of the combat troops of the 14th division in Basra to be complete around the turn of the year. As the focus shifts from training combat troops, we will move forward to the specific task of mentoring headquarters and specialist staffs, and our military commanders expect the 14th division in Basra to be fully trained during the first months of next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000175">As we complete these tasks, and as progress continues in these different areas, we will continue to reduce the number of British troops in Iraq. Of course, future decisions will, as always, be based on the advice of our military commanders on the ground, but I can tell the House today that, just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch, we expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009, as we make the transition to a long-term bilateral relationship with Iraq, similar to the normal relationships that our military forces have with other important countries in the region. The Defence Secretary and our military commanders will now work with the Iraqi Government to formulate agreement on the details of such a partnership, including its necessary legal basis, and he will report to the House in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000176">I believe it is right that having successfully trained and mentored large numbers of the Iraqi forces, and  <br>

having successfully worked with the Iraqis on a new economic development strategy, we should complete the key tasks that we have agreed with the Iraqi Government: training the 14th division of the Iraqi army in Basra; preparing Basra airport for transfer to Iraqi control; pushing forward economic development; providing the necessary support for provincial elections; honouring our obligations to the Iraqi people; and at the same time&#151;and at all times&#151;ensuring the safety of our armed forces, whose professionalism and dedication have brought us to this stage and whose service to our country I once again commend to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="08072274000177"><a name="80722-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="08072274001001"><b>Mr. David Cameron (Witney) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000178">Is not the absolutely clear message that should go out from across this House that the British armed forces who have served in Iraq and are still serving there are doing, and have done, an incredible job in difficult circumstances? When sitting in the back of one of those transport planes in Basra, you meet people who have been to Iraq three times, four times, five times and sometimes even more. They have given great service and the whole country can be incredibly proud of them. I join the Prime Minister in praising the Iraqi army and Prime Minister Maliki for imposing the rule of law, and for doing the important job of taking on the militias. The Prime Minister was quite right to mention that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000179">On the question of troop numbers, clearly everyone wants to see our forces withdrawn from Iraq as soon as it is practical to do so, but does the Prime Minister agree that, looking back over the past year, we can see two important lessons to learn? The first is that we should not make premature announcements about troop withdrawals that cannot then be delivered. Instead, we should set the conditions that need to be met to achieve our objectives, and the troop withdrawals can take place when they have been made. The Prime Minister said last October that</p>
<a name="80722-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08072274000805"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we plan from next spring to reduce force numbers in southern Iraq to a figure of 2,500.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 8 October 2007; Vol. 464, c. 23.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000180">Yet currently&#151;for good reason&#151;there are more than 4,000 servicemen and women stationed in Iraq. Can the Prime Minister clarify the figures for Operation Telic as a whole? When servicemen and women serving at sea are included, the figure is more than 6,000. Can the Prime Minister confirm that a combination of written answers and the Ministry of Defence website suggests that the figure has actually increased since October, when the Prime Minister promised that 1,000 troops would come home by Christmas?</p>

<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="08072274000181"><a name="80722-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="08072274001002"><b>The Prime Minister</b>

 He says it is not true; it would help if he gave us simple, consistent, practical figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000183">That brings me to the second lesson, which is the need for the Government to be as clear and transparent as possible on troop numbers. Is it not the case that over the past few days we have been in danger of hearing two quite contradictory things? On the one hand, the Prime Minister has said that he is against any artificial timetables for withdrawing the troops; on the other hand, Downing  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 664</b><br>
street sources have been reported as saying that he supports a 16-month timetable for withdrawal. Does the Prime Minister agree that we are discussing not abstract numbers and abstract announcements, but people with families and responsibilities who are already coping with the consequence of overstretch and who deserve the very best treatment&#151;not spinning over numbers and announcements?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000184">Can the Prime Minister clear up one wider issue on Iraq? The UN mandate for our presence there expires in December, and the Iraqi Government are not seeking a fresh UN mandate. In his statement, the Prime Minister mentioned seeking a fresh legal basis for our troops. Can he tell us a little more about that? Is it being negotiated in parallel with the United States? When will the negotiations begin? Is he absolutely happy that they will be concluded before the UN mandate runs out, and that there will not be a gap between the two legal bases? It is important to straighten that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000185">As for economic development, the Prime Minister spoke of accelerating economic reconstruction. Can he tell us when he expects there to be basic amenities such as reliable electricity and clean running water for the whole of Basra city? While there are clearly improvements in security there, which are very welcome, can he confirm that the provincial reconstruction team is still based with British forces at the air base? Can he also tell us what prospect there is of a move to Basra proper, and in what circumstances it could take place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000186">The Prime Minister mentioned the hostages in Iraq. The whole House will wish to call for their release, and the Government know that they have our support in doing all that they can to make progress on that vital issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000187">On the last occasion when we discussed this, the Prime Minister agreed with our view that there should be an inquiry to enable us to learn the lessons of our involvement in Iraq. Does he agree that the argument for delaying the start of that inquiry is becoming weaker and weaker, and that he really should tell us when he will get on with it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000188">Let me turn to the influence of Iran on Iraq. Can the Prime Minister give us the current assessment of Iranian involvement, and its impact on security and stability? On the issue of sanctions against Iran, he said in November that Britain would</p>
<a name="80722-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08072274000806"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;lead in seeking tougher sanctions... at the UN... including on oil and gas investment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000189">Last month he said that action would</p>
<a name="80722-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08072274000807"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;start today for a new phase of sanctions on oil and gas&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000190">Will he confirm that, as we speak, there are still no sanctions on oil and gas? Is he absolutely confident that if there is no positive response to the latest diplomatic offer within two weeks, sanctions will be imposed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000191">I should be grateful if the Prime Minister addressed one final issue relating to statements such as this. I have asked him this before. It is essential that the British people are kept up to date at regular intervals. Will the Prime Minister consider again our call for, at least, full quarterly reports on progress in Iraq and Afghanistan so that we can be given clear statements, on the record, on troop numbers and progress on the ground? Is that not the only way of ensuring that everyone, especially those serving on our behalf and their families, knows exactly where they stand?</p>

 I join the right hon. Gentleman in thanking our armed forces for their professionalism and dedication. I think it true to say that no Ministers have come to the House more frequently to make statements about the developing situation in Iraq than have I, the Defence Secretary and the Foreign Secretary, on occasion. I also believe that we have kept the House fully informed of what is happening, by means of written answers and other statements. I am pleased that the Defence Committee has published a report today, to which I shall return in a minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000193">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we want to press ahead with the economic development of Basra, which includes the provision of electricity and water. As I have said, 800,000 people have electricity and 1 million have water, but more money has been pledged both by us and by the other organisations involved. I also agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we will need a legal basis for continuing our presence in Iraq after December this year, and that is precisely what will be discussed in the negotiations in which the Defence Secretary and our commanders will engage with the Iraqi Government. Of course, as the right hon. Gentleman would expect, when I met Prime Minister Maliki at the weekend I discussed exactly that issue, and how the talks would move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000194">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the figures relating to troop numbers. We completed the first stage of the reduction in numbers from 5,500 and 4,500, but it was right to pause when the advice on the ground was that Prime Minister Maliki and Operation Charge of the Knights were intent on excluding all the militias from Basra. We wanted to give, as did the American forces, the support that we could to what was a successful operation&#151;and now recognised to be successful&#151;to exclude the militias from the area of Basra. It was right to learn the lessons of Charge of the Knights, which were to take into account the pressing need for further training of the Iraqi army. So nearly 1,000 troops a day are now working with the Iraqi army, embedded with it and doing a great job&#151;I met them at the weekend&#151;advising, mentoring and preparing it for taking over greater responsibilities in the future. We have now agreed a new set of tasks that the British Army will work with the Iraqi army to complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000195">We made the right decisions to come down from 5,500 to 4,500. I said at the time&#151;the right hon. Gentleman did not give the full quotation&#151;that we would take the decisions that were necessary</p>

contrast with what we saw last year is stark and profound, and the MoD must continue to support the MiTTs in what will inevitably be a medium-to long-term project.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000199">The decisions that we made on the advice of the military commanders on the ground were the right decisions. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to make political capital out of them, because it was right not only that we reduced the numbers at the time we did but that we paused so that we could support Operation Charge of the Knights. It was right that we changed our tactics so that we were in a position to embed our troops in support of training the Iraqi forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000200">It is also right&#151;this relates to the final questions that the right hon. Gentleman asked&#151;that we work to a long-term bilateral relationship with the Iraqi Government. The discussions were about how we can give bilateral support to the Iraqi forces over a period of time. We will complete the work at Basra airport soon, and we hope to hold local government elections in the near future. The economic development plan will be published with the support of the British Government and funds that we are providing, and the work of training the forces will be completed in due course. It is right, therefore, to move to what is a change of mission, and that is a new bilateral relationship with the Iraqi Government, which I hope all parties in the House will support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80722-0004.htm_para30"><a name="08072274000201">Finally, I have already said that this is not the right time for us to consider an inquiry.

However, will he learn the lesson of our disastrous tacit support for Israel&#146;s incursion into Lebanon two years ago and make it clear to the House today, and to Israel and the country at large, that he will not support, even tacitly, any unilateral Israeli military strike in Iran?

I hope that he will reconsider his view on this matter. The training function that is being carried out by our forces in Iraq is welcomed by the Iraqi forces and is vital in making them able to conduct their own operations and, therefore, enabling us to release the things that we are doing, allowing them to get on with their work.</p>

Their choice is that they can work with us, gain access to civil nuclear power and play their part as a responsible member of the international community or they can face isolation from the whole of the international community, as a result of their failure to honour what they promised to do under the non-proliferation treaty and withdraw from their programme on nuclear weapons.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I know that he has visited Iraq in the past few weeks and was able to walk on the streets of Basra and see for himself the change in security in the town itself, as well as in the region more widely. I believe that the Defence Committee report will be regarded as an extremely important document. It shows that the training function agreed with the Iraqi authorities is working, and it shows the value of continuing that training function so that we can properly complete the task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80722-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000219">I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that all the figures announced to the House were based on the best advice of our military commanders at the time. It is true to say that we could have reduced our troops further had it not been for the operation carried out by Prime Minister Maliki&#151;which turned out to be the right way of getting the militias out of Basra&#151;while at the same time, by embedding our forces with the Iraqi forces, completing the training processes in a better, more efficient and more expeditious way than before. As the Defence Committee&#146;s report shows, embedding our training groups in the Iraqi forces has been the right thing to do and has been very successful. We look forward to the day when, as a result of all the advice and mentoring that we have been able to give them, the Iraqis can take over full responsibility for the security of all areas of Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80722-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000220">The negotiations on the long-term bilateral relationship between Iraq and the United Kingdom, which the right hon. Gentleman also asked about, will continue over the summer and autumn months. I hope that when the House returns we will be able to report on their success. It is important to understand that the Iraqis want to receive support in a number of areas where we are giving specialist advice. The relationship will not be too dissimilar to one we have with other countries in the region, and it will be to the benefit of the UK, representing, as I have said, a further fundamental change of mission. I think that it is right for the Iraqis to have control over their own country&#146;s security, and it is also an acknowledgement, as the right hon. Gentleman said at the outset, of the great sacrifice made by British troops and of their professionalism and dedication. That is what has brought us to the point where we have been able to report progress today.</p>

 The Prime Minister will know that I have visited Iraq three times in the past 12 months, most recently with the Select Committee only a few weeks ago, so I can attest to the changes taking place there. In consolidating those changes, my right hon. Friend refers to the bilateral arrangements to be struck with the Iraqis in parallel with those of the United States. We currently operate a detention and internment facility, whose legality is bound up with a UN resolution. The ending of that resolution is clearly important for the continuation of the facility and the protection of our forces who operate it. I have visited it on several occasions over the past few years, so I can say that it is a very well run facility, validated by the Red Cross. However, it is also important as we continue to help the Iraqis with their reconciliation&#151;</p>

We have increased the number of troops available in Afghanistan and we are meeting our responsibilities in respect of equipment and staffing.

As his report shows, the training that the Ministry of Defence is undertaking of the Iraqi forces is yielding results&#151;we can see the improvement every week in the Basra area. The improvement is also due to the change of tactics in the west of Iraq.</p>

We have made major commitments of resources and capital in recent years and the defence budget rises every year. To be absolutely accurate, and to correct something that I said at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, the UK is the second highest spending nation on defence, behind only the United States of America. That shows that we have continued to make commitments on defence, and we will continue to do that in future. We will of course continue to examine the capital budget and the planning assumptions, but the hon. Gentleman cannot take away from us the fact that the defence budget has continued to rise, or the fact that we have fulfilled the urgent operational requirements of the ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right that it is important both to have an open and transparent policing operation in Iraq and that there is no corruption. Anything that leads to corruption is detrimental to the future of Iraq. However, he is wrong about applications to join the police force in Iraq: I am told that there is a waiting list to join. With others, we have trained 20,000 policemen and women, and we will continue to perform that vital training function. Just as we want a properly trained army, we want a properly trained police force that can conduct its duties.</p>

In the light of his refusal to hold a proper inquiry into the Government&#146;s Iraq policy, will he explain here and now why, in contrast to the young Senator Obama, he got it so badly wrong about the necessity of the war in the first place, the difficulties of the occupation and, most important, the huge human cost in service and civilian casualties of the worst foreign policy error of any Government in more than 50 years?</p>

When I have been in Iraq and when I met TA members at a reception for the 100th anniversary of the TA that we held last week, I have been able to thank them for their service&#151;for giving up their ordinary jobs, and for giving their time and expertise to the work of the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. I thank them for what they have done.

That was done for reasons of naked electoral and political advantage.

It was also right to change our tactics, as military commanders advised us about what was happening on the ground in Basra. I have always said, and I repeat again today, that the decisions we make will be made on the advice of military commanders on the ground and by reviewing the situation on the ground. It is right, too, that we continue to embed our troops with the Iraqi forces in order to complete the training function. Notwithstanding what the hon.

When the Prime Minister went to Iraq in October, he did not predict that the Iraqis would have to go in and retake the streets from the militias after we had abandoned them.

That is why we must strengthen the Iraqi forces. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I have already answered the inquiry question.

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000276">Secondly, on marking quality, I have been advised by Ofqual&#151;the independent regulator of qualifications, exams and tests in England&#151;that the quality of marking is at least as good as in previous years, and justifies the issuing of results. Ofqual has assured me that it continues to monitor the quality of the marking of the tests, and that it will consider the evidence in relation to any problems that are brought to its attention and act accordingly. I shall continue to update Parliament on the progress with Ofqual&#146;s work on marking quality. The QCA has extended the timetable for appeals to 10 September or 10 days after the start of term, whichever is later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000277">Thirdly, QCA has confirmed, in a statement over the weekend, that it is in contractual discussions with ETS Europe following these unacceptable delays. QCA states that it is considering all available options to allow the timely conclusion of the work for the 2008 test series and to secure a successful 2009 programme. The contract with ETS Europe was drawn up and has been managed by QCA, at arm&#146;s length from Ministers, to ensure the independence and objectivity of the testing regime. Any contractual discussions are legally a matter for the QCA and ETS Europe. Those discussions are continuing, and they are highly sensitive&#151;commercially, legally and financially. At this stage it is very important and in the public interest that QCA should be able to conclude those discussions in a timely, orderly and rigorous fashion, in order to safeguard the interests of pupils, schools and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000278">I am advised that ministerial intervention or interference at this stage, including public statements intended to influence the outcome of these contractual discussions, would be inappropriate and would jeopardise the public interest. In particular, it is very important that nothing is said to shift responsibility or redress from where it properly falls under the contract. I hope that the House will understand why I cannot comment further at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000279">Fourthly, following the publication of the terms of reference last week, I can confirm to the House that Lord Sutherland has started work on his independent inquiry. It is important to allow an orderly completion of this year&#146;s national curriculum tests, so Lord Sutherland has told me that he intends to collect evidence in August and September before reporting publicly when the House returns in the autumn. The independent inquiry will look at all the issues surrounding the test delays, including the specification and procurement of the contract with ETS by QCA. That will include the role played by Ministers and my Department and the arm&#146;s length relationship between the QCA and Ministers and departmental officials in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000280">Finally, on the wider question of testing and assessment, I have welcomed the Select Committee&#146;s recent report and its support for the principle of externally assessed national tests. But, as I said to the Committee last week, the current testing and assessment regime is not set in stone. Indeed, in the children&#146;s plan we highlighted the potential opportunities presented by our Making Good Progress pilot, involving 500 schools, where pupils are entered for single-level tests when their teacher judges them to be ready and at the level appropriate for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000281">It is important that we evaluate the case for change before making decisions. As I said to the Committee last week, the pilot runs to next July and is being externally evaluated. I have asked for an interim report in the autumn, and I will publish it to Parliament, but we must not return to the situation where school accountability was weak, parents lacked good information about their child&#146;s progress and, as a result, many children fell behind in their education and development. That is why it is so important that we complete the delivery of this year&#146;s test results, ensure the delivery of the 2009 national curriculum tests and secure public confidence that the system is being appropriately managed, regulated and scrutinised at arm&#146;s length from the Government.</p>

and papers of widely differing quality being given the same mark. The Secretary of State says that it is no worse than every year. Does not that just underline the incompetence at the heart of this Government when it comes to education?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000285">The Secretary of State rightly acknowledges that this situation is unacceptable, but what parents and teachers want to know is whether he will take responsibility. He has consistently argued that responsibility for this affair rests in hands other than his&#151;at arm&#146;s length. But can he confirm that civil servants from his Department&#151;specifically, the director general of schools&#151;were there at the meeting when the contract was awarded to ETS? Can the Secretary of State tell us what, if anything, civil servants told him about that procurement process? Can he tell us what action, if any, he then took to ensure the safe delivery of testing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000286">When I informed the Secretary of State in the House on 19 May that ETS had a record of missed deadlines and mistaken marking in the US, he confessed he had &#147;no knowledge&#148; of their record&#151;even though he is accountable to Parliament for the testing regime. How could the Secretary of State have known so little about the company to which we were entrusting a multi-million pound contract when his own director general of schools was there when the contract was awarded? The chief executive of the QCA says that he is entirely satisfied with the process that awarded ETS this contract. Is the Secretary of State?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000287">I note what the Secretary of State says about the ongoing contractual negotiations, but does he not agree that when companies with public sector contracts fail to live up to their promises they should not be bailed out by the taxpayer? Does he not agree that any contract signed with a company that means we have to pay them to escape is a contract that could only have been signed by a Government who are neither prudent nor competent?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000288">As soon as ETS took up its contract, examiners started to register their concerns. The standardisation process, which ensures consistent marking, was flawed, with highly experienced markers being failed and other, much weaker candidates, being passed despite registering a worryingly high number of mistakes. Worse, the failsafe system to deal with bad marking&#151;the borderline process which allows for papers to be remarked&#151;was scrapped. Given the high number of complaints of inconsistent and error-strewn marking in this year&#146;s tests, how can the Secretary of State have confidence in the quality of marking? Can he give an absolute guarantee that full key stage 2 results will be published on 5 August and key stage 3 results on 12 August? And can he give an absolute guarantee that heads and teachers can be confident that the results generated by ETS will be robust enough to guarantee accurate pupil scores and reliable league tables?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000289">In assessing the credibility of everything that has been said today, it is crucial that we also know just what action Ministers took when the flaws in ETS&#146;s operation became impossible to ignore. When was the Secretary of State first made aware that there were major problems with this year&#146;s marking and what actions did he take? In March, the chief executive of the QCA warned the Secretary of State that the introduction of &#147;new IT&#148; by ETS carried risks. What steps did the Secretary of State take to reduce those risks?</p>

In his reply, the Secretary of State said nothing about the importance of getting this year&#146;s SATs right, and instead said that the new single-level testing and the diploma programme were the priorities. Why, when teachers and examiners were already warning of problems with the tests, did the Secretary of State not ask the regulator specifically to address those concerns?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000291">On 19 May, I and the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) again raised the concerns being voiced by teachers and examiners. The Secretary of State said that he would monitor the situation closely. Then on 4 July, Ministers had to acknowledge that the problems with marking were so great that the publication of results would have to be delayed. Can the Secretary of State tell us what specific steps he took after 19 May to get SATs testing back on track, what meetings he had, which interventions he authorised and which officials he pursued? Or did he, like an exam candidate who has not done his homework, just cross his fingers, hope for the best and pray that he would not be asked any tough questions?</p>

Why is the Secretary of State not insisting on similar urgency even now? Is he afraid of the results? Has not his behaviour throughout this affair been characterised by indifference, high-handedness and inattention? Is it not the case that his Department failed to ensure that contracts had been awarded properly, failed to heed warning signs and failed to act quickly to avert a fiasco that every teacher in the land could see coming? Do not pupils, parents and teachers deserve better than a Secretary of State who fails the most basic test of all&#151;competence in office?</p>

happened and get it right. He might not have observed that the difference between this case and the Tomlinson inquiry in 2002 is that there was no contractual, legal or commercial issue at stake in the delivery of those tests. There is such an issue at stake in this case, and that is why it is important that things are handled carefully. Lord Sutherland has said that he wants to work to this timetable. I am happy to let him work to the timetable that he thinks is right to get to the heart of what has occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000297">The hon. Gentleman asked me about the procurement process. That process was handled at arm&#146;s length from Ministers. At no point have Ministers seen the contracts drawn up between the QCA and ETS. At no point were Ministers consulted on those contracts&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Why not?&#148;] Opposition Members ask why not, but it is not possible for the Government to be accountable for the results of tests while at the same time being actively involved in the management of the marking of those tests. That would not command public confidence. That is why the right way, which is how this has been done for a number of years, is for the contract to be managed at arm&#146;s length by the QCA. That is what it did in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000298">I am accountable to the House for schools policy, including the delivery of results. However, the responsibility for the delivery of those results is a matter for the QCA and ETS under contract. Lord Sutherland will look carefully at why that delivery did not happen. Clear processes were followed at the time, including the Office of Government Commerce&#146;s carrying out gateway reviews&#151;at least one, carried out two years ago&#151;to ensure that the contract was negotiated in line with the remit set by our Department and in line with best practice in order to deliver efficiency, value for money and the best procurement of the contract. Those processes were given a green light by the OGC and that was reported to Ministers.</p>

The reality of government is that Ministers do not interfere with the procurement and marking of tests and test results. We have stuck to that fundamental principle.</p>

That was raised with our Department in advance of our exchanges in the House of Commons in May. They were raised in the House on that day, too. I immediately sought reassurances. In the following weeks, the Minister for Schools and Learners had a series of meetings. Contingencies were put in place for the delivery of those results. I had a meeting on 2 June with Ken Boston, the chief executive of the QCA, in which I was reassured that all the actions that we had asked for in the days after 19 May had been taken. We were assured that the actions in that period had got things on track.</p>

the Library and Opposition spokesmen, that we would delay the publication of key stage 2 results until 15 June and the publication of key stage 3 results until later in that week. At that time, we announced the independent inquiry. We discussed the inquiry&#146;s terms of reference with Ofqual and with Lord Sutherland. That was published when I appeared before the Select Committee the following week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80722-0007.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000302">At the same time, Ofqual reassured me on 4 July, and has done since, that the quality of marking is at least as high as in previous years&#151;although that is monitored closely&#151;and that therefore it is appropriate for those results to be published in August. The final decision on publication will be made on the advice of the independent statistician in our Department and on the basis of the views of Ofqual in the coming days and weeks.</p>

 The scripts are done by pupils, not marked by pupils; I am sorry about that faux pas. There are 1.2 million pupils and 10 million scripts, and every year there are some difficulties with the marking of those scripts. That is why we have an appeals process and why there are appeals every year. Of course, every year there are problems in the marking of the scripts and things get sorted out.</p>

Ofqual is looking at that, and Lord Sutherland will consider it. No evidence has been provided at this point to suggest that there is any reason to delay the publication of the marks. It would be the wrong thing to do for the future of testing in our country.</p>

If he wants to provide that information to Lord Sutherland&#146;s inquiry, I am sure that it will be considered. Once again, we will find that behind the rhetoric there is no substance to the hon.

Rather than undermining confidence, the hon. Gentleman should support the work that we are doing with the independent inquiry. He should support the work that the QCA is doing in order to get the best outcome in these discussions. Rather than undermining confidence, he should act more like a statesman in these matters.</p>

Is he prepared to accept some responsibility on his part and on that of his ministerial team for the failure to act in that two-month period? Interestingly, he acknowledged a moment ago that he and his ministerial colleagues were aware of the problems before he made the statement in the House on 19 May that the tests were on track. Will he tell us in his response when he and his ministerial colleagues were first made aware of the problems that there have been this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80722-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000311">On the issue of the reliability of marking, is the Secretary of State not extraordinarily complacent and very premature to assume that we can have confidence in this year&#146;s key stage test marking? That is particularly the case in the light of the number of complaints that there have already been about key stage 2 English and that there are likely to be about key stage 3 English tests when they are marked and sent out. Will he confirm that the assessment that has been made by Ofqual, which he seems so keen to rely on, appears to be only a somewhat cursory assessment of the processes that have been used and not of the results? Schools that end up having to appeal against the results could face costs of &#163;6.50 per script or &#163;180 per school or per set of results. Will he consider waiving those fees this year so that schools in this country do not end up paying for the incompetence of the Government and ETS? On ETS, does he accept that it is fairly clear from all the evidence so far that ETS has demonstrated unfitness to run the contract this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80722-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000313">Will the Secretary of State tell us whether any payments have been made so far to ETS out of the extraordinary &#163;165 million that the Government will pay to that company over the next five years to administer the tests?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80722-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000315">On the time scale for the Sutherland inquiry, the Secretary of State has given us the usual ministerial vagueness, saying that the report will be delivered in the autumn. Can he be a little clearer about when he expects the report to come back? Can he indicate the latest date by which it would be necessary for the Government to make a decision if they are to put in place a new contractor for the 2009 tests, given the sensitivity of the time scales involved?</p>

In his comments at the end of his statement about single-level tests and other adjustments that could be made, there was a sense of the deckchairs being shuffled around on the Titanic, given what we have seen with the marking of the tests this year and the much wider criticisms that have been made. Nobody is suggesting going back to a system of zero accountability, but when it is clear that the testing regime is collapsing under its own grotesque weight, do we not need a more fundamental  <br>

review of that regime than the one that the Secretary of State is hinting at? Do we not need to axe some of the unhelpful and irrelevant tests, such as those at key stage 3, which have a low value in terms of school accountability and pupil assessment? Should we not put some of the enormous amount of money that could be saved by reducing the scale of testing into early diagnosis and early intervention to address some of the root causes of the challenges faced by so many young people in our education system today?</p>

I guess that we will have to wait for the outcome of its inquiry under Richard Sykes before we get more elucidation from the hon. Gentleman. However, the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and I have different views. I am happy to reform, but I want to keep externally validated tests, and it is really important for parents, teachers and the Government that we do so.</p>

As he will know, there is a &#163;6.50 charge only if the school fails in its appeal; if it succeeds, it does not pay a charge. Of course it is sensible to keep that charge in place, but if more appeals are successful, schools will not pay more charges. As I said&#151;I am not being complacent about this&#151;Ofqual has advised me on the basis of its work so far that there has not been a decline in marking quality, but it has also said that it continues to keep the issue under the review, and that is its role. That shows that I was right to introduce the principle of an independent regulator&#151;Ofqual&#151;last year so that it could play that role precisely.</p>

The Schools Minister and I were aware of the problems that had occurred with ETS Europe before our exchange in the House of Commons on 19 May. Lord Sutherland will look into the detail of all this. We also took repeated and regular action in the following weeks in discussions with QCA, but, again, Lord Sutherland will look at that in his inquiry. I hope that he will report as soon as possible once he has collected his evidence in August and September. I hope that that will be in October, but, for today, I will say that it will be in the autumn, because I do not want to pre-empt his timetable, as that is for him to decide. However, I am clear that the sooner he can complete his report, the better.</p>

 My hon. Friend is quite right. One reason why I acted last autumn was that, in my judgment, there was a conflict of interest in the same body&#151;the QCA&#151;being responsible for contracting to deliver the tests and also acting as the independent regulator of quality. That is why we pulled those two roles apart and why we are legislating for Ofqual. Ofqual is giving the assurances, and it is monitoring the situation closely. There are always some problems with marking every year, but the advice to me is that, so far, there have not been more problems than in previous years.

 Is the Secretary of State aware of the concern among teachers about the quality of the tests themselves? When I visited three primary schools in Slough, I found that the teachers were not particularly concerned about the results, although they were angry that they had not got them yet. However, they were very keen to tell me that the extended writing test at key stage 2 was ethnically biased and not appropriate for the pupils of Slough. Those teachers are also concerned, and this will affect every constituency, about how the RAISE system&#151;the system for reporting and analysis for improvement through school self-evaluation&#151;for tracking pupil progress will be affected by what has happened and by the quality of the tests, which look at individual questions.</p>

A contract was drawn up with the QCA at arm&#146;s length from Ministers, and rightly so, because that is the only way to inspire public confidence in the objectivity of test setting that is independent of ministerial interference.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for his statement. I have written to him about a primary school in my constituency and the issue of marking quality. The school has achieved key stage 2 results of 74 per cent. in maths, which is good for our area of Salford, but its English results, which were expected to be 70 per cent., were only 34 per cent. That is having quite an impact on the English teachers. The school has checked with the Salford school improvement service, which cannot see any reason for the gap between what was expected and what has actually happened.

 As the hon.

These tests play more than one role, however. They are an aid to teacher assessment, and they also provide a way of allowing parents to see the independently validated progress of their child. They also provide a way in which we, and the hon. Lady, can compare performance school by school. All those functions can be performed only if we have universal, externally validated tests. However, that does not mean that we cannot make changes to give more discretion to teachers, and I am keen to do that if the evaluation suggests that it will work.</p>

If there is evidence of a problem with the quality of marking, Ofqual will act and also advise me, but that is not where we are today, and nor is it the advice that we are receiving.

That is because Ministers should not interfere with how those tests are set and managed, and that is why the contract is managed at arm&#146;s length by the QCA, with ETS Europe. A contractual discussion is going on between the QCA and ETS Europe, which together are responsible for delivering the test results. Both organisations have apologised because they have not met the expectations of pupils or the outputs that they specified in their contract. That is where the responsibility lies.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Yesterday, this House and the other House had the honour of welcoming 120 British servicemen returning from Iraq at the north door of the Great Hall. Mr. Speaker was there to greet them, and it was a pleasure and an honour to see them. However, while we were waiting for them, the lunatic fringe that is the peace camp outside broke through the police lines and got into the ranks of those brave servicemen and women. Those people abused and attacked the service personnel, calling them cowards and other things that I will not repeat in this House. Can we investigate how on earth British servicemen and women returning from Iraq and marching through the streets of London to this House came to be attacked, and whether enough police were on duty? Next time we invite them, can we make sure that there are enough police on hand, so that we can welcome them in the proper way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="08072274000358"><a name="80722-0009.htm_spnew13"><a name="08072274001104"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b>
 We are all aware of the demonstrations that are a permanent feature outside the House, and of how they may sometimes stray beyond the limits. As politicians, we are perhaps more used to such things than other people but, given that the soldiers to whom the hon. Gentleman has referred were here not only to be honoured by us but to be our guests in the Houses of Parliament, I think that what happened was a dreadful situation. I am sure that he will be glad to have his words on the record, and that they will be noted by everyone in the House today and by people outside it. Let us hope that that kind of thing does not happen again.</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="08072274000359"><a name="80722-0009.htm_spnew14"><a name="08072274001105"><b>Dr. Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b>
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I did not see the attack on the servicemen, but I heard the persistent attempts to use amplified noise from the square to abuse them. Fortunately, that did not spoil the occasion, at any rate not significantly, but will you ask Mr. Speaker to investigate what has happened in respect of Westminster council? Representatives from the council came for a meeting with Mr. Speaker, the police and me following 50 complaints about broadcast noise from the square disturbing people at work. Westminster council assured us that the licence to broadcast from the square would run out in January of this year, which means that it has run out now, yet there appears to be no enforcement to prevent such broadcasting. The situation is intolerable and absolutely pathetic, and it is about time that the law was enforced in respect of these abusive people.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises two matters, and I think that I have dealt with the first already, although I should like to add that I hope that all the soldiers and their families who are here today will be seriously and strongly reassured by the feelings in this Chamber today. As for the second matter&#151;noise&#151;we are all well aware of what goes on out there. I shall draw Mr. Speaker&#146;s attention to the matter and make sure that he reads the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks in <i> Hansard</i>. Let us hope that some action can be taken.</p>

<h3 align="center">Theft from Shops (Penalties)</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_4"><a name="80722-0009.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08072274000855"><h5 align="left">2.26 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o200"><a name="08072274000361"><a name="80722-0009.htm_spnew16"><a name="08072274001107"><b>Miss Anne McIntosh (Vale of York) (Con):</b>
 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80722-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08072274000814"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to exclude the offence of theft from retail and commercial premises from the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 relating to fixed penalty notices; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000362">This Bill has cross-party support and I am most grateful to right hon. and hon. Members for their support. The Bill is necessary because the use of penalty notices for disorder is ineffective in deterring crime, especially shoplifting and other crimes against business. Using PNDs for shoplifting sends out the wrong message, as the shoplifter or thief is treated in the same way as a motorist is treated for outstaying his or her welcome at a parking meter. Tough and effective sentences are needed to fight that type of crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000363">The cost to businesses from shoplifting totals &#163;6 billion each year. In 2007-08, a staggering 290,625 shoplifting incidents were recorded, but only 58,536 offenders were found guilty, and of them only 38,772 were given penalty notices. Therefore, the numbers clearly show that a large number of crimes are being committed by a small number of offenders. Those offenders are ignoring the threat of penalty notices, 40 per cent. of which are not even paid. That is why this Bill is so necessary, as it would delete any reference to theft from the list of offences in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 that attract a penalty notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000364">It is important to recall that the crime of shoplifting is on the increase. In 1997, there were 274,000 incidents but, as I have said, the latest figures show that there were more than 290,000 in 2007-08. The current law means that penalty notices for theft apply only to retail and commercial theft. Crime against business is often thought to be victimless, but it most certainly is not. The victims are businesses that are employers, and the communities that small businesses sustain. The owners of small businesses face a climate of constant intimidation and violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000365">Crime affects business in a number of ways. It leads to an inability to meet customer deadlines, damages profitability, wastes management&#146;s time and affects staff morale, among other things. Some 57 per cent. of businesses are victims of crime every year, and in any 12-month period 45 per cent. of businesses say that crime has cost them up to &#163;5,000; that is big money for a small business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000366">Crime against business costs the UK economy an estimated &#163;19 million a year, which is approximately &#163;5,000 for each business, and 12 per cent. of businesses estimate that crime costs them more than &#163;10,000 a year, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. Not only does that have a direct impact on businesses, but the cost is passed on to consumers and individuals in society; it is reflected in the price of goods and in higher insurance premiums. The British Retail Consortium says that the retail sector alone loses &#163;1.5 billion to retail crime annually. If we add the &#163;1.43 billion that is invested in crime prevention, the total cost of crime for a year is &#163;2.1 billion.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 696</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000367">Penalty notices for disorder can normally be given only for thefts up to a value of &#163;100, or for criminal damage to the value of &#163;300. The value of the average annual shoplift, or shop theft, is about &#163;149 according to the Federation of Small Businesses. As that figure is below the cut-off point of &#163;200, the majority of shoplifters are dealt with by PND, but 40 per cent. of PNDs go unpaid, as I have said. The FSB figures show that the cost to businesses of shoplifting is &#163;6 billion a year, &#163;4 billion of which is spent by businesses on crime prevention measures; &#163;2 billion is the value of the shoplifting itself. The Federation of Small Businesses would like the police to re-focus on protecting the whole community, and to recognise that protecting the individual in their place of work is just as important as protecting them in their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000368">The use of penalty notices for disorder for shoplifting is inappropriate. The crime of shoplifting needs to be punished, and the causes of that crime, such as the need to feed a drink or drugs habit or other addiction, need to be addressed. The courts expect the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to follow any guidance issued by the Secretary of State; otherwise, a case will be dismissed. The increasing use and inconsistent application of penalty notices for disorder, particularly for shoplifting, needs to be addressed. The Federation of Small Businesses appreciates that the police find PNDs attractive because they reduce the amount of paperwork, but it is worrying that just over half are paid, and that the fine may not even match the value of the items stolen. If the notices are to be used, there should be proper enforcement. Fines should be followed up, and the notices should not be used in the case of repeat and persistent offenders. Retailers should also be consulted before fines are levied. We encourage the police to consult in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000369">The British Retail Consortium and its members are concerned about the lack of guidance on the suitability of such notices as a means of disposal. That lack of guidance results in their inconsistent use. The BRC agrees that tough and effective sentences are needed for crimes against business. There should be clarity about when such notices can be used, and consistency of approach is vital. It agrees that penalty notices for disorder are ineffective in deterring crime, and it campaigns for more attention to be paid to the effects of the inconsistencies, as regards shoplifting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000370">In connection with my Bill, the director general of the British Retail Consortium, Stephen Robertson, wrote to me to say:</p>
<a name="80722-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="08072274000815"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our members support the use of Penalty Notices for Disorder...when dealing with first time offenders but we are concerned that penalty notices are often issued in circumstances where they are not appropriate. There is a lack of clear guidance on the suitability of PNDs as a suitable method of disposal, resulting in inconsistencies in their use. It is clear that identities are not being checked and fingerprints, DNA and photographs are not being taken from offenders, preventing effective operation of the PND register.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000371">He goes on to say that current guidance is insufficient. Given that the British crime survey is a survey of households and does not capture corporate victims, and given that 40 per cent. of businesses do not report such crimes, the indicators are likely to under-represent the true extent of the crime. The law was amended in 2001 to allow penalty notices to be issued for theft, and further offences were added to those for which penalty notices for disorder may be given, and for which fines  <br>

may be levied. I propose to use my Bill to stop the overuse of penalty notices for disorder, and to amend the guidance that has been issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000372">In conclusion, the current situation is unacceptable. The crime of theft from shops has grown considerably. The current guidelines permit different sentences and inconsistent approaches across the country. We want clear, consistent guidelines. We want to distinguish between first-time and repeat offenders, and between aggravated and non-aggravated offences, but we want the ability to ensure that the strongest possible penalties are given. We want to deal with the issue in a serious way, and we want the Bill adopted, so that we can ensure that such crimes are properly reported and recorded. We want to give the police the tools to do their job, and I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I am taken aback at being called so early in the debate; like most Members, I am used to sitting here for a few hours before speaking. However, I am pleased and grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000378">As is traditional on these occasions, I want to mention issues affecting my constituency. I shall mention two matters, both of which I have raised in the past, although events have moved on since then. The first relates to Southern Railway services between London Bridge and my constituency. I have an inner-London constituency south of the river. Overground services are particularly important to my constituents and me, as the north London underground railway, as it is known, has not yet come to our part of south-east London. Fortunately, that will be remedied in a couple of years&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000379">I have previously raised in the House issues arising from the route utilisation strategy for south London, and from the extension of the East London line to Crystal Palace and West Croydon. As part of the changes, Transport for London will take responsibility for the route, and for all stations from New Cross Gate to Crystal Palace and to West Croydon, and will take over the running of Brockley, Honor Oak Park, Forest Hill, Sydenham, Penge West, Anerley and Norwood Junction stations to boot; they will become part of what will be known as the London overground network, although it will be run by TFL and will be part of the tube system. That, of course, is a great boon to my constituents and to right hon. and hon. Friends whose constituencies neighbour mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000380">I raised the issue in the past because there was some doubt about whether the services would be at the expense of, or additional to, existing services. Fortunately, most of the problems have been resolved, and my constituents and others are looking forward eagerly to the considerable expansion of the public transport network in south-east London. It probably will be the greatest improvement since the arrival of the railways many decades ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80722-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000381">With change comes difficulty, as everybody knows. New stations are being fitted with the Oyster card system, which has been hugely successful on the underground network and on London buses. Extending it to the national rail network will be to the advantage of passengers throughout the area and the country, wherever it is adopted. Bringing in the Oyster card service means bringing in gates, which is where the current problem exists. There is a plan at Sydenham and Forest Hill stations to introduce over two phases and by the end of this year automatic gates, which will be brought on line while the Southern Trains franchise is still in existence.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080722/debtext/80722-0010.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000382">Unfortunately, this is causing many of my constituents considerable inconvenience and has made their lives difficult because of restrictions on the up service from Sydenham and the down service from Forest Hill, requiring people to go to the other side of the station and back over the footbridge to get to the service they want. For people with buggies or luggage or with mobility difficulties, that is extremely inconvenient. Everybody understands  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 699</b><br>
why the new system is being brought in, but it cannot be right to inconvenience the law-abiding and ticket-buying majority in the hope of catching the fare-evading minority. My constituents certainly do not see it that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000383">Fortunately, the elected mayor of Lewisham, Sir Steve Bullock, arranged for me and him to meet senior Southern Trains managers at Forest Hill and Sydenham stations last Friday and, more particularly, for the managers to meet a number of constituents&#151;their customers, passengers, or whatever they are called these days&#151;and to hear from them first hand precisely how difficult their lives have been made by the lack of co-ordination in introducing the programme. As I say, nobody disputes the need to reduce fare evasion and to improve security by ensuring that only genuine passengers have access to both trains and stations. My constituents would agree with that proposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000384">However, as the full scheme can be implemented by the end of this year, we are asking Southern Trains&#151;it has agreed to consider this&#151;to revert to the original position of unguarded gates until such time as it can bring in the whole scheme. My constituents will then be able to have access to both the up and down platforms at all times of the day with minimum inconvenience. I hope and expect Southern Trains to respond positively in a short space of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000385">The other issue concerns health in south-east London. The primary care trusts in Lewisham, Greenwich, Bromley and Bexley put together a review of acute provision within what they called &#147;outer south-east London.&#148; I grew up in south-east London and have lived there all my life so far. I have never heard of outer south-east London. However, I applaud the PCTs for taking a joint approach to planning important services in the area. The last time I spoke on this issue was at the start of the consultation period. Fortunately, within the last few weeks, that consultation has concluded. The one thing that became apparent beyond all others was that the people of Lewisham do not regard themselves as living in outer south-east London, whatever that might be. If services at Lewisham hospital are taken away, the people would be more likely to go to King&#146;s in the west or Guy&#146;s and St. Thomas&#146;s in the north than they would ever be to go to Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich, Princess Royal in Farnborough or Queen Mary in Sidcup.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000386">I am delighted that the result of the consultation has been to underline, rather than undermine, the services provided by Lewisham hospital. It is good news for Lewisham residents. The confidence and respect of residents for University hospital in Lewisham has been confirmed by the exercise and by the PCT. The joint PCT accepted that it will continue with the world class maternity and, certainly, paediatric services, which are among the best in the country&#151;as good as Great Ormond street, according to the Healthcare Commission, or better, as Great Ormond street does not provide a children&#146;s A &amp; E service but Lewisham does. There are many other arrangements&#151;for example, the future of maternity services and collaboration with the academic health sciences centre, which is due to be set up shortly&#151;which will be to the benefit not just of Lewisham hospital as an institution and a centre of technical and medical excellence, but to my constituents and the many others who use its facilities.</p>

Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd), I have the privilege of representing parts of south-east London, and in a second I shall mention some topics of concern in our part of the world. First, however, I shall mention some slightly broader issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000391">We go into recess today with hope and a bit of encouragement that, at last, in Zimbabwe, which we have debated so often in recent weeks, there may be a glimmer of a possibility that things can get better. From these Benches, via the Deputy Leader of the House, may I offer the Foreign Office team our best wishes and encourage them to continue to do all they can, despite the difficult position of the UK, to encourage African Union member states in particular to work strongly and determinedly to bring to an end the illegal and absolutely oppressive Government and to move to a much more positive future in Zimbabwe?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000392">There are two other places where the next few weeks will be crucial. The Deputy Leader of the House will know that, in a matter of days, talks resume between the President of Cyprus and the Prime Minister and President of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This weekend was the 34th anniversary of the Turkish invasion. Many people have seen false dawns in trying to find a resolution, but the election of the new President of Cyprus in February has raised a welcome possibility of new talks and proposals for peace. There are lots of difficult problems, including land, housing, property, disappeared people and so on, but on behalf of the whole House, I wish those initiatives well. It is important that the Government in Ankara understand that, whatever the internal problems of the governing party and the military, they have a huge obligation to seek with their neighbours and on behalf of the whole of Europe to bring Cyprus back to being one nation, with all its communities living together in peace. It is a Commonwealth country and an EU country, and we are a guarantor power. I urge Foreign Office Ministers to be proactive with a greater intensity than ever before. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000393">The third Commonwealth matter that I shall mention is Sri Lanka, in which I have long taken a interest. I am aware that the Minister for Africa, Asia and the United Nations has just returned from Sri Lanka, and I hope with colleagues from all parties to meet him shortly to go through what he has learned. There are many people working hard under the radar to bring the parties together in Sri Lanka, including the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), who is in his place, and others. There has been conflict in that country for far too long. Violence and terrorism are unacceptable. Unless everybody is brought round the table and engaged in the process&#151;Sinhala and Tamil, all the faith communities, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian, and others&#151;there will be no peace on that island.

If the Government in Sri Lanka still think that they can bomb the LTT into submission, they must realise that that is not realistic. As we know from Northern Ireland and elsewhere, unless we engage people, there will not be a solution. I am sure a solution short of separation and two states is possible.</p>

That decision was not met by a positive response around the Commonwealth&#151;indeed, the reaction was to the contrary, and real anger persists. The former Member for Bristol, West, Valery Davey, who is now the extremely able chair of the Council for Education in the Commonwealth, and colleagues from all parties are working with others to try to get the Government to think again.

The organisation XLP has a bus that it uses on estates, and it would like to use that bus all day, every day. Downside Fisher youth club, Rockingham estate play association and many other youth organisations would like to do more, which would lead to other people volunteering.

 I want to raise a number of constituency issues that have implications for the Government and for legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000405">First, I shall discuss common land in Norley, which is a beautiful village in the middle of my constituency. It has recently come to light that a company has registered the leasehold of the common land. That affects 28 of  <br>

my constituents, who fear that they will have to pay for access to their own homes. The lease is dated 25 December 1999 and is on land valued at about &#163;40,000 with a &#163;10 rent. The Land Registry registered the lease as a good leasehold, because at the time of registration the company that claimed to own the land was unable to prove that it owned the lordship of the manor of Norley and any land that lay within the lordship. My constituents are concerned that they will have to pay exorbitant prices for access to the land, even though the Government tried to resolve that problem in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which gives people who have used land for access for 20 years a prescriptive right of access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000406">The Government have four important questions to consider. First, on what basis can a company acquire common land that has been designated as common land for hundreds of years? Secondly, where a company applies to register a leasehold on common land but does not produce the evidence to show that the lessor has the title to that common land, surely the Land Registry should consult local residents who are affected to let them know what is happening and give them the opportunity to get involved in the process, which is nearly 10 years old in this case? Thirdly, where prescriptive rights of access to common land have been acquired, I want the Government to make it absolutely clear that if the property is sold, the rights acquired are transferred with the sale, which would go a long way in allaying my constituents&#146; fears. Finally, where a company attempts to sell the freehold on common land, surely they must be able to prove that they own the freehold to the satisfaction of the Land Registry?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000407">Let me now discuss the activities of United Utilities in my constituency. It is necessary to write to United Utilities at least three times in order to get an answer to the question one originally asked. This is only a small thing, but United Utilities promised that it would not change the way in which it charges park homes for land drainage; it made that promise three years ago, but this year it has introduced changes that mean that people in park homes in my constituency face an increase of between 85 and 183 per cent. in their charges. I had to write three times to United Utilities to obtain an explanation. It told me that the changes would be revenue neutral. When I pressed it on that point, it said that, based on the 2003-04 figures, it was &#163;25,000 worse off, but it had managed to rebalance the books. When I asked it about the figures for the next three years, it said that it does not have those figures and that it would be too expensive manually to collect them. How on earth can United Utilities say that those changes, which are only small but which affect my constituents, are revenue neutral? That is an important question for the Government to answer, and it relates to my next point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000408">United Utilities has also decided to change the way in which it levies water charges on churches. Such charges are now based not on rateable value, but on the actual area covered by the church, including car parks and open spaces. Churches obtain their income from parishioners, and any money that United Utilities takes off them in increased charges for water will come out of the money that they spend on their communities, their churches, their parishioners and their work.

pressed United Utilities to say whether it will maintain the 90 per cent. charitable discount for churches and places of worship, but it has not answered that question, which I have asked three times. Incidentally, I have also asked the Minister with responsibility for that matter that question, but he has not answered it, either. I need answers to all those questions from United Utilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000409">I am rushing through the points that I want to raise. My next point is about NHS Logistics, which is based in four parts of the country. There is a depot in my constituency. The company supplies consumable goods to the national health service and, in September 2006, against my advice and that of other Members, the Government transferred NHS Logistics into the private sector. It was taken over by DHL and is now called NHS Supply Chain. At the time of the transfer, a written guarantee was given to NHS Logistics staff that they would be subject to &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;. On 1 April, &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; introduced unsocial working hours payments for everybody in the NHS except those working at NHS Logistics&#151;or NHS Supply Chain, as it is now called. I wrote to the relevant Minister and asked that the written guarantee remain in force and that the staff at NHS Supply Chain benefit from &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;. What I got back were a lot of conditions and arguments about why &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; could not be given all across the NHS. This is an important point. I seek clarification from the Government on whether the guarantee, given in September 2006, stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000410">That guarantee also contained a promise that the trade union recognition and activities available to workers at NHS Logistics in the NHS would transfer to DHL and NHS Supply Chain. Only recently, a union official at DHL-NHS Supply Chain was suspended for trade union activities, and at a disciplinary hearing was given a six-month warning about them. That is not consistent with the terms and conditions guaranteed in writing when NHS Logistics moved to the private sector. It was also promised that a service agreement should be written between the Department of Health and NHS Supply Chain about what trade union activities will go on; another issue is whether the agreement will be written and binding. The master service agreement has been written and I seek confirmation from the Government that that agreement, signed by DHL and the Department of Health, still stands and will be adhered to. I seek clarification on how the Government will scrutinise whether the agreement is kept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80722-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000411">The penultimate matter that I want to raise relates to the BBC and its trustees. The recently published BBC annual report shows that the BBC should pay tax on taxable benefits given to BBC non-executive directors. The report also confirms that private health care for BBC senior managers is being paid for from the BBC licence fee. We are now told that there is an issue about where BBC trustees live&#151;there is concern that they are too London-centric. I should like the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to consider that matter.</p>

He lived an extremely full life. He was a committed socialist and a Quaker. He was a power for good in Frodsham and worked extensively in Africa.

 I want to use this opportunity to raise an issue that I have raised several times. I seek to persuade Ministers, at the Home Office in particular, to improve the legislation on paedophiles&#151;particularly predatory paedophiles who use encryption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000414">Most of us in the House know that paedophiles collect photographs of child abuse. In the old days, they used hard copies, then they used videos. Now they are into digital data, which are kept on computers, CD-ROMs and DVDs&#151;any form of digital storage. They source the material by downloading from websites, swapping among themselves on the internet and producing their own photographs. The demand for new material is endless and increasing. There have been a number of changes over the years. Internationally, there is a bigger supply. In this country, there is an increasing demand. Worse than that, the level of depravity also seems to be increasing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000415">Many people see paedophiles as individuals who seek young teens, but the reality is that they increasingly look for material depicting the abuse of very young children&#151;infants, and even babies. Most recently, the material has been able to be encrypted in such a way that the police and even the security forces have been unable to break into it. I have discussed the issue with police experts and the National Technical Assistance Centre, which has the job of breaking encryption for the security forces and the police. I understand from the head of NTAC that an increasing proportion of its work is related to encrypted child abuse data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000416">Such data used to be difficult to encrypt, but then came along 128-bit and 256-bit encryption that the individuals could download free from the internet. The process has got progressively more simple, and the new Vista Professional operating system means that, at the moment the individuals turn off their computers, all the material is automatically encrypted. Some individuals go further; they have computers with no hard drives and store the data online, often in other countries, and access is hidden by password or key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000417">Part 3 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000&#151;RIPA, for short&#151;relatively recently introduced a penalty for failure to provide, on request, the password or the key. The problem is that the penalty is not working for the simple reason that it involves two years in jail. The data that the individuals&#151;men and women&#151;are hiding would put them in prison for considerably longer than that and they would also end up on the sex offenders register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000418">I am requesting a change. I shall give the Minister a brief example. A friend and colleague of mine, Dave Marshall of the Metropolitan police, arrested two individuals who were on the way to France. They had a manual on how they were going to collect and abuse children in France; fortunately, they were picked up first. At one of the individual&#146;s homes a computer was found with what was believed to be 150 gigabytes of encrypted photos that could not be accessed&#151;if they were single pictures, that translates to 750,000 photographs of abuse.</p>

They know that he likes to photograph his activities and are sure that the photos are on the computer. NTAC has had the computer for more than nine months but has failed to break the encryption. The police want the data to convict the individual&#151;and others, of course. They want to collect the names and faces of the children, because they want to care for them. We in the House want such individuals put away for a very long time so that they cannot touch children.</p>

They are sympathetic, but say that they wish to wait and see how part 3 of RIPA works. It does not work. I cannot understand why we need to wait for more and more paedophiles to escape detection, while little children fail to get the safe care and attention that people expect of our society. There will be yet another Home Office crime Bill; a small amendment in it would rectify the situation and could increase the penalty from two years to at least five, so that our children and babies can be protected.</p>

 I would like to talk about one subject this afternoon. Airedale general hospital is situated in a very attractive part of my constituency, at Eastburn in the Aire valley. It cares for constituents of Keighley, Pendle, Skipton and Shipley. It has a well used helipad that works with the accident and emergency department, which cares for climbers, potholers and abseilers from the dales, as well as for others with less rural interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000422">This excellent district hospital is the biggest employer in my constituency and is highly regarded by me and my neighbouring colleagues&#151;and, more importantly, by our constituents. However, I wish to draw the House&#146;s attention to the long-standing problems caused by lack of investment in the kitchens and canteen. Since 2002, the hospital trust and management have been asked by Bradford&#146;s environmental health service to improve the kitchens. At the time, the trust and management explained that funds were not available for that work. Each time the kitchens have been inspected since then, the list of improvements and refurbishments needed has grown. At the moment, they include replacing floor tiles, wall surfaces and ceilings, as well as new, improved methods of air extraction&#151;at a total cost, it is claimed, of &#163;1.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000423">Last year, I had meetings with management where I stressed the need for the work to be done. By then, however, they had decided that the only solution was to go down the privatisation path. In March this year, the staff were advised that a procurement process was under way to outsource catering. On Thursday of this week, 24 July, the trust will announce its decision. I still hope that catering will be kept in-house and finance will be found for the kitchen refurbishments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000424">Good food is a very basic requirement, and it goes without saying that it is especially important for people who are unwell and in hospital.

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000426">I have been advised that before making its decision on catering the trust board will, when allocating the contract or otherwise, take into consideration the following criteria: quality, nutrition, safety, contingency planning, guarantees, value for money and staff transfer proposals. However, public opinion, the responsiveness of local provision and the environment are not included. There is considerable evidence that the public support the retention of in-house catering. Last year, a petition was signed by 650 people in two hours. The story has occupied many column inches in the local press. This is a subject that people really care about, and I have asked that the trust take into consideration the views of local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000427">Furthermore, damage is caused to the environment by transporting food over long distances, and freshness is reduced when food is not prepared on site. I believe that the promotion of good food by all public sector bodies, whether schools, care homes or hospitals, is a way of promoting a culture of healthy eating that is clearly needed in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000428">Finally, I want to talk about the staff, who are the most important factor in all this. There are significant implications for those staff, whose numbers have reduced from 92 last year to 65 now and who are working ever harder in very difficult circumstances. Many of them have contacted me. I believe that the interests of staff are wholly and inextricably linked to the interests of patients. Any threat to their jobs, terms and conditions is not acceptable. Catering work is often relatively low-paid, but the work is vital. The hard work and loyalty of these staff has been core to the success of catering at Airedale general hospital, but I am not convinced that there will be any long-term security for their employment rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000429">As has been seen on numerous occasions following other such privatisations, there is no turning back, and often good things are thrown away.

 Before the House rises for the summer recess, I wish to draw to its attention once again the plight of the Cumbrian economy&#151;my perennial rant about our situation in Cumbria. That is because we are still the fifth poorest sub-region or county in the whole of Europe. It is not just me saying that; I am not talking down our county, with its superb people and innovators. The Commission for Rural Communities says in its latest report that people living in parts of rural Cumbria are among the country&#146;s worst paid and our areas among the most deprived. It highlights a lack of affordable housing, declining services in rural areas and poorer access to services for people without cars. For those who have cars&#151;and it is essential to have cars in Cumbria&#151;their costs are rocketing for the reasons that we know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000431">There are things that the Government could do about this. First, they could sort out the Northwest Regional Development Agency and the funding that we are supposed to have through the rural development programme for England, which is funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the European Union. We have had a two-year funding gap whereby the money has not come through because the bureaucrats have been wrangling about what we should be doing. Perhaps other areas of the country have also suffered, but Cumbria needs that cash. We do not need political wrangles about how to spend it. We have the innovators&#151;the small business men and women and the rural areas who have the good ideas&#151;so give them the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000432">Cumbria is also suffering because of the continuing shambles of the Rural Payments Agency, which is again late in paying hundreds of farmers in my constituency. Although it is not as bad as last year or the year before, they will now be clobbered by the clawback of the money that they were wrongly paid. Twenty thousand farmers in this country were wrongly paid. We know that the Government will behave in exactly the same way as they did with child tax credits. Demands will land on the claimant&#146;s mat for the money to be repaid immediately, even though it is not their fault. Many farmers will not have spotted that they have been wrongly paid, so the money will not be there to be paid back&#151;it will already have been reinvested, to use the Government&#146;s term. Some farmers will be put out of business when that money is demanded back. It is high time that DEFRA sorted out the shambles of the RPA. Yes, it can be forgiven for getting it wrong in the first year, when it was setting up probably the most complex payments system in Europe, but it is not acceptable to get it wrong in the second and third years. DEFRA should subcontract the payments agency out to Northern Ireland&#146;s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which seems to be able to pay its farmers on time, or across the border to Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000433">The plight of the Cumbrian economy has not been helped by the continuing post office closure programme. I utterly condemn the senior management of the Post Office for being the Government&#146;s little puppy dog in this. When I phoned the senior officer to say, &#147;We are campaigning to save post offices in my constituency&#148;, the answer was, &#147;Well, I&#146;m under instructions to close 2,500 post offices in the country, and if you manage to save one, Mr. Maclean, I&#146;ll just have to find another one to close.&#148; That was not a threat&#151;she was not being nasty but merely stating a fact. For each post office in our constituencies that we and local people manage to save, another will be closed instead because those are the Government&#146;s orders. The consultation has been an utter sham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000434">I have recently been inundated, as most colleagues probably have, by correspondence about the cost of fuel from people who have to travel in the course of their work. I have just received some letters from workers from the RPA, who point out that they are on 40p a mile&#151;as is everyone in this House, of course&#151;and that their actual motoring costs are now about 52p, 53p or 54p a mile. I have heard from social workers and meals on wheels workers in Cumbria, some on only 39p per mile, who are now, as volunteers, making a huge loss in trying to deliver meals on wheels or social services. That cannot continue. The report on Members&#146; allowances  <br>

said that the cost of motoring was high and MPs were making a loss, but we did not wish to raise our levels until the Government and the Treasury did it for everyone else in the country. It is vital that throughout the country those essential volunteer drivers, who are driving in the course of their duty, get an increase in their Treasury mileage rates to a lot more than 40p per mile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000435">In Cumbria, we are facing the additional costs of vehicle excise duty. An area such as Cumbria has a lot more people with cars&#151;they are not the newer, flashier models but older cars. We have a low-paid rural population who do not have access to buses&#151;they just ain&#146;t there. We all use trains when we can. We get into our cars and drive the 30 miles to the nearest train station, and then we use the trains. Those lower-paid workers will generally have older-model cars, and they are in danger of being clobbered because of the Government&#146;s changes on VED.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000436">I appeal to the Government: to help the Cumbrian economy, let us push the button on the nuclear programme and stop messing around. Cumbria is a nuclear county. It has Sellafield, the only centre of excellence in this country for nuclear technology. We want Sellafield to be expanded; we are willing for it to be a depository for nuclear waste&#151;not a dump, but a depository such as those in Sweden or other Scandinavian countries where people can access it and check on the materials. We will do that for a price. We are willing to have a nuclear reactor in Cumbria. We will take that technology, provided we are not afflicted with more ghastly wind farms destroying the beautiful landscape of rural Cumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000437">At least nuclear energy will contribute to our electricity supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and not the 30 per cent. of the time that our miserable wind farms do. Our beautiful county is in danger of being destroyed by wind farm applications at Shap, Berrier, at the foot of Blencathra and now Cumwhinton near Carlisle. They contribute little to our energy needs, but&#151;goodness me&#151;they could certainly contribute 24/7 to the ugliness and destruction of our visual environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000438">My penultimate point to the Government is this: please do not muck around with our GP practices and our excellent chemists. We do not need polyclinics in Cumbria. If I had cut my finger in London, I would not dream of trying to search out a local GP. Like everyone else, I would go to St. Thomas&#146;s or one of the big hospitals. We know that there is a problem and that London needs health centres and possibly polyclinics. In Cumbria we have had big rural GP practices for years, with six or seven doctors working together in excellent health centres. We do not need polyclinics, and nor do we need the destabilisation of our system of rural chemists&#151;some doctors are now applying to have 100-hour pharmacies, because they believe that their businesses are under threat from the Government&#146;s White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000439">I conclude on this point: as colleagues pass through my constituency in the Lake district this summer, possibly heading for Scotland, the highlands or elsewhere, they will find one or two tiny little parts of it where, if they stop and look carefully, they will see a red squirrel. But they should look very closely, because we are in danger of losing that species. Our red squirrels are in danger of extinction. I appeal to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to give us funding for traps to control the greys&#151;let us spend the summer saving the reds.</p>

 Saving the reds is, of course, a sentiment that I echo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000441">This debate should be renamed the tour of Britain because it gives all Members the opportunity to visit, via virtual reality, the constituencies of other Members. The red squirrels of Cumbria are very important to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), and I am sure that the debate will end with the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) inviting us all to spend our summer holidays in her constituency, seeing all the wonderful flowers that grow there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000442">I want to spend the brief time that I have to raise a local, a national and an international issue. I have raised the local issue with the Minister before, and it concerns a site in Leicester that is still owned by General Electric, the second largest company in the world. Those who have been to Leicester&#151;I know that the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) frequently visits relatives there&#151;will come off the M1 and drive to Rushey Mead and past the old Thorn EMI site. That site is now for sale. For many years, it made about a third of the light bulbs for the whole of Europe, but it has closed, and GE wishes to sell it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000443">The land, however, is contaminated, and we have asked the council and Ministers to intervene to ensure that it is not sold for commercial purposes until there is a full and thorough investigation by the local council and the Environment Agency into the reasons for the contamination. It should be put on the market only once the contamination is cleared. Once it has been cleared, the land should be used for housing rather than for commercial purposes or sporting activity. I find it very strange that the Government are trying to force an eco-town on Leicestershire in the western part of my constituency, on what I regard as green belt land. That is a beautiful part of the county, but I can offer them a brownfield site in the middle of Leicester, which will be ideal for house building once it has been cleared of contamination. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will give us some good news about the Government&#146;s commitment to dealing with contaminated land and on their desire to ensure that when developers wish to build, they should build within cities, where possible, before moving outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000444">My second point concerns home affairs issues, although I do not want to turn this into a debate on the programme of the Select Committee on Home Affairs because there will be other opportunities for that. I fully endorse what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said about the march against knife crime that is currently going through Westminster, and I hope to join him and others outside No. 10 at 4 o&#146;clock to show our support for the need to find a solution to that ever-increasing problem. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise those issues, and to raise the issue of peace in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000445">I would like, however, to address the Government&#146;s decision to initiate a consultation on alcohol. As my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) will know, on Tuesday of last week the Home Affairs Committee completed its lengthy inquiry into policing in the 21st century. Alcohol-related crime is an important aspect of the time spent by the police on  <br>

solving crimes of violence. In fact, 46 per cent. of crimes in this country are alcohol-related and, based on current figures, 6 per cent. of hospital admissions are alcohol-related. I welcome the fact that the Government have decided to carry out a consultation on the sale and availability of alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000446">Cut-price alcohol is offered to those who wish to go to pubs and clubs for so-called happy hours. Our major supermarkets discount alcohol to such an extent that people&#151;in many cases young people&#151;who go to nightclubs on a Friday or Saturday night have already been able to front-load their drinking by drinking cheap alcohol at home. In some cases, alcohol in places such as Asda, Sainsbury&#146;s and Tesco is actually cheaper than water. I welcome the consultation, which will last until October. Looking at the alcohol industry and, more importantly, at the effect alcohol has on crime is an important step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08072274000447">Finally, I would like to raise an international point, which relates to Yemen. I declare an interest: I was born in Yemen, and spent the first nine years of my life there. I try to go back at least once a year with the all-party group on Yemen. Members on both sides of the House have had the opportunity to visit that wonderful country. Unfortunately, the Government have decided to restrict travelling to Yemen on the grounds that the terrorist situation has become much worse. The problem with such advice is that people-to-people contact, which is so important to building up relations, is put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para31"><a name="08072274000448">I am not a security expert, but I do not think there is a huge problem for tourists visiting Yemen if they take the advice of the Yemeni Government. In other words, they should stick to the big towns and cities of Yemen, such as Sana&#146;a and Aden&#151;the city where I was born&#151;where the Government give protection to tourists. The advice is sending the wrong signal given our determination to ensure that the Government of Yemen remain in line with our agenda to combat terrorism in that region of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80722-0011.htm_para32"><a name="08072274000449">We have a proud record of providing aid to Yemen. We set up the donor conference in 2006, where millions of pounds were raised for Yemen by the countries involved. Some of that money has been spent, and other resources remain to be spent. Because we provided the basis for the donor conference, and have now started a consultation on the Yemen development plan, it is important that we are seen to take a lead in helping the Yemeni people, 35 per cent. of whom live in poverty. The level of ill health among young people there is terrible. As we enjoy our summer holidays, whether in Tiverton and Honiton, or the lovely city of Leicester&#151;whichever pitch right hon. and hon. Members make today&#151;I hope that we remember that there is a world outside. Yemen is not a traditional summer holiday destination for Members of Parliament, but I hope that we will take the necessary steps to protect and support the people of that small and beautiful country.</p>

 I propose to speak briefly about three subjects: knife crime, tax credit problems and choice in health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000451">Although I am a Leicestershire Member of Parliament, in 1980, I stood for election to the Greater London council in London, not far from the constituency of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). I well remember driving back on Friday evening and seeing the whole of Brixton in flames, and the roads cordoned off. In subsequent years, I was at Oxford university researching, specifically, policing and public order in a multi-racial Britain. I looked at the Scarman report, and studied the Bristol and Brixton riots in some detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000452">I raise this matter because I fear that the policing strategy and the general attitude to the knife crime wave in London, terrible though it is&#151;I believe that 25 young lives have been lost so far&#151;is slightly off-message. Members with long memories will recall that the key problem addressed by Scarman was the &#147;sus&#148; law: the blanket stop-and-search arrangements that had inflamed relations with the ethnic community. As I consider the strategy to deal with the present problem in London, I am concerned about the possibility that we will repeat the problems of the 1980s, when the perceived strong approach of the police involved targeting large numbers of people in the hope of finding a fairly large number carrying knives and did not involve targeting known offenders. I am concerned that such a strategy will blow up in our faces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000453">I do not believe that the police can maintain blanket stop-and-search arrangements for a long period. There must be a strategy for targeting the gang leaders. The police have a duty&#151;I think it is in the Public Order Act 1986&#151;to provide public tranquillity, and tranquillity is often enhanced by the presence of police. The new &#147;half police officers&#148; and special constables should be brought into play in that context. However, the situation is worrying: policing by consent is above all essential, and should be the main goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000454">About 10 years ago, when we debated speed cameras in the House, the only basis on which Members accepted the proposal for cameras en masse across the country was the understanding that they would be clearly marked. I remember those debates well. I have noticed in the Metropolitan police district&#151;I tabled some questions about this yesterday&#151;new bi-directional speed cameras that are marked on only one side. That strikes me as dangerous. There is a general agreement that safety cameras&#151;or speed cameras; call them what you like&#151;are a good idea, but there will be problems if they do not command public consent. Moreover, I believe that the police are in breach of the guidelines that clearly state that the cameras should be marked on both sides. I could read them all out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000455">My next point concerns tax credit. What a nightmare! I cannot believe the amount of work that my local tax offices devote to dealing with it. It is generally those with the most problems whose problems are compounded by the lunacy of the Government&#146;s overpaying them and then saying &#147;We want it all back.&#148; It is madness. I cannot believe the amount of time and misery that it has generated.</p>

ghastly, and the least well-off generally suffer most. The tax credit system has put people in debt for the first time. People who have never entertained debt in their lives find themselves in debt, just like the wretched farmers&#151;including some in my constituency&#151;who are suffering at the hands of the Rural Payments Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000457">As I have said, Ann Abraham, the ombudsman, launched a scathing attack. How can it be that &#163;1 billion was overpaid last year and a third of tax credit awards were overpaid by more than &#163;1,000&#151;25,000 by over &#163;5,000? We must, I think, consider the way in which the Government have tinkered with tax and credit over the years. The current Prime Minister began by abolishing the family credit system, and then introduced working families tax credit, disabled person&#146;s tax credit, child care tax credit and employment credit. He then abolished the married couples tax allowance, introduced a children&#146;s tax credit, introduced a baby tax credit, abolished the working families tax credit, the disabled person&#146;s tax credit, the children&#146;s tax credit and the baby tax credit, introduced child tax credit, abolished employment credit and introduced the working tax credit that we now have. Is it any wonder that people are confused after 15 changes over the years, and that the ombudsman has taken an interest? It is a disgraceful record.</p>

I welcome the publication of a long-awaited report by the Department of Health&#146;s steering group on the regulation of acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. I am sure that this will interest the Deputy Leader of the House. The report, published on 16 June, recommended that the Government proceed with statutory regulation of acupuncture and herbalists through the Health Professions Council. There is a pressing need for such regulation because we must link our arrangements with European law by 2011, but there is another pressing reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000459">What we have found in the whole field of integrated health care is that once there is statutory regulation&#151;this was true of the Osteopaths Act 1993 and the Chiropractors Act 1994; I served on the Committee stages of both&#151;doctors are prepared to refer people. One of our problems with integrated health care, including homoeopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture and aromatherapy, is that doctors do not want to refer people because they are not certain that those to whom they are referring them are properly qualified. If we can ensure that more such therapies are regulated by Acts of Parliament, many more people will be referred, which will be much cheaper for the national health service.</p>

Next summer it will be the Ashes series again, yet cricket is still living off the heroes of the last Ashes series&#151;names such as Pietersen and so on are well known. The next Ashes series will be live on free TV in Australia through the night, but not in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000466">There are two ways of progressing, the first of which is the listed events legislation. It is no accident that the Wimbledon final, which is listed and must be available free to air to all the population at a fair and reasonable price to the broadcasting companies, was enjoyed by 12 million people. Every pub, restaurant and club in the land could put it on, and people who were not at all interested in tennis watched it. I fear that if the cricket authorities do not put some cricket back on terrestrial television, Ministers may be persuaded at last that they have to look at the issue again&#151;indeed, we are coming up to a review of listed events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000467">The second way in which cricket can return to free-to-air TV is simply through the cricket authorities recognising that although they have to make money out of Sky and other subscription broadcasters&#151;Sky does a marvellous job&#151;they can still insist in their contracts that some cricket be on free-to-air TV. Rugby league does that with the Challenge cup, which will be enjoyed on BBC television this weekend. The Football League recently did a broadcasting deal in which it insisted that 10 live matches from 2010 be on free-to-air TV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000468">There are ways of having cricket on TV and still retaining a good income for the sport. I hope even at this late stage that the English cricket board and the two gentlemen who are negotiating the contracts&#151;I have mentioned Giles Clarke; the second gentleman is a constituent of mine, Clive Leach, who lives in Barkston Ash and is chairman of Durham, and to whom I appeal in particular as a constituent&#151;will think again and see whether at least some cricket, such as part of one of the Twenty20 competitions that were announced last week, could be on free-to-air TV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000469">The issue is the subject of great debate in the English cricket board. Giles Clarke won by just one vote among the counties last year. In the first ballot there was a tie, at nine votes each, and his main rival and critic, Mike Soper, took a very different view on free-to-air TV. I appeal to the counties of England represented on the  <br>

There were some worthy measures mentioned. It is always worth remembering, by the way, that our alcohol consumption per head is falling, although that does not detract from the health dangers facing those who drink too much or the dangers to public order and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000471">The Government need to revisit the issue of alcohol pricing. They will not get away with dodging it. There are many pressures. For example, the Governments in Scotland and Ireland have said that they will legislate. The official spokesman for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition said that they would deal with below-cost selling&#151;in an undefined way, but that is nevertheless a big step forward. Doctors and senior police chiefs are forming a loose coalition demanding action. Even Tesco has said that it would not object if the Government decided to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000472">It is ridiculous when alcohol is sold for less than the price of water and when 60 cans or bottles are sold in some supermarkets for &#163;20 or less. The Government need to revisit the issue over the recess. The Department of Health is publishing a study on the relationship between alcohol and price. I say gently to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench that we cannot find ourselves in a situation next year where there will be one price of beer or wine in Glasgow, Edinburgh or Dumfries, yet over the border in Berwick, York, Manchester or Leeds&#151;indeed, throughout the whole of England&#151;there will be another. That would not be sustainable. As I have said, Ministers will not be able to dodge the issue.</p>

The national hero of Mongolia is Genghis Khan, which makes it even more remarkable that Mongolia has developed a market economy and a democracy over the past 15 or 16 years. Given that its neighbours are China and Russia, that is a tremendous achievement. Tomorrow, the Khural, the Mongolian Parliament, will meet for the first time since the most recent election, when sadly, despite international observers saying that it was free and fair, there were some disturbances and five people were killed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000476">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I could speak about a number of constituency issues, but I shall limit myself mainly to two. The other topical issues would include the latest application to build a wind farm in my constituency, which I hope we will see off; today&#146;s announcement by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government of her response to the regional spatial strategy, which eats up the green belt in the southern part of my constituency; the crisis in both social and affordable housing; the appalling misery experienced on the A350&#151;the main north-south route&#151;by drivers and those who live near the road; and the suffering of dairy farmers, as we are a hot spot for bovine TB, yet we have seen an almost complete lack of response from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000477">The two main issues I wish to deal with are economic: one is about the rural economy and the other is about the technological and industrial economy. Although many people may not recognise it, North Dorset does have a technological and industrial economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000478">Last week, the list of post offices to be closed in Dorset was issued and some eight in my constituency are on it, while another three are due to be converted to outreach services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000479">The technological issue concerns the aerospace industry and goes wider than just Dorset, as it deals with the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000480">Some of the eight sub-post offices in my constituency that are on the list for closure should not be included on it. I hesitate to mount a campaign, but I will be participating in a march from Milton on Stour to Gillingham next Sunday morning, and anyone who wants to join us would be most welcome. I want to mention the post office at Blandford Camp. When the man from the Post Office came to see me, he told me that the post office at Blandford Camp, which is the home of the Royal Corps of Signals, was on the list. I said that that was rather surprising as I had visited it the other day and it seemed to be very busy. He said, &#147;Oh yes, but there aren&#146;t enough people at retirement age, there are no benefit claimants and no pensioners.&#148; I said, &#147;Well, yes, it is a military establishment, so it is unlikely that there would be any of those categories of people.&#148; None the less, I was told, this was part of the criteria, so we need to find some way of countering that sort of &#147;logic&#148;, particularly when that post office has an enormous amount of parcels business, for example, which supports our troops serving overseas. I feel that it would be a very sad loss if that post office were closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000481">I mentioned Milton on Stour a few moments ago, and its post office is also due for closure. This is a thriving rural community very close to the town of Gillingham, but not in it. It has a very limited bus service, as do other areas with post offices on the list. There is a bus service, but anyone who uses it cannot get back the same day, which is rather illogical if one wants to go out to do some postal business. I implore the Post Office seriously to consider the logic of closing some of these post offices and I implore my constituents to make a very good case for keeping them open, particularly those in remote rural areas, and to write letters individually. Petitions are great, but they do not always do a lot here; individual letters will be more influential. If we can keep up the campaign, we may stand a chance of saving at least some of these post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000482">Let me consider the technological and aerospace industries. Flight Refuelling, a traditional company, has been based in Wimborne in the south-east of my constituency for many years. It is now sometimes known by its parent company name of Cobham, after the founder of flight refuelling. It is the world leader in air-to-air refuelling and almost every aircraft in the world&#151;whether a Boeing, an Airbus or a fighter aircraft&#151;has some bit of refuelling or fuelling equipment that the company has supplied and that has been built in Wimborne.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000483">Air-to-air refuelling is the key issue in which the company is currently involved. On 27 March, after much deliberation, the Government eventually signed the 27-year contract with the AirTanker consortium to provide 14 new Airbus A330 air-to-air refuelling aircraft, which will be worth a lot of money to the Cobham group in my constituency. They will be fitted out at Hurn airport just outside Bournemouth and we can all be proud of that state-of-the-art equipment. However, just a few weeks before that, the United States air force, which needed to replace its tanker fleet, announced that it would buy aircraft of almost the same configuration. That order dwarfs the RAF&#146;s order because the US air force is in the market for 179 air-to-air refuelling tankers. That is worth about $1 billion to the company in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80722-0012.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000484">The only problem is that the US Government Accountability Office, under considerable political pressure from Boeing and Congress, has thrown that very good order into touch, and the contract must be readvertised, despite the fact that the US air force says that it is the best aircraft for the job and that it wants the aircraft. I implore the Government to remind the US Government that we are a net buyer of US military equipment and that we should have a fair playing field for the supply of equipment across the Atlantic.</p>

 The major road between Norwich and London is the A11. Over the years, it has been the butt of many jokes and much comment. For example, it used to be said in the 1960s that, as one entered Norfolk, one would meet the Romans leaving because it took so long to come down the A11. Nowadays, many comments are made about keeping &#147;them&#148;&#151;those crooks from London who come up the main road&#151;out of Norfolk. It is said that if one dualled the road, they would come back quicker. That argument was vehemently presented for the non-dualling of the road. Comments have even been made about the need for a drawbridge in Wymondham in Norfolk to stop people coming in. I cannot repeat what people in Norfolk say about the Chelsea tractors that arrive every weekend at second homes in Burnham, but those driving them would favour a faster road.</p>

However, the A11 fascinates people and, when I am being mischievous, which happens rarely, I say, &#147;Well, dualling is fine, but in California, it would have five lanes by now.&#148; However, I dread that thought, with climate change so high on the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000487">Other people say that we can always use the trains. Some of us have been fighting the train route from Norwich to London for years. It is unreliable and today&#146;s report about Network Rail fits perfectly with our experience of the trains. The train is no substitute&#151;it is so unreliable. Dualling the road is therefore important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000488">Norwich is a large and vibrant European city, with a route to Yarmouth, which now has an outer harbour. People will want to get from London through Norwich to the outer harbour. We want that fast route to be developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000489">This issue was first talked about as long ago as 1971, in Edward Heath&#146;s Government. Progress has always stuttered along since then. The proposals for the Attleborough bypass were made in &#146;89, and in &#146;95 they were put on the long-term programme. In 1999, Lord Larry Whitty, then a Transport Minister, said it was a necessity to get the A11 dualled. In November 2001, the Department for Transport&#151;bless it&#151;announced that the A11 was to be made completely into a dual-carriageway. I supported that, and was quite enthusiastic at the time&#151;and I was the butt of many cartoon jokes saying it would never happen. That was the level of argument at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000490">In fact, however, most of it has been dualled. The distance from London to Norwich is 100-odd miles. The stretch between Roudham heath and Attleborough was dualled in 2003, and the Attleborough bypass was also dualled that year. That venture has led to increased road safety and greater journey time reliability. However, the section between Thetford and Barton Mills/Fiveways is still not dualled, and the pressure is mounting to do that. As this remaining stretch is only 9 miles in length this might seem a trivial issue, but I think that that is an argument for getting the job done sooner rather than later. That would excite people&#151;as I have said, it certainly does so at dinner parties. It would excite those in business and in the travel industry, because there are many traffic jams along that stretch of the A11 as the lorries pile up as they move out into eastern England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000491">There are also environmental debates and difficulties, for instance to do with sites of special scientific interest. There are environmental pressures to bypass Elveden, where Guinness magnate Lord Iveagh has his place. That has been agreed by the Highways Agency, which has bought a piece of land to allow for migrating birds and certain habitats, and thereby to compensate for the upgrade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000492">The cost of the upgrade of this 9-mile stretch will be &#163;135 million. It astonishes me that it will be that much, but the experts tell me that that will be the cost. I do not want to compare that with the cost of identity cards and wars, as that would be far too political for end-of-term discussions, but I think I have got my point across. I am sure that &#163;135 million could be quietly absorbed, and that would result in a happier business community in the east of England. The East of England Development Agency has come out in support. It says it would boost the local economy by &#163;600 million and it is vital for the region&#146;s economy. It would also generate wider economic benefits for the region and bring firms into Norwich and Thetford.</p>

residents of the area, think that investment in the scheme would be a building-block in the continued economic success of our region. The East of England regional assembly&#151;in an amazing burst of enthusiasm that astonished me&#151;recently gave the green light for the 9-mile stretch on the A11 to be dualled and made it a priority. The Highways Agency is giving support, too. It is beginning to be recognised that that area of the country needs to develop.

 I am sorry not to be able to follow on from the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on a light note, but today we have formally been given the final list of Devon post offices that have been subject to consultation, and we now know exactly which ones will close. I particularly want to raise the matter today because of my ongoing concern about the impact on village communities, which has been touched on by colleagues. A crude criterion has been applied: whether a post office is more than 3 miles from another one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000497">One of the post offices in my constituency that is due to close is located in Tipton St. John, a small village in east Devon. We made a very strong case, saying that although its post office is located within 3 miles of two other village post offices, the geography of the constituency consists of narrow lanes that are very difficult and dangerous for elderly people or people with small children to walk along, but we were given the answer that the Post Office had satisfied itself that people could catch a bus to a town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000498">That fundamental criterion might have been overlooked, but, even more worryingly, the village shop aspect&#151;some post offices are also the local village shop, which is a very important facility in rural communities&#151;does not seem to have been taken into account at all. The post office in Tipton St. John is also the village shop. Our difficulty is that despite the fact that I met the Post Office&#146;s representatives twice while the consultation was going on, it has still not recognised that any form of outreach service should be provided in place of the closure. That will be very damaging to the local community. In the other six villages where the intention is to close the post office and replace it with some form of outreach service, several of those post offices are also sited in the only village shop for miles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000499">I particularly worry about the role of the consumer bodies that are in place to make representations on behalf of consumers. Postwatch wrote to me, putting in  <br>

a detailed application, to say that it was very concerned about some of the issues that I and many others have raised, However, Postwatch seems to have no teeth, and I think it almost a foregone conclusion that these Post Office consultations are a mockery. The most one can do for one&#146;s constituents is try to negotiate the best deal possible on outreach services, because, as we have heard, if one saves one post office, the chances are that the post office in the next village may close in order to meet the requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000500">Members of Parliament have been placed in a very difficult position, but so too has Postwatch. Given its role in the process&#151;it says that it has focused very much on the 3-mile limit between post offices that has been set&#151;it seems to me that many of these consumer bodies, which, at one time, would have been championing the rights of consumers and would have been at the forefront of campaigns, have lost all their teeth. I put it to the Government that they have deliberately manipulated many of these representative consumer bodies and watchdogs, which look after things such as postal services and monitoring health service complaints. The Government keep changing these organisations every few years until they have reduced them to being the most ineffective bodies. I intend no disrespect to the people involved in them today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000501">The post office closure exercise has shown us that if Members of Parliament, the consumer bodies and large campaigns&#151;even though people engage in them in the best hope and faith that they will change minds&#151;cannot make these changes happen, this exercise has been on paper only; it has not been a proper consultation. There will be long-term consequences for the viability of rural communities, such as the villages of Kennerleigh, Newton St. Cyres and Plymtree in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000502">The other issue that I wish to raise is that of charity shops. I have several small market towns in my constituency, with populations of between 8,000 and 10,000. Shopkeepers in those towns are increasingly concerned about the number of charity shops. No one is saying that there should not be any charity shops &#151;I have opened some&#151;but I have received correspondence, which I have forwarded to the appropriate Minister, from the chamber of trade in Honiton about the balance that needs to be struck when planning applications are made. The question  is how many charity shops can a small town accommodate before the regular traders start to feel disadvantaged? I know that there are trading standards rules on what charity shops can sell, but the traders have a point. I ask the Minister to consider the appropriate number of permissions granted for charity shops to trade in small towns before they start to undermine core businesses.</p>

 I am coming to that. Colleagues who dined in the Members&#146; Dining Room three weeks ago will have experienced the regional menu of Devon produce, including Devon crab cakes and ruby red Devon beef from the Coombe estate in Gittisham in my constituency. So this year, I encourage colleagues to come to the beautiful county of Devon and, especially, to my constituency to take advantage of the wonderful home-produced food. It is not just cream teas: even vegetarians would love the ruby red Devon beef. It is to die for. It is delicious. I hope that everyone has a very happy holiday, and welcome to Devon.</p>

 I cannot match the exotic invitations to Devon, Mongolia or the A11, but I wish to raise a couple of matters of concern to my constituents. I start, inevitably, with Heathrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000507">Last night, Members may have seen the &#147;Panorama&#148; expos&#233; of the Government&#146;s decision-making process on the development of Heathrow airport and the information about it obtained by various freedom of information requests. It confirmed that the decision to allow the expansion of Heathrow was made on the basis of information that was &#147;doctored&#148;&#151;it is the only way to describe it&#151;by BAA. That doctoring included the invention of an aeroplane that does not exist yet and is not likely to exist because no manufacturer is willing to create it. That was included in the modelling for the air pollution and noise estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000508">Allegations were also made in the programme about collusion between Government officials and BAA. It is now time, as I have said in an early-day motion that I have tabled today, for a full public inquiry into the decision-making about Heathrow by this Government. It is clear that the Government must now reject all further expansion at Heathrow, because the undoctored evidence demonstrates that if the Government allow it, they will not be able to meet European directive restrictions on air and noise pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000509">I hope that hon. Members will find time today and when we return to sign that early-day motion and that the Government will reject further expansion at Heathrow. I hope that at the same time we can have that inquiry into how a Government can make a policy decision that is based on information doctored by a private company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000510">The next matter that I want to raise is the BBC resources section. I have constituents who work there, including Mr. Mark Cody, to whom I pay tribute. He has soldiered on, exposing what is happening in that section of the BBC. Some hon. Members will remember that we had a debate earlier in the year in which we drew out some of the information about what is happening with the BBC and its licence. We were then told that the BBC resources section, which includes studio production, post-production and outside broadcasting, was to be sold off. The target was &#163;150 million of income. We now know that &#163;3.4 million has been spent on consultants and advisers to sell off BBC resources, yet only one division&#151;the outside broadcasting division&#151;has been sold, for &#163;19.3 million. The rest of the negotiations have collapsed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000511">All that money has been spent, and the worst thing for my constituents&#151;in particular for Mr. Mark Cody, who has explained this to me and to others through his  <br>

union, the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union, is that members of staff have been left virtually in the dark. They have been offered various commitments about protection through TUPE&#151;the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006&#151;if their division is sold off, yet that protection amounts to very little, particularly when it comes to the threat to their pensions, their future wages and their working conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000512">I urge the BBC to start to consult the union properly, to ensure that there is openness and transparency and to ensure that people like Mark Cody are kept fully informed. At the moment, if he is transferred at some future stage, there will be a pension shortfall and he will lose part of his pension, his conditions of service will be undermined and his employment will be threatened. That problem affects loyal staff in a profitable area of the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000513">Events in another section of the BBC will affect my constituents, too. The BBC is not only outsourcing but offshoring. The latest scheme is to offshore the World Service&#151;the BBC proposes to move major parts of the World Service abroad. The service is directly funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so there must have been some consultation with the Government. For example, the south Asian broadcasting service in Urdu, Hindi and Nepali will be transferred offshore to India, Pakistan and Nepal. That section represents a third of the World Service&#146;s audience, attracted, of course, by a superb and excellent independent service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000514">The problem of offshoring the services to those states is that they come within the ambit of local laws. Already, the BBC has been threatened with censorship by the Pakistani authorities as a result of some of the stories that it wanted to produce and broadcast. In addition, staff are being told that they can transfer abroad on lower pay and short-term contracts and to often unstable and unsafe locations, or they can face redundancy. That is a take-it-or-leave-it offer for those staff, many of whom built up the service over the years. It has a standing and credibility across the world that is second to none. None of the issues with the BBC&#146;s performance is acceptable. I urge the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to review those matters and to report back to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000515">The final area of concern that has been raised by my constituents is what has been happening at Shelter, the housing charity. Some Members might know, because they have been written to by Shelter&#146;s staff, that Shelter&#146;s senior management team has been forcing through changes in staff conditions and contracts against the wishes of the majority of staff, 60 per cent. of whom are unionised and represented by the Transport and General Workers Union, now called Unite the Union. That situation has led to industrial action for the first time in the 41 year history of Shelter. Shelter staff report to me that there is demoralisation and key expert staff are leaving as a result of the imposition by management of cuts in wages and working conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000516">That must be a concern to us all. Many Members on both sides of the House have worked with Shelter over the years; it has provided us with an excellent service in briefings and other materials, as well as campaigning on issues such as homelessness. At a time when we have a housing crisis, especially in terms of affordability, and  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 723</b><br>
when repossessions are rising, to undermine Shelter is to undermine an organisation that provides us and the homeless with a service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000517">Interestingly, before the management sought to impose pay and condition cuts on their staff, they gave themselves a significant wage rise. In fact, the chief executive, whom I met, gave himself an 18 per cent. wage rise just before he started sacking his own staff. The staff themselves have had an average pay cut of &#163;2,300. There have been cuts in wages of &#163;800 per annum, and increased hours. We are told that some staff are now having to work three weeks extra for no additional pay, yet the headquarters has been cosmetically refurbished for &#163;750,000, and &#163;500,000 has been spent on consultants to advise the management on how to cut the wages and conditions of the staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000518">I urge the Shelter board to intervene. I have met the chief executive of Shelter, who says that this is actually to do with the way in which contracts are awarded by the Government. If that is the case, I urge the Government to meet the Shelter board to resolve the problem before this essential organisation is undermined. We must not undermine Shelter&#146;s status and the services that it provides to Members of this House and to homeless people as a result of its campaigning. It would be a tragedy, in this year when we need the organisation so much, if it were undermined by the way in which its brutal management are dealing with its dedicated staff.</p>

 I should like to speak for a few minutes on a subject that I know is close to the hearts of many hon. Members. We are all suffering, or have suffered, or will suffer, from post office closures in our constituencies. We in Solihull are lucky&#151;if that is the right word&#151;because only three post offices are earmarked for closure. However, having lost several important post offices in the cull that we experienced a few years ago, each one that we have left plays a vital role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000520">Our story in Solihull is also being played out across the country, and the questions that it raises are pertinent to every Member&#146;s constituency. The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) mentioned the criteria that can be used to try to obtain a reversal of a decision to close a post office. Three criteria of which I am aware are: unforeseen planning proposals that might increase unpredicted footfall; the difficulty of reaching other, more distant, post offices; and the deprivation that would be suffered as a result of the closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80722-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000521">By extraordinary coincidence, one of those three criteria pertains to each proposed closure in Solihull. In Haslucks Green road, in Shirley, a superstore and shopping development is planned, despite the fact that we already have six supermarkets in Shirley high street. I have fought bitterly against the Asda superstore, but our failure to prevent this unwanted development has turned out to have a silver lining. Haslucks Green post office is just a few hundred yards away from it, and it will be besieged, not least by people who cannot even get to  the superstore because of the traffic congestion that will be created.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 724</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000522">Distance is another criterion that can be used. The Post Office, having encouraged the owner of the post office in Catherine de Barnes to grow his business, is now suggesting that it should be closed. I cannot match some of the ridiculous examples given by other hon. Members about people being unable to get a bus back home from the post office the same day, but Catherine de Barnes is a small village, and the bus to Solihull only comes about every 70 minutes, if we are lucky. The idea of going anywhere other than Solihull by bus is really not feasible. The post office is the only shop in the village, but it has a unique advantage in that it has a combi-counter which offers post office services seven days a week, up to 9 o&#146;clock at night. People come from miles around to use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000523">Deprivation is the third criterion. In Olton Hollow, there is more sheltered housing and, arguably, more elderly people than anywhere else in the borough. Olton Hollow, as the name suggests, is in a hollow, so anyone wanting to reach another post office would have a physical and metaphorical steep hill to climb.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000524">Citizens Advice carried out an online survey, and it might help the House if I were to quote some of its findings. Citizens Advice feels that six weeks is too short a time for the proper consultation of vulnerable people. More than 90 per cent. of those who completed its online survey said that they would be personally affected if their local post office were to close, while 75 per cent. said that they would be significantly affected. In addition, 75 per cent. of respondents to the survey said that they could get to a local post office on foot, but only 14 per cent. would still be able to do so if the local office closed. For people on benefits, of course, there would be an additional cost if they could no longer reach their office on foot. The survey found that half of the over-65s and nearly half of those on means-tested benefits visited post offices several times a week. Despite what the Government may say, more than 60 per cent. of the over-75s still use the post office to pay many household bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000525">In Solihull, just as elsewhere, other criteria apply that are not being given proper consideration. For example, what happens if the nearest alternative is already too busy, with elderly people waiting in queues for long periods of time? We were not allowed to run a petition inside the post office in Shirley as the shop is owned by the Co-op, so the owners of 35 local shops agreed to take it instead. Many of them said, &#147;For goodness sake, please don&#146;t let them close the post office at Haslucks Green, because we don&#146;t want to have to wait 45 minutes at the one here.&#148; They said that even though the post office in Shirley was physically nearer for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000526">What about parking? If it is a nightmare to park near the nearest post office, what will that mean for people forced to use transport to reach their post office? What about the effect of a post office closure on the surrounding local economy? In Olton Hollow, for example, the closure of the post office will affect the footfall in the local parade of shops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000527">When I raised these questions with the relevant Minister this morning, he blamed the decrease in post office business on changes in technology such as the internet. Of course, some patterns of business do change, but many services, such as the provision of TV licences, have been withdrawn from post offices. Moreover, different criteria now apply for online payments such as for car  <br>

tax. Following the withdrawal of Post Office books, there has been the reluctant introduction of the Post Office card account. Although that account is difficult to apply for, it remains phenomenally successful, but the Post Office now faces the indignity of having to tender for its own post office card accounts services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000528">When services are withdrawn, and when people find it more difficult to get to their post offices and queues are longer, that means that the Government are making the post office network unsustainable. In the midlands, there are 160 proposed closures, and only four decisions have been reversed. I am concerned that there is some sort of conspiracy. Our communities are putting themselves through the pain of fighting to save their precious post offices, but it seems to be a done deal already. I have tabled an early-day motion stating that the word &#147;consultation&#148; must mean just that, and that the result must not be a foregone conclusion.</p>

 I always love taking part in these debates, as they are one of the few opportunities that Back Benchers have to raise their constituents&#146; concerns. In the last such debate that I took part in, I raised the matter of free travel for pensioners in my constituency. One of my local councils was restricting free travel for pensioners, but I am pleased to report to the House that pensioners in my constituency had their free travel restored on 2 June. That shows how powerful these debates are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000530">I also raised some fears and worries about the closure of Waltham fire station and the loss of a pump at Immingham fire station. I appealed for more time, as any closures that were to happen would have been announced in the middle of the recess. The announcement was put off but&#151;sadly&#151;we shall find out about the future of those fire stations on Friday. I want the fire authority to think again about the impact of the fire station closures on our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000531">One reason why I make that point is that last Christmas&#151;I do not know whether hon. Members recall this&#151;there was an explosion at Fred&#146;s Taxis in Immingham. Sadly, two women who worked there, Ann Mawer and Sue Barker, lost their lives. The inquest was held this week, and it recorded verdicts of accidental death as a result of the explosion, which was caused by the storage of petrol on the premises. We do not yet know what caused the petrol to ignite. I have been working with Ann&#146;s sisters to ensure that the law is better enforced, or indeed changed so that there are stricter controls on how much petrol can be stored on domestic premises and very small commercial premises of the type used by most taxi firms. We could lose a fire appliance at Immingham, where the accident took place. In light of those two tragic deaths, I am sure that Humberside fire and rescue authority will understand why people are so concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000532">Last year, Immingham was subject to flooding, and some constituents were out of their homes for more than a year. A lot of that had to do with loss adjustors and insurance firms delaying giving people the money and the go-ahead for building works. Again, the fire and rescue service was crucial in assisting many of the people who were affected by the floods, so I call on the fire and rescue authority to think again. I hope that that campaign will meet with success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000533">I praise the Government for announcing that there will be a water and flood management Bill. I have received a wealth of information from constituents who were affected by the floods last June, and I will forward it to Ministers so that they can see some of the suggestions that my constituents have made. Last year, there was a focus on places such as Hull, but a lot of the floods in my area were in the more rural parts of the constituency. We have to address those concerns, particularly with internal drainage boards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000534">I have already raised in the House the issue of the A180, and the need to get that damned noisy road resurfaced. One section has been resurfaced, and it has been announced that another section will be resurfaced. However, there is a catch: only half of it&#151;the westbound, but not the eastbound, carriageway&#151;will be resurfaced. Who at the Highways Agency came up with the idea of resurfacing just one side of the dual carriageway to reduce the noise? If the equipment is on site, let us do all the work. I will not stop campaigning until every section of concrete on that road is finally stripped off, and until the road is re-tarmacked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000535">Also on the subject of roads, I am sorry to say that in Barton-upon-Humber yesterday there was a fatal accident in which a pensioner was knocked down and killed on the crossing in the marketplace. I send my condolences to her family. Town residents have long complained about the safety aspects of the crossing. There is a lot of industry in the Humber area, and there are many heavy goods vehicles. They continue to go through small towns, market towns and villages in the area, although there is a perfectly good dual carriageway, albeit a noisy one with a concrete surface. They choose to go through the villages. Some people have told me that that is because their satnavs sometimes direct them by the shortest route, rather than by the main roads. I want something done about the number of HGVs that use towns such as Barton-upon-Humber&#151;people say that the situation there was an accident waiting to happen&#151;and Immingham, which I mentioned earlier. HGVs continue to thunder through the centre of that town, past schools and shops. We need to address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000536">Another transport issue that I should like to bring to the House&#146;s attention is that of free school transport. There has been a bit of a fuss in my local area recently, as North Lincolnshire council intended to withdraw some of its free school transport, and to start means-testing those who used it. I am pleased to say that the council has changed its mind following a revolt by parents worried about the safety of their children if the free transport were not applied. North East Lincolnshire, the same council that withdrew free travel for pensioners last year, is also going to go down the road of means-testing children&#146;s transport to school. Clearly the council has seen the fuss caused in the neighbouring authority and I hope that North East Lincolnshire council, as it did with bus passes, changes its mind about removing something that is free and starting to charge for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000537">Last week it was announced that North East Lincolnshire council was to receive more than &#163;3 million from the Government to refurbish kitchens in schools.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on behalf of my constituents on a number of issues and I shall try to use as little time as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000540">First, I pay tribute to one of my predecessors in representing Blaenau Gwent, Aneurin Bevan. In this, the 60th anniversary of the health service, it is a great pleasure to represent the area and to be linked alongside such a great man. I pay tribute to Tredegar Medical Aid, one of the organisations that influenced Bevan in pushing forward the national health service, and to the people of the south Wales valleys, who showed that co-operation coming together with funds could benefit more than just the individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000541">The NHS principle of treatment free at the point of need is as important now as it was 60 years ago. Bevan would be proud that the NHS is still in existence, but I believe that he would be disappointed in the fact that ill health remains and that the divide between rich and poor is as wide now as it was then. Health inequality between industrial heartlands such as my constituency and the wealthier areas of the country is nothing to be proud of. The differences between those areas are far too great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000542">Bevan said that the NHS should be for the rich and the poor, who should be treated alike, and that poverty should not be a disability and wealth not an advantage, but the statistics show that where we live is as important in assessing our life expectancy now as it was after the second world war. Life expectancy for those in the well-off areas is some 10 years more than in the poor areas. Infant mortality rates are much higher in the poorer areas. A lot of that has to do with poor housing and education, in which we need to invest. Those areas in poverty are remaining in poverty and we have done very little to lift them out of it. Infant mortality rates show a health inequality gap: one in five children in poverty, but one in 20 in the more affluent areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000543">Bevan said that the reason to gain power was to give it away, but we should not give it away to management consultants within the health service. We should give it to the people who need to make the decisions&#151;the doctors, nurses, cleaners, cooks and patients. Bevan&#146;s co-operative commonwealth for health is as relevant today as it ever was.</p>

I want to concentrate particularly on the Post Office card account. The average card lobby that I receive on any particular issue is a dozen, perhaps 20 cards. I have brought a sample of the 500 I have received about the card account, and I guess that the number will be higher in the bigger constituencies. That shows what the general public think about supporting our post offices. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government recently launched &#147;Communities in Control&#148;.

at the Dispatch Box about petitions, but there is no point in encouraging individuals to take part in petitions and the political debate if the Government ignore the outcome. Petitions show the need for the Post Office card account to remain with the Post Office. The Government want to spend taxpayers&#146; money to the best of their ability, but surely the card account protest shows that taxpayers want their money spent on retaining the card account where it belongs. The Government must listen to that referendum.</p>

When I was a young man, which was a long time ago, youth crime and crime in general took place in the big city. Now, even gun crime and knife crime have shifted across the country, and they have probably touched all constituencies. If one were to sit down in a room with elected representatives, the police, teachers and people in the community who work in such areas, problem families who are always in trouble could be identified. The process begins with a mum and dad who are perhaps disfranchised for whatever reason. When that mum and dad have two or three children, the problem gets that much bigger. We need to deal with such problems at the core, because it is no good being reactive&#151;we must be proactive. Some of those families need 24-hour support and the help and encouragement of others to put their lives right. Changing a social worker without allowing representation, which breaks continuity, is unacceptable. We cannot play with youth worker involvement, which should be there as a matter of course. Education has a huge role to play.</p>

All we seem to see is community centres closing for lack of funding, which is not continuity and which disrupts the community. Short-term project funding instead of long-term solutions is not the way forward. The community knows what it needs, and we must consult the community at large to find out what it wants.</p>

 The expansion of Milton Keynes remains one of my constituents&#146; main concerns. I will begin with a partial review of the &#147;South East Plan&#148;, which was published recently. Although we have known for some time that Milton Keynes is expected to absorb some 50,000 dwellings by 2026, it has come as a shock to discover that we are now expected to provide some 5,600 dwellings to the east of the M1.</p>

Rural north Buckinghamshire lies to the east of the M1, and I fear that housing to the east of the M1 will be the thin end of the wedge. Interestingly, the Government always claim that they are keen to consult the local population, but when they did so&#151;albeit briefly&#151;last year, of the six options that were put forward, the one option that included housing to the  <br>

east of the M1 was the least preferred among local residents. Yet again, the consultation was a sham, and the Government have decided not to follow the wishes of local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000550">A connected issue, which I have raised in this House on many occasions, is my campaign for &#147;i before e&#148;, or infrastructure before expansion. If Milton Keynes is to expand, it is vital that the infrastructure is in place. In recent weeks, I have raised my concern in the House that we are some &#163;24 million short of our basic needs allocation for schools. Furthermore, the Government have told us that all our problems will be answered by the innovative Milton Keynes tariff, a system whereby &#163;18,500 will be given towards the Milton Keynes infrastructure for every new house that is built. However, such schemes rely almost entirely on a strong housing industry. During this economic downturn, fewer houses are selling in Milton Keynes, so we are not getting the income from the tariff. In turn, it appears that many of the schemes that we hope to deliver in the next two years&#151;such as the new multi-storey car parks in the city centre&#151;will have to be delayed. The Government put all their eggs in one basket when it came to the delivery of the Milton Keynes infrastructure. Will the Minister consider again how we are to deliver that infrastructure, which is much needed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000551">Connected to that issue is the future of the grid roads in the city. Those who have come to Milton Keynes will be aware that it is one of the few cities in the country that can be crossed in 10 minutes. That is because of our marvellous grid road system. Yes, it is very much designed for the car&#151;that may not be particularly green in the modern age&#151;but it is effective. Yet it appears that the new east and west expansion areas will not have the grid roads and that there will be some sort of hybrid system&#151;a &#147;worse for all&#148; system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80722-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000552">Today, the Leader of the House said that she wanted an e-petition system for Parliament similar to the one for No. 10 Downing street. I tell the Deputy Leader of the House that some of my constituents petitioned No. 10 about saving the grid road system, and were concerned that the reply was so ill informed as to state that Milton Keynes council was the planning authority for the east and west expansion areas. As the hon. Lady may be aware, it is not Milton Keynes council, but Milton Keynes Partnership&#151;the unelected, unaccountable quango&#151;that is the planning authority. Given the lack of research evident in the replies to the petitions to No. 10, what hope is there for the system when it is extended to Parliament?</p>

As a result of the severe overruns on Network Rail engineering works in early July, the Office of Rail Regulation agreed a set of 25 milestones for Network Rail so that progress towards the December delivery could be monitored. That, of course, will affect hon. Members, many of whose constituencies are on the west coast main line. Each of the milestones is vital if we are to meet the December timetable, so if one goes, the whole project will disappear. Yet there will be only two reports on the milestones in the next two months. I would be grateful if the Minister came back to me to explain why there cannot be a monthly progress report to ensure that the services are met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000556">I also want to raise the issue of compensation from train operating companies. In the past, automatic compensation was paid&#151;in cash, directly to affected passengers and season ticket holders&#151;when major disruptions occurred. Such incidents were classified as &#147;void days&#148;. Today there is no such classification; it is left to the individual to claim from the train operating company. It is up to the individual to prove their inconvenience by having to keep detailed records of their potential journey. That is inconvenient to the point of being unworkable, as few passengers have the time or resources to record in detail every problem that they encounter. Under a supposedly simplified system recently announced by the Government, there is no provision for strike-day compensation for season ticket holders. What the individual train operating companies do is up to them and even if alternative transport arrangements are provided, they are often inconvenient and the passenger suffers extra journey time and financial hardship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000557">Although there is no legal requirement, the train operating company can, at its discretion, pay compensation, although of course it invariably chooses not to. Many of my constituents feel that that is unacceptable. Even if compensation is paid, it is now done in vouchers, not cash. Although those vouchers can be used against season ticket renewal at a future date, if the person does not use the train for other journeys, it is months before they can use the vouchers. My constituents are clear about what they would like to be done: for lost days, a return to the old system of automatic cash compensation; for strike days, an automatic refund, the same as for lost days; and for the payment to be in cash, not vouchers.</p>

Although Silverstone is not in my constituency, much motor racing activity is, and it would have a severe impact on my constituency should it move&#151;on the hotel business, for example, because many people going to Silverstone stay in hotels in my area. Although I realise that this is not a matter directly for the Government, the Minister concerned has recently had meetings with Bernie Ecclestone.

We are a significant contributor to the Treasury coffers. Local residents pay a heavy price for economic success in terms of congestion and traffic, but that is not recognised in our funding settlements. As one county councillor said to me, we have double the amount of car usage and half the amount of money.

The first, which does not appear in the review but which I consider incredibly important, is the abolition of prescription charges. We know that they are unfair, and that an inquiry is being carried out at this moment. The Secretary of State for Health told us today that the result would be produced shortly, but he then said that it was some months away. The process has been going on for months and months, which just shows how difficult it is to make any sense out of prescription charges if they remain.</p>

However, they include people with long-term conditions&#151;for instance, young people with cystic fibrosis&#151;who a few years ago would not have survived. One young lady told the Select Committee on Health that she was taking 85 tablets a day. Those with long-term conditions such as Parkinson&#146;s are not exempt, yet those who are lucky enough to have thyroid disease, which is easily put straight, are exempt from charges for every medicine that they might need in the future. The people most affected are working adults whose incomes are just above the income support level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000579">We are told by the Government that abolishing prescription charges would cost &#163;450 million a year. That is a fraction of the national health service budget, and about a quarter of last year&#146;s NHS surplus. However, even if the Government desperately want to find another source of funding, I think that this is one of the occasions on which a tiny hypothecated tax on the super-rich would be borne by everyone concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000583">The third of my seven points is competition. Obligatory reading for everyone involved in it is an article in the <i> Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine </i>by Richard Smith, a recent editor of the <i> BMJ</i>. He has reluctantly come to see that competition may be essential. As I have supported the NHS so intensely throughout my life, it goes against the grain for me to realise that it is like a great big juggernaut or tanker which cannot easily be turned around. Perhaps we must appreciate that there is something in competition, but if we do, we must bear in mind some of the criticisms of the experience in the United States&#151;worded very well&#151;that appeared in the <i> BMJ </i>at the end of last year. The authors observed:</p>
<a name="80722-0015.htm_brev10"><a name="08072274000828"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Extensive research shows that its for-profit health institutions provide inferior care at inflated prices... commercialisation drives up costs by diverting money to profits and fuelling growth in management and financial bureaucracy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000584">The <i> New England Journal of Medicine</i> said in January this year:</p>
<a name="80722-0015.htm_brev11"><a name="08072274000829"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The extreme failure of the United States to contain medical costs results primarily from our unique, pervasive commercialization.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000585">If there is to be competition in the NHS, it must be regulated. That means a fair and level playing field, open to NHS providers as well as non-NHS consortiums. An example of unfairness is where out-of-hours care is put to tender, but where there is no definition of how the service is to be provided, so that the non-NHS providers can come in with a reduced skill mix and thus offer it more cheaply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000586">Fourthly, all providers&#151;hospitals, GP conglomerates and mental health providers&#151;should be able to go for foundation trust status, because it means that they can engage with Members, keep their surpluses and, by so doing, have money for quality awards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000587">Fifthly, we should accelerate the work of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, as recommended by Darzi. That would be part of the answer to co-payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08072274000588">Sixthly, patient and public involvement in commissioning is crucial. We have to strengthen local involvement networks and overview and scrutiny committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para31"><a name="08072274000589">My final point is about health care rationing&#151;we are scarcely allowed to use the term; we have to use &#147;prioritisation&#148; instead&#151;which is essential. I quote again from <i> The Journal of The Royal Society of Medicine</i>:</p>
<a name="80722-0015.htm_brev12"><a name="08072274000830"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The final recurring theme, present throughout the last 60 years and no doubt into the next 60, is the thorny question of rationing health care...The future of rationing health care will provide a key battleground for the NHS.&#148;</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will seek to honour what you have just said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para32"><a name="08072274000593">As the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) said, we have had a tour of Britain. We have heard a lot about the different experiences in England and Wales, and I should now like to draw Scotland into that picture, too. There is a theme linking many of this afternoon&#146;s speeches, which is essentially that the Government are failing in particular areas. That is generally the case in rural Britain and, as I see it, particularly so in my constituency. Some key decisions will be made over the summer by the Government and the agencies acting on their behalf. Currently, I fear that they will make the wrong kinds of decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para33"><a name="08072274000594">One issue is that the Government are failing to understand the realities of rural Britain and the extra pressures of the increases in the cost of living, particularly in fuel and, as was mentioned earlier, the changes to vehicle excise duty. Local businesses in my constituency, whether in the fishing communities or the textile industry in Hawick or elsewhere, are struggling with the extra costs that have been imposed on them in the past few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para34"><a name="08072274000595">Like many others who have spoken, I face the prospect of post office closures in my constituency being announced in a few weeks. There are 3,500 pensioners who go to post offices each week to get their pensions and 3,500 other people who collect their benefits there. They depend on a network of post offices spread across the vast, beautiful constituency that I represent. I rather fear that, as others have said, the criteria are not designed to ensure that we get a sustainable network that services the local community in the way required. Thousands of my constituents have signed postcards, and thousands have also signed the sub-postmasters&#146; campaign on the Post Office card account. I hope that the Government will hear what has been said throughout the country about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80722-0015.htm_para35"><a name="08072274000596">A related matter is puzzling for many of my constituents and must be dealt with&#151;the issue of the Royal Mail and its address database. A number of communities in Berwickshire&#151;for example, the villages of Foulden, Hutton, Paxton, Lamberton and Mordington&#151;have a Berwick-upon-Tweed postcode. I have no wish to cast aspersions on the good people of Berwick-upon-Tweed, but my constituents are very firmly in Scotland, even though they have an English postal address. It can be plain irritating for the people concerned, but it can also have serious consequences for official documentation about which country they live in, for example. It can affect insurance premiums in areas where small villages are linked to nearby towns and it can also affect deliveries to those areas. A community such as Fountainhall, a full 15 miles from Galashiels, has a Galashiels postal address, which can cause utter confusion, particularly when people try to buy or sell a house. The Royal Mail has frankly refused to accept that it has any responsibilities in this matter. It has refused to accept that the commercial database that it sells has consequences for people such as my constituents, who are the consumers in this case. I hope that the Government will look further into this issue and force the Royal Mail to rethink.</p>

of the poor mobile phone coverage in the area or of the fact that pay phones are often the emergency lifeline for these communities, so I hope that we will see a rethink of plans to close the 46 such phones selected for closure, which represent 27 per cent. of the unprofitable boxes in my constituency&#151;a higher proportion than in just about any other part of Scotland.</p>

I have raised many issues about this matter in the past, but I want to refocus the Government&#146;s minds on &#147;Freeview Lite&#148; and the fact that anyone served by a relay transmitter will get a second-class service with far fewer channels, whether it be on the TV or the radio. With my area having 11 relay stations, almost half my constituents, through no fault of their own, will get that second-class service. If we combine that with doubts about the future of ITV regional news and concerns about the allocation of the digital dividend from the switchover process, we see that very serious problems surround the entire digital switchover process, and the Government need to address them&#151;urgently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000599">One issue causing great anxiety and anger among farmers in my constituency is the proposal to introduce electronic identification tags for sheep, which is going to be compulsory by the end of 2009. We all understand why biosecurity and disease control are uppermost in our minds and we understand the need to follow through the food chain and ensure proper traceability, but one size cannot fit all. With the farming community comprising many different farms with more than 1,000 ewes across the beautiful hills of my constituency, it is simply not practical to implement those proposals. We need a risk-based approach that will be affordable, proportionate and cost-effective for all concerned. A batch recording system would offer us such a scheme, and I am appalled that so far nobody has been able to take it up and accept it. I hope that the Minister will support a feasibility study and a Scottish trial to ensure that we see off the nonsense of the current proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000600">Finally, I want to say a few words about the future of the Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs offices in my constituency. So far, we have heard very little detail about the costs that the Government plan to save. I have tabled parliamentary questions and I hope that I will get a response to them. We are in danger of losing high-quality jobs in an area that can ill afford to lose them. It is time for the Government to look hard again at what they are proposing. I hope that they will do so and send out a signal that they understand rural areas.</p>

 Many comments from hon. Members of all parties have been about the Post Office card account, and I will discuss the Post Office&#146;s future shortly. However, since Christmas, a couple of events have taken place in my constituency that I would like to bring to the House&#146;s attention. On the Dexion front, 700 of my constituents had their pensions stolen from them five years ago. After five years of campaigning, before I was a Member of Parliament and subsequently, with all those people sticking together, trying to get justice for themselves, the Government eventually introduced a compensation package, which would have given my constituents 80 per cent. of the  <br>

pensions that were stolen from them. We did not accept that&#151;we stood our ground and got 90 per cent. Those payments have started to be made in the past few weeks. That proves to me that, if a community sticks together, no matter how big the organisation against which it is fighting, it can win.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000602">Those who drive through my constituency often get stuck because of roadworks on the M1 between junctions 6 and 10. Those works will be finished at Christmas and the widening of the road will open up Hemel Hempstead to much more retail use and many more businesses on the industrial estates. Sadly, the Government appear to have shelved the road widening from junctions 10 to 13, so my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), who was here a few moments ago, will still get stuck because the Government have shelved the plans north of Luton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000603">On a sad note, like many hon. Members, I have been inundated with concerns from my constituents in the rural and urban parts of my constituency about the closure of three post offices. The craziest aspect of the post office closures is the way in which they affect the most affluent and the poorest parts of our constituencies. Most people in the village of Potten End in my constituency would agree that it is a fairly affluent community, but it survives with one shop, with one post office inside it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08102372000001">Another part of my constituency, the Heights is, according to Government figures, one of the most socially deprived wards in the country, with the highest unemployment and economic inactivity in my constituency. It also has the most pensioners in my constituency. Believe it or not, that post office, too, is closing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08102372000002">When the Post Office explained to me that the closures had to go ahead, I asked, &#147;If my constituents fight, fill in petitions, send letters and contact the head of the Post Office, what difference will it make?&#148; The reply was, &#147;We can&#146;t tell you. We&#146;re in consultation.&#148; I then simply asked what percentage of consultations were successful. Let us all be honest with our constituents&#151;on what percentage of the consultations does the Post Office back off? The answer is 4 per cent. Ninety-six per cent. of proposed post office closures in this country go ahead. Let us be honest: the Government have made a decision and created an economic environment in the post office network that makes post offices not viable&#151;I intended to use another word, but it was inappropriate for the Chamber. They are not viable if business keeps being taken away from them and we do not let them sell the products for which our constituents prefer to use the post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000604">The other sad situation that continues is that of Hemel Hempstead hospital. Other hon. Members have also expressed concern about the future of their hospitals. The hospital is not Victorian, not falling down&#151;it was built in the 1970s&#151;and has been expanded over the years. Other hospitals in the Hemel Hempstead area have closed to join the central site, which is close to the M1 and the M25. A decision was made to close acute services there&#151;the elective surgery would go to St. Albans and acute services would go to Watford. We fought that decision and delayed it; we fought it again and delayed it again. However, on the very day of the wonderful service in Westminster abbey to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS, while I was in the queue to go through security, I took a call from the chief executive of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, who told  <br>

me that, in the first week in March, Hemel Hempstead&#146;s acute services will close and be moved to Watford. For those who do not know where Watford hospital is, it is smack bang next to Watford football stadium. If Watford play at home&#151;I wish the team every success; many of my constituents are Watford fans&#151;they get a reasonable crowd and there is traffic chaos. An extra burden will be created because the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in St. Albans is to close. How on earth are two huge towns such as Watford and Hemel Hempstead, as well as St. Albans, to cope? We will fight the decision. We will not lie down and roll over. There will be another huge demonstration in my constituency in the autumn, when my constituents will again show that they do not want to lose their acute hospital. We do not want a polyclinic to replace an acute general hospital&#151;indeed, we do not want a polyclinic at all. Our surgeries are vibrant and well served. None of the lists of any of the surgeries in the town are full, yet we will have a polyclinic in the middle of it imposed on us, with a catchment and list of about 8,000. That means that some of my surgeries will suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000605">Finally, let me return to football. Sport has been talked about a lot today. Many of the people in the northern part of my constituency support Luton Town football club. It is a wonderfully historic club, but it is going through some particularly difficult times on the pitch, which have been exacerbated by poor management and the attitude of the Football League to a small club such as Luton Town. It will go into the season with a 30-point deduction. It will not survive that, so it will go out of the football league and into the conference. For any team in the country, a 30-point reduction would lead to relegation. For Luton Town, it will mean the end of league status. I do not believe that if Luton Town were Liverpool, Arsenal or any other premiership club, this would have been done to it. It has been done to it because it is a small club in a small community, and it has been hammered by the bureaucrats who want to set an example. They would not have done that to Arsenal, Liverpool or Manchester United; they should not be doing it to Luton Town.</p>

 Before the House adjourns for the summer recess, I wish to raise a number of points, but I promise colleagues I shall do so briefly.

On 4 July, the chief executive of New Forest district council, Dave Yates, wrote me a friendly letter in his capacity as electoral registration officer, saying that he wanted me to reconsider my practice of doing that, which had recently come to his attention. That was because the arrangement I had made to do that every year since 1996 had been superseded 12 months ago, by a new system of anonymous registration  <br>

that needed to be counter-signed by a chief constable. As soon as Mr. Yates supplied me with the new form, I completed it and obtained the necessary signature, and I am now anonymously registered for the next five years&#151;although it turns out that I may have been wasting my time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000615">I asked Mr. Yates whether I was correct in thinking that the matter had been raised with him by Terry Scriven, a retired colonel in the military police who will be standing against me at the next election, and he confirmed that that was so. Mr. Scriven could easily have asked me openly about this matter, but he is the sort of individual whom, unfortunately, one encounters from time to time in public life&#151;the sort of person who smears one in the papers but rushes to shake one&#146;s hand when one meets him. He insinuates wrongdoing without having the guts openly to accuse one. His political party is irrelevant to this sort of behaviour, which I have experienced on a number of previous occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000616">Dave Yates saw no reason to deny that Mr. Scriven had e-mailed him about my registration arrangements, and eventually I was sent the relevant exchanges. The first e-mail was headed</p>

The chief executive replied&#151;I believe that he did so on 11 July&#151;confirming that I had been registered under the nom de plume by arrangement with the previous electoral registration officer for reasons of personal security, but that, as the law had changed last year, I would be using the new system in future. Mr. Scriven said that he accepted that, and that should have been the end of the matter.</p>

The journalist was none other than Ben Leapman of <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>&#151;the only participant in the freedom of information court case who had demanded the publication of all MPs&#146; home addresses in order to check that we are not fiddling our expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80722-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000619">I fully accept that a newspaper is perfectly at liberty to employ any journalist it likes, although the choice of Mr. Leapman by <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> has a certain incongruity; it gives me the sort of feeling that Labour Members would have if <i> The Guardian</i> took on my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) or my hon. Friend, as I call him, the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) as its European Union correspondent. Unfortunately, apart from employing an anti-Conservative activist as a political journalist,<i>  The Sunday Telegraph</i> has bought into his reckless campaign to expose MPs&#146; addresses and has done everything it can to attack me and suppress the arguments against this.</p>

However, he did not do that, and I handed him a very short letter which asked him to state, without further prevarication, direct answers to those two questions. He took the envelope and headed at high speed to the nearest gentlemen&#146;s toilet, where he remained for several minutes. It is conceivable that he did not open the envelope there, but I find that hard to believe. Nevertheless he still did not answer the questions.</p>

I have checked with the council, and no such information request was made. I therefore have to rely on <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> to tell me whether Ben Leapman is now in possession of my private home address, which is quite properly anonymously registered, irrespective of whether the e-mail correspondence was supplied to him by Terry Scriven, phantom FOI requesters, Father Christmas or little green men from Mars.</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="08072274000628"><a name="80722-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="08072274001145"><b>Sarah Teather (Brent, East) (LD):</b>
 Two and a half months ago, a man was stabbed to death at the end of my street. Michael Mann, who was in his early 40s, was killed by a single stab wound in front of his partner, Natasha, and their six-month-old baby, leaving a bewildered family to try to pick up the pieces. The trauma of that experience was exacerbated considerably by the complete incompetence of Natasha&#146;s housing association, PCHA, which refused to take her request for rehousing seriously, despite the fact that it was her neighbours from an adjacent flat who were arrested for the murder and then bailed. Sadly, that is an all too common experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000629">Michael Mann&#146;s murder brought to a close a period of relative calm in Brent. We had begun to think that we had turned a corner after several years of high-profile gun and knife crime fatalities. The most famous and shocking was the killing of the child Toni-Ann Byfield in 2003. It is seared in my memory because she was murdered just days before the by-election in Brent, East, and the front pages of the newspapers that told the story of my victory also carried photographs of children carrying candles in a vigil outside the house in which she was killed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000630">Things had seemed a little better until May this year, when three people were killed in the space of just a week. The toll now stands at two fatal gun attacks and two fatal stabbings. The headlines have all been about young people and gangs, but the fatalities in Brent this year have been adults, mostly killed by other adults, with causes ranging from domestic violence to neighbour disputes. It is a complex picture and we need to be careful not to make too great a generalisation about the causes. There is no doubt that the fatalities of adults have masked many other incidents involving young people, which are often not reported to the police because of fear or because of a lack of belief in the police&#146;s ability to tackle the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000631">Policy Exchange&#146;s recent report, &#147;Going Ballistic&#148;, said that only one in four young offenders thought that the police could protect them from crime. More shockingly, two thirds of those who thought that the police could not protect them had previously been threatened with a knife, so there is often a cycle. Perhaps the greatest challenge in tackling knife crime is tackling the fear that everybody else is carrying a knife. It is important to put on the record that a recent random search of 300 young people at a school in Brent found that none of those children was carrying a knife. The concern about knife crime, which is rightly expressed, often fuels that fear in young people and means that they think that they will  <br>

be safe only if they all carry a knife. There is a desperate need to tackle that problem, perhaps with better and closer relationships on a ward level between community police and young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000632">Research on gun crime in Brent has turned up a similarly complex picture. The council commissioned research that was published in 2005, and is going on to commission further work that looks at the causes of gun crime in Brent. The 2005 research contradicted many of the stereotypes. It found that gun crime was not just a problem of one ethnic group against another, and neither was it about drugs. It is not necessarily directly related to gangs. We have had gang problems in Brent, but the research shows that the incidence of gun crime is not always related to gang crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000633">As Policy Exchange found, the distinction between victims and offenders is often blurred. The Brent study found that all those people who offended with guns have been victims of crime. Most had been victims of gun crime and half had had family or friends who were directly affected. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the research and the most common feature between offenders was a hyper-material culture and attachment to overt wealth. There is a bit of a moral parable about what happens when someone values things that they can see rather than things that are about them as an individual. When that is coupled with a fear of violence, it is easy to see how people can get into a cycle where life is cheap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000634">We have many ongoing projects in Brent that work through the umbrella project, Not Another Drop. I want to highlight one particular project, which targets young people who are thought to be at risk of or on the cusp of being involved in serious violence. It is called In-volve RAW and focuses on young people in the south Kilburn area of my constituency and in Harlesden and Stonebridge in neighbouring areas, as well as the Harrow road corridor that runs between those two areas. It focuses on raising self-esteem and trying to tackle the problem caused when people&#146;s sense of value is about overt wealth rather than themselves. The project tries to reverse negative self-images and, in particular, tries to help young people to deal with anger and a sense of hopelessness. It is an interesting project that I hope that the Government will look at carefully and consider replicating in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000635">Finally, I want to mention the fact that that project, along with many other projects in Brent, suffers from a lack of consistent and stable funding. It is difficult for the council and other community organisations to plan the funding of good projects in Brent when initiatives and priorities constantly change. I have one plea for the Government: will they consider a more stable way of funding this difficult work with difficult communities, who need long-term work in order to build up trust?</p>

Bill two years ago and feel predisposed to make comments, which are not party political in nature, on it. I invite the House and the Deputy Leader of the House, through her Ministers, to review what actions are needed to ensure that the provisions laid down to deal with failing schools can be used with greater alacrity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000637">My concern is for some of my constituents&#146; children who have been adversely affected as a consequence of an ineffectual head teacher, a weak and compliant governing body and a local education authority that was willing to act but was circumscribed by legislation. The school to which I refer is St. John Fisher school, a Roman Catholic voluntary secondary school in Peterborough. It is a mixed school of 744 pupils and, until quite recently, it was one of the highest performing schools in the Peterborough local education authority area. The school operates within the Roman Catholic diocese of East Anglia and, in particular, within the diocesan board of education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000638">From 1999 until 17 July this year, the school&#146;s head was Mary Mihovilovic. She resigned last week for personal reasons, and this week signed a compromise agreement. Significant problems were identified at the school, particularly in regard to the management of the school and the quality of the education, as long ago as 2004, when a warning notice was issued by the local education authority as a result of a serious breakdown in the way the school was managed and governed, which was seen as likely to prejudice future standards of performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08072274000639">The initial warning in that year was subsequently rescinded. It was clear, however, that things were not improving. In the past four years, results have plummeted, the school has had difficulty in attracting and retaining newly qualified teachers, and the head teacher was the only head teacher in the country who refused to take part in the excellence clusters programme. Trade unions surveyed the staff, and the results that were presented to the governing body showed a culture of centralised control, bullying and intimidation. This was routinely dismissed by the governing body as an attack on the head.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08072274000640">The senior management team refused to communicate with outside bodies such as the diocesan board, the LEA and Cambridgeshire constabulary. &#147;Difficult&#148; governors were removed, and teachers who would not co-operate with the head were asked to resign or made redundant. There were questions about the appropriateness of having a personal friend of the head as the chair of the governors. It has emerged only in the last few months that the governing body actually voted for a &#163;20,000 fund for legal fees to enable the head to send legal letters to people who fell foul of her, including some on the LEA and the diocesan board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08072274000641">Matters reached a head in late 2007, when the governing body removed an LEA governor, Councillor Stephen Goldspink&#151;who also happened to be the deputy leader of the city council, and who was attending an extraordinary meeting of Peterborough city council at the time&#151;for having the temerity to complain about the inconvenience to his constituents of inconsiderate parking by some parents at the school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000642">This year, it has been confirmed that the school is now on the infamous list of 638 failing schools, having fallen below the target floor.

standards, the effectiveness and function of the governing body, staffing issues and a lack of willingness to engage with external partners and stakeholders. A section 8 inspection by Ofsted in April resulted in one of the worst inspection reports for any secondary school in the Peterborough local education authority area, the school being rated inadequate in 19 out of 26 categories. On 5 June 2008, the school was put into special measures under section 13 of the Education Act 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000643">The key question now is how will the present legislation, Ofsted and the Department for Children, Schools and Families be able to deal with a rogue governing body and a head teacher who refused to acknowledge or engage with statutory bodies, and who used delay, obfuscation and the appeal process for more than six months, which is more than half the school year? That is the problem that we face. Lessons need to be learned, particularly in regard to the role of the diocesan board, which had no statutory powers to intervene, and to the process of appeals against the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000644">Thankfully, the school now has a new head, Mr. Sean Hayes, formerly the head of St. Alban&#146;s school in Ipswich, and a new interim independent executive board.

 Order. The hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member of this House and he knows exactly how we operate. It is unfortunate that people who have been here all day sometimes do not get called, but there is nothing that the Chair can do about it other than to exhort Members to take a little less time when they speak. Now we are only taking time out of what remains. I call Shailesh Vara.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000653">The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd) made a very conscientious speech, and not for the first time he spoke about the local transport situation affecting his constituents. Resolving those problems will not be easy, but I certainly wish him well in all his efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000654">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) spoke for most if not all hon. Members when he rightly welcomed the moves being taken towards achieving some sort of peace settlement in Zimbabwe. However, given President Mugabe&#146;s record in these matters, we must recognise that these are only talks. We must maintain the pressure on Mugabe and his regime, as we will be able to have a sense of rejoicing only when an actual result has been achieved. I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome the involvement of South Africa&#146;s President Mbeki, who I very much hope will use his considerable influence in other parts of Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000655">The hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) gave a very knowledgeable speech, in which he raised some issues concerning United Utilities. He said that he wrote to United Utilities three times before he got a reply, and that he is still waiting for a reply from the Minister. However, if the past record of ministerial responses is anything to go by, even when he gets a reply from the Minister he will probably need a lot more than three supplementary letters before he gets a substantive response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08072274000656">My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) gave a very serious speech about the data stored by paedophiles. He has spoken about the problem before, and he has considerable expertise and knowledge about it. All of us in the House wish him well in his endeavours to ensure greater protection for children and families who are victims of paedophiles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000657">The hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) spoke up for catering staff at Airedale hospital trust. I very much hope that the decision due to be taken on Thursday is the right one for all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000658">A number of hon. Members raised the very real issue that affects constituencies around the country: the closure of post offices. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), as well as my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) all described how the closure of local post offices was ripping the very heart out of their communities. I think that we all share their concerns&#151;I certainly do, as I was informed only some two weeks ago that five post offices in my constituency were to be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000659">On the theme of post offices, the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) gave a heartfelt speech about the Post Office card account. Like him, we have all received hundreds if not thousands of letters from constituents urging that the Post Office card account be retained, and that demonstrates the enormous strength of feeling among the public on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000660">The right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) gave a typically eloquent speech. He talked about a consultation on alcohol and its relation to crime; I look forward to its conclusions. I hope that the Government will take on board the good points raised in the consultation, although their usual practice is to kick matters into the long grass by announcing another review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000662">The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) gave an appropriate speech, given recent sport activities. During the recess, he may well receive hundreds of letters from cricket fans who welcome his plea that cricket be made available on free-to-air TV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000663">About midway through the debate, we heard a light-hearted, humorous speech by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson); it came at just the right time. However, he had a serious message to convey about the A11. I am sure that the changes that he proposed will not easily be agreed to, but I have no doubt that he will continue to fight for them in his usual way.</p>

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) raised some very serious points about information, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act 2000, on Heathrow airport and BAA. I suspect that the issue will run for a while yet, and that we have not heard the last of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000665">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) is a veteran of these Adjournment debates. I trust that the Deputy Leader of the House will pass on to the relevant Minister in the Department for Transport  the hon. Lady&#146;s concern about the concrete surface of the A180, which is being replaced on only one carriageway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000666">It is vital that when cities and towns consider expansion, they do not overlook the growth of infrastructure. That was rightly pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), when he spoke of expansion in his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para30"><a name="08072274000667">On the subject of expansion, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) spoke of the inconsistency of the south-east plan, which threatens the green belt, despite statements having been made by the Prime Minister in the House urging protection of the green belt. My hon. Friend asked the Deputy Leader of the House a simple question about how to square the Prime Minister&#146;s statement with the reality, and I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will give her a reasonable, straightforward answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para31"><a name="08072274000668">In the past three years, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) has demonstrated how robustly he defends the rights of his constituents, as regards their local hospital. He has fought hard for that hospital, and I have every confidence that he will continue his campaign to save it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para32"><a name="08072274000669">In a succinct speech, the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) raised a huge number of points and demonstrated his expertise on health matters. I very much hope that Health Ministers will find time during the recess to consider some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80722-0017.htm_para33"><a name="08072274000670">The hon.

 It is always a pleasure to take part in the pre-recess Adjournment debate and to follow the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara). When I was a child I never really understood the meaning of the phrase &#147;The show isn&#146;t over until the fat lady sings&#148;, but I think I understand it now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000677">The debate was opened by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd), who talked about the rail connections from his constituency to central London. It is fortunate that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris), is here to note that that matter needs to be looked into.</p>

He may be aware that Zimbabwe will be on the agenda in Europe next Tuesday. He may also be aware that the President of Cyprus and the President of North Cyprus will be meeting on 25 July to have talks. I am sure that he is also aware that Lord Malloch-Brown has recently been in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000679">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of knife crime, which has been very much in people&#146;s minds because of some horrific deaths recently, particularly, but not only, in London. Those points were echoed by the hon. Members for Bosworth (David Tredinnick) and for Brent, East (Sarah Teather). It is interesting that that was a focus for London Members, because it is clearly a problem in London and the big cities. The hon. Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey and for Brent, East asked about funding for young people&#146;s centres  <br>

He talked also about the unfair pricing of utilities, particularly with regard to churches. My understanding is that the Secretary of State put out guidance on this in 2000 and churches are supposed to benefit from lower charges. He talked about NHS Logistics and the position of the workers there. My understanding is that there is to be a ballot on the point raised by my hon. Friend.</p>

He raised the question of whether the penalties under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 were adequate. I will convey the urgency of the matter to my colleagues in the relevant Departments.</p>

She talked about the need for more investment in the Airedale general hospital, in particular the need for investment in kitchens and the canteen. My understanding is that the Minister of State will have a meeting with my hon. Friend to discuss this matter, although in the first instance this is a matter for the local trust board.</p>

Since I share a boundary with him, I am deeply sympathetic to what he was saying. He talked about the performance of the Northwest Regional Development Agency. I commend to the right hon. Gentleman the new regional Select Committees that will be set up, as I do to the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton) who talked about the regional spatial strategy in her area. Those Select Committees will provide hon. Members with opportunities to examine the performance of regional bodies.</p>

 As this is the only parliamentary opportunity between the start of the consultation on post office closures in Cornwall and the closures at the end of the programme in September, will the Deputy Leader of the House take to her ministerial colleagues the utter despair of my constituents, particularly in the area around Bude, where six post offices are closing in a very rural area? I hope that she will convey my constituents&#146; dismay that the programme is being conducted in the summer, when there will not be adequate scrutiny.</p>

He raised the administrative problems, but he forgot to remind the House that 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty through child tax credits. Although the rate of error and fraud is too high at 7.5 per cent., it is much lower than the 13 per cent. rate that we inherited from the previous Administration on jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000705">The first recommendation related to clause 60(1), which in turn relates to the power of the Secretary of State to devolve functions to the London government. As the Committee noted, clause 60(1) confers what is, in effect, a Henry VIII power to modify references in the Act to the Secretary of State to references to the Greater London authority, Transport for London, or both, and to make consequential provision that may include modifying the Crossrail Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08072274000706">The second and third recommendations both related to secondary legislation that makes provision about arbitration. Clause 20 modifies the operation of sections 60 and 61 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, so that appeals relating to noise emanating from construction sites are determined by the Secretary of State or&#151;if the parties agree&#151;by arbitration, rather than by a magistrates court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000707">Clause 20(4) enables the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, acting jointly, to make regulations about the procedure in relation to such arbitrations. Such regulations would be made by a statutory instrument not currently subject to a parliamentary procedure by virtue of the Bill. Clause 63 makes provision for the arbitration of disputes under the Act, unless otherwise provided for, such as in the example that I have just mentioned. Subsection (5) enables the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Transport, acting jointly, to make rules about the arbitration by procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000708">Those rules will be made by a statutory instrument that is not currently subject to a parliamentary procedure in accordance with the Bill. The Committee recommended that since one or other of the Secretaries of State might be a party to an arbitration arising from the Bill, arbitration rules made under clause 20 or clause 63 should be subject to the negative resolution parliamentary procedure. Having carefully considered the report, the Government agreed with what the Committee proposed in each case.</p>

 This is a large group of amendments concerning the railway matters in the Bill, and it will take me a few minutes to explain them. The majority complete actions that were promised during the Commons stages of the Bill. The dozen clauses 23 to 34 were included in the Bill as reserve powers to ensure, principally through overriding duties on the Office of Rail Regulation, that Crossrail can be built and Crossrail services can operate. In parallel with the Bill process, the Department for Transport has negotiated an access option with Network Rail to grant the necessary access rights for Crossrail services so as to provide essential security on which to base investment in the Crossrail project. Following industry-wide consultation, including holding a hearing, the ORR issued its decision on 14 April this year to approve the access option with modifications. Yesterday, the ORR gave its formal directions under the Railways Act 1993, which marks the completion of the legal documentation for the access option. As a result, the reserve powers in the Bill can now be deleted as proposed in amendments Nos. 5 to 16.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08072274000714">Two new clauses are proposed under amendments No. 3 and 4. Amendment No. 3 includes an additional objective of facilitating the construction of Crossrail in the ORR&#146;s list of objectives in section 4(1) of the Railways Act 1993. This does not direct the ORR on how it should meet that new objective. That is for its judgment as the independent rail regulator in the circumstances at the time, balancing all its section 4(1)  <br>

objectives. The provision is precedented by section 17 of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08072274000715">Amendment No. 4 requires the ORR to produce a report on what it has done, or proposes to do, to meet its new Crossrail construction-related objective and on how it has exercised, or proposes to exercise, any of its functions in relation to the operation of Crossrail services. That is to aid transparency, given that the ORR, in reaching decisions that take account of all relevant interests, is important to the successful delivery of the Crossrail project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08072274000716">Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 20 relate to clause 35. The clause disapplies the prohibition in the Railways Act 1993 on a public sector operator acting as a franchisee, which provides flexibility to accommodate a potentially public sector franchisee of Crossrail passenger services if that is considered desirable. It might, for example, be in the period when Crossrail services are being phased in, during which it could be challenging to let a conventional private sector franchise. Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 20 extend that flexibility in two respects in order to ease the construction of Crossrail and the bringing into operation of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para31"><a name="08072274000717">Amendment No. 17 enables ancillary or complementary services to be included within a Crossrail public sector franchise. That is to aid franchise mapping, so as to avoid services closely related to Crossrail services becoming orphans, as it were, because they do not logically fit into another group of services that are franchised. Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 provide for a public sector franchise for services that are likely to suffer substantial disruption because of the construction of Crossrail. Better value for money may be achieved by managing certain suburban services as part of project delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para32"><a name="08072274000718">Amendments Nos. 21 to 24 deal with another matter. This is not so much a change in policy, but a modification to the legal route by which this is delivered. The background is that the Railways (London Regional Transport) (Exemptions) Order 1994 exempts the London underground network from regulation under the Railways Act 1993. Unless we can amend that order, there might be unintended exemptions or applications of regulations relating to the Crossrail tunnels or their interchanges with relevant London underground stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para33"><a name="08072274000719">We looked again at the powers that the Secretary of State already enjoys under the 1993 Act, and we concluded that we would be able to amend the order under them. Given that it is reasonably likely that we will use powers under the 1993 Act in any event, it will be simpler and clearer to rely solely on those powers rather than have specific provisions for amendment in clause 36. It is a different means to the same end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80722-0018.htm_para34"><a name="08072274000720">Finally, amendment No. 26 relates to clause 40. This clause is based on a provision contained in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996, and provides an obligation to co-operate between the nominated undertaker and controllers of railway assets with which Crossrail construction, maintenance or operation interact. The asset controllers in question include London Underground and the public private partnerships, BAA, and Network Rail. Either party can require the other party to enter into an agreement, and if this cannot be reached, it is referred to arbitration, for which clauses 41 and 42 establish the arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08072274000721">Amendment No. 26 ensures that clause 40 cannot be used in circumstances where the matter may be dealt with by the Office of Rail Regulation&#151;in effect, requiring a solution to be reached under the aegis of the normal regulatory processes. Amendments Nos. 19, 20, 25, 29 and 31 are consequential.</p>

<p><a name="st_o257"><a name="08072274000722"><a name="80722-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="08072274001164"><b>Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon) (Con):</b>
 First, may I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for making available advance copies of the explanatory notes? I would like to take the opportunity to say how much we welcome the written statement of 14 July on the subject of publishing financial data in relation to Crossrail. He will be well aware that during all stages of the Bill&#146;s progress, I have been urging him to accept one of my well-worded amendments. It would have required the Government to publish an annual statement setting out that financial data. Although we are upset that he did not feel able to accept that amendment, we are pleased to see that the Bill will include such a provision. It is always good to see the Government adopting excellent ideas, and I thank him for his assurances in that statement on that part of the Crossrail project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000723">This group of amendments will do some quite important things, in that it will do away with the previous clauses 23 and 24 and replace them with new clauses. Those clauses, which the Lords now seek to amend, were the subject of some lengthy discussions in Committee. They dealt with the so-called &#147;interim period&#148;, which is the time between the granting of Royal Assent to the Bill, which I guess is not far off now, and the day on which passenger services commence on Crossrail. During that so-called &#147;interim period&#148;, the Office of Rail Regulation was to have an &#147;overriding&#148; duty to exercise its access contract functions in such a way to facilitate the operation of Crossrail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000724">The idea of an overriding duty was a principle that we were willing to accept&#151;after all, it had a precedent in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act of 1996. However, of great concern to us was the fact that the &#147;interim period&#148; was ill-defined and could be subject to unnecessary extension. Our fears were compounded when we saw the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary Provisions) Bill recently, which did indeed extend the interim period for High Speed 1 beyond the construction phase. We were concerned about the &#147;interim period&#148; being turned into an &#147;indefinite period&#148;. The amendment will remove those clauses, and give us a definite time scale. The new clauses proposed by the Lords in the amendment will be welcomed by my party. The powers in question were merely reserve powers that the Government intended to use only if normal industry procedures were not possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000725">This time last year, the Government and Network Rail applied to the ORR for access rights for Crossrail on the existing network, and the ORR approved this access option on 14 April. With that agreement in place, there is no longer the need for Network Rail to be told when and where to enter into access agreements, and the operator of Crossrail will no longer have superior access rights to other operators, which is to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000726">I would like the Minister to clarify the purpose of the first amendment in the group, which inserts a new, but not overriding, objective into the remit of the ORR, namely the facilitation of the construction of Crossrail.

 The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State and London Government can give an unqualified commitment at the start of the Crossrail project in relation to a potential future transfer of assets between Transport for London and the Secretary of State. Governance arrangements for the project currently allow that if the forecast final cost breaches an agreed level, the Department has the right to take back control of the project, including ownership of CLRL&#151;Cross London Rail Links&#151;and, indirectly, assets of Crossrail. However, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 provides that, at any given time, Transport for London should follow the direction of the Mayor in the exercise of its functions and that the Secretary of State must consent to the disposal of assets by TfL.</p>

 I am grateful to have the opportunity to present a 15,000-signature petition on an issue that has caused enormous concern and anxiety among people living in the broads area of my constituency. A leaked report from Natural England raised the possibility of an area of 25 sq m that includes six villages being lost to the North sea as a result of rising sea levels. One can imagine the concern that that caused and the immediate impact that it had on house prices and people&#146;s everyday lives.</p>

 I present this petition on behalf of more than 2,000 residents in Basingstoke, who are increasingly concerned about the levels of noise and traffic congestion connected with the M3, particularly around junctions 5 to 7. Over the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in traffic on the motorway, which means that more local residents are affected by more noise and excessive tailbacks on the motorway at peak times. As a result, some areas in my constituency, particularly the villages and suburbs around Basingstoke, are experiencing quite significant increases in rat-running. Hence, the petitioners request the House to urge the Government to stop the delay and install noise-reducing road surfaces on all six lanes of the M3 and to put in place improvements to junction 6 that will ease the traffic flow at peak times, as it is affecting not just residents but major employers in the Basingstoke area. This amounts to much-needed investment to fill a yawning infrastructure gap created by an ever-increasing level of house building demanded by the Government in Basingstoke and in the south-east more generally.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a small issue that is of deep concern to many people in my constituency. I would like to thank the Minister, especially as she is the last Minister to be standing, as it were, in the pre-recess period. I do not envy her; I have been in the same position before, and I hope that she has recovered from the shock of having to respond to this debate. I also hope that she will be sweetness and light, to the benefit of my constituents. What I am really asking is for the Minister to show a little understanding and perhaps some flexibility in her Department&#146;s thinking. As she will be aware, nationally applied rigidity can be damaging. I hope that she will listen gently and, as I have done several times, set aside her official speech and concentrate on the little bits and pieces that I raise in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08072274000768">To provide a bit of background, Mole Valley is the largest Surrey constituency; it is very different from the Minister&#146;s deep urban seat. Having been a local councillor in a solid London inner-city borough, I have some idea of the problems she has to face in her Bristol constituency with tower blocks, unemployment, health conditions and so on and so forth. My constituency is, as I said, very different. It has two small towns and approximately 32 to 33 villages, so it is rural and semi-rural. Some of the villages are large, most are small. The gaps between villages are often considerable green farming areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08072274000769">Transport is predominately by private car and there is very little in the way of bus services; most of the trains are on radial lines running into London and are often inappropriate. As the Minister may know from the package of departmental information given her about the population, a considerable proportion of people in the area are elderly and most of those do not drive or are very nervous of driving; they are certainly very nervous of driving and parking in the towns. In addition, there are many young families with children, especially farming families. That explains the relatively large number of village schools and, until recently, village shops and post offices, as well as village halls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08072274000770">Surrey is perceived by outsiders as green and wealthy, but the wealth is mixed and so is mobility. Life expectancy is higher than the national average, so all access problems are more applicable, as a recent Help the Aged survey pointed out. Of course, as the Minister knows, age brings increased demands on the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80722-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08072274000771">Mole Valley is served by three hospitals in adjacent constituencies, none in mine; one of them&#151;Epsom hospital&#151;is under threat, but that is a discussion for another time. In Mole Valley, there are two so-called cottage hospitals, one in Dorking and the other in Leatherhead.</p>

Sadly, I was unaware of his visit until after he returned to Westminster&#151;I would have liked to join him at the hospital. No. 10 thoughtfully informed my hon. Friend the neighbouring Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), albeit too late for him to inform me. I was delighted 24 hours later to receive some apologies from  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

No. 10, which were accepted, but I used the opportunity to request an audience, along with some of my colleagues, with the Prime Minister about the issues that I would have raised if I could have joined them. To date, the silence from No. 10 is significant but not golden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08072274000773">Both hospitals have evolved to meet the need to act as intermediaries between the GPs and their clinics and the three general hospitals. Both hospitals work closely with the many GP practices in their surrounding areas. For example, Leatherhead is run as an independent, not-for-profit unit giving services, including clinical assessment, especially for heart conditions, X-rays, audiology and dentistry for handicapped, abused and difficult children. I had hoped to use the opportunity to expand on the latter part by bringing in the private sector to pay for refurbishments and so on, and perhaps establish a charity to provide dentistry&#151;to put on my dental hat&#151;in the hospital if possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08072274000774">The hospital is effectively a polyclinic without GP services&#151;the latter are not necessary, as the GPs are close by in Leatherhead and the surrounding villages. GPs in Mole Valley have coagulated&#151;if I may use that medical term&#151;to form what I call mini-polyclinics. By forming partnerships with up to a dozen doctors, those clinics can offer the usual paramedical services as well as extras such as physiotherapy, minor surgery and, in the case of the Medwyn GP clinic in Dorking, dentistry&#151;as long as one&#146;s Polish English is effective. Several of those group practices can thus run satellite services in many villages. They are generally also dispensing practices, and that makes them just financially viable and means that the village patients do not have to travel into the bigger villages with their prescriptions. The towns and bigger villages are served by many excellent and modern pharmacies, which have encompassed new demands and requirements from patients, local GPs and the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08072274000775">All those relationships of GPs, clinics, local hospitals and pharmacies have evolved co-operatively to meet evolving patient needs, and have encompassed developing medical science as well as requests from the Government. Any Government changes, such as polyclinics and changes in pharmacies that affect dispensing GP practices, may be applicable in inner-city areas such as the Minister's constituency, but must not be applied prescriptively to rural and semi-rural areas such as my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08072274000776">I guess that it may be convenient for the Minister and even the Prime Minister to call Leatherhead hospital a polyclinic. However, to expand that to include general medical practitioner services, when they are being provided close by, or to impose a full blown polyclinic anywhere else in or close to Mole Valley, would be short-sighted and deeply damaging to NHS services, Mole Valley towns and especially villages. To quote one of the many deeply worried doctors,</p>
<a name="80722-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08072274000850"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a polyclinic would act like a black hole drawing all in and forcing closure of GP clinics especially in the villages&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08072274000777">Surrey villages have been and are under great threat&#151;several village shops have gone. Recently, 25 per cent. of sub-post offices have closed and village halls have been hurt by the recent licensing legislation. Polyclinics and changes in the pharmacy rules could especially hurt GP services in satellite villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08072274000778">A recent speculative bid for a new pharmacy, ostensibly serving several villages east of Dorking, was carefully assessed and rejected by NHS regulators. The key reason for rejection was that the demand for prescription medicines  <br>

was being met by dispensing GPs in the village satellite clinics. The presence of a new pharmacy in the villages would have disturbed the financial balance of those surgeries. Some or all would either curtail their hours or force closure for economic reasons. To add to this, there was severe doubt whether the proposed pharmacy would have been viable. The end result would have been a pharmacy that would have killed off some of the GP services and GP clinics and then died itself for economic reasons. The result in a few short months would have been disaster for those villages. Fortunately, the decision was a refusal. It would be helpful if these dispensing pharmacies were able to provide over-the-counter medicines and other minor pharmacy additions such as first-aid supplies, and I understand that the Government are considering that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08072274000779">I am asking the Minister to accept that a rigid application of the new distance parameters for pharmacies would be severely damaging in rural and semi-rural areas. Similarly, I hope she and her Department will accept that polyclinics with GP services in areas such as mine would damage a delicate and evolved environmental balance serving the national health service, and that that would result in poorer services for patients. My GPs will be keen to learn of the Minister&#146;s response, and if they are unhappy I suspect they will ask me to ask her whether I and one or two representatives might see her to expand on anything that comes out of today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08072274000780">These clinics are major employers, particularly in the villages, and they serve many who would find travelling for NHS care an enormous problem. I would be delighted if the Minister used this chance to reassure the concerned GPs and their patients, because if she does not do so she will be deepening an already deep fear among many people who loyally serve the NHS and who use it.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) on securing the debate. It is a pleasure to be present this evening. I shall go straight to the heart of his two major points on dispensing GPs and GP-led health centres&#151;or, as he called them and as they are often referred to in London, polyclinics. I hope that I will be able to reassure him, his constituents and those GPs who have been making representations to him that they should put aside their worst fears and instead embrace the agenda that he has outlined and that the Government are taking forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08072274000786">In his comments on dispensing GPs, the hon. Gentleman graphically laid out the complexities and differences in his constituency. Of course, if we compare it with, for example, my constituency of Bristol, South, his first proposition that one size does not fit all across the country is absolutely right, and that is precisely the Government&#146;s view. In looking at the provision of health services, it is important to take account of the needs and the location of the services in order to best serve patients in terms of quality and access to those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08072274000787">As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Government&#146;s White Paper, &#147;Pharmacy in England: Building on Strengths&#151;Delivering the Future&#148;, published on 3 April, set out our future proposals for expanding high-quality pharmaceutical services and developing the role of pharmacists as a leading clinical profession within the primary care team. He will know from my written ministerial statement of 17 July that next month we intend to publish our further consultation on the structural changes for the pharmaceutical services, which will run through the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08072274000788">Regulations governing dispensing by GPs have been in place since 1912, and despite some changes in April 2005 to implement measures agreed between pharmacy and medical representative bodies, they have not substantially changed for almost a century. A general precept adhered to not only by this Government, but by all Governments, is that doctors prescribe medicines and pharmacists dispense them. However, the hon. Gentleman alluded to the fact that community pharmacy is not always viable in all parts of the country, particularly rural areas. Patients need to receive their NHS-prescribed medicines promptly and efficiently, and that is where dispensing GPs can play a vital role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08072274000789">I say clearly to the hon. Gentleman that the Government recognise the importance of the role of the dispensing GP and do not propose to end it; there is no question of the Government&#146;s advancing an agenda that is about disposing of the services of dispensing GPs. I know that some dispensing GPs have expressed doubts about their future. I hope that my clear statements today will show that it is not, and never has been, the Government&#146;s intention to disband or remove the services of dispensing GPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08072274000790">However, I am sure that the hon.

because there is no predetermination involved, and we have made no suggestion that GP dispensing will cease. We have also made it clear that in examining some of the problems and anomalies, which GPs themselves identify, it will be vital to consult. That is the case precisely for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman so clearly and correctly identified in respect of understanding the geography and the services that are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08072274000791">I move on to the question of super-surgeries&#151;polyclinics&#151;and GP-led services. I am told by Surrey primary care trust that there are no plans to have any major new primary care developments in the area. However, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that that might not please all his constituents, given that the public have told us that enabling them to see a GP at a time that is more convenient to them&#151;for example, at weekends or in the evenings&#151;is their No. 1 priority in improving the NHS further. It is also true that Surrey PCT has more patients who are dissatisfied with the office hours opening times than anywhere else.</p>

 I thank the Minister for letting me respond to that specific point. Interestingly, the GPs in my constituency are clear about the fact that they have reacted positively by expanding their hours&#151;that includes weekend openings.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, because, so far, 55 per cent. of the local GPs&#151;77 out of 139&#151;are offering extended opening hours. None the less, that leaves almost 50 per cent. of his constituents outside such arrangements. The point that he makes is that the investment in and the dialogue with the PCT and the GPs is about enhancing and developing services, not cutting back on the services that are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08072274000794">I confirm once more that the guiding principle behind GP health centres is the wish to provide additional ways of accessing GP services&#151;precisely the sort of things that the hon.

I am more than happy to echo the point that he made that that is best planned and delivered by agreement and in co-operation with the health professionals&#151;GPs and others&#151;in his constituency. The most important thing is that his constituents get the best quality of care and the best access to care.</p>

be continuing dialogue between the GPs, the PCT and other health professionals on how to deliver the best services; and, secondly, there is no predetermined conclusion and no desire to abolish GP dispensing. The White Paper raises questions about the accessibility of pharmacies and how we can iron out any problems in the current rules. It may not be a problem in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, but there are examples around the country of dispensing GPs being on the opposite side of the road to a pharmacy. Such anomalies need to be resolved.</p>

 I accept the Minister&#146;s point about other areas. The difficulty in my villages is that a new pharmacy, on its arrival, will kill off the satellite dispensing pharmacies in the villages&#151;we have seen some speculators try that&#151;and then die off itself, leaving the villagers without pharmacy or GP services.</p>

 It is obviously not the Government&#146;s intention to drive GP services out of areas, given that we have announced that we will invest an extra &#163;250 million in taking those services into areas that are under-doctored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08072274000798">I am aware that applications have been made for two pharmacies, and those are under consideration. The White Paper attempts to ensure that we have the most appropriate services for the patient, delivered by the best-qualified provider. However, in encouraging that breadth of professionals in an area, we do not want to remove the GP service, for instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08072274000799">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to point out that, particularly in the areas represented by him and by some of my hon. Friends, it will be very important to consider the provisions for quality of care and for access. The White Paper says not that pharmacies offer all the solutions, but that they have the potential in certain parts of the country to open up the health service. We need to find a route whereby we can do that, where appropriate, without undermining quality provision where it exists. I know that he will agree that we need rules that are consistent and fair and that work to the best advantage of the patient and of the quality of care. That is what we are proposing to do and I see no reason why that should threaten the viability of GPs offering excellent medical services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80722-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08072274000800">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my reassurance and await the publication in the next month or so of the next stage of the consultation. If there are outstanding issues that he wants to raise with me, I will be happy to see him.</p>
