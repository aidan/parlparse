 It is important that we make optimum use of the internet in job advertising and other areas to maximise value for money for the taxpayer while at the same time ensuring access to information about job opportunities in Government for the one third of the population who do not use the internet. All Departments are instructed to advertise vacancies on the civil service jobs website, at http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk/ and also, where appropriate, on the Jobcentre Plus website. We recognise that civil service spending in this area is a small part of total public sector spending, but we are committed to making better use of the internet and reducing expenditure on press advertising. To that end, we expect to reduce the &#163;1.3 million estimated spending on senior jobs in the six largest spending Departments by up to 80 per cent. over the next few months.</p>

 This Government are committed to improving the delivery of public services and ensuring maximum value for money for the taxpayer. The 2004 spending review set a target for achieving annual efficiency gains of &#163;21 billion by 2007-08. Against that ambition, Departments and local authorities already reported annual efficiency gains worth over &#163;15 billion by the end of 2006.

 I would like to begin by recording my thanks to you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing the House to hold a very successful full-day Adjournment debate on Tuesday 20 March to mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade Act. As was agreed by all participants in the Adjournment debate, slavery is still with us in its modern forms. On 23 March, the Government were proud to sign the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings to tackle this appalling modern-day form of slavery. The Home Secretary has published an action plan on what the UK will be doing. We will be working towards ratification and we are co-operating closely with our international partners to take forward this work. I recently visited Geneva, where I held discussions with a number of UN and other international organisations on how we may do more.</p>

The ratification of the Council of Europe convention will be an important step forward. I welcome the fact that Kofi Annan will address the House on 8 May.

In addition, we have doubled the amount of money for the treatment of people on drugs. I appreciate that we have a very great deal more to do, but it is simply not the case that we are not making the investment or the changes that are necessary.

That is the problem that we have to address. Does the Prime Minister understand that so far only about 1,000 people have actually been helped? The financial assistance scheme is not working. Will he not look at a Treasury loan? That is how we dealt with the mess that was left by the Maxwell scheme. Surely he agrees that only 1,000 people helped so far is not good enough? As I say, some of the people are in great hardship. Surely we should act now, so that at least they can get some of the pension for which they worked and saved so hard.</p>

 It is, of course, precisely because we want to do what we can to help people responsibly that we have introduced these new proposals, the Pension Protection Fund and a host of other measures designed to support people, but I am afraid that the position, very simply, is this: we cannot make that additional commitment unless we are sure that the finances are there to fund it; otherwise we will be saying to people, &#147;Yes, we can give you this additional payment,&#148; when we cannot be sure until the review is published that we are able to make that commitment. As for taking out some unspecified loan from the Treasury, we do not believe that that is a proper way to deal with the issue, because it leaves us with a financial liability that we cannot be sure we can meet. The issue between us is not who wants to help people more, because, as I say, we have already introduced the first ever system of help for people in those circumstances. However, we need to be sure that we can actually fulfil a commitment that we make to people, since it would be the cruellest thing to tell them that we can make that commitment and can bail them out, if it may actually transpire that we cannot.</p>

 The Prime Minister says that the amount is unspecified, but it is not. We know that the first-year cost is &#163;30 million, which would help the people who have hit retirement age with nothing, as only 1,000 of them are being helped. May I ask the Prime Minister something specific? We welcome the fact that there is review, but can it be a cross-party review, because we have a great contribution to make, and when does he expect it to report?

cross-party review as such, but we are perfectly happy to listen any ideas put forward by Opposition parties or, indeed, by anyone else. If I can come back to the nub of the issue, when the right hon. Gentleman says that it is only a &#163;30 million cost in the first year, that is correct, but it then builds up over time, so our worry is that we would end up with an unfunded commitment that runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. If we accepted the amendments today, I think that I am right in saying the full cost would be &#163;2.48 billion. We simply cannot responsibly make such a commitment until we know whether we can fund it. That, with the greatest respect, is the difference between being in opposition and being in government.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words about our record on education. It is true, for example, that when we came to power there were only just over 80 secondary schools in the whole country with 70 per cent. of pupils getting five good GCSEs; the figure is now more than 600. The reason why I believe that in future most secondary schools, or all secondary schools, will become trust or academy schools&#151;it is a choice, of course&#151;is that they benefit from these partnerships. In doing so, academy and trust schools remain with a fully comprehensive intake. Indeed, academy schools have a higher percentage of pupils taking free school meals than the average secondary school. We have increased results dramatically since 1997 partly because of the ability to have partnerships with outside bodies. Specialist schools were the first step in that. At the time, people said that they would spell the end of the comprehensive system; they did not. Of course, my hon. Friend has four excellent specialist schools in his own constituency.</p>

 The point that my hon.

It is also true&#151;this is something that even the Conservatives apparently do not realise any more&#151;that we need to make changes and reforms in the way that the health service works. The report published today by Professor Darzi shows clearly that, as a result of the changes in the NHS, we are moving towards a system in which more care is done in the community and in which the number of day cases has risen by about 1.5 million a year. People can now often get day-case surgery when previously they would have had to spend days in hospital. We are therefore having to change the health care system; that is inevitable. If we manage to carry on making these improvements, by the end of next year the constituents of my hon.

 It is correct to say that living standards have gone up, and that house prices have gone up significantly. I agree with that, but the answer, as I said a moment ago, is that we must be prepared to release more land for development and to do more brownfield development, which this Government are doing. With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman and to the Liberal Democrats, we cannot have a situation in which the Liberal Democrats say that there should be more housing, while locally opposing every development that is proposed. In the end, they, like the Conservatives, have to understand that if the Government want to deal with these problems, hard decisions have to be taken, and the truth is that we take them.</p>

 That surcharge is paying for a whole range of victim and witness services. It is providing some &#163;3 million for witness care units, and some &#163;3 million for independent domestic violence advisers. If victims feel more comfortable about giving evidence in court, they will be more likely to secure the convictions of those who are guilty. One reason why we have significantly lowered levels of domestic violence is the fact that we are giving more support to people who need to bring such cases to court. The surcharge, although controversial at the time of its imposition, is yet another example of a difficult decision that was fully justified.</p>

 With your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a short statement on the examination of tissue taken from some individuals who had worked in the nuclear industry and who died between November 1962 and August 1991. Having regard to the feelings of the families of those concerned and because it is in the public interest, I want to provide the House with the information available from British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, which operates the Sellafield site where the examinations were carried out. I shall then set out how I intend to proceed with the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07041863000170">Most of the employees concerned worked at Sellafield, but one individual worked at the Capenhurst nuclear site in Cheshire, and had transferred from Sellafield. There are data, but not medical records, at Sellafield relating to an employee at the Springfields nuclear site in Lancashire and to a further six who worked at Aldermaston. BNFL, which holds the relevant medical records, tells me that to date it has been able to identify 65 cases in which tissue was taken from individuals and analysed for the radionuclide content of organs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07041863000171">It is important to tell the House about the limited nature of the records that are held by BNFL. They are medical records, which show what analysis was done on organs removed following post mortem examination. Because they are medical records that dealt with the analysis carried out at Sellafield, they do not provide an audit trail that would show in every case who asked for such an examination, under what authority and for what purpose; nor do they disclose whether the appropriate consent from the next of kin was received. Some records contain more information than others, but at this stage it is simply not clear what procedures were followed in every case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07041863000172">From the information that I have, I can tell the House that 23 such requests for further examination and analysis were made following a coroner&#146;s inquest. A further 33 requests appear to follow a coroner&#146;s post mortem. Three requests were made associated with legal proceedings, and one request was made by an individual prior to death. Therefore, it is assumed that in the majority of these cases requests were made to help establish the cause of death in the normal way. In many cases, that would be part of the coroner&#146;s inquiry, but we cannot be sure of that because there is not an audit trail to establish that as a fact. A further single request was made following a biopsy of a living individual. In respect of a further four cases, I understand that the records do not record by what mechanism the request for the analysis was made. Clearly, it is important to establish why these requests were made and for what purpose. It is also clear that the data obtained from these examinations have been used in other studies that were subsequently published. One of the questions that therefore arise is whether it was appropriate to use the data gathered for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07041863000173">It follows from what I have said that the records held by BNFL do not disclose whether the next of kin knew  <br>

of the examinations and analysis. That needs to be established. Most cases appear to have followed a coroner&#146;s request. It is therefore possible that in some cases there was such knowledge, but it is not at all clear that even if the next of kin had known about the analysis they would have been aware that the data gathered were then to be used as part of a wider research study. However, it will be necessary to examine the coroner&#146;s records to find out what exactly the position was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07041863000174">BNFL tells me that it believes that the tissue would have been destroyed as part of the analytical process. It also believes that although there was storage of the tissue prior to the examination, any tissue that remained would have been destroyed. Certainly BNFL tells me that no such tissue exists today. However, it is not certain at this stage what procedures were followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07041863000175">The House will appreciate that some of these cases go back 45 years. It is simply not possible, therefore, to be sure whether procedures were carried out properly. As I have said, the information held by BNFL is necessarily limited and a fuller investigation is therefore necessary. I believe that it is necessary to establish why these examinations were carried out and whether the next of kin were informed and consented to the analysis. It is also necessary to establish whether any of the examinations were carried out following the correct and proper procedures, and whether the data obtained were used appropriately and with the necessary consents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07041863000176">The families and the public will want to know the answers to all those questions. I have therefore asked Michael Redfern, QC, who conducted the Royal Liverpool Children&#146;s NHS Trust&#151;Alder Hey&#151;inquiry to investigate this matter. I have asked him to establish the facts, and to report to me. I will publish the full terms of reference shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07041863000177">This is clearly a difficult situation, covering events that took place up to 45 years ago. None the less, we owe it to the families, as well as to the public, to find out what happened and why.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for allowing me advance sight of the statement and for notifying both the shadow Secretary of State&#151;who is abroad and sends his apologies to the House&#151;and me of this issue as soon as he became aware of it yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07041863000179">All Members are shocked and incredulous at what appears to have happened. I join the Secretary of State in expressing our deep sympathy for all the families involved and our wish to see the full facts established as quickly as possible. I therefore welcome his decision to set up an immediate inquiry under Michael Redfern, QC, who has exceptional expertise and authority in this area. That is the right way forward to alleviate the great distress that will be felt today by all the families potentially involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07041863000180">I recognise that the Secretary of State&#146;s knowledge of this matter is very recent and that it has been hard for him to establish many of the facts so far, but I hope that he might be able to give some greater detail to the House. At present, many families of former workers at Sellafield and other nuclear locations will be profoundly concerned to know whether their loved  <br>

Is it the Secretary of State&#146;s understanding that any such post-mortem tests related particularly to those who might have been affected by the fire in pile 1 at Windscale in October 1957? Or does the information that he has received suggest that it might have been a much more general practice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07041863000182">The Secretary of State has told us that those involved worked at Sellafield, Capenhurst, Springfields and Aldermaston. Will the inquiry establish whether other nuclear sites might have been involved, and is it his understanding that the issue related purely to civil nuclear personnel, or might military personnel working with our military nuclear programme have been involved?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07041863000183">As the Secretary of State will know, rule 9 of the coroners rules allows coroners to retain material relevant to the cause of death. Clearly, coroners would not have had the power to allow material to be retained for more general research, and we agree with the Secretary of State that it is paramount that we establish precisely why tissues and organs were retained, to see whether that was entirely legal. Have there been any previous expressions of concern by families about what might have happened? Will the inquiry establish what legal advice was given to British Nuclear Fuels at the time about the legality of removing any body parts? Furthermore, will the inquiry publish the outcome of any research that was carried out on whether there may have been a link between the deaths of those involved and their exposure to radioactivity?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07041863000184">Will Mr. Redfern establish whether all activity complied with the Human Tissue Act 1961, which provided for inquiries to be made whether the deceased or any surviving relative objected to the retention of organs or tissue? Will he also establish what contact took place between British Nuclear Fuels and the Retained Organs Commission, set up in 2002 after Mr Redfern&#146;s earlier inquiry, or subsequently with the Human Tissue Authority, to ensure that all legal obligations were fully complied with?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07041863000185">Crucially, will the Secretary of State confirm to the House that the inquiry will establish who made the decision to stop the practice and when that decision was made? Will it also establish why the families were not informed when the decision to end the practice was made or whether it was decided simply to try to brush the issue under the carpet? At this stage, does he consider that the inquiry could lead to criminal investigations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07041863000186">Finally, on the broader issue, like the Secretary of State, I have visited nuclear plants and I have seen first hand the priority that they attach to safety. The Government want a new fleet of nuclear power stations to be built. Does he accept that public acceptance for that will be undermined if people do not see this issue  <br>

resolved openly and transparently, and will he therefore emphasise to Mr. Redfern the importance of this inquiry being both thorough and as quick as possible?</p>

<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="07041863000187"><a name="70418-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="07041863001919"><b>Mr. Darling:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he put his questions. For the sake of clarity, I think that I told the hon. Gentleman and his colleague that it was last Friday when I became aware of the issue. The difficulty in getting information is as I set out. BNFL&#146;s medical records deal simply with the examinations. There is no audit trail from the time of the post mortem that indicates who in each case asked for further analysis to be carried out or, at the other end, what happened as a result of the further consideration of the findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07041863000188">The hon. Gentleman asked several questions. I agree with him that it is essential that we have an open process. That is why I have asked Michael Redfern to conduct this investigation as thoroughly as possible. I do not intend to put any constraints on what he considers. He needs to examine all the matters that he thinks are relevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07041863000189">In relation to some of the specific points raised, the hon. Gentleman referred to &#147;this practice&#148;. From what I have been able to discern, I do not think that it was a routine practice. What happened was that from time to time the coroner&#151;in the majority of cases&#151;would ask for further analysis to be carried out. I do not know whether he decided to do that because of something that he was concerned about, or whether he was asked to do it on behalf of the family concerned. If we look at the distribution of the 65 cases over what was a very long period, we realise that it cannot be said to be a practice. Certainly, as I understand it, it was not done routinely. However, one of the issues that Mr. Redfern will wish to consider is why the decisions were taken, and then he will draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07041863000190">I cannot give the hon. Member for Wealden any information on whether any of the people concerned were involved in, or associated with, the 1957 incident, nor can I say whether any of them were military personnel; no doubt Mr. Redfern will want to investigate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07041863000191">The hon. Member for Wealden asked about the research. There has been quite a lot, although I understand that it has been more concerned with the methodology used to calculate radioactivity in organs than with these specific cases. However, it is important to note that the records for the individuals involved are confidential. As a result, I do not know&#151;and neither does BNFL&#151;what conclusions were reached for each person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07041863000192">The final point raised by the hon. Member for Wealden is very important and sensitive. The company, work force representatives and Michael Redfern are urgently considering how to approach the families concerned to explain what happened. The House will appreciate that in some cases the immediate next of kin are, sadly, no longer alive. However, there will be surviving family members: contacting them must be handled sensitively and, as I have told the company today, quickly. The surviving next of kin will be concerned about what happened, and the right thing to do is to explain to them exactly what we know and what we are doing to find the answers to those questions that are not yet resolved.</p>

 I have no evidence to back up what my hon. Friend says.

However, Mr. Redfern will face the problem that attitudes have changed, as has the relevant legislation.

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70418-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07041863000198">However, I want to ask the Secretary of State a number of questions.

Were the CEGB records fully transferred to BNFL, or have some of them stayed in the Government&#146;s possession, perhaps even in the archives of the Department of Trade and Industry?

and events at Alder Hey did not lead to disclosure of the series of events in this case some years ago? That leads to the obvious question that if BNFL did not use that opportunity to examine its records, which other organisations failed to do so, too?</p>

 Perhaps I can deal with the points that the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) has made. It is more likely that the UK Atomic Energy Authority held the records rather than the Central Electricity Generating Board, but one of the things that Mr. Redfern will want to look at is whose responsibility it was. As I said in my statement and in reply to the hon. Member for Wealden, it is important to remember that the analysis was undertaken at Sellafield because that is where the expertise was. In many cases, the analysis was being undertaken either at the request&#151;it would appear&#151;of a coroner as part of his wider inquiry or, in a smaller number of cases, as part of legal proceedings. It is not clear whether the families concerned knew whether further analysis was being performed in those cases, but it is clear that the main inquiry was being conducted by a third party; in other words, not BNFL or its predecessors.</p>

Lady&#146;s call for a wider inquiry, I want Mr. Redfern to find out what happened in this set of cases. If we go wider, we shall not get the answers that the families want in anything like a reasonable time scale. On her point about research, analysis of the tissues was carried out&#151;often, it would appear, at the request of a coroner&#151;to find the cause of death, and that point is fairly well known. As I understand it, the research was derived from the data found, and a lot of it involved looking at the methodology used to calculate the effect of radioactive material. I understand that the research has been fairly well published, although that is not to say that the families concerned would have known about it&#151;a point I made earlier. Mr. Redfern will look at what should have happened with regard to the law prevailing at the time and so on. The law is quite different now and is much tighter, thanks to legislation published two years ago following Alder Hey, but those issues need to be examined.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that the difficult issue with which he has dealt so appropriately and sensitively today could be seen as just the latest manifestation of the nuclear industry&#146;s past reputation for a dangerous combination of unbridled optimism, alarming scientific naivety and obsessive cold war secrecy? Bearing in mind the new consultation that the right hon.

If things went on the past, let us hear about them&#151;subject, of course, to observing sensitivities and the confidentiality to which families are entitled. It is far better to be open about these things. As far as we understand, the practice stopped in the early 1990s and it was not until the company was approached to see whether it would allow the data gathered to be used for further general research that people focused on what had happened. People&#146;s attitudes now are quite different from the 1960s, when&#151;the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to the extent that a sudden death is a matter for the procurator fiscal. I suppose this point follows on from the point that was just made by my hon.

 May I add a historical perspective? It is sadly needed. Anybody who worked or trained as a doctor in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s knows that the standard of obtaining consent for post-mortems was abysmally low. In hospitals, it was left to the most junior houseman to ask. No detail was mentioned. It was also well known among members of the medical profession that it was automatic to retain certain amounts of body tissue for examination afterwards. In the &#146;60s and &#146;70s, and until the desperate Alder Hey disaster, it was not recognised that that should form a separate request. In 2007, it is probably hard to recognise that, but we have to be realistic about what the standards were at the time. Regrettably, it is probably still necessary&#151;another hon.

 The Secretary of State rightly said that people need to know, where possible. I put it to him that he should consult the Health and Safety Executive and the royal colleges on the terms of reference. Even though the inquiry may be limited, its implications for research for medical purposes, and for our safety and the analysis of risk, will matter. If people are not able to reuse data in the future, we may find that that has implications&#151;as in the past, when we did not pick up on the dangers of asbestosis or pneumoconiosis or other things that have killed many more people that any possible deaths attributed to the nuclear industry.

precisely because he has some experience, following the Alder Hey inquiry, and he will be well aware of the fact that his recommendations led to a change in the law just a couple of years ago. In relation to the final point: yes, the workers were employed in the nuclear industry, but we need to get these things into perspective.

 I largely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is important to reiterate the value of post-mortem examination and further analysis, because only by that can we learn for the future. Many people working in medicine and science could not do their work if they were unable to carry out that research&#151;and most members of the public understand that. The law now is, broadly, that the next of kin have to consent, though there is an obvious exception in respect of coroners. The position now is, of course, different from 40 years ago. As I said to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), it would be wrong for us to judge people who were operating in the 1960s by the laws and standards of 2007, as that would be unfair. I agree that it is important to recognise the value of these further investigations. I reiterate that what I want to find out and what the families&#151;and the public&#151;want to know is what happened in this particular case. We should be very careful about drawing premature conclusions for which there is no evidence one way or another. We should address the issue in a measured and balanced way, with all the sensitivity that the situation requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para2"><a name="07041863000228">There are people who believe that poverty is a fact of life, and there are people who believe that many should live in poverty because that is the way of the world. I profoundly disagree, as I believe that poverty is not some mysterious dispensation that descends from heaven on some families and not on others. I also believe that one of the first duties of Government is to try to tackle the inequalities between rich and poor, between rich countries and poor countries and between rich areas and poor areas of a country. It is particularly important to tackle the inequity that is child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para3"><a name="07041863000229">I believe that the single best means that Governments have of tackling child poverty is to enable parents&#151;whether they be lone parents or happily married or cohabiting couples&#151;to work. I think so for two main reasons. First, work brings money into the household, and what better way is there to tackle poverty than by ensuring that money is available in the household? I am glad that the Government have done so much over recent years&#151;through child tax credits, working tax credits and the national minimum wage&#151;to make sure that work pays. Secondly, it is also important for parents to be able to work because it gives them the social contact that is essential for their families to flourish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para4"><a name="07041863000230">The statistics clearly support my case. International figures for child poverty and parents in work show a remarkable correlation. The country with the lowest level of child poverty is Sweden, with only 4.2 per cent. of children growing up in child poverty. What is the number of women with children in work in that country? It is 76.6 per cent.&#151;70 per cent. of women with children under three and 80 per cent. with children over three. That shows a clear correlation because Sweden is the country with the highest proportion of mothers in work and the lowest proportion of children living in poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para5"><a name="07041863000231">In the United States of America, on the other hand, merely 58 per cent. of women with children are in work and 21.9 per cent. of children grow up in poverty. Sadly, Britain is closer to the American level than to the Swedish level, with 57 per cent. of women with children in work and 15.4 per cent. of children growing up in poverty. When the Government came to power, we were at the bottom&#151;the absolute bottom&#151;of the league for child poverty in Europe. I believe that that was because there was systematic ignorance and deliberate carelessness about child poverty by previous generations of Governments. I am glad that we have managed to lift ourselves from the bottom of the league, but we are still only half way up. That is why I want us to tackle, with increased energy, the issue of child care provision, particularly in Wales.</p>

proud of the &#163;12.5 million of European Union structural funds that have been secured to spend on child care in Wales. I am proud, particularly in respect of the Rhondda, of Flying Start&#151;the new scheme now coming on track, whereby significant extra resources of health visitors are being provided. As well as making a difference on child care, we need to ensure that parents with health problems have the support that they need to get into work. Also important are free part-time child care for the poorest members of our community and tackling deprivation in the poorest wards in my constituency. I am proud of all of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para7"><a name="07041863000233">Very significant problems remain, however. There is still not enough child care available. Quite simply, there are not enough places for everyone who wants to go to work to place their child in proper child care. There are many reasons for that. One is that child care is not overly valued in society, which is why it is still not valued highly as a career. Many of the people working in child care are on the national minimum wage. At a time of relatively high levels of employment and relatively low levels of unemployment, alternative careers are available, which has made it difficult to recruit people to work in child care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para8"><a name="07041863000234">There is also a significant problem with buildings. Should we not have a sense of shame about the fact that very few Members could cite a single child care building that was expressly built for that purpose? In other countries, many thousands of buildings were expressly built for that purpose, yet we end up using buildings that were built in the 19th century for completely different purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para9"><a name="07041863000235">The cost of child care is still prohibitive for many parents, which makes it difficult for them to make the choice to work. There is still a lack of flexibility. Many child care facilities insist that parents have to use them for a full week rather than just two days. Parents say that they want only part-time child care and if they cannot have it, they cannot decide to go into work. We need to meet more accurately the pattern of work by which people live their lives. That often means making provision close to home and close to places of work. Many people in the Rhondda who may work in Cardiff, Newport, Swansea or elsewhere need very flexible arrangements if they are to take the opportunity of going into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para10"><a name="07041863000236">We also need to make it possible to cope with crises. Many lone parents who have courageously gone off benefits and into work with excitement and glee are able to cope with the expected crises of the year, such as school holidays, because members of their extended family may be able to help. What is really difficult for them to cope with, however, is the unexpected crisis, when a child or parentis ill. That is why the new idea espoused by the Welsh Assembly Government, to which Labour is committed in its manifesto for Wales, is so important. I refer to the idea of having mobile mammas who will be able to provide the crisis support  <br>

for child care at the moments when lone parents really need it. It will make a dramatic difference in the years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para11"><a name="07041863000237">Sometimes child care provision does not feel as inclusive of every young parent as it might. One young parent told me that it was great going along to many of the new facilities and everyone was very welcoming, but it sometimes felt like a gathering of the middle classes. Everyone was chatting away about how to cultivate organic pears, but they did not seem to have a proper understanding of how child care might fit their particular personal needs. We need to go much further in making child care available, particularly to those who have gone forward with teenage pregnancies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07041863000238">Two very important principles are relevant. First, there should be no compulsion. We should not be forcing every single parent to put their child into child care and go into work, but we certainly should make it possible for every single parent to have that option. Also, child care should not mean just warehousing. Some people have been concerned about recent reports suggesting that children who have grown up in child care that effectively places babies in a row and leaves them there for several hours turn out to have more social problems later in life than others who did not go through that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07041863000240">The role of the mother will always be vital in brining up a child, and child care should not be an alternative to the role of the mother. It is vital that every child learns the difference between a frown and a smile from one person, and the primary person in that role will always be the mother. But it is important, too, that we give opportunities for people to go into work. It is absolutely vital that we get this right. We should not have a stop-start approach to child care; there should not be a new idea every two or three years, because we must introduce a generational change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70418-0005.htm_para14"><a name="07041863000241">I wholly support the Welsh Assembly&#146;s idea of mobile mammas, because that will make it much easier for young mums in particular to cope with crises. It is important that we investigate whether we should have a universal right to child care, as parents enjoy in Sweden. It is important that we have a recruitment campaign to ensure that more people have access to child care. Finally, there are 1,420 lone parents on benefit in the Rhondda. We must not fail them, and we must not fail their children either.</p>

 New clause 38 deals with the important issue of failed company pensions and the financial assistance scheme. In my speech, I want to set out three things: first, how the scheme will now guarantee 80 per cent. of expected core pensions to all 125,000 people affected, in contrast to the Opposition, who said that they would not put any more taxpayers&#146; money into the scheme; secondly, how a review, led by industry experts, will look at topping up that 80 per cent., looking in particular at pooling assets; but thirdly, how we should wait for the outcome of that review, rather than voting for the Conservative amendments, which have already been condemned by the Association of British Insurers.</p>

As the judicial review found, the 1996 leaflet published by the then Tory Government was misleading and maladministrative.

 Is there not a pattern in Government policy making as well: three times, the Government have been dragged perhaps not kicking and scheming, but kicking and screaming into providing some pension compensation, first with the financial assistance scheme and then with two increases in its size? Given the amount that is now being put in and the feeling of concern and injustice, why on earth cannot the Government go the final step today to deliver what most hon. Members on both sides of the House want: fair compensation at PPF level, with the other changes that are in the cross-party amendments?</p>

 Again, I will turn to that in my speech slightly later on, but I want to contest what the hon. Gentleman has just said. We could have just looked at the outcome of those court cases and continued to defend them. That would have benefited only a very small number of people. The ECJ made it very clear that it thought that damages would not be payable, so the case would have affected only people who went into insolvency after the case. Similarly, the judicial review only asked us to reconsider the decision. Given that the courts had made it clear that the Conservative Government&#146;s decisions that we have defended had been wrong, we decided that it was time to come up with a scheme that would provide at least 80 per cent. and to listen to the suggestions that the hon. Gentleman, other Opposition Front Benchers, the ombudsman and my honourable colleagues have been making and set up a review. That is the right way to proceed, but I will turn to his precise point later in my speech.</p>

The Minister has carefully talked about the review considering pooling assets, but the Prime Minister said that it will consider the use of unclaimed assets. Will the Minister confirm that the Prime Minister made a mistake?</p>

 I want to return to an issue that was raised before. I know that the Minister said that he would address it later in his speech, but I hope that this is the right time to make this point. I have visited him with pensioners from my constituency who worked for the firm Tinsley Bridge, which is still in existence. Given that the firm is not in liquidation, its workers cannot at present be covered by the financial assistance scheme. However, the firm is not in liquidation only because the pension scheme decided not to pursue from the company the full amount due to it. The pension scheme has thus been wound up, so the workers in the scheme cannot join the PPF. The company&#146;s pensioners and future pensioners are thus caught in a situation in which they cannot be part of the PPF or receive any help from the FAS. About 8,000 people in the country are affected in such a way. Can my hon. Friend give us any assurance that those workers will now be included in the FAS?</p>

 I am pleased by what my hon. Friend has said, but I do not understand the basis on which he argues that he therefore could not accept new clause 25. The new clause refers explicitly to schemes that are eligible for assistance under section 286 of the Pensions Act 2004.

It was going to taper down to 50 per cent. and then to nothing for people who were not covered. Now it will be at 80 per cent. for everyone, and an extra 100,000 people will get more benefit. In all, we are allocating a further &#163;5.6 billion in cash terms. The original amount committed to the FAS in 2004 was &#163;400 million in cash. We then extended that figure to &#163;2.3 billion.

 I am afraid that there is a misunderstanding about the task that the financial assistance scheme has had to undertake, which the PPF or whoever else was tasked with running it would have had to undertake. The FAS has had to go through hundreds of schemes to see whether they are eligible; it has had to set up a new IT system; and it has had to get data from the trustees about exactly what people are entitled to and compare that with FAS. That is why there has been a significant up-front cost. That work is now largely complete, and we are paying everybody whom we are in a position to pay. Everybody who has asked for initial payments is being paid. There is no delay in FAS; the delay is in requests for initial payments. We need schemes to come forward and ask for those.

 This is important so we must be clear about it. Is the Minister saying that he accepts the substance of new clause 25, reflecting the announcement that he has made this afternoon, but he thinks that it is technically deficient&#151;although I am advised that that is not the case&#151;so he will incorporate it in the Bill at a later stage, to remedy its technical deficiency?</p>

The taxpayer should fund up to 80 per cent. but there should then be a review of alternative sources of funding that have been suggested. The taxpayer does not fund the 90 per cent. level provided by the PPF. There is no taxpayer money at all in the PPF. There will now be nearly &#163;2 billion of taxpayers&#146; money in net present value terms in FAS. In contrast, the PPF is funded entirely by the levy payments of member companies, which are paying to insure themselves against future possible insolvency. We therefore think that the balance that we are striking of nearly &#163;2 billion of public money in FAS and no public money in the PPF, with a review to look at what more could be done is the right one for the taxpayer and for the people involved.</p>

 Yes, if the hon. Gentleman can tell me what tax and benefit policy will be for the next 50 years. So far there is very little interaction between FAS payments and pension credits. Very few of the current recipients get pension credits, so that will not reduce the cost significantly. The difference for the payments that I set out earlier is the additional &#163;2.7 billion, which in net present value terms is about &#163;600 million, or an increase of a third in the current scheme.</p>

 The Minister has talked about an additional &#163;2 billion going into the fund. Where is that money? I cannot find it anywhere in the Department&#146;s accounts. Has anyone received it? Is it a fund with pension trustees who are accountable for its expenditure or is it something that maybe, at some stage, a Government will pay?</p>

 That is a very good point. There is a misunderstanding about this. People think that the sum is a pot of money that has been put into the scheme; it is not. It is a guarantee from the Government to pay at least 80 per cent. We have estimates of how much that will cost, but it could cost more than &#163;8 billion&#151;for example, if people in the schemes live longer. However, the Government are giving that guarantee, which is not available elsewhere, so it is significantly worthwhile to the people involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70418-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07041863000335">The right thing to do is to carry out a further review. We are doing precisely what is suggested in new clause 11 and holding a review, which will be led by Andrew Young, directing actuary at the Government Actuary&#146;s Department, who helped to set up the PPF and who therefore has real expertise in this area. He will be advised by a panel of leading external experts. The review will provide an initial view in the summer and will then report by the end of the year. I can make it clear today that any extra funding that the review identifies will be put into topping up the financial assistance scheme beyond 80 per cent.</p>

As I said before, if we compelled people to stop annuitising and they lost out, we could be open to compensation claims, and if annuity rates fell, we could be open to compensation claims.

 The hon. Gentleman has contradicted the answer that he just gave. He said that the amendments were about only one class of assets, but now says that they can be about any class of assets.

That is why the Government amendment will increase the amount that people get in initial payments from 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. That means more money for more people immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70418-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07041863000346">That brings me to new clause 47, whose purposes appear to be twofold: first, to transfer the delivery of the financial assistance scheme to pension schemes; and, secondly, to provide that funds for those payments should be provided by FAS or by the lifeboat, whether by loan or by retrospective repayment. The problem with the new clause is that scheme administrators, who are expert in what they do, would have to learn a new set of skills that FAS is currently delivering. We would be ignoring the expertise that exists in FAS&#151;a single centralised unit, which has assessed hundreds of schemes&#151;and instead asking hundreds of scheme administrators to learn those skills. Those scheme administrators would then come to us saying that they should be paid for having done so.</p>

Government new clause 38 is the only amendment that will enable us to give more people more money immediately, and I urge hon. Members to support it.</p>

 The background to this matter is well known and well rehearsed. We are dealing with a finite group&#151;future pension scheme failures will not increase its size&#151;comprising 125,000 people, some of whom are terminally ill and some of whom have had to come out of retirement and start work again. There are some heartbreaking stories, and I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will relate some of those stories during the debate. Fairness demands that the people in that group are treated similarly to those whose schemes failed after April 2005, whether their employers were solvent or not. Fairness is not alone: the ombudsman, the Public Administration Committee, the European Court of Justice and the High Court have all expressed the same sentiment.</p>

I pay tribute to the Select Committee on Public Administration and the hon.

It improves the scheme significantly for younger members who would otherwise have been excluded, but it does not address the real issues to do with speed of payment, the effectiveness of the financial assistance scheme, and the benefit payable. The increase in the cap will benefit some higher-paid scheme members, but that does not address the issues affecting the desperate people whom the Members most interested in the subject meet repeatedly. We will not oppose new clause 38, because it is a significant improvement and a helpful step forward, but it does not address the real issues before the House today.</p>

Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) tabled, would amend Government new clause 38 by increasing the benefits provided in the new clause to Pension Protection Fund levels. It is similar in its effect to new clause 24. We have two concerns with amendment (a). First, because of the reference to qualifying members, it appears to include only those members who are over 65, rather than those who are over scheme retirement age, as the PPF does, yet that group includes some of the people in greatest hardship. Secondly, we believe that, contrary to what the Minister said, it is necessary to balance the moral case for helping that group of people with the obligation on us all to protect the taxpayer.

We accept that, as the Minister pointed out, if a loan is made, a residual contingent liability is taken on, but if we are to reach a solution to the problems, we have to recognise that we are all in this together. There has to be a sharing of the pain. The pensioners concerned have to accept that they will receive only 90 per cent. of the benefits that they would have got, the industry has to accept that it will have to yield up the unclaimed assets, and the Government have to extend the loan to bridge the gap, so that relief can be provided right now, while the unclaimed assets are being collected. I have set out the two reasons why we cannot support amendment (a), tabled by the hon. Lady; we urge her to consider supporting new clauses 41 to 45 instead, which have the same objective and would deliver the same outcome for pensioners, but which take a different route.</p>

of the problem. I say to the hon. Gentleman that the scheme that we have set out, involving a lifeboat fund, in no way precludes using the assets that the Minister hopes to find in his review, including, possibly, the residual assets in the schemes; those could go into the lifeboat fund.

What we have said is that the Government should make a loan available to the lifeboat fund to enable it to start paying out immediately.

It is ridiculous for the Minister to suggest that the loan would need to be &#163;600 million; he has just explained, in the context of the financial assistance scheme, that the scheme would not have to be pre-funded.

proposing to increase the public sector borrowing requirement, and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s only answer to my question is, &#147;We&#146;d get the money from unclaimed pension assets.&#148; If he is to increase public borrowing, he has to tell us what else he would cut, but I bet the House that he will refuse to do so.</p>

 The amount of money that we are talking about is around &#163;30 million a year in the early years, and I hope that the Minister agrees with those approximate figures. He talks about unfunded commitments, but he has just made an increase in the commitment to the financial assistance scheme from &#163;2.4 billion to &#163;8 billion. That money will be spread over 50 or 60 years, and the money needed for the lifeboat fund will also be spread over 50 to 60 years. The initial cost will be approximately &#163;30 million in the first year, and that will be funded by a Treasury loan of &#163;30 million, which is way below the rounding error in any of the accounts that his Department produces.</p>

 My hon. Friend has a point about the &#163;30 million.

 May I make some progress and turn to new clause 25 and the Minister&#146;s welcome announcement that he is willing to yield on the issue of solvent schemes? There appears to be a technical issue concerning the extent of his commitment. Yesterday, the Chancellor displayed alarming unawareness of the problem of solvent schemes, and told the House that the problem for those pensioners was that their employers had gone bust. Hon. Members who take an interest in these things know that in some cases that is not so. The problem is that the schemes are underfunded, not that the employer has gone bust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70418-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07041863000380">That is an issue that the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) must address in his contribution. He must decide whether his new clause 25 needs to be pressed further, notwithstanding the commitment that the Minister made today. I came to the Chamber ready to commit the Opposition to supporting the hon. Gentleman and his new clause, which extends the scheme to solvent employers. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister is asking where the money will come from. It will now come from the Government&#146;s pot, because he has made a commitment. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase will make a judgment as to whether to proceed with new clause 25.

Although we will vote on the issue today, there is still an opportunity to get the wording into the exact shape needed to satisfy all parties in the House of Lords.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. The Minister, in a rather niggardly way, criticised the drafting of the amendments at the Dispatch Box.

that no one who tabled a new clause today would fail to hesitate to press it if the Minister made a commitment to deal with the substantive issues that they raise when the Bill proceeds to the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70418-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07041863000383">Our new clause 40 approaches the problem from a slightly different angle from new clause 25. On reflection, we have decided that new clause 25 provides the better approach so, if the hon. Member for Cannock Chase chooses to proceed with it, we will support it. New clause 26, which was tabled by the hon. Gentleman and members of Select Committee on Public Administration, does not suffer from the defects of new clause 24, as it clearly includes people under 65 who are none the less over scheme age. It still makes a public spending commitment. I should have made it clear earlier that one of our concerns about amendment (a) to Government new clause 38 is that it appears to exclude members who are under 65 but above scheme age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70418-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07041863000384">In new clause 26, however, there is a further problem that I wish to draw to the attention of the House. Subsection (3) requires the omission of the provisions of section 286 of the Pensions Act 2004 that prevent the means-testing of FAS benefits. If the new clause were accepted, it would allow the Secretary of State to impose means- testing on FAS benefits. By seeking specifically to omit the provisions that prevent means-testing, the implication is clearly that FAS benefits should be means-tested. I do not believe that that is the consensual view in the House, and for that reason, and because of the public spending commitment that it implies, we do not support it. New clause 27, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), excludes the means-testing problems, but it still makes a direct public spending commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="70418-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07041863000385">Since the new clauses were tabled, there have been intense discussions in all parts of the House, co-ordinated by the pensions action group, which represents the people who are outside the House today. There is genuine good will to try to seek a solution. I do not think that anyone, except for the Minister, is trying to score political points. We seek a way forward that is fair and deliverable. I pay tribute to Members from all parts of the House, to the pensions action group, and to the tireless Ros Altmann&#151;her mobile phone bill, I am sure that many hon. Members agree, must be horrendous&#151;who have done so much to bring the issue to the attention of the House and to focus our attention on the way forward. As a result of that process, a series of new clauses has been agreed by the pensions action group and by Members from all parts of the House as the best way forward, and I thank all hon. Members who have been involved. The amendments belong to the whole House.</p>

Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who has taken a particular interest in this, not least because he has a special constituency interest in a particularly heartbreaking case. They are supported by the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), and by other Labour Members who have seen the need for a cross-party solution. I hope that that cross-party approach sends a message to the Government about the strength of feeling and sense of moral obligation across the House. This is one of those occasions when we as parliamentarians have to stand up and be counted and be seen to be doing the right thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70418-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07041863000389">Before I go through the new clauses, there is a procedural issue that I should like to explain to hon. Members. I understand that for reasons of time it is unlikely that it will be possible to vote on more than one new clause in the group. I should like to indicate to you now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I will, if possible, seek a Division on new clause 41. It is our understanding, on advice, that new clauses 42, 43, 44, 45 and 47 are essentially consequential, and if the House agreed to new clause 41 there would then be an opportunity to consider the other new clauses. That leaves out new clauses 39 and 46, which are not consequential but would do slightly different things. I will deal with those separately.</p>

There is no point in reviewing the possible use of residual scheme assets if by the time that the review has completed its course and the Minister has considered it the residual scheme assets have all been given to the Pru and Legal and General. That is why we need a moratorium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70418-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07041863000391">New clause 39 would provide that the PPF board should take over from the Secretary of State the role of scheme manager, for two reasons: on the merits of the case for the PFF board, which has demonstrated its competence by winding up the MG Rover scheme and taking it into the PPF in less than two years; and secondly, as part of a wider architecture in this group of new clauses, which would put the PPF board in overall control board of pension compensation&#151;separate funds, for very good reasons, but under a single administration with single payment structures and, it is to be hoped, administrative savings to be made and efficiencies to be gained. The new clause would achieve its objective simply by substituting the PPF board for the Secretary of State in the 2005 regulations.</p>

We need a separate fund, as opposed to one merely incorporated into the FAS. The source of funds for the lifeboat fund would be different from that of the FAS. The FAS is a body publicly funded with taxpayers&#146; money; the lifeboat fund is intended to be funded with unclaimed assets, perhaps with residual scheme assets or some part of them, if they become available, and in the interim to be allowed to go about its work with the benefit of a Treasury  <br>

loan. The lifeboat fund would be mandated to pay top-up benefits so that people who are being paid under the FAS would be topped up to PPF levels, and people who are below the FAS qualifying age but above the scheme retirement age would be paid from the lifeboat fund. Crucially, it would provide for loans from the Secretary of State to allow immediate operations. Later new clauses would provide for the collection of assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70418-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07041863000393">I have acknowledged, and will do so again, that in granting a loan there is a residual risk of a liability to the public purse. However, having considered it carefully and looked at the moral obligation that falls upon us, we think that it is a tiny risk that it is right and reasonable to ask the taxpayer to bear. The costs would be slightly more than the &#163;2 billion in cash over 50 or 60 years, or &#163;600 million net present value, that the parliamentary Labour party briefing document set out, because it appears that the Secretary of State&#146;s briefing to the PLP did not factor in the cost of including those who were under 65.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70418-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07041863000394">We estimate that the initial cost of the lifeboat fund&#151;its initial cash flow need&#151;would be about &#163;30 million a year, rising to &#163;100 million in 2033 and then tailing off to zero. Today, the Prime Minister quoted a figure of &#163;2.48 billion in cash, or about &#163;750 million NPV, as the total cost of the package of proposals that stand in the name of the Leader of the Opposition. That estimate does not look unreasonable, although we all recognise that in calculating such figures there is a fairly wide degree of error. I should emphasise, however, that the figure would not have to be found immediately but over a period of 50 or 60 years&#151;exactly the same as the &#163;8 billion that the Secretary of State has committed to the FAS.</p>

New clauses 42 to 45 would create the rather inelegantly named pensions unclaimed assets recovery agency. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who will have recognised in the new clauses a large chunk of his private Member&#146;s Bill, the Pensions (Unclaimed Assets) Bill. I am grateful to him for doing a large amount of the drafting work. The agency would be charged with first identifying these assets, then collecting and supplying information to the Secretary of State, and then collecting the assets in. The new clause would provide that the Secretary of State specified the classes of unclaimed assets to be collected by the agency. Our focus is on unclaimed pension assets, including the possibility of residual scheme assets. We think that there is an elegance and a justice in using unclaimed pension assets to deal with a pensions problem. However, the House should be aware that the new clause would enable the Secretary of State, over time, should he wish, to widen or change the scope of the classes of unclaimed assets that could be included.</p>

Although there would be two streams of funding, there would be a single payment mechanism delivering efficiency and seamlessness for recipients. The system would minimise the risk to the public purse, while a loan would allow for an immediate start to payments to those most in need. It would be flexible as to the classes of asset that could be used, so that the Secretary of State would have wide discretion in managing the process in future. It would deliver the objectives of new clauses 26 and 27 and amendment (a) to new clause 38. As far as beneficiaries are concerned, its effect would be no different, but it would be achieved without placing the burden on to the taxpayer.</p>

As I have already said, its intention is to support the review that the Government are undertaking. We acknowledge that there are problems with the use of residual scheme assets but our discussions suggest that there is between &#163;1 billion and &#163;2 billion in the schemes that is not already committed to the purchase of annuities, as well as a further sum, which may be subject to some penalty costs when annuity option arrangements have been entered into. That is a sizeable sum. If just part of it could be released to support the lifeboat fund, it would be a useful additional source. That is worth pursuing and we would be happy to engage in the review that the Secretary of State has set up and examine with him some of the problems, which we acknowledge must be overcome to make the proposal work.</p>

They already have the power to make interim payments if they choose, but trustees, by their nature, tend to be conservative people. Their inclination to ask for interim payments has been disappointing, as the Minister acknowledged. He has written letters to encourage them to do so. We believe that it would be right to impose a duty on them to make such payments, the cost of which they would recover from the FAS and the lifeboat fund in due course when the scheme was wound up. The new clause also provides for the unlikely position whereby a scheme does not have the liquid resources to make payments and Treasury loans might be made to trustees to bridge the gap while they get their assets into liquid form.</p>

That was a big step forward. I also applaud the Government&#146;s establishment of the financial assistance scheme and their work to improve it. When it was originally set up, it applied only to members who had reached retirement age or were within three years of doing so. It was woefully inadequate to address the needs of all the pensioners.</p>

The FAS has been gradually extended, but the process has been long and tortuous. It has taken five years and it has felt as though the campaigning of Members of Parliament, the unions and others forced the Government to improve the provision in the FAS. Nevertheless, they have done that. Many hon.

My concern, however, is that it will not give any certainty. Amendment (a) would ensure that those who currently receive the reduced FAS level would receive 90 per cent. of their expected pension, capped at about &#163;26,000, rather than 80 per cent. Since 1997, pensions have been index-linked, either to the retail prices index or to 2.5 per cent., whichever is the lower, rather than being index-linked only until people draw them at 65 years of age. According to what the unions have told me, they would then decline by more than a third in the first 10 years, and by more than 50 per cent. should the pensioner live to over 85 years old. Immediate benefits could be gained if we were to adopt the PPF proposals. </p>

 Yes, that is a matter of concern. Another issue is that there is a provision under the Pension Protection Fund for the payment of a lump sum, which many people were relying on to pay off their mortgages but which they cannot do under the FAS provisions. There would therefore be many advantages to bringing the FAS provisions up to the PPF levels.</p>

If the problem is not sorted out now, there is always a possibility that the Government could be forced, either by the UK High Court or by the European Commission, to introduce PPF-equivalent benefits for those who currently qualify for the FAS. This issue has been a running sore. It has been going on for five years and caused huge anxiety to many people. It would be very good if we could now settle the matter and put it behind us.</p>

The High Court decision did not mean that the Government had to compensate workers for their losses, but the ruling by Mr. Justice Bean meant that they had to rethink the issue of compensation. That has been done, and we have made huge progress, but I would like to see this go one step further so that full justice can be done.

embarked on the tortuous process described by the hon. Lady. It has not satisfied the pensioners who have lost their pensions, it has not brought the matter to a conclusion, and it has led to a series of very critical reports on the Government&#151;first from the parliamentary ombudsman, then from the cross-party Public Administration Committee, then from the European Court of Justice and then from the judicial review group.

But does any Member, including the Minister, seriously believe that we have seen all the concessions that we will see from the Government? As the hon. Member for Cardiff, North suggested, they may be forced to make more concessions through the legal process; moreover, those in another place will have to scrutinise the Bill, and given the cross-party nature of what we are debating today, I strongly suspect that they will insist on changes.</p>

 That is true. Many of us fear that people will have to wait even longer for a solution the shape of which looks obvious to most of us, and which we feel we might as well get on with delivering rather than putting those people through more pain. Moreover, many Members in all parts of the House fear that if we miss this opportunity, we may not have another opportunity to impose a sensible solution on the Government through the will of the House of Commons and, perhaps, that of another place.</p>

As the Minister said, it is not the substance of the amendments, but the issue of finance. The Government have already moved enormously to deliver a substantial part&#151;now the majority&#151;of the compensation for which we are asking. They say that they want to consider the process of annuitisation and that of securing unclaimed assets. The Minister has acknowledged that the costing figures that he has given today for delivery of the extra element of compensation do not include offsets from tax revenue from means-tested benefits. What does it all come down to, provided that the Government can secure some unclaimed assets? It seems to come down to the determination of the Government, or perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not to concede what in public expenditure terms is a minuscule amount of money.</p>

They are now virtually where they will end up anyway. The Minister&#146;s arguments are very unconvincing. Given the closeness of his aspirations to those shared by almost every other Member, he would do a service to all of us&#151;but mostly to the pensioners who are waiting for a settlement&#151;if he were to get on with delivering it. It is fairly obvious that we will end up with a package of a certain shape in one way or another; the question is whether that happens quickly or slowly.</p>

 The Bill is in many respects a reckoning with the future of pensions, but it contains within it the reckoning with the past. We all wish that it did not do so because it would be nice simply to move on to the sunnier uplands of pensions policy to come. However, as several Members have said, the fact is that many people are not able to move on as they have lost their pension. They look to this House to do something about that&#151;legitimately because an Officer of this House, the ombudsman. has conducted an exhaustive inquiry to establish exactly what happened and whether there was any Government role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07041863000441">I must confess that when I started to think about this matter&#151;before I had read the ombudsman report, and before the Public Administration Committee started taking evidence on it and talking to some of the people involved&#151;I took a different view from that which I now hold. I thought, &#147;Well, the world&#146;s an uncertain place and risky things can happen; pensions are fragile objects and we have to live with such events.&#148; However, the more I examined the subject the less I could sustain that position. After 1994&#151;after Maxwell&#151;we believed that we had put in place a framework of protection that would prevent such things from happening again. The ombudsman was able to show in detail that in terms of what had been said about that framework of protection&#151;the descriptions of the amount of safety that there was in the schemes&#151;there had been maladministration. That is not simply a proposition of mine; it has now been demonstrated. It has been upheld in the High Court, so we know it to be the case. Therefore, we have moved on from that argument.</p>

That is not true. There is some liability, but the major point is that the only body or person who can organise a remedy and sort out this situation are the Government. The Government have been trying to do so, and we must welcome the fact that we have made huge progress. This is a bit like building a house. Originally, when we began with the financial assistance scheme, the Government erected one wall and said, &#147;There&#146;s some shelter&#148; and we said, &#147;But one wall isn&#146;t good enough.&#148; So they added another wall and said, &#147;There we are; that&#146;s better shelter&#148; and it was better, but we again said, &#147;It&#146;s not good enough.&#148; After that, in the Budget they added two more walls. We have the surrounding structure of a house now. That is vastly better, but we then said, &#147;But we still haven&#146;t got the roof on.&#148; The Government have responded by saying, &#147;No, we haven&#146;t got the roof on, but we know a man who can find the wherewithal to put the roof on.&#148; The Opposition have said in return, &#147;We can do better than that: we have got a man who can loan us the money to find the man who will put the roof on.&#148; Frankly, I do not care where the roof comes from. Most Members accept that we need the roof on&#151;that we need to reach Pension Protection Fund levels. As has been said, that is a responsibility of the House&#151;of all Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07041863000443">Let us consider the history of this matter. It started with the last Government. Some of the most offending  <br>

literature in maladministration terms occurred under the last Government. However, the point about ombudsman investigations and all that flows from them is that responsibility is handed back to the House. When the ombudsman system was put in place exactly 40 years ago, the House sensibly decided not to give the ombudsman the ability to impose remedies. She would have the ability to investigate without any hindrance and operate completely independently and then to report to the House. She can suggest lines of remedy, but not impose them. The responsibility for that comes back to Members. We must decide what is the right thing to do. That is what we are faced with in this context. We did not think that the Government had done enough when they produced one wall, or two walls, or now when they have produced four walls. We still want to talk about putting the roof on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07041863000444">I know that the Opposition and the Government are terrified of public spending, but there are times when we have to say, &#147;We have an obligation to spend the money to do the right thing&#151;we would like not to spend it, but we have an obligation to do the right thing.&#148; I say to both the Government and the official Opposition that I wish that they were both saying that, because the official Opposition are going to some lengths not to say that&#151;but instead to say that they are not prepared to sign up to propositions that commit them to moving to PPF levels. It would be easier for the House if we could test the proposition of whether we wanted to do that, and then worry about the mechanisms for doing it. The incentive to find mechanisms that work would be greater if we had committed ourselves to the objective. That might be the effect of new clause 41 and associated measures, and that is why I shall support them. Even funny money is better than no money at all, and I am prepared to accept it on that basis&#151;although the Government are entitled to say to the Opposition that it is funny money and that they must answer for that.</p>

The compensation available applies only in cases where there has been an insolvency event. That has left high and dry about 8,000 people who have been in solvent employer schemes. We all recognise that they are in exactly the same position in terms of the loss of their pension as everybody else and that there are no grounds on which we could possibly want to exclude them. New clause 25 brings their schemes&#151;we seem to agree on the numbers&#151;into the package that is being developed. The Minister is entitled to say that the amendments under discussion were devised over the weekend in a great hurry, but I can assure him that this one was not. A good deal of time and authority has been invested in it in this House. It comes with some good authority behind it. When the Minister says to me that it is technically deficient, my response is that I do not think that it is because it covers exactly the same kind of schemes that are eligible under section 286 of the Pensions Act 2004. It does not in effect say, &#147;Let&#146;s open the door to any scheme that might want to fold to get some protection.&#148; It is explicitly contained within those parameters.</p>

 I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. We are looking at the same number of people&#151;some 8,000. I did not intend to criticise his drafting, but I have been advised that the new clause would let in an extra category. The intention is to include all schemes that were wound up unfunded, preventing an employer insolvency. New clause 25 would include schemes in which debt and winding up could not have forced an employer insolvency and, therefore, the employer was healthy enough to fund more of their pension liabilities. I am happy to discuss the issue with my hon. Friend, but I hope that I have given him the guarantee that he wants. We are trying to achieve the same aims and we are happy to return to the issue in the other place if necessary.</p>

 I have listened carefully to what the Minister said and I still have a concern. He appears to be acknowledging that there is a group of people without pensions who will remain without pensions or assistance because of something that their employer has or has not done. The essential fairness in this is that it is not the problem of the pensioner or the would-be pensioner if his employer has behaved badly or correctly. We are seeking a solution that deals with the problem from the pensioners&#146; perspective. It needs to be clear whether some people who see themselves as victims of this problem will still not be covered by what the Minister is offering.</p>

I do not accept, on technical grounds, the Minister&#146;s point that we would be opening the door.

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07041863000455">The issue was brought to my attention when I was a parliamentary candidate in Hemel Hempstead some six years ago. Just after I was selected, the former Dexion workers committee came to see me. They asked me to read their file&#151;it was about 6 in deep&#151;and give them my opinion on whether they had been treated fairly and with dignity, whether natural justice had been done and whether trust in Parliament and pension schemes could ever be restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07041863000456">I read every word, and when I went back to the committee I was tested. They did not trust me: they did not trust any politician. I do not think that they do today. They wanted to know whether I had read and understood the file, and whether I agreed with them that no matter who was in power, or who had made the mistakes, they had been treated appallingly. At the time, there were just over 700 of them, mostly men, but some ladies, who had paid into a scheme, at one stage, compulsorily. Following legislation, membership of the scheme was voluntary, but nobody left it because it was very good. Some people had paid in for 35 years and more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07041863000457">The campaigners had huge dignity, but they had already been around the country taking their clothes off in public. They were middle-aged men and women who had worked all their lives, done the decent thing and did not want to scrounge off the state. They did not want means-tested benefits. They wanted to work until their time for retirement came and to pay in a fair amount of money to be kept safe for them, and for their loved ones when their time came to pass on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70418-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07041863000458">I told the campaigners that they desperately needed to put their case before the parliamentary ombudsman&#151;the place for justice in the mother of all Parliaments. I fought hard&#151;and it is hard for a parliamentary candidate&#151;to get the ombudsman to listen to their case. I went to Front-Bench colleagues and asked them to read the file, but they said that they had seen the same thing happen to other schemes and that it should go to the ombudsman.</p>

especially in a scheme set up 40 years ago, but it is for her to have unrestricted access to the facts and to come to a decision as to whether our constituents had been let down by the system, Parliament and the Government of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07041863000460">I have just met some of the campaigners, and I apologise for not being present for the whole debate. They still do not understand why the Government did not accept the ombudsman&#146;s decision. They have come so far. It is as though a velvet revolution has taken place. The hon. Gentleman said that when he first looked at the issue, he thought that such things happen in a market system, but a groundswell of opinion, led by many Labour Members and others&#151;I have pushed it hard myself since coming here&#151;has convinced my Front-Bench colleagues, the Liberal Democrat Front Bench and Ministers. People who told me 18 months ago that they would never support a scheme under which the Government would compensate those who lost out, because it was not the Government&#146;s fault, have now decided&#151;rightly, in my opinion&#151;that they do need help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07041863000461">This is not about party politics, as the Minister has joined me in meeting delegations of widows. I shall say more about the widows in a moment, but the Secretary of State, only days after taking up his post, also met a delegation that I brought to him. I passionately believe that the Department for Work and Pensions wants to settle this matter once and for all. None of us has any doubt about that, so why on earth can it not be resolved today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07041863000462">The Minister has made another move in our direction, and the Treasury seems to have come up with some extra money so that he can compensate the 8,000 people who are not covered by present schemes. We may not know where the money has come from, but we know that it is available. In the greater scheme of things, the sum involved is, frankly, peanuts. I am proud to be a member of the Health Select Committee, and we know that Government spending on the NHS now totals &#163;100 billion. Where it goes is another question, but that is a huge amount. In contrast, we are talking about only &#163;30 million a year to compensate the people who have lost out. That sum is expected to rise to around &#163;100 million, and then fall again.</p>

I do not understand why my party&#146;s Front-Bench spokesmen do not agree with the proposal. I have said that to them in private, and now I do so in public. We are talking about only 30 million quid, so we should make it available today. The lifeboat scheme that we have come up with has been prepared with the help of hon. Members of all parties. I hope that we will be able to vote on it later, because it will provide immediate help for the people who need it. They need that help today, not in six months or a year.

disproportionate levels of strokes and heart attacks suffered by the people who need our help. They are stressed out beyond belief, and that is because they are honourable people whose personal dignity means that they do not want to rely on means-tested benefits or charitable hand-outs.

Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) earlier: we have it in our power today to make a decision to put an end to the gross injustice that decent people, who have saved and done everything required of them, have been cheated of their inheritance. We should make that decision for justice&#146;s sake, but we should also make it for the Government&#146;s sake, because they still seem unable to realise that as long as that sore continues to fester, they will find it impossible to kick-start the savings habit in our community. Why should one save when one knows that all too many people who did precisely that at the Government&#146;s behest now feel themselves cheated? Today, we can stop that cheating by supporting new clause 41 and I hope we shall do so.</p>

 I, too, will be brief. I want to support new clause 25 tabled by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright).</p>

They have been left out of the financial assistance scheme, although there is little to choose between what has happened to them and to insolvent employers. I cite the case of a scheme in the small burgh of Kirriemuir in my constituency. The company remains in being&#151;indeed, it provides valuable jobs in the community&#151;yet workers nearing retirement find that their pensions provide nothing like the sums they expected. The scheme is being wound up and the value of each pensioner&#146;s pot is to be paid into a private pension scheme. An employee described for me the situation when they were told that the scheme was being would up: they were told, in effect, &#147;It&#146;s your pension or your job&#148;. It is difficult for people in small communities to come to terms with that.</p>

I am sure that new clause 25 would cover their situation, but it is a great pity that we do not have the Minister&#146;s proposals. What tests will he apply in relation to insolvency? What evidence will a company have to produce before it can be covered by the new scheme? In the case I described, the employees were told that the company would go into insolvency unless the scheme was wound up.</p>

I realise that for many Members the whole question of the administration of pension funds is extremely complex and detailed. I find it useful to refer back to the time when I started as a county councillor in Nottinghamshire. We had just appointed a chief executive&#151;a person who, at that time, called himself Mick Lyons. He has been elevated somewhat since then. He invited us to identify problems in the administration of local government within the county. A number of us identified that schools were having serious problems in accessing the resources that they needed. He got a number of councillors and a number of the officers in different departments together and he asked people to explain what the problem was and what was causing the gap between the time when the schools sought to requisition pencils and paper and the time when anything arrived. The delay was often six weeks, two months or two and a half months. He listened patiently to the explanations from officials in different departments for about 20 to 25 minutes. Then suddenly he banged his hand on the table and said, &#147;Right. I&#146;ve got a plan.&#148; Everyone shut up and listened to him. He said, &#147;Send the bloody pencils and the paperwork can follow. I don&#146;t care about the paperwork that follows. It&#146;s not that it&#146;s not important, but schools are about learning. It is about delivering the resources for learning. If schools haven&#146;t got pencils and paper, we are undermining their primary function. So send the bloody pencils.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07041863000491">If we were having that same debate among ourselves today, the central issue would be, &#147;Send the bloody pensions.&#148; It is not about the technicalities. The reason why I support new clause 41, which is a cross-party new clause, is that it says precisely that. We have a moral duty to pay people&#146;s pensions today and to use the lifeboat fund to work out among ourselves how best to reclaim the resources that we have at our fingertips in order to do that. My only quibble in political terms is that I wish that new clause 41 had been tabled principally in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), because, as been acknowledged, the origin of almost everything in that  <br>

new clause was rightly encapsulated in the private Member&#146;s Bill that he presented to the House in 2002. It would be helpful for our own Members to be able to recognise and claim the integrity of that as a starting point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07041863000492">But I no longer care who claims the credit. What I am concerned about is that we are dealing with people who have never asked for a penny of a handout in their lives. They are people who have done what successive Governments have asked them to do: take money out of their weekly and monthly earnings and put it into pension funds in order to provide for their old age. We will not be able to convince successive generations who follow that that is a sensible step if their parents or grandparents say to them: &#147;We were mugs. We put the money aside and people stole it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07041863000493">The great attraction of what is incorporated in new clause 41 is that it allows us to draw a simple line under a debate that will not go away if as a House we fail to take this decision today. New clause 41 brings everyone under the cover of the Pension Protection Fund. It does not say that there is going to be a huge delay. It says that we will pay out today and that we will work out how we will reclaim and repay the assets afterwards. It does not presume that there are billions of pounds to be found. However, the volume of unclaimed assets in this country is about &#163;15 billion&#151;&#163;3 billion in unclaimed pension funds, &#163;5 billion in terms of banks and building societies, &#163;3 billion in national savings, and another &#163;1 billion to &#163;2 billion in residual assets in the existing schemes. So we would not be short of possible sources. Nor is it true to say that all that money would have to be found now. My understanding is that the &#163;600 million that would need to be put aside works out, on the Government&#146;s own figures, at about &#163;20 million a year. Just to provide a reference point, we should understand that the error factor in the Department for Work and Pensions budget for the administration of benefits last year was not &#163;20 million, but &#163;700 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07041863000494">It is not beyond the Government&#146;s and the House&#146;s capacity to incorporate everyone affected into a scheme that would achieve what we promised at the end of the Maxwell fiasco. We promised people then that it would never happen again. Yet we now find ourselves in a position, five years after an event, in which many people who saved throughout their lives are living&#151;and, in some cases, dying&#151;in abject poverty. That is morally outrageous and morally indefensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70418-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07041863000495">I would like to end on a non-technical and non-political point with the line of a song by Tracy Chapman&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I will spare the House by not singing it! In that song, she said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07041863000498">I represent a significant number of former employees of the Albert Fisher group, who have lost the bulk of their pensions. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, I have had numerous meetings with that group, as a result of which I have also met many other people involved in different pension action groups. One thing that struck me is that those people trusted the advice that they were given and invested their money&#151;their own wages&#151;in what they believed were safe products, only to have the rug pulled from under them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07041863000499">I would like to pick up on one point that the Chancellor made yesterday. When he was justifying the changes to dividend tax credits in the 1998 Budget, he said that they were more than compensated for by cuts in corporation tax. However, dozens of companies did not benefit from those cuts because they were either breaking even or making a loss. In the case of the Albert Fisher group, part of the food processing sector, particularly the frozen food sector, was struggling and under very substantial pressure. That company was not making a profit, so the concessions on corporation tax were of absolutely no benefit whatever&#151;and the same applies to dozens of other companies as well. What the Chancellor said yesterday was irrelevant to those companies, which got no benefit from corporation tax changes, so the hit to them in respect of pension funds was direct and immediate. There was immediate pain and the result was that many of the pension schemes went bust with people suffering as a consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07041863000500">I intervened earlier on the Minister, who was very critical of the Opposition amendments, but those amendments had been carefully thought through. They were not worked out on the back of a cigarette packet over the weekend. A number of experts gave us advice. As to Ros Altmann, she has a huge amount of experience and commands phenomenal respect. To be fair, until quite recently, Ros Altmann was saying that what we were doing with our draft amendments was not good enough. She said that the amendments did not go far enough, were not properly drafted and were technically incorrect, so Opposition Front Benchers put a great deal of effort and work into drawing up a package of measures&#151;the amendments and new clauses&#151;that would go as far as possible and, above all, give these people some immediate respite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07041863000501">On the point about a review, we have had endless reviews. Time and again, the Government have introduced changes and initiatives, and every time, they creep a little bit further towards the full measures that those people want and deserve. What we want now&#151;what is on offer with these amendments and new clauses&#151;is immediate relief. What those people want is immediate relief. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said a moment ago, a lot of those people are suffering as we speak. Many of them are ill. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07041863000502">Lots of very proud people were looking forward to a long and happy retirement, but they have had that retirement totally undermined and destroyed. Those people deserve immediate action. They want immediate action. We have a huge opportunity this afternoon to give them that action, and there is a very strong moral case for doing so. I appeal to Labour Members to support these amendments, because a lot of people are watching them very carefully. If they support us, those people will have the relief that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07041863000504">On 22 January 2002, I was fortunate enough to secure a debate in Westminster Hall that allowed me to raise the plight of more than 1,000 former workers of United Engineering Forgings in the United Kingdom who had lost most of their expected pensions when the company went into administration. Since then, as we have heard, along with my colleagues on the Labour Benches, I have tabled early-day motions, tabled amendments, met Ministers and generally campaigned with the trade unions for a solution to what I still see as a major injustice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07041863000505">The Government recognised that injustice and the fact that hard-working people had been affected, but they did not recognise that compensation was required. However, as other hon. Members have said in the debate today, we achieved incremental success in securing help for those who lost out and, crucially, legislation has been passed to ensure that never again will people be deprived of the pensions that they have paid into all their working lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07041863000506">The Government have said at every stage of the debate so far that they have gone as far as they can go, and subsequently, they have gone further. So I am very interested to hear what the Minister said about the fact that they are prepared to go further again. There is no question but that a substantial amount of public money has been allocated to the financial assistance scheme&#151;something that has not been adequately recognised in the debate or in general over the past five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70418-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07041863000507">The Conservative party said before the last election that it would not commit any further public money than had been committed already to the financial assistance scheme.

I have always thought it quite ironic that those who campaigned for justice in this matter will receive less as things stand at the moment than the beneficiaries of their campaign in the form of the Pension Protection Fund. Therefore, I believe that there should be equity. According to the trade unions, they have evidence that the &#163;8 billion may in any case be enough to settle that issue. I do not know whether that is the case, but, obviously, it would be welcome. The Government have set up a review and said that they are open to suggestions.

They are far too keen to set up the personal accounts delivery authority and leave it to the authority to sort out the detailed design of personal accounts and make all the difficult decisions. We do not see it that way at all. There are serious issues that need to be addressed now, and in the next pensions Bill&#151;there is always another pensions Bill around the corner&#151;by politicians. I am not suggesting for a moment that we should second-guess the experts on the detailed technical stuff, but it is the job of politicians to make decisions about the broad structure of personal accounts and the way in which they sit alongside existing pension provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07041863001102">The best indicator of that is the Government&#146;s attitude to the contribution cap. The Turner commission could not have been clearer in its recommendation that it should be set at &#163;3,000, and the official Opposition agree with that level. It is a ground for genuine concern that the Government inexplicably announced that they wished to increase it to &#163;5,000, which would mean that personal accounts could include nearly 95 per cent. of existing pension savers, thereby straying a long way from the concept of the target audience. We were therefore delighted when in a recent answer at DWP questions the Secretary of State said that he was reconsidering the level of the cap. That is a relief for us, as an increase to &#163;5,000 would be unacceptable and would jeopardise the future of consensus building between the main parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07041863001103">Some argue for an even higher cap or no cap. With all due respect, I believe that they are misguided and fail to grasp that the point of personal accounts is to target the unpensioned. We therefore wish to make it clear that the success or failure of personal accounts crucially depends on increasing not only the number of savers but savings overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07041863001104">Proposed paragraph (b) is self-explanatory. The point is to optimise participation among the target group as defined in the Government&#146;s White Paper. Proposed paragraph (e) expresses our concern about the dangers of levelling down. It is said that some levelling down has already occurred and, with more than 60,000 schemes closed on the Government&#146;s watch, that can hardly be denied. The Minister is fond of saying that there is currently nothing to stop levelling down. However, how many companies, having calculated the cost of increased participation based on auto-enrolment, will be tempted to close their existing and more generous schemes and point their employees towards personal accounts? It will be all too easy for the contribution levels inherent in personal accounts to be perceived as the norm whereas they will not deliver a comfortable retirement.</p>

However, the contribution cap is an important litmus test of the Government&#146;s true intentions in the Bill. Do they genuinely intend to target those groups in society that do not save for their retirement or are they more concerned with the back-door nationalisation of the most successful private pensions system in the world?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07041863001106">New clause 29 deals with means-testing, which is a cancer that eats away at saving for retirement. It can be intrusive and demeaning and it is no guarantee that help will get to those who need it most. Pension credit has tested to destruction the theory that means-testing is the answer to poverty. Some 1.5 million people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, and some 2 million pensioners live in poverty in this country. The ABI&#151;I am happy to rely on its views on the matter and on many other issues&#151;stated that much greater clarity was needed on the Bill&#146;s impact on future levels of means-testing. That is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07041863001107">There are conflicting views about means-testing, even in Government. The Chancellor is keen to extend the number of people who depend on the state. He has vastly increased the number of people who are employed by the state. Approximately a third of people&#151;more in Scotland&#151;depend on the state for all or part of their livelihood. Nearly 50 per cent. of pensioners are already subject to means-tested benefits. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07041863001108">To their credit, Department for Work and Pensions Ministers, in extolling the virtues of their pension reforms, point to the fact that, if we go on as we are, some 80 per cent. of pensioners will be means-tested by the middle of the century. On any view, the likely amount of means-testing after the reforms will be crucial to the success or failure of personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70418-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07041863001109">As the official Opposition, we naturally wish savings to be restored to the sort of levels that prevailed under the previous Conservative Government. Will personal accounts achieve that? I believe that the answer depends on whether means-testing can be reduced significantly. It was clear, even before the Bill was introduced, that significant differences existed between the Government&#146;s projections on means-testing and those of independent bodies such as the Pensions Policy Institute. It reaches sharply different conclusions from those of the DWP.</p>

 I just want to clarify the intention of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause. We already have a situation in which more than 29 per cent. of pensioners are means-tested in retirement, and the figure was more than 29 per cent. when the Conservative party was in power. It is also forecast to be more than 29 per cent. in 2012. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Conservatives would not introduce personal accounts unless the figure dropped below 29 per cent.?

Apart from anything else, how will people near the beginning of their careers know whether they will be one of the third, or one of the two thirds?

Anyway, we all duly turned up and listened to the views of the DWP and the PPI. By the end of the seminar, I was&#151;as F. E. Smith might have put it&#151;none the wiser but much better informed. It was clear that different methodologies were being used by the two contenders. For example, the PPI included the effects of housing benefit, but the DWP did not. Where the PPI failed to score was that, unlike the DWP, it did not have an amazing machine whirring away in the basement to produce its projections.</p>

The 29 per cent. figure is a Government figure; they project that the proportion of means-testing will fall from about 45 per cent. to about 29 per cent. by 2050, following the reforms.

I ask those questions not just as a member of the official Opposition and not just in a spirit of consensus on long-term pension reform, although that is important. I ask them also because we do not wish to inherit a system that has clearly been set up to fail. These are issues that need to be addressed now.</p>

 What would the hon. Gentleman count as means-tested benefits? If the aim of the Opposition&#151;who obviously want to be the Government&#151;is to phase them out, I think people would like to know whether they include housing benefit, council tax benefit and the various disability and carers&#146; top-ups.</p>

 The hon. Lady, whose contribution to the Committee was greatly valued, has more or less summarised the benefits that I would include. Council tax benefit, which she mentioned, has a lower take-up than any other means-tested benefit. We should recognise, as a matter of practical politics, that there will always be some means-testing in the system, because there will always be people who are sufficiently poor to need help from means-tested benefits. As I have said, the problem with mass means-testing of benefits such as pension credit is that many people who are entitled to those benefits do not claim them, for whatever reason. I am sure that in our constituencies we all do our best to encourage home visits by the Pension Service, and encourage people to make the telephone call that enables them to fill up the form.</p>

We think that both Front Benches, in a spirit of consensus, should aspire to reduce means-testing in the medium term, which may mean committing funds to increasing the state pension even further than is envisaged in the reforms. Those, however, are aspirations rather than current spending commitments. </p>

 It is a pleasure to have become involved at this late stage in such an important Bill. I have observed its progress closely, although my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) has been very much in the driving seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70418-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07041863001128">Let me say a little about amendment No. 7. It dwells in detail on points that the hon.

It seeks to provide a mechanism for clarifying some of the issues he described about the likely extent of continued means-testing under the new arrangements proposed in the Bill and to offer objective analysis of that issue. It also seeks to offer analysis of the likely returns that different groups of people who will be auto-enrolled into personal accounts might expect to receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70418-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07041863001129">The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to a seminar that I and many other Members attended. It sought to clarify the difference between various assessments&#151;principally the Government&#146;s assessment and that of the Pensions Policy Institute&#151;of the proportion of people who will be subject to means-testing under the Government&#146;s proposed pension arrangements. It forecast that the proportion will probably be about 29 per cent.&#151;that is still its central estimate&#151;but the PPI has suggested that about 45 per cent. of pensioners are likely to be subject to means-testing. The seminar clarified the reasoning behind those different estimates. As someone who is not a pensions expert, the evidence seemed to me to leave a wide range of possibilities about the proportion of people who will be auto-enrolled into personal accounts and who will continue to be in receipt of means-tested pension benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70418-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07041863001130">That will have a substantial impact on how worth while it is for someone to save in a personal account and on other aspects of their personal circumstances.

It would be wrong for the House to consider a Bill that would set up such personal accounts without having that important information to hand. We also need to have information about the likely returns of such accounts. Such information is also critical to the marketing and promotion of personal accounts. The hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned generic advice, but there are big questions about whether saving in personal accounts would be worth while for some people in that category, depending on the outcome in relation to means testing and the returns that they can expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70418-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07041863001138">I challenge the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) about the benefits he was including in the general category of means testing. We have all heard that term endlessly and we have all heard our constituents say that they do not particularly like means-tested benefits. When they say that, they mean particular aspects of the pension credit. By and large, the people who most dislike the means-testing of pension credit are those who are not entitled to receive it. I have never yet heard someone who is entitled to pension credit actually complain about the process for getting it. If we included all the other benefits to which old people might be entitled in the first place, we would strangle the personal accounts at birth, which would be a great shame. That would say to people that either they should rely on personal accounts and self-provision, or that they should be dependent on the state. The reality for many people is that it will be a combination of both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70418-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07041863001139">Many of my constituents will need both forms of provision, because many of them work part time. Others may work all the hours God sends, but they are not on very high wages. The personal accounts will work well for them, but in some instances they will need top-ups. Some of my constituents bought their council houses, and they will not need to worry about housing benefit, but those in rented accommodation will still need housing benefit. I think that they would regard that not as a means-tested benefit, but as part of the income package that they need to get by each month. The same applies to council tax credit and the various disability benefits and carer allowances that some people need to increase their income.</p>

 I am following very closely what the hon. Lady is saying, but has she seen the figures produced by the Pensions Policy Institute? Unlike the DWP, it takes account of housing benefit in its projections of those who will benefit from personal accounts. The forecast shows that men with full national insurance records who rent in retirement will be in the high-risk category. Housing benefit will make a crucial difference for some people, and we cannot just ignore that by saying that personal accounts will be a jolly good thing for most. Factors such as that really must be taken into account.</p>

 I agree that the Liberal Democrats should also tell us what they mean by the phrase &#147;means-tested benefits&#148;, but the existing advice systems are supposed to be able to provide the information to which my hon.

Independent financial advisers are supposed to give people advice on benefits&#151;goodness knows how!&#151;but, equally, advice is also supposed to be given to them by the agencies dispensing the benefits. Those arrangements are designed to ensure that people make decisions based on what is in their best financial interest. We should not label as &#147;means testing&#148; all state support that takes into account someone&#146;s personal finances. For instance, the carers allowance, or the carers or disability supplements to pension credit, are not examples of means testing: instead, they offer&#151;in a dignified and proper way&#151;substantial support so that people in retirement can have a decent standard of living.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman suggests is a bit like telling people on the welfare to work scheme that it is better for some of them to remain unemployed and simply live on benefits. We want a system that encourages people to provide for themselves, which means that we must show robust support for self-provision. However, we must also recognise that this is not an either/or choice, as people who make private provision will also need top-ups. We must not suggest that it is some kind of disgrace to apply for the other benefits, or that it is degrading to do so because of the implied element of means testing.

In their substance, however, they treat the delivery authority as though it would take decisions on personal accounts, whereas all that we are setting up under the Bill is an authority that can advise the Government so that the Government can take those decisions. Although I realise that these are probing amendments, on the issue of whether we should set objectives for such an advisory authority, it is quite clear that those objectives should be for Government&#151;exactly as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said in his introductory remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70418-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07041863001162">I want to turn to the points that the hon. Gentleman made. First, on amendment No. 3, he has slightly misunderstood the kind of guidance that we are talking about. As I said, the delivery authority is going to be advisory. It will support the Government in understanding the operational and commercial implications of policy options. It is therefore right that the Secretary of State is able to issue appropriate guidance from time to time, but a lot of that guidance is going to be fairly trivial. It will be on the format and presentation of the advice, and who should be consulted within the Department for Work and Pensions or other parts of Government. To specify that such ad hoc guidance must be subject to a length parliamentary process would impede the ability of the authority and the Secretary of State to move flexibly and quickly. Indeed, to suggest that for this initial short phase we should have a 40-day delay every time we want to issue guidance would be verging on the sclerotic and would be quite disproportionate. It is quite right that that advice should be given on a basis that people can look at. We want to make sure that we continue on the basis of the open and consultative process that we have had to date. But it would be a mistake for a formal relationship and formal commitments in relation to publication and consultation with Parliament to be included in the Bill. </p>

We want to give enough headroom for people to be able to contribute above that and achieve a higher pension in retirement.

whether we should or should not have means-testing. The truth is that all parties know that, whichever Government are in power and whatever scheme they come up with, there will always be a certain amount of means-testing. The question is therefore not whether there should or should not be means-testing, but what is the right balance between universal benefits and means-tested benefits and how fast should we taper away those means-tested benefits.</p>

The truth is that the proportion of pensioners who claim means-tested benefits is far lower than in the past. Today, about a third of pensioner families claim means-tested benefits; in 1979, nearly two thirds did so. If our pension system has been affected by the level of means-testing, it should have been affected positively by the trends that have occurred. Indeed, the proportion of pensioner families who claim means-tested benefits has fallen since 1997. The question is not what that has done to saving today, but what can we do to encourage saving in the future. That is exactly what the Pensions Commission considered.</p>

 No, the figure is not going up, exactly because of the Bill, but if that happened the vast the majority of the generation starting work today, who would retire in 2050, would expect to be affected by means-testing once they reach retirement. The reforms recommended by the Pensions Commission and implemented by the Bill address that situation. They make the basic state pension and the state second pension more generous, so that individuals with a good contribution record will be able to retire on &#163;135 a week from their basic state pension and state second pension&#151;well above the level of the pension credit&#151;and their private savings will come on top of that.</p>

 When the hon. Gentleman is Pensions Minister in 2050, or even in 2040 or 2030, he will be able to deal with that. We have clearly set out a set of policies that we want to make work. The reason why I am slightly reluctant to answer his question&#151;something that he may have spotted&#151;is that it is a question of what is the right balance to reduce poverty. It is not about picking an abstract number out of thin air. For example, as was persuasively pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), the Front-Bench team could just say, &#147;We will get rid of council tax benefit and housing benefit.&#148; That would reduce means-testing in retirement by a huge proportion, but they would not want to do that because it would push people into poverty unjustifiably. Therefore, we should all aim to create a policy that delivers the right balance between universal benefits and means-tested benefits to ensure that people do not fall into unacceptable levels of poverty.</p>

People can get to that &#163;135 through a full life of caring, and caring contributions will be put on the same footing as working contributions&#151;something that is extremely welcome&#151;but their private savings will come on top of that. Many long-term savers in personal accounts can expect to get returns of at least &#163;2 for every &#163;1 initially invested by the individual.</p>

We can all seek together, through the Bill, to create a consensus, but I warn particularly Liberal Democrat Members about looking for a level of certainty that is so great that it makes the scheme impossible. If the Liberal Democrats want to sign up to automatic enrolment, as I believe that they do, they will have to accept that we will be giving people a reasonable understanding of their future, rather than a perfect 20:20 prediction&#151;no one could aim to do that.</p>

should have a safety net to prevent unacceptable poverty in retirement, which is what pension credit becomes thanks to these reforms. The proportion of people entitled to pension credit will be reduced to less than 30 per cent. by 2050. There will thus be two main groups of people who will benefit from pension credit: those whose working lives did not turn out as they hoped and were not able to make contributions through working or caring to lift themselves above the means-tested level; and, just as importantly&#151;and inconveniently for the policy of the Liberal Democrats&#151;people who get more than &#163;119 in retirement because they are disabled or caring for someone, or because they have other costs. We teased the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) in Committee to tell us whether he planned to take money away from that second group of people, but I assume that he will continue to duck the question, given that that issue is the fatal flaw in his proposal.</p>

The first way would be to increase the basic state pension to the standard minimum guarantee level of &#163;119 a week, which is somewhere near the policy of the hon. Member for Yeovil. However, without making offsetting changes, that would cost &#163;20 billion, or 5p on income tax. If it were not enough that such a policy would be unaffordable, it is worth noting that it would not get rid of means-testing. It would reduce means-testing by only about a quarter, so while &#163;20 billion would be spent, the hon. Gentleman would still have to decide whether to support automatic enrolment because of, for example, the question of housing benefit, or the situation for people who got more in retirement because they were disabled. Perhaps he will tell us whether he would take money off the people whom we have been discussing for so long.</p>

 I will do so happily, provided that the hon. Member for Yeovil also tells us what he would do about the 80 per cent. of people who, in 2050, would be getting more than &#163;119. If the hon. Gentleman wants to tell us what he would do about people who got more than that amount because of disability or carers premiums or their state second pension&#151;if he wants to tell the public that his plan is to take that money away from them&#151;we will be happy to put that information in the Library. We are very happy to put it in the Library anyway, but I was trying yet again, rather pathetically, to get the hon. Gentleman to tell us what his policy is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07041863001197">The other way to reduce means-testing, of course, is to take money off poor people. The Tories seem to be saying that they do not want to increase the basic state pension, but they want to reduce the level of means-testing. The only way they could do that is by taking money off poor people, and I do not think that that is what they are planning to do. I am happy to let the hon. Member for Eastbourne intervene on me if he wants to. If that really is the Tories&#146; policy we are happy to debate it with them. Otherwise, the House will have to conclude that they want to make a noise about means-testing in general, without having any proposal to change what the Government are doing. We are happy to have that debate. We think that our proposals strike the right balance between enabling people to save for themselves and providing a safety net for them to fall back on&#151;a safety net that has lifted 2 million people out of pensioner poverty since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07041863001198">Amendment No. 7 would require the delivery authority to publish analysis of the interaction of means-testing with personal accounts as well as plans for the delivery of generic financial information. That would place an unnecessary extra pressure on the delivery authority in its initial stages by requiring it to carry out extensive and complex analysis in a short time and to duplicate some work already being undertaken in other areas. The Department for Work and Pensions and other experts will be providing much of the information that the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey are after. Indeed, we plan to invite them to a further series of seminars to discuss the information base over the next few decades.</p>

<p><a name="st_o295"><a name="07041863001199"><a name="70418-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="07041863002657"><b>Mr. Laws:</b>

 My officials have suggested a series of five seminars to which we could invite Front Benchers. I am happy to strike a bargain with the hon. Gentleman: if he wants to tell us how he is going to take money off disabled people and carers, we will invite him to all five seminars; otherwise, I propose to invite him to just two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07041863001201">We do not believe that it would be right to place that burden on the authority. We believe that it is right to have a proper information strategy and to look at what we can do to improve people&#146;s financial capability. We are working with Otto Thoreson and the Treasury on a study to research and design a national approach to generic financial advice, and rather than a false debate about means-testing, in which the House knows that  <br>

what we are talking about is where that balance should be struck, we should have a real debate about how to make that generic information and advice work so that people can make informed decisions about their future. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07041863001202">The debate has shown that personal accounts and automatic enrolment are of great interest to Members. Much of our debate has focused on the substance of personal accounts, and there will be opportunities to discuss that following our response to the White Paper, which will be published soon, and, subject to the will of Parliament, in legislation in the next Session. Rather than pre-empt that, I urge Members on both Front Benches not press their amendments and new clauses and instead to comfort themselves with the thought of the seminars that we will be holding between now and then so that they can table amendments in the next Session.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="07041863001203"><a name="70418-0017.htm_spnew2"><a name="07041863002659"><b>Mr. Waterson:</b>
 If the Minister thinks that he can threaten me by upping the rate of seminars to which he is going to invite me, he is absolutely right. I am seminared out, and the prospect of no fewer than five on one small subset of the issues is more than flesh and blood can bear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07041863001204">I have already made it clear that new clause 29 is a probing new clause and it has served its purpose, up to a point. Amendment No. 3 is not sufficiently important to press to a Division. However, I feel strongly about new clause 7. The Minister ought to feel equally strongly about it because it is largely looted from the wording in his own White Paper, so I do not understand why there is a problem putting that in the Bill. We have concerns, and it is not just us; the industry shares those concerns, as I said in my speech. On that basis, I would like to press new clause 7 to a vote.</p>

 I am delighted that despite our necessarily long debates on some of the earlier amendments, we have reached new clause 28 and amendment No. 15, which stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07041881000013">Members who regularly attended our debates in Committee will recall that we had a debate that I suspect will be very similar to this one because it dealt with a very similar issue. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) raised issues to do with caring, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt). It is recognised on both sides of the House that the Bill will benefit the position not only of many women but of many individuals who are carers because of the change that it makes to the national insurance contribution mechanism&#151;the reduced number of years&#151;and the other changes that the Government are implementing in relation to carers credit. We welcome those reforms, which have also been widely welcomed by groups with an interest in the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07041881000014">Without going back over all the debate in Committee that is already on the record, it is widely appreciated that some 40,000 individuals who are caring for 20 hours or more a week will not be covered by the Government&#146;s carers credit because they are not caring for someone who is in receipt of constant attendance allowance or the middle or highest rate of the care components of disability living allowance. The various bodies that represent carers&#151;the Equal Opportunities Commission and others&#151;have set out a series of helpful examples, which we discussed in Committee, of individuals whom hon. Members of all parties would want to benefit from the carers credit, but are left out of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07041881000015">The hon. Member for Northampton, North also raised the matter in Committee and we tabled various amendments, which were designed to remedy the position by introducing a process of certification by health and social care professionals for individuals who are engaged in caring for another person or persons for a minimum of 20 hours a week or more. In one of the great triumphs&#151;perhaps the great triumph&#151;of the Committee stage for the Liberal Democrats, the Minister responded constructively to a debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull initiated. He said that the Government were happy to explore certification and that they had various concerns about whether health professionals would have the expertise to quantify the hours of care, whether they would require payment, and how the new requirement on local authorities would fit into the overall Government approach to carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07041881000016">The Minister helpfully undertook to discuss the matter with the Department of Health and report back before the end of the Bill&#146;s passage. The new clause and amendment give us an opportunity to check on the Minister&#146;s progress and ensure that he has moved swiftly to deliver the relatively firm undertaking. It gives him an opportunity to tell us what progress has been made between the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health.</p>

 I am pleased that it is possible to discuss the subject again and have another chance to press my hon. Friend the Minister. We want to ensure that the proposals are taken forward and that we get greater recognition for carers in the Bill.</p>

Friend for some time on a range of carers&#146; issues, but especially on proper recognition for the role of carers. The amendment deals with that. The Bill includes important proposals to improve carers&#146; pension rights but the number and range of people who come within its scope are disappointing. We need to ensure that the work that all carers do, when it amounts to a full job, is properly recognised so that people do not lose out simply because their sort of caring does not tick every single box on the entitlement to carers credit sheet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70418-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07041881000020">There must be a process to ensure that we have a robust way in which to decide who should qualify for the credit. It will not help carers if the credit is cheapened by being provided too easily. As I have previously argued, it is important to conduct the assessment of the carer&#146;s work during the caring assessment, which the local authority undertakes. That would properly involve social services and health care professionals and would also rely on a robust decision-making process, which is conducted by the social services authority and rests with it rather than the health authority. I would hope that discussions on these issues will take place before any regulations are put in place. I feel that to introduce those regulations by the end of the year would be too soon, although I acknowledge that they have to be brought in within a year.</p>

For example, those carrying out the assessment might look at the number of people being cared for, and at the type of disability involved. Rather than looking at just one or the other, however, they should be able to look at a complex situation in the round, to see exactly what the person is doing. For example, a woman might be looking after a number of neighbours, none of whom receives any of the qualifying benefits, and none of whom would be able to manage without her support. She would thereby be excluded from taking a job, but she should be able to benefit because of the type of care she is providing, and the range of conditions and the number of people involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07041881000022">I would hope that such provision would include family members.

press my hon. Friend the Minister on this issue. It involves a range of issues about disability benefits and carers benefits, but this specific question regarding pensions is really important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07041881000023">This usually affects women, although I accept that it can involve men as well. Often, women who have spent their whole lives caring for people and been unable to go out to work as a result will have to go out to work after retirement because they do not have the appropriate pension entitlements and cannot get benefits. They have to find an income somehow, but just at the time when they should be looking for more support from the state, they have to go out to work. A small cost would achieve a massive gain for this vulnerable group of pensioners. They make a huge contribution to society and are completely entitled to our support in retirement. I hope that my hon. Friend will make clear his commitment to establishing a proper process and a robust certification procedure to ensure that these people and the service that they provide to people with disabilities and to the wider society are properly recognised in their retirement.</p>

 I will endeavour to be brief as we do not have much time. New clause 28 and amendment No. 15 cover ground that was well covered by our deliberations on clause 3 in the Public Bill Committee. However, it is worth mentioning again the predicament of carers and the reasons why my hon. Friends and I are pleased to support the measures in the Bill that support them, some of which were in our 2005 manifesto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07041881000025">There are 6 million carers in the United Kingdom, one in five of whom give up employment to care and have gaps in their pension record as a result. Carers UK estimates that, by 2037, there could be as many as 9 million carers&#151;an increase of 3 million. The Government estimate that the effect of clause 3&#151;which new clause 28 and amendment No. 15 seek to amend&#151;will be that, by 2010, an additional 120,000 carers who care for more than 20 hours a week will gain entitlement to the basic state pension, and that an additional 180,000 such carers will gain entitlement to the state second pension. As the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) has pointed out, that leaves 40,000 people who might not accrue rights to the basic state pension and 60,000 who might not accrue rights to the state second pension, if they do not have 30 qualifying years at pensionable age. It is odd that the Government have sought to base the eligibility criteria for carers&#146; credits on the benefits of the person being cared for, rather than on the circumstances of the carer.</p>

constant attendance allowance, or the middle or higher-rate care component of disability living allowance will be &#163;800 million by 2050. That was revealed on 29 March in written answer 303 in the House of Lords, asked by Lady Hollis. The Government have already made a considerable financial commitment. Is there a maximum amount that the Government are prepared to spend per year on carers national insurance credit?

 I shall be extremely brief. We have heard some excellent speeches, and I do not want to duplicate what has been said by other Members, all of whom have spoken in favour of new clause 28.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07041881000032">The principle is that carers credit is for the carer, not the person being cared for. Carers UK believes that a system of certification can be made to work, and that carers should not be punished for the inflexibility of the current system. As was explained by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), some people are not covered through no fault of their own. Someone caring for several people on the lower rate of disability living allowance, or a woman who looks after a schizophrenic husband who is not prepared to claim disability living allowance but needs constant care, cannot claim carers allowance, home responsibilities protection or carers national insurance credit .</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07041881000033">Many organisations recommend a system of accreditation, involving a standard form with a space for an approved professional to certify that a carer is working for 20 or more hours a week. In Committee, we had a fairly long discussion on whether a doctor would be an appropriate person. I think that appropriate people would be those who were involved with the disabled person and his or her carer at home, such as members of social services departments, local education authorities&#151;in the case of those with special educational needs&#151;and community mental health teams, or community nurses and other health professionals who are in constant contact with patient and carer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07041881000034">The Women&#146;s Pensions Network, which includes groups such as Age Concern, Help the Aged and the Equal Opportunities Campaign, agrees that justice is needed for the people affected by the present system&#151;40,000 according to Carers UK, although the EOC estimates that the number is closer to 50,000. In fact, it is not merely a question of the number of people affected; it is a question of justice for those who have fallen through the net of an inflexible framework. The Minister has kindly said that he is prepared to reflect seriously on the possibility of encapsulating those deserving individuals in the framework, and we await the outcome of his reflections with bated breath.</p>

amount of time that is available I will try to respond positively to this group of amendments and to the campaigning of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07041881000036">New clause 28 and amendment No. 15 introduce a new regulation-making power that would be used to extend the carers credit to those certified as engaged in at least 20 hours of caring a week by health or social care professionals. There has been an attempt to encapsulate the spirit of some of my remarks in Committee, and it is therefore unsurprising that we are sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments. The amendments are, however, not strictly necessary. The regulation power under the Bill is drawn widely enough to allow us to include people engaged in caring. We therefore would not need to introduce further legislation to put into practice the intention of these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07041881000037">As I said in Committee, our plan is that in order to be eligible for the carers credit people would have to self-certify. There is no perfect way of doing that: the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said that it was not a perfect measure, but there is no perfect measure. We are trying to avoid the carer having to have a time sheet and therefore we want to have a self-certification process, but we need a lock in the system which is why they will have to identify someone for whom they are caring, and we say that that should be someone in receipt of attendance allowance, the highest or middle rate of disability living allowance or constant attendance allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07041881000038">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire asked how much we are prepared to spend on this. We are prepared to spend&#151;and have costed in&#151;enough to get to that population whose hours are above 20 a week but who are not building up a full state pension. Everybody shares the goal of enabling those 40,000 people to qualify for the basic state pension and, more importantly, for their state second pension, and the intention is to do exactly that. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he needs. This is not a question of finance; it is a question of trying to find a way of getting people to self-certify and to get the qualification that they need.</p>

We are happy to work with the hon.

Everybody shares the same goal. The review will be published before the end of the year. What this will do is put in place the final building block of our carers&#146; strategy to ensure that people can build up a full state pension and a state second pension through caring contributions.

simplicity. Above all, it is based on the foundation of consensus. We have an opportunity to send out a signal to people listening to this debate and reading it in the future that the Bill received a Third Reading on the basis of consensus and agreement on the direction of travel in our pension system and, in particular, on giving people who are putting their money away for the future greater certainty that the system will endure and can be relied on.</p>

I particularly thank all the members of the Committee for their good humour and dedication to our proceedings. I also wish to thank the two Chairmen who presided over the proceedings. Of course, I thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for his support, and the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), who led on many clauses in Committee. I also wish to put on record my appreciation&#151;I am sure that it is shared by all my hon. Friends&#151;of my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, who played an important part in the early formulation of the Bill. On a personal note, I particularly wish to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks), whose support and wise advice throughout the Bill&#146;s passage has been invaluable. Finally, I wish to thank the Bill team, which has done a fantastic job, and all those in my Department who have worked on the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07041881000055">What will the Bill do? It comes after 10 years of progress in reducing the poverty that we inherited and that had all too often become associated with old age. Since 1997, 1 million pensioners have escaped from relative poverty, and more than 2 million from absolute poverty. We are spending more than &#163;10 billion&#151;or about 1 per cent. of gross domestic product&#151;more on pensioners than we would have had we continued the policies that we inherited in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07041881000056">As a result, pensioners&#146; incomes have grown roughly in line with those of people in work. In effect, they have tracked earnings over the past 10 years. For the first time in a generation, therefore, pensioners are less likely to be poor than other groups in society, even though they are not in work and even though people who are in work benefit from increases in earnings. That is a remarkable achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07041881000057">Earlier this afternoon, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said that means-testing was a cancer. I do not agree: on the contrary, it is the generosity of the pension credit system that has enabled us to achieve such an improvement. It must be accepted that mechanisms such as the pension credit system must be introduced if we are to reduce poverty. After all, that is why the Conservative party has supported the uprating of pension credit in line with earnings that will be guaranteed by this Bill.</p>

Conservative and Labour Governments in the 1980s and 1990s pursued a voluntary approach to retirement provision. I am not trying to score any political points, but the link between earnings and the basic state pension was broken in the early 1980s and, for many years, people&#151;including people in the Labour  <br>

movement&#151;campaigned for its restoration. However, that was resisted by both the Conservative and Labour parties, because it was not possible to make a formal commitment to a long-term link between earnings and the basic state pension without making it clear how that could be afforded. There would have been no point in talking about plans to restore the link if it was not possible to tell pensioners how that would be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07041881000059">It is the hard choice at the heart of the Bill that will make the Government&#146;s approach affordable. Because we have raised the state pension age, we know that it will now be possible formally to restore the link between earnings and pensions, in a way that is both sustainable and affordable. Moreover, we will not place an unfair tax burden on our children and grandchildren as we arrange a more generous retirement for ourselves.</p>

Today has been very enlightening, and I am pleased that the Bill has reached this stage. However, I hope that the Minister will answer a question that I have raised many times. The Government have introduced a new 30-year qualifying rule for the basic state pension, but about 2 million people have come here from other parts of Europe since 1997. The Secretary of State has said that migrants who do not qualify under the new rule will have their pensions topped up through pension credit. Has there been any calculation of the size of that bill, which I believe will be significant?</p>

 I answered that question in Committee. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that there are reciprocal rules between different parts of the EU. Acceptance of those rules is a definition of EU membership, and I regret that the hon. Gentleman continues to raise that question. I should be interested to know why he does so, but it is possible that he would prefer the UK to withdraw from the EU, even though that would mean that our citizens could not benefit from the ability to move freely around it. In fact, apart from that intervention, I believe that the Bill has achieved a fairly good consensus, and that is something that we want to develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70418-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07041881000062">The Bill marks the most significant move towards equality between men and women since Barbara Castle introduced home responsibilities protection in the 1970s. It ends the inequality between men and women in the state pension by putting working and caring contributions on the same basis. Today, only about 30 per cent. of women retire on a full state pension&#151;a staggering figure&#151;compared with about 90 per cent. of men. That is completely unjustifiable and we will put it right through the Bill.</p>

Its progress shows that our reforms have been broadly endorsed by all those groups, which is a real credit to the work of the Pensions Commission and, once again, I congratulate the commission on a report that is a model of its kind. It internalised the trade-offs involved and produced a package that put political parties and stakeholders in a situation where they had  <br>

People do not want to put their money away for 20, 30 or 40 years on the basis either of uncertainty about what the system will be or of constant changes. That will make them less likely to save. Through the consensus that we have developed as part of the Bill we will provide them with greater certainty, and it is a real achievement that the Bill is placed to deliver that. That is why consensus is so important. We cannot remove risk from pensions saving entirely, nor can we halt demographic shift, but we can and should remove the risk of political instability.</p>

I look forward to the answers, because it is important that we have not just consensus in theory but fully costed consensus in practice.</p>

Friends the Members for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) and for Burton (Mrs. Dean) who pushed us to make further changes to the Bill to recognise the crucial role of carers. I am sure that all Members share the fundamental belief that pensioners are entitled to security and dignity in retirement. The Bill provides a solid platform so that people can save; it will give them the ability to build up a pension of &#163;135 a week, which is well above means-tested level, either by caring or working throughout their lives. It puts in place the first stepping stones for the delivery authority and&#151;perhaps most important&#151;it introduces real equality in the state pension system and I commend it to the House.</p>

No doubt we shall all meet again in a few months&#146; time, unless I am sacked or reshuffled&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Never.&#148;] I thank my hon. Friends for that. We are always pleased to know that another pensions Bill is just around the corner, but as we bid farewell, for the time being anyway, to this Bill, I think that it is a pity that owing to pressure of time today some important issues have not been debated fully or indeed at all. No doubt their lordships will help to remedy that.</p>

From the start of the Bill&#151;and even before it was introduced&#151;we in the official Opposition have taken a thoroughly responsible attitude and worked hard to try to forge a long-term cross-party consensus on pensions reform. At times it has been tough, but we have continued to try. I am still entirely unclear whether the Liberal Democrats are part of that consensus, or part of a parallel consensus that is going on somewhere else and that neither we nor the Government seem to be involved in.</p>

We also promised to tackle the gross unfairness&#151;as the Minister has said&#151;of a situation in which less than a third of women receive the full state pension. It would be the height of churlishness to oppose the measures simply because they have been proposed by another party, but we do have concerns.</p>

We also remain concerned about the cliff edge for some women pensioners and we remain concerned that many women already retired or soon to retire will see little or no benefit.

We have given our broad support to the proposals for personal accounts, but, again, as I explained to some extent in relation to one of the groups of amendments earlier today, we still have serious concerns about the design of the new system and the extent to which we should include in this Bill, rather than the next Bill, the basic parameters of success or failure for the system for personal accounts.</p>

The Minister and the Pensions Policy Institute will just have to agree to disagree&#151;without being disagreeable about it. They are never going to reach a consensus, and the more the Minister tried to explain his way out of that problem, the more he seemed to say that nobody can ever really know, so we are boldly taking a step into utter darkness with no way of knowing what will happen.

of pensions legislation. We certainly saw it at work with the Pensions Act 2004. There are real concerns in the industry that the advent of personal accounts will bring about a levelling down and that finance directors will, as I said earlier, take a quick, sharp look at the extra cost caused by the extra participation introduced by auto-enrolment and suggest to their employees that they might be better served by going through the personal accounts system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07041881000084">As the deputy director general of the Association of British Insurers, Mr. Stephen Sklaroff, said a little while ago:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07041881000086">I developed arguments about the contribution cap earlier today and I am afraid to say that I did not find the Minister&#146;s remarks about it particularly reassuring, so we shall watch what develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07041881000087">There is some potential for mis-selling. Ministers love to go on about previous mis-selling scandals, but the issue very much remains in respect of people auto-enrolled into personal accounts who would actually be well advised to opt out. I am thinking of people on low incomes with high credit card debts. In my intervention on the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), I referred to the excellent work of the PPI on risk categories. It looked at two distinct ages&#151;people aged 40 and 25 in 2012&#151;and examined categories where people are &#147;at risk&#148;, meaning that they are unlikely to receive back the value of their individual contributions to personal accounts. That is a real concern that needs to be looked at further, not only as part of the Thoresen review, but more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07041881000088">I conclude by talking about confidence. When the Government are proposing to launch a brand new pensions system designed to appeal to 7 million, 8 million, 9 million or perhaps 10 million people who are currently not saving for their retirement, it really beggars belief that Ministers are so blind to the danger to confidence posed by existing problems in the system. How can we expect younger workers to save for their retirement when almost every week they see bad news stories about people who have lost their pensions? How can the Minister talk about sending a signal from this House based on consensus when the actual signal we have sent today is that we are not prepared to give proper help to the 125,000 people who have lost their pensions? The Minister should be in no doubt that that is indeed the signal that we have sent out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07041881000092">I shall interrupt the Minister&#146;s private conversation for a moment by reminding him that he suggested earlier in our debates&#151;or, indeed, it might have been the Secretary of State&#151;that the Government came forward initially with plans to produce the financial assistance scheme and that the Government were the ones on the front foot in trying to improve these matters. The fact is that, on 14 May 2004, the Government were forced to produce in a hurry their proposals for the FAS, with a price tag of &#163;400 million that had no basis in fact or research at the time, because they were facing defeat in the House&#151;a defeat based on our opposition and that of the Liberal Democrats, other parties and a large number of Labour rebels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70418-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07041881000093">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) pointed out earlier in our debates that, at every point, the Government have been dragged here kicking and screaming to put in a bit of extra money or to make some concessions. How long will it take before they make the final concessions that justice demands? They have been told on no fewer than four separate occasions&#151;by the ombudsman, by the European Court, by the Select Committee and by the High Court&#151;that there has been maladministration, but their reaction is that everybody else is wrong and that they are right, and they are even appealing the High Court decision. They are still ignoring the legitimate demands of the pension victims, but even this Government should not have ignored the voice of the House. Those Labour Members with constituents facing penury who failed to support the cross-party package this evening must answer to their own consciences and to their own constituents.</p>

Courtesy of the former Paymaster General, we now know that this policy was created in conditions of the utmost secrecy. It was hidden from the British public during the 1997 election campaign, when the Labour party had the effrontery to make a centrepiece of its campaign our pensions policy, while its policy was firmly locked in a safe at the Grosvenor House hotel. It was then acted on in the teeth of advice to the contrary from civil servants and the CBI, among others.

 The bottom line is this: the official Opposition support the direction of travel of these reforms, although we have worries about some of the technical details and aspects of the personal accounts on which I have touched. However, fundamentally, we need to restore confidence in the pensions system as a whole. The man in the saloon bar who is not saving for his retirement, yet should be, needs to have confidence that when he locks his money away for 40 years, it will still be there at the end of that time to provide him with a decent pension. Ministers need to go back to the drawing board and address the way in which the problems that I have touched on are dealt with so that we can clear the ground and the personal accounts system can have the best possible start in life, instead of being encumbered by the baggage of recent history. Having said that, we wish the Bill a safe passage to the Lords and look forward to it coming back in due course in an improved form.</p>

 It is understandable that the financial assistance scheme and the way in which we might help those who have been cheated of their pensions have dominated today&#146;s proceedings. I certainly hope that the Government will come back with proposals that are more generous than those on offer. However, the Bill should be setting a solid foundation for the next 50 or so years, so it is most unfortunate that there has been such little time to debate some of its fundamental aspects. I was disappointed that all the concerns that I raised on Second Reading were not addressed in Committee and that they were not even discussed, let alone voted on, on Report. Although there are many welcome provisions in the Bill, especially those relating to pensions for women, I cannot see how the Bill, as it stands, will be a firm foundation for the future.</p>

system and the disincentives for people to save so that they can provide better for themselves than the state can do. Although it is good that the Government have accepted the recommendation of restoring the link to earnings, it will be some time before that happy event takes place. In the meantime, the disparity between the basic state pension and the means-tested pension credit will continue to grow, not narrow. That will mean that more people will be subject to means-testing, which will be counter-productive to our fundamental aims. Sadly, many people will thus be automatically enrolled into the new pension scheme when they would be better off using their money in other ways to save for their future.</p>

I ask the Government to bear that in mind when they set out in future the arrangements for the Report stage of such complex and important legislation. For obvious reasons, the Minister talks about affordability when addressing the aim of reducing means-testing and improving the basic state pension. However, we have not been able to debate today the amount of taxpayers&#146; money that is spent on tax relief and the fact that the majority of that money goes to the 5 per cent. of people in our society who are the most wealthy.</p>

We have to look at ways of ensuring that more resources are directed to those on lower incomes. If that means taking money away from those on higher incomes who have the ability to provide for their old age without substantial largesse from the taxpayer, that is something that a Labour Government should want to do.</p>

 I want to make a few brief points. Looking at the ePolitix briefing for the debate, I see that it lists all those who contributed on Second Reading and notes that I was the only one who voiced any real concerns about the Bill.</p>

away, but there are grave difficulties with the proposal because of the use of averages. As I said on Second Reading, the difference in life expectancy between and within areas means that there is a danger that many people will never get the benefit of their pension. In Glasgow, for example, many people have a life expectancy of less than 70 years. There has been much debate about the reasons for that and the improvements in health and housing that may make a difference. However, there are still huge discrepancies in life expectancy in different parts of the country and even within areas, and that will prove problematic in future. If, as the pension age increases, it turns out that many people are not getting the benefit of their pension, that problem will come back and hit us.</p>

It leaves here slightly improved, but still with measures that cause concern.</p>

 I should like to start on three points of consensus, and I shall try to be brief as other Members still want to speak. First, I echo the Minister&#146;s comments in passing on our thanks to those people who have been involved in supporting the Bill through its various stages: the officials in his Department, those who advise us and the lobby groups who sometimes see their ideas and even their words taken up in the debates. We are grateful for all of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07041881000109">We would also like to thank the Minister for the very reasonable way in which he conducted himself throughout the Committee stage and for the fact that he tried, on the whole, to answer our questions. We can only wonder what future there is for a person who displays such qualities in the Government that we are about to get. We wish him all the best with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07041881000110">Perhaps more importantly, we add our congratulations to those of the Minister on the work of the Pensions Commission. It is worth bearing in mind that none of the big measures in the Bill was included in its entirety in the manifesto of any of the four main parties before the last general election. To succeed within a very limited period in proposing a coherent package of reforms and persuading not only the Government, but both main Opposition parties and some of the other groups represented in the House, to accept it is a major achievement. I hope that many of those reforms will last and influence the shape of the pensions system for many years to come. I think in particular of the restoration of the earnings link, the increase in the state pension age, auto-enrolment and the other changes to the pensions contributory system. There is a great deal of consensus on those measures and on the direction of travel, which is why we, too, do not intend to divide the House on Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07041881000111">Earlier, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) teased me about whether there was a parallel consensus, which only the Liberal Democrats were part of and which could exist alongside the  <br>

apparent universal consensus on the Pensions Commission&#146;s proposals. In fact, there is. I put it to him that if he went to every saloon bar and village hall in the country and held a public meeting on pensions, he would find that there is indeed a parallel consensus on three points. It is perfectly possible to hold both the existing consensus and the parallel consensus in one&#146;s mind at the same time. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak described the elements of the parallel consensus in her comments. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne will recognise as I describe them, the elements of that consensus are threefold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07041881000112">First, the Government have said that there is a great degree of certainty about the reforms. In their response to the Committee on Work and Pensions, they said:</p>
<a name="70418-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="07041881000190"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is no ambiguity around this commitment&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07041881000113">for example, in respect of the earnings link. However, that comes as news to many people in this country and in this House who feel that there is a great degree of uncertainty, not least about the arbitrary way in which the earnings link is to be restored, which has created uncertainty and will increase the amount of means-testing in the meantime. There is no guarantee that the state pension will be uprated by the greater of the increases in prices and earnings&#151;the Labour party has dropped its commitment to that. More seriously, there is not even a commitment in the Bill to uprate pensions by a measurable and defined index, which the Engineering Employers Federation has said gives the Secretary of State almost carte blanche to determine the way in which the uprating takes place. That is worrying for all of us, because none of us knows which party will be in government in the future or how they might decide to reinterpret some of the changes made though the Bill. In a nutshell, if one goes to any pensioners&#146; group in the country, one will find a parallel consensus on dissatisfaction with the uncertainty and the long time before the changes take effect. That is why although all of us here may be pleased about the pensions consensus, people in the rest of the country are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07041881000114">Secondly, because the restoration of the earnings link is being delayed and because, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak said, we are building on such a low foundation of the basic state pension&#151;because the Chancellor has insisted that pensions reform takes place in an environment where for 10 years we will not increase the share of GDP that goes to state pensions&#151;we have an enormous amount of means-testing. In the short time left I shall not repeat the entire debate, but today I was interested to hear even the Minister start to moderate his claims about the number of people who will benefit from personal accounts. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the vast majority of people would gain more than &#163;2 for every &#163;1 invested, but today we have been told that a good majority of people will be net gainers&#151;in other words, the claims are being scaled back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07041881000115">The Government have not yet been able to answer the point, so I continue to believe that half the target audience for the personal account&#151;people on lower incomes, whose risk of becoming subject to means-testing is greater than it is for the rest of the population&#151;could be subject to means-testing in 2020, 2030 or 2040. A large number of people might find  <br>

either that the &#163;2 for &#163;1 no-brainer offer that Adair Turner and his commission tried to deliver is not realised for them, or that&#151;worse still&#151;they fall into the small but not negligible category of people who will actually lose by investing in a personal account because of the effect of means-testing not only on the pension credit, but on housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07041881000116">The Government&#146;s problem is that the more they deal with the mis-selling problem by not auto-enrolling various groups for personal accounts, or by not making sure that those groups get generic advice, the more they displace the mis-selling problem and make it a take-up problem, in which lots of people who should have personal accounts do not. The Government have yet really to deal with that problem. Some of us have concerns that the Government are building on an unsound foundation. If we are right about those concerns, the personal account part of the package, which we will hear about later this year, could be a failure, and if it is it will pull the rug from under a lot of the reforms, and that will affect what is delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07041881000117">The final point on the parallel consensus is that people recognise that there are some huge issues with which the Government have not yet dealt. The hon. Member for Eastbourne touched on our disappointment today about pension compensation, but there are bigger issues with which the Government have not yet dealt, including the reform of public sector pensions, and the reform of tax relief in ways that are strongly hinted at in the Pensions Commission report and the Select Committee report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07041881000118">The direction of travel is right, but the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) said earlier, on pension compensation, that he feels that the Government have half-built a house. Similarly, on pensions reform, we feel that the house is not yet complete. Given the degree of consensus, we hope that we will not have to advocate knocking down any of the walls in future, but there is a long way to go before the house is completely built, so that we can deliver the pension system that the country really needs for the future.</p>

platform on which I want to stand in Grimsby and tell my constituents, &#147;However old you are, hang on until 2015, and you&#146;ll get a better deal.&#148; That is not the kind of result that I wanted from a Bill as all-encompassing and all-important as this one. It does nothing for current pensioners, and we could have tackled the two problems together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07041881000121">First, on the earnings tie, some 21 per cent. of pensioners are now below the poverty line; that is 2.2 million people. The earnings tie could and should have been restored by now, or much earlier. We will restore it eventually, but eventually is a long, long time away, and many of us will not actually reach it. Let us face it, our pensions are among the lowest in the world. They are lower than pensions in many of the countries that are new entrants to the European Community, including Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia. The Cheeky Girls will not be retiring to Wales; they will go back to Latvia, Estonia or wherever to get better pensions than they would get if they stayed in this country. It is monstrous that our pensions should be so low, compared to those of those new entrants. We need to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07041881000122">Our poverty line is 60 per cent. of median earnings, and pensioners should not be required to live below that line. We can only ensure that they do not by restoring the earnings link earlier. I agree that pension credit goes a long way; it is a salutary innovation of the Government&#146;s that I have long welcomed. The pension credit, n&#233;e the minimum income guarantee, is a welcome development, but it is means-tested, and because the increase to the basic pension is not as closely allied to the increase in earnings as it should be, means-testing, which is implicit for pension credit, will increase enormously. The gap between the pension credit and the actual pension will be much wider as time passes. Means-testing channels a limited amount of money to those most in need, but it is not claimed by many people who need the money, so it is an inefficient way of increasing pensions. We should therefore restore the direct tie to earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07041881000123">My second point of dissent concerns the raising of the retirement age, which will be painful for many people. It is ludicrous to expect people in hard manual jobs whose physical strength is often broken by a life of hard manual labour to carry on working until they are 68. Fishermen, for instance, lead a tough life, and the pension arrangements in the industry are very bad. French fishermen retire on a full pension at 55. What am I to say to the former fishermen in Grimsby? Should I tell them to carry on fishing when they are over 65, over 60, or over 55? It is ludicrous to introduce such measures, as the system must be graduated. We must channel pension support to the poorest and to people whose jobs involve hard manual labour. After all, people in the poorest areas live 12 years less than people in the richest areas, and the pension system should be able to cope with that situation. I wish to brief, and I shall not wander over two previous debates, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) did. I welcome the Bill&#151;it is a cool welcome&#151;but I worry intensely that it does nothing for people now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07041881000126">May I briefly put on record one aspect of the Pensions Bill that is lacking&#151;and I do not think that the Minister will find this surprising? Yesterday, the Minister graciously agreed to meet some of my constituents who took early retirement and are particularly affected by the provisions of the Pensions Act 2004 that immediately cut the pension benefits payable to people who took early retirement. I am not sure that the House anticipated that when it introduced the Bill those people would be uniquely affected by its provisions. For many people, benefits were cut by at least by at least 10 per cent. and in some cases by 70 per cent. of what they were expecting, which has a knock-on effect on their wives&#146; and, indeed, widows&#146; pensions if they pre-decease their spouse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07041881000127">A much wider issue is therefore involved. It clearly cannot be addressed today, as the Bill is about to complete its passage in the Commons, but fresh amendments could be tabled in the other place to try to improve the position of people who took early retirement. They are not asking for a great deal&#151;they are just asking for an improvement to their present predicament. The Minister obviously has to cost that with regard to the existing PPF commitments, but we believe that there are ways of taking the issue forward. I implore him to take a further look at the matter, as he said that he would do so. I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the chance to put that on the record in the Chamber.</p>

Friends on the Front Bench that many Labour Members will be pushing to go much further than they are suggesting.

substantially higher pension that is not means-tested&#151;we should use the taxation system to redistribute income instead&#151;with an earnings link restored when the pension reaches the level of 25 per cent., instead of 15 per cent., of earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07041881000130">On occupational pensions, if the Government do not secure the system and ensure that people trust in it, believe in it and continue to support it, in the end the only fall-back will be a thoroughgoing state system. That would be perfectly acceptable for a socialist like myself, but not so acceptable, I suspect, for my hon. Friend the Minister. I leave that thought with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70418-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07041881000131">On affordability, I think that that is a nonsense word. If my children had said when they were young, &#147;Can we have more pocket money?&#148;, and I had said, &#147;I can&#146;t afford it&#148;, they would have said, &#147;That&#146;s nonsense, dad&#151;we know you can afford it&#148;, and they would have been right. What I would have meant was, &#147;I choose not to give you any more pocket money&#148;, which is a very different matter. Compared with other countries in Europe, particularly those in Scandinavia, Germany and France, we have a lower gross tax take and a lower level of public spending on public services. I want to see much higher levels of both. The Scandinavian economies are very successful, and we could go much further in their direction. Affordability is a non-argument: what it means is, &#147;We choose not to give you higher pensions because we don&#146;t want to pay for them.&#148; That is unacceptable.</p>

I understand from a recent written answer that there is a massive surplus of &#163;73 billion in the national insurance fund. If the upper earnings limit on national insurance contributions was removed, that would equate to an extra &#163;6.5 billion. There is plenty of money, but it happens to be in the wrong pockets. We should take the money from those who may have too much and give it to those who have too little, the majority of whom happen to be our pensioners. I want a redistributive taxation system and much higher pensions without means-testing.</p>

 I am most grateful for the opportunity to raise an important matter on the Adjournment this evening. The millions of the travelling public who use Gatwick airport and the thousands of people who work there also believe that it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07041881000143">My constituency&#151;Crawley in West Sussex&#151;has grown up with Gatwick airport since the 1950s. The airport is wholly within the Crawley constituency and, even in the worst of the Tory years, when recession, high interest rates and unemployment wreaked such havoc in so many communities across the UK, it sustained Crawley and we have always been grateful to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07041925000001">The year on year success of Gatwick is a key reason Crawley is the most successful of the new towns&#151;but I would say that, wouldn&#146;t I? By sustaining high employment, the quality of all our lives is enhanced. I know from my frequent dealings with local business people how much they appreciate the quality of service that they get from Gatwick and its impact on the local business community. There can be no doubt that Gatwick is the premier business in the &#147;Gatwick diamond&#148; area, and a major draw for many other businesses locating there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07041881000144">It consistently wins the airport of the year award and we are justly proud of that. Gatwick&#146;s status as a transport hub is crucial, which is why we so warmly welcome the Department for Transport&#146;s recent decision to retain Gatwick Express, through a reasonable compromise about which we are delighted locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07041881000145">I recently met around 100 local business people from my constituency when they came to the House of Commons for a business summit that I arranged the day after the Budget. It is a mark of the importance that the Treasury places on the business community in the Gatwick diamond area that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary made himself available for the event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07041881000146">We learned that the Gatwick diamond business community is vibrant, enthusiastic and extensive, with a GDP that is estimated at &#163;38 billion. It ranks 56th out of 200 regions measured across Europe. Naturally, the business community is keen to promote the Gatwick diamond area throughout Europe and internationally. A central part of that promotion must be the airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07041881000147">People in and around Crawley are proud of their airport. The many thousands of people who work there take a genuine pride in the services that they provide and understand clearly the benefits that Gatwick brings. They jealously guard their safety and security reputation, and that is the reason for the debate today. All sorts of people contribute to that good reputation. They include catering staff, security staff, baggage handlers, customs officers, air crew, ground staff, engineers, cleaning staff, immigration staff and medical and nursing staff. I know that I have missed out many people. I simply wanted to mention the many teams that provide such an excellent service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07041881000148">We all know about the extra pressures that now face airports through the increased security that they have to provide. Staff at Gatwick have risen to the challenges and the heightened security, which has added to the pressures of their work. We congratulate them on their work. BAA is having to recruit many more staff to rise to that challenge, and I look forward to seeing them in place soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07041881000149">I have set the scene, and now I want to look in more detail at the issues that have arisen with ground handling services at Gatwick. Among other responsibilities, they cover the arrangements for handling the enormous quantity of luggage that inevitably accompanies the 35 million people who travel through the airport each year. For historical reasons, the Civil Aviation Authority has always set a limit on the number of companies involved in ground handling at Gatwick. That has not been a popular decision with everyone. Some felt that it was anti-competitive, especially those airlines operating within tight margins, for whom all cost savings are vital. With liberalised competition, however, things have changed substantially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07041881000150">Recently, the CAA decided to review the four-operator limit, and held a consultation into the number of ground handling operators working at Gatwick. Of course, holding that consultation was the right way to proceed, but the online consultation was not well advertised, even though it needed to seek the views of people dealing with the issues day in and day out, as well as those of the airline representatives. There was general concern that the consultation process needed to include staff working in ground handling. Representatives of the Transport and General Workers Union and I pressed for the voice for all those staff to be heard to ensure that their expertise and experience was central to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para16"><a name="07041881000151">Most of us do not fully understand the complexities and pressures involved in turning an aircraft round in as little as 25 minutes. There could be as many as 10 different service providers working on one aircraft, and the pressures on staff are enormous. Ensuring their health and safety, along with the safety of the aircraft, must be a priority. That is why I was delighted that the TGWU campaign and the petition to the CAA to extend the consultation period was successful. That allowed those voices to be heard, and I thank the CAA for responding positively. I also pay tribute to those in the T and G, particularly Ian McCullogh and Colin Terry, who worked so hard locally to ensure that these issues were raised. The trade unions have made an important contribution to ensuring that safety is at the heart of the Gatwick operation, with the publication of the charter, particularly from the T and G, which outlines minimum standards for the ground handling services for aircraft. The GMB union conducted a safety audit a couple of years ago, which also made a great contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07041881000152">The concerns relate to the impact of increased competition on the health and safety of the workers and the aircraft. There has been unease, following the consultation, at the speed with which the decision was taken to allow a further ground handling operation at Gatwick. That ground handler was allowed on to the  <br>

airport just one week after the decision was made. It is not surprising that that resulted in a widespread feeling of scepticism among the existing ground staff about the outcome of the consultation process, as they felt that they had made a good case for ensuring that there was not too much competition, and therefore pressure on the work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07041881000153">All staff and employers have a responsibility for health and safety under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. We all accept that. It must therefore be right that the CAA, the contractors and all other employers take into account health and safety issues when making decisions and agreeing any contracts. Many of my constituents involved in manual handling at Gatwick have raised concerns about health and safety since the work pressures on them increased. They say that the drive to reduce costs&#151;which comes from all areas of the airport operation&#151;has already had an impact on staffing levels, leading to a significant increase in manual handling per worker. We should also recognise that there have been significant improvements in the mechanical equipment used to move the vast quantities of cargo and luggage, but people still have to lift very heavy bags.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07041881000154">The facts clearly show that staffing levels have fallen at the same time as aircraft movements and passenger numbers have risen. The airport staff have my sympathy. As a nurse for 25 years, I too was in a profession whose members were susceptible to manual handling injury. Such injuries can be very disabling, and I understand how important it is to ensure that everything possible can be done to minimise the possibility of their occurrence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para20"><a name="07041881000156">Lines of responsibility in health and safety in the national health service are very clear, but I am not entirely sure that that applies to airport workers. It would be helpful if the Minister gave us assurances today on some of the measures that we believe would help us to retain Gatwick&#146;s jealously guarded good reputation. Perhaps she will also tell us whether there have been any impact assessments of the incidence of manual handling-related injuries since the introduction of more ground handling companies, and what other measures exist to ensure that standards are maintained as a further operator comes on board. I am not opposed to competition&#151;competition is healthy&#151;but it is reasonable and important to expect health and safety issues always to come first, especially at an international airport. Health and safety and security go hand in hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para21"><a name="07041881000157">Two particular worries concern weight limits for individual items of luggage. There have been calls for implementation of the 23 kg limit, but it has not yet been enforced. It is not uncommon for cargo weights in excess of 100 kg to be manually handled by workers in airport holds. The provision of adequate chutes and lifts in areas where staff regularly have to handle items such as wheelchairs is essential, and is crucial to the well-being of airport staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para22"><a name="07041881000158">Clarity on responsibilities for health and safety issues is vital. I thank the Minister for her helpful answers to my recent parliamentary questions, but they indicate that responsibilities currently fall between the Civil Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Executive. I should like more information on the particular responsibilities of those bodies.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) on securing the debate. She is a tremendous advocate for the people who work at Gatwick airport, and is highly respected both in the House and outside for being so.</p>

I agree that the Gatwick Express announcement was good news for passengers and the local community, and I thank her for her support in the campaign that led to us getting that good news. We are adding more seats and trains on one of the country&#146;s busiest rail routes.

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para26"><a name="07041881000163">As with all airports, the success of Gatwick depends on the contributions of the many and varied people who work there, including those, such as ground handling staff, whose contribution is often unglamorous and hidden from the public gaze, but without whom the whole operation would quickly grind to a halt. I extend my thanks and congratulations to those who work on the ground&#151;literally&#151;at airports because without them the United Kingdom aviation industry could not continue to offer a first-class service to the travelling public during the many difficult times, such as those that we have gone through lately.

position that gives rise to the situation. It is not correct that there has always been such a limit. Before 1998 there was no limit at all. In that year the Civil Aviation Authority, on an application from Gatwick Airport Ltd, made a determination under the ground handling regulations, which had been implemented in the UK the previous year, to limit to four the number of suppliers of airside ground handling services at Gatwick airport. The CAA subsequently modified the determination in 1999, again on application from the airport, so that the number of suppliers of airside bussing services would be limited to two, rather than four. Both decisions rested primarily on arguments relating to the space and capacity available at the airport at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07041881000165">It is important to remember that in the 10 years since the ground handling regulations came into force Gatwick has been the only UK airport with a legal limit on the number of handlers allowed to operate. Gatwick Airport Ltd applied to the CAA in April 2006 to have both of the existing limits removed. On 30 May, the CAA published a proposal in its official record and on its website stating that in the absence of clear arguments to the contrary it was minded to accept the judgment of Gatwick Airport Ltd, as the responsible operator of Gatwick airport, that the existing limitations on the number of airside handlers should be removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para29"><a name="07041881000166">The CAA asked for representations on this proposal to be made by the end of June. I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s comments about the effectiveness of the consultation process. The CAA extended the period for comments, which I welcome, following representations from the Transport and General Workers Union, to ensure that the union could make a written submission, which it did in October 2006. The TGWU raised a number of concerns about the possible effects of increased competition in the provision of ground handling services at Gatwick, particularly in respect of security, health and safety, and the capacity of the terminal facilities. The CAA considered the representations carefully and seriously, but found no compelling grounds for it to reject the judgment of Gatwick Airport Ltd. Consequently, it decided to revoke the existing limit on the number of companies permitted to provide ground handling services at Gatwick. The CAA&#146;s full decision is set out in its official record, published on 20 February 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para30"><a name="07041881000167">In view of the well-established mechanisms of safety oversight of airport operations by the CAA&#146;s safety regulation group and by the Health and Safety Executive, the CAA found no reason to believe that removing the limit would itself have a detrimental effect on health and safety levels. I expect the parties most directly concerned&#151;such as the airport, the airlines and the handling companies&#151;to ensure that any changes to the ground handling arrangements at Gatwick are implemented in a way that does not compromise the safety of staff, which is of paramount importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para31"><a name="07041881000168">My hon. Friend asks specifically about the respective roles of the CAA and the Health and Safety Executive. The CAA is responsible for ensuring that risks to civil aviation safety are properly controlled. To this end it seeks to ensure that Gatwick airport is safe for use by  <br>

aircraft and that operators of aircraft have suitable safety arrangements in place both in the air and on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para32"><a name="07041881000169">The role of the HSE is to ensure that risks to people&#146;s health and safety from work activities are properly controlled. There is a memorandum of understanding between the CAA and the HSE, the aim of which is to ensure co-ordination of policy issues, enforcement activity and investigation in respect of aircraft and the systems in which they operate. The memorandum is available for inspection in the safety regulation group section of the CAA website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para33"><a name="07041881000170">My hon. Friend also asks what measures are in place to ensure that standards are maintained as a further operator comes on board and whether any impact assessment of manual handling-related injury has been made since 2002. Prior to the removal of the limits, as part of the re-licensing process, Gatwick Airport Ltd undertook an audit involving existing handling companies and the potential new entrant that looked at health, safety, environmental responsibility, security and service standards. I understand that the potential new entrant received a favourable rating. I also understand that the airport is implementing an enhanced safety performance regime with the expectation of improved safety performance across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70418-0021.htm_para34"><a name="07041881000171">My hon. Friend raised two specific health and safety concerns. On weight limits, I understand that the Health and Safety Executive has been successful in working with aircraft operators, ground handling organisations and airports to limit the maximum weight for hold baggage to 32 kg, and that talks are under way to reduce this to 23 kg. This, however, applies only to UK aircraft operators. Otherwise, ground handling operations come within the sphere of the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992. The regulations do not set specific weight limits for manual handling, but instead recommend that a specific ergonomic assessment should be made to take account of the specific circumstances of each activity to ensure that the health and safety of the work force is assured. I would expect the parties involved to take full account of those recommendations. In the light of my hon. Friend&#146;s representations, I have asked officials to look at ways in which that matter can be raised at a European level and I will be happy to get back to her on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07041881000172">The provision of chutes and lifts in areas where staff regularly have to handle manual items such as wheelchairs is essentially a matter for the airport&#146;s management. As part of the development of the airport&#146;s capital expenditure programme, I would expect that to be the subject of consultation between the airport and its customer airlines, which are likely to have in mind the implications for their ground handling suppliers of investing&#151;or of failing to invest&#151;in facilities that support ground handling activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07041881000173">I am aware that concern has been expressed about the space to accommodate extra handlers. The CAA accepted Gatwick&#146;s contention that congestion was primarily a function of peak passenger demand at the airport, rather than being related to the number of ground handlers operating. In its 1998 decision, the CAA had noted that it would be possible to review the limit on the number of handlers should circumstances change significantly from those then prevailing at Gatwick. The CAA said that it now expected Gatwick airport to work with all handlers to ensure that adequate space was sought and used appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07041881000174">The CAA notified all interested parties of its decision to remove the limit on the number of ground handling service providers at Gatwick on 14 February 2007. Gatwick airport was therefore free to appoint a fifth handler at any time after this date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07041881000175">I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley said about the speed with which a fifth operator was announced, and her observation that that generated scepticism about the consultation process among existing ground handling staff. However, I can assure both her and them that the airport&#146;s preparations had no effect on the CAA&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07041881000176">I understand that the airport had to act rapidly to complete the appointment, as a number of the existing ground handling contracts were due to expire at the end of March. An orderly handover of business was needed, in the interests of the airport and of its customers and staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70418-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07041881000177">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley for speaking up on behalf of people who are an integral part of the Gatwick airport team. I assure both her and her constituents that I shall continue to take a close interest in the matters that have been raised in the House tonight.</p>
