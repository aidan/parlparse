 Mr. Speaker, with the leave of the House, let me begin by saying that I know that the whole House will join me in sending our thoughts to the 15 members of HMS Cornwall currently detained by Iran. Our thoughts go out to their friends in theatre and to their families back here in the UK. I do not intend to comment further on the issue, other than to say that we are doing everything possible to secure their release.

On 1 March, I announced that the Government had accepted the report&#146;s recommendations and would implement them in full without delay. As a result, all service personnel will receive at least a 3.3 per cent. pay increase, with the 13,000 lowest paid receiving 9.2 per cent. In total, about &#163;358 million more a year will go into pay and allowances. I also announced that we are committing &#163;70 million to financial retention initiatives in areas where we face particular manning challenges, including the infantry and the marines&#151;an approach endorsed by the AFPRB and the National Audit Office. We are doing all that we can to sustain manning levels for our operational commitments, and I and the chiefs of staff continue to judge that current commitments are manageable.</p>

week in the Budget, the Chancellor sought to give the impression that there is an extra &#163;400 million for forces&#146; funding, but it turns out to be nothing of the sort: it is operational costs, which will be paid out of the Treasury reserve next year in the usual way. So how can men and women in the armed forces trust what the Government say, when even on something as fundamental as forces&#146; funding the Chancellor of the Exchequer is playing smoke and mirrors?</p>

 There can be no criticism of the Treasury&#146;s support for the armed forces in the formof resources not just for pay and operational allowances&#151;we have been able to announce the operational bonus in recent months&#151;but for other areas. It would be much easier to conduct this debate about funding, including what comes from the reserve and what comes from the core Ministry of Defence budget, if other hon. Members&#151;I excuse the hon. Gentleman from this&#151;did not seek to give the impression that operational costs come from the MOD&#146;s core budget. It is well known that in every Budget and pre-Budget report, the Chancellor refers to the access to the reserve for supporting operations.</p>

 I am very grateful to the AFPRB and to the National Audit Office for pointing out in their respective reports the way in which targeted incentives or financial help can assist in meeting the challenge of recruitment and retention. This year, we intended that the armed forces&#146; settlement would help particularly the least well off&#151;the worst paid among our troops. That was exactly what the AFPRB recommended,and I was very pleased to be able to accept that recommendation.</p>

 I accept with alacrity the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s congratulations on the armed forces pay review settlement. The Budget&#146;s impact is different for different people; for example, single-earner couples with children on a private&#146;s salary will gain from the package by more than &#163;300 a year, and I could give more examples. He asked specifically about the lowest paid. He will know that their salary will go up to &#163;15,677, ignoring the operational bonus. The strict effect of the Budget is that those who are single and in receipt of that amount of money will be worse off by the equivalent of about &#163;1 per week, but one has to take into account the fact that almost all of them are likely to attract the operational bonus, so that must be factored in, too.</p>

 Harmony guidelines have been consistently broken, planning assumptions breached, readiness targets not met and essential training requirements not fulfilled. Even the Chief of the Defence Staff says that the armed forces are very stretched, so just what does it take for the Defence Secretary to admit that we are asking too much of our armed forces?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman sought to get the Chief of the Defence Staff to agree at the Defence Committee evidence session that we were asking too much of the armed forces, but he would not agree. It takes exactly the same for me, as for the Chief of the Defence Staff, to admit to that, which is not correct. We are not asking too much of our armed forces; we are operating at levels that are higher than the assumptions that informed our operational planning. If that is not addressed, we know what the long-term consequences will be; but the hon. Gentleman was told by the Chief of the Defence Staff during the evidence session that we are already taking steps to address those issues. As the Chief of the Defence Staff said, the screw is being somewhat loosened by the decisions that have already been made in relation to the tightened circumstances of the armed forces..</p>

Because we are aware of the diplomatic sensitivity, we shall not press the Government on the issue today, but we obviously want Parliament to have a chance to discuss it as soon as possible. I am sure that the House would also like to send condolences to the families of the submariners of HMS Tireless who were killed on active service&#151;another example that shows how much they risk in our name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="70326-0001.htm_para4"><a name="0703263000036">On the question of overstretch in the armed forces, the basic problem is that the Government produced the strategic defence review, defence planning assumptions came from that and a budget was designed to suit it. The Government then exceeded those defence planning assumptions in the past five years. At the same time, they are cutting the size of the Navy, the Army and the RAF, yet they are increasing expectations and activity levels. When will it dawn on them that with defence spending of only 2.2 per cent. of GDP, the lowestsince 1930, they cannot conduct wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with peacetime resources, because the people who will ultimately suffer are those in our armed forces, with the inevitable consequences for recruitment and retention that we are now beginningto see.</p>

That, of course, as we have already discussed at Question Times, is supplemented by access to the special reserve in relation to operations. The hon.

In terms of the future use, my view is that we should be looking, as progressively as we can, to move forward the timetables. I would not like to see a major planning blight descending on that site for any length of time, if at all. It is an important site. That is why we have designated it as a potential&#151;probable&#151;site for other military use.

 The citizens of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire take huge pride in what the Red Arrows do, and I am glad to hear from the Minister that their budget will not be cut.

 On the point about an independent military complaints authority, we set up an independent complaints system as part of a Bill that recently went through Parliament. There is no place at all for discrimination or harassment in the armed forces, and I can tell the hon.

For instance, we ensure that progress reports are made to the Equal Opportunities Commission, and we have a new complaints procedure in place. Of course, training and education are key, and above all else, it is leadership that delivers that. That is why I am confident that the armed forces are clearly moving forward on the issue.

 I totally rebut any such allegations. In fact, there has been a decrease in the past few years in the number of people going absent without leave. The latest figures are lower than they were seven years ago, and there is strong support for people who have developed mental health problems in the armed forces, on the bases and elsewhere. Some of the evidence shows that a key reason for members of the armed forces going absent without leave is relationship issues. In my surgery on Saturday, I met someone who had been in that position and wants to rejoin the Army&#151;that was exactly the position in which they found themselves. That is how many of the issues arise. The support is there, and there is a welfare line that people can contact, so I reject and rebut the allegations completely.</p>

 Does the hon.

Will he therefore be very careful, and not be seduced in any way by the siren voice of the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point. Clearly, we have to have robust and challenging training, because of the nature of operations and service that our armed forces have to undertake. Again, I have visited a number of training establishments in the six months I have been in this job. I have been impressed both by the robustness and the challenges of the training for recruits, and by welfare support and support generally, given the issues that recruits may encounter. I completely accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman&#151;we need robust and challenging training, but we must put procedures in place to make sure any complaints can be dealt with and that people are comfortable, if they suffer any difficulties, with the system for making a complaint.</p>

The Minister mentioned the Falkland Islands in an earlier answer to a supplementary question: is he placing any emphasis on the fact that this year is the 25th anniversary of the defeat of the Argentineans and their expulsion from the Falkland Islands?

Last week, I met some of them in Portsmouth&#151;they did a tremendous thing for this country. Weare focusing on the Falklands this year, and commemorations and funding have been agreed.

In an earlier answer, my right hon. Friend said that he will focus on better pay and conditions in those particular unitsto ensure that recruitment stays high. I welcome his commitment to support a 9.2 per cent. increase for the lowest paid members of our armed forces, but what more can we do to ensure that those elements of our forces that regularly rotate on to the front line are rewarded properly?</p>

 My hon. Friend will know that there is a tax-free operational allowance, which is &#163;2,240 for six months&#151;in my view, and, I think, in the view of the armed forces, it goes some way to recognising the contribution made on operations. As well as those who get a 9.2 per cent. pay rise, the next band up gets a6.2 per cent. pay rise as a result of the acceptance of the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body report reflects the fact that there are a number of specific incentives, one of which concerns the retention of marines, to address pinch points that result in retention problems in the armed forces. In the past, such approaches have improved our ability to hold on to those who have the skills that we need, whether or not they were deployed in operational theatres, and that is what we will continue to do.</p>

 I recognise one of the birthdays. Let me deal with the EU aspect. In building up our capabilities with NATO and EU, not only as regards the Royal Navy but across our armed forces, we are meeting the various challenges that have been set, including the headline goals that were laid down for 2010. That is part of the process of ensuring that we have the capabilities required not only to meet the foreseeable demands as best we can anticipate but to be ready for, and able to address, the unforeseen. There are many examples of joint training taking place to build up that interoperability between nations. It is important that we work with our allies in the EU and in NATO and that we stop those who are advocating part of this proud nation coming out of NATO, which would diminish our capacity to defend these shores and work against good European tradition.</p>

 As has been said many times from the Dispatch Box by previous Administrations as well as this one, there is a continuum in the defence of this country. It does not surprise me that ships that have been commissioned in the past 10 years were ordered in previous periods. The important aspect is that those orders were carried out because it was acknowledged that it is important to maintain the strength of the Royal Navy. On top of that, there is a projected&#163;14 billion capital programme for the Royal Navy in the next decade. That includes carriers, Type 45s and other vessels for the Royal Navy.

Both my right hon.

Ian Paisley) and the Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams)&#151;met for very the first time this morning at Stormont, and have agreed to participatein a power-sharing agreement on 8 May. Right hon. and hon. Members will recognise the extraordinary significance of that. Many in the House and beyond would never have expected such a development in their lifetimes. The fact that it has been achieved is a tribute not only to the work of my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State but totheir predecessors in both Labour and Conservative Administrations who, throughout the past 35 years, worked tirelessly to bring about a settlement that would allow devolution to be restored and to end direct rule in Northern Ireland. Most importantly, it is a tribute to the commitment of all the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>

To achieve that within the framework put in place last November by Parliament in the Northern Ireland(St. Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, it is essentialthat the necessary changes to that Act are made by midnight tomorrow. I am therefore proposing to the House a change to the Order Paper tomorrow to allow a very short technical Bill to be considered to put the necessary changes in place. My noble Friend the Chief Whip in the Lords will make a similar request in the other place.</p>

If the representatives of Unionism, republicanism and nationalism can reach agreement on what the whole House will hope will be a final political settlement in Northern Ireland through a shared future, it is right that this House should do all that it can to facilitate that in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. A Bill will therefore be put before the House tomorrow with the aim of Royal Assent before midnight. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will cover all the key points during consideration of the Bill, I am sure that the whole House will understand that tomorrow&#146;s oral statement, of which I gave notice last Thursday, will now not take place.</p>

Preferably, Parliament&#146;s sitting this week could be extended: we could sit on Friday,or on Monday of next week. Agreement in Northern Ireland, and agreement on a restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland, is a significant step, but should not be an excuse for the Government to ride roughshod over Parliament and shorten debate on the Budget. We welcome the agreement, and we will co-operate in getting the legislation through, but I urge the Leader of the House to look again at the order of business for this week.</p>

I reassure the right hon. Lady and the Opposition, who I know are anxious to debate every last detail of the Budget, as, indeed, are we, that we are ready to extend tomorrow&#146;s parliamentary day by a significant amount.

Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) that that must not, and need not, be at the expense of giving proper consideration to the Budget. Do I understand from what the Leader of the House said that he will fully protect the time set aside for the Budget debate tomorrow? If not, will he consider having a later sitting on Wednesday so that we can conclude the Budget debate and the Divisions on the Budget resolutions without losing any of the time that has been set aside for the other matters that are due to be debated on that day?

I have already said that we are willing to extend the parliamentary day tomorrow, but I cannot agree that there will be exact, minute-for-minute injury time. We are working on that, but it is a matter for the Whips of the different parties to agree. We recognise that the time for tomorrow&#146;s debate on the Budget might need to be extended.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on Zimbabwe. I hope that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and the Liberal Democrats received a copy in good time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0703263000170">As the Prime Minister told the House last Wednesday, what is happening in Zimbabwe is appalling, disgraceful and utterly tragic for its people. My noble Friend Lord Triesman, Minister responsible for Africa, noted on 12 March that it was a direct consequence of Mugabe&#146;s own approach and of his disregard for the suffering of ordinary Zimbabweans. What we are seeing is a wilful waste of Zimbabwe&#146;s assets and potential by a ZANU-PF Governmentwho have substituted plunder and corruption for a programme of economic and social advancement for its people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0703263000171">Hunger and malnutrition are all that millions of Zimbabweans now experience in their daily lives, and Mugabe and his regime are directly responsible. They are directly responsible for Zimbabwe&#146;s economy being in free fall: the economy shrank by 40 per cent. in less than a decade, and will shrink by a further 5 per cent. this year. Inflation is already at 3,000 per cent., and the International Monetary Fund says that it will breach 5,000 per cent. by the end of this year. They are directly responsible for circumstances in which a quarter of the resident population is dependent on food aid, and a quarter has already fled the country. They are directly responsible for an unemployment rate of over 80 per cent., the third highest in the world. It is little wonder that there has been an exodus over the Limpopo river. They are directly responsible for Zimbabwe&#146;s having the world&#146;s highest orphan rate, largely as a consequence of the pandemic rate of AIDS: roughly20 per cent. of adults are infected. They are directly responsible for circumstances in which Zimbabweans can expect to die younger than anyone else on the planet. A Zimbabwean woman today can expect to live to just 34, while a Zimbabwean man can expect tolive to 37. However, instead of taking the necessary measures to reverse each of those evolving tragedies, the regime continues to make people homeless, suppress independent media, harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest those involved in peaceful demonstrations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0703263000172">The violence and repression used against peaceful protesters gathering to pray for change during the weekend of 10-11 March, during which at least one young person was shot and killed, has continued unabated. Four members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change have been prevented from leaving Zimbabwe, including one MP, Nelson Chamisa, who was badly beaten when travelling to a meeting in Brussels.

Mugabe&#146;s men might break the bones of the democracy campaigners, but they cannot break the quiet dignity of these extraordinary human beings. One day, Zimbabwe will return to democracy; Zimbabweans will be free. Mugabe knows that. He knows that he has got it wrong, and that the crisis has resulted in an increase in internal pressure. He feels more vulnerable. The involvement of the military in almost all aspects of Zimbabwe life&#151;from running state businesses and economic programmes to agriculture and food distribution&#151;underlines that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0703263000175">What does Mugabe do? He blames everyone else, especially us in the United Kingdom. He persistently alleges that the UK is responsible for Zimbabwe&#146;s woes&#151;that we are somehow victimising him for his disastrous fast-track land reform policies. That is simply not true. We have always recognised the need for an equitable redistribution of land, but that has to be done in a transparent, legal manner. We signed up to all three of the internationally recognised land reform packages: in 1979, 1998 and 2001. The UK gave a total of &#163;44 million to the first of them. About &#163;3 million was returned unspent in the mid-1990s when the Zimbabwean Government lost interest in proper land reform. We were also willing to support the package put together by the United Nations Development Programme in 2001, but Mugabe&#146;s violent land invasions put a halt to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0703263000176">Let us look for a moment at Mugabe&#146;s claims that the crisis is down to us. It was his Government&#151;not the UK&#151;who displaced and destroyed the homes and livelihoods of, 700,000 people during Operation Murambatsvina, which I understand means &#147;drive out the filth&#148;. It is the Government of Zimbabwe&#151;not the UK&#151;who previously refused to appeal to the UN for food aid despite widely reported food shortages. It is the Government of Zimbabwe&#151;not the UK&#151;who have crushed a free media. It is the Government of Zimbabwe&#151;not the UK&#151;who deny Zimbabweans their basic rights of freedom of expression and assembly by routinely and violently breaking up peaceful protests. It is the Government of Zimbabwe&#151;not the UK&#151;who have ignored IMF recommendations to reform an imploding economy. It is they who continue to squander the country&#146;s limited foreign exchange while ordinary Zimbabweans can scarcely afford food. It is the Government of Zimbabwe&#151;not the UK&#151;who destroyed property rights by removing land from the legal process. It is they&#151;not the UK&#151;who have ruined the Zimbabwean agricultural sector; agricultural productivity has fallen by a staggering 80 per cent. since 1998.</p>

Government of Zimbabwe continue to blame the international community, the European Union and the UK Government for their troubles, in each case we are taking action to improve life on the ground for ordinary Zimbabweans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0703263000178">As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said last week, there is considerable concern throughout the international community about the situation in Zimbabwe. The United Kingdom is greatly concerned about the situation there, but those concerns are shared by the whole of the European Union, by the African Union&#151;sadly, those concerns have not always been expressed as loudly as they might be&#151;by the United Nations and by the rest of the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0703263000179">Ministers and officials are in constant contact with our African counterparts, emphasising the risks to regional stability and the importance of Zimbabwe&#146;s African neighbours taking a more direct role in addressing the crisis in Zimbabwe. The Prime Minister last week wrote to President Mbeki and spoke with President Kikwete of Tanzania on this issue. We recognise the difficulties in challenging Mugabe bilaterally, but without the engagement of the Southern African Development Community, with its commitment to promoting good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law, the situation will deteriorate further. We therefore welcome the visit of the chair of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, President Kikwete, to Harare on 15 March. With President Mbeki of South Africa, he has proposed an initiative to encourage internal dialogue between ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change on policy reform, but quick progress is necessary if that is to have an impact. Mugabe is a master of denial and delay. The Zambian President has recently called Zimbabwe a &#147;sinking Titanic&#148;&#151;an apt description, indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0703263000180">On the European Union, despite the claims of Mugabe about illegal economic sanctions imposed by the EU, let us be clear: the EU has no economic sanctions against Zimbabwe. They exist only in his mind. The EU does not prevent western companies, including British ones, from doing business with Zimbabwe, which in fact has a trade surplus with the UK. The EU does have an arms sales ban, and a travel ban and an assets freeze on leading members of the regime. While those targeted measures have had no impact on the Zimbabwean economy, they show that the EU is serious about human rights. Zimbabwean civil society organisations support those measures because they are focused on the destroyers of Zimbabwean society and not on its suffering people. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary told the House on Tuesday and the Prime Minister repeated the next day, we will look to add to these targeted measures. We are pushing for, and expect there to be, progress on the addition of extra names to the EU visa ban list, again pressurising the regime without impacting on ordinary Zimbabweans.</p>

Zimbabwe. For some, that money is quite literally the difference between life and death, and the House should be proud of that contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0703263000182">In the past five years, the Department for International Development has committed more than &#163;143 million to humanitarian programmes, including food aid, life-saving vaccines, support for orphans and vulnerable children, and agricultural inputs to the poorest farmers. We have also provided &#163;37 million to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Of the &#8364;200 million given by the EU last year, the UK alone disbursed nearly &#8364;60 million in bilateral assistance&#151;hardly the actions of a country not interested in the affairs of Zimbabwe; far less one with a bilateral grievance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0703263000183">As the Foreign Secretary made clear on Tuesday, our aid is channelled through United Nations and NGO agencies to escape the clutches of the regime. I want to stress that our food aid is not a part of the ZANU-PF programme to use food as a means to force support or to punish opposition. It is also clear that not only are innocent Zimbabweans suffering, but the tragedy in Zimbabwe is having a significant impact on the region: both a direct impact with mass migration, and a consequent social impact in terms of HIV, malnutrition, safety and the education of children, to name but a few factors. As Zimbabwe disintegrates, those impacts will increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0703263000184">The UK shares the region&#146;s desire to see Zimbabwe&#146;s recovery&#151;there is no other UK agenda. Our concerns are for the ordinary Zimbabweans and their suffering at the hands of a regime determined to pursue policies that hurt rather than help them. We stand ready to help, with our international partners, but only when there is an environment inside Zimbabwe in which that assistance will be effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70326-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0703263000185">Until the Zimbabwean regime changes course, we will maintain the international spotlight on them, and increase Mugabe&#146;s isolation. In that vein, I welcome France&#146;s decision not to invite Mugabe to the February France-Africa summit, which sent a clear signal that this woeful governance will not be tolerated. However, as I and others, including the Prime Minister, have made clear, the Zimbabwean crisis cannot be solvedby the UK. Those sentiments were echoed by the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who told the BBC on 18 March:</p>

Can he confirm that the UK is strongly conveying that message, particularly to the Government of South Africa? Is not it vital that the international community presents a united front in pursuing a clear strategy that increases the penalties on the Mugabe leadership? Could he have a system of incentives and disincentives clearly linked to sanctions, so that the international community can ratchet up their actions? Can he confirm reports that the UK, along with other nations, is working with moderate members of ZANU-PF to discuss the possibility of agreeing a power-sharing transitional Government?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his positive statement of support for the Government&#146;s strategy.

As I tried to outline in my remarks to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), that should be done in a way that does not undermine further the ability of Zimbabweans to see through the crisis and get to a different place.</p>

 I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) in thanking the Minister for an advance copy of the statement. The Minister has made a powerful case against Mugabe this afternoon and the whole House will be grateful to him for doing that. He did not pull his punches in his description of Mugabe&#146;s monstrous regime. I invite him to be more robust about the countries of southern Africa. Frankly, people are despairing at South Africa&#146;s softly-softly approach, in particular. Notwithstanding what the Minister said about Angola, they are alarmed by the past week&#146;s reports of closer security co-operation between the two countries.</p>

It has been reported today that to facilitate Mugabe&#146;s political demise, he might get some sort of deal letting him off the hook for all his crimes against humanity, which would surely be an appalling prospect for all of us. Will the Minister confirm that neither the United Kingdom nor the European Union would support such a tawdry arrangement?</p>

 Let me take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point first. We are not holding discussions about giving immunity to Mugabe or any other member of the regime. However, our first act must surely be to assist efforts internationally and in the region itself so that we get to a position in which Mugabe is no longer in power. However, that should be achieved by the Zimbabwean people with the support of the international community. That will be an important first step, yet what happens after that, in terms of our contingency planning, ongoing support for the people of Zimbabwe and the problems flowing from the excesses of the regime, is important. I am not dodging the question, but as the hon. Gentleman indicated, we must ensure that South Africa and the other countries in the region&#151;this is critically important&#151;and China and other countries are in a position in which they will come along with ourselves and the European Union on multilateral action to resolve the situation in Zimbabwe once and for all.

not simply wait until there is potential regime change, or indeed until there is a collapse, with all its consequences. We can already see the stresses and pressures on the front-line states around Zimbabweas a result of migration and issues related to it. It is important that the international community, including the European Union, the United States and otherlarge donors to Zimbabwe, think through what our contribution will be to assisting the transition to a democratic society and, with that, to preventing full-scale humanitarian disaster from occurring. That will be a huge effort.</p>

If they are to do so, a stable, incoming Government are needed.

If there is a collapse of government and energy supplies, they will be at risk not within days or weeks but almost within hours. In addition to the measures that the Minister discussed a moment ago about longer-term contingency plans, can he assure the House something will be put in place almost immediately, because a collapse could take place tomorrow or the next day, and people will be vulnerable immediately?

 I am delighted to open this third day of the Budget debate on the economy and the environment. It provides an opportunity to explore two key themes that will be central to our prosperity in the years ahead: first, the drive to build a low-carbon economy at home; and secondly, the need to maximise our contribution to the development of effective systems for emissions reduction around the world.</p>

It complemented measures in previous Budgets and pre-Budget reports, the Climate Change Bill and European negotiations.

The vice-president, who is recognised as an authentic voice on climate change, said that United Kingdom citizens should be proud of their record in contributing to the global fight against climate change. The starting point for the debate is, therefore, the UK&#146;s record so far and international evidence on the science and politics of climate change.</p>

For carbon dioxide, the reduction&#151;including through the EU ETS&#151;is 4 per cent. Only the countries of central and eastern Europe, the economies of which have undergone a process of restructuring since 1990, match the UK for the scale of emissions reductions.</p>

In this country, we have enjoyed 58 successive quarters of economic growth. Our inflation, according to the internationally recognised measuring standard, has been the lowest in the G7 countries in the past 10 years. Since 1997, our interest rates have been half the 11 per cent. average of the previous 20 years. Employment is at a record high, and, all the while, greenhouse gas emissions have fallen. In other words, we have given the lie to the old choice of environment versus<i> </i>economy.</p>

The figure is now 27 per cent., which beats the target that we set. I am sorry that the hon.

It states that climate change is inexorably becoming one of the major forces that shapes business, and that that presents new opportunities and enables new business to appear and develop. But while we have broken the link between economic growth and carbon growth, we know the country as a whole&#151;Government, businesses and individuals&#151;has to do better. That is the rationale behind the climate change Bill, which I look forward to debating in the House, and also for the measures in the Budget and further measures to come.</p>

 I want to ask about aggregates tax. The right hon. Gentleman and I agree that we need to reduce the use of non-sustainable resources, but given that the prime driver is transport costs, is there any evidence to suggest that the aggregates levy has actually reduced the take of virgin stone or increased the use of recycled stone? Will not removing the direct environmental benefit for the local communities affected by quarrying create a pointless levy?</p>

 The short answer to whether there is any evidence is yes, but it might be best if I write to the hon. Gentleman to provide the extensive details, some of which, I think I am right in saying, were publishedin the Red Book last week. They show some of the changes made, but I will happily write with further details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70326-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0703263000278">For the UK, there are four main sources of greenhouse gas emissions: electricity, heat, transport and waste disposal. Each needs to be addressed by a combination of Government, business and individual action. That is what the Government are determined to do. Let me start with electricity and heating supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70326-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0703263000279">It is remarkable that we can deliver more than1 million tonnes of carbon reduction from the decision to make the UK the first country in Europe to phase out all high-energy light bulbs. Further significant reductions will come from consumer electronics and from reducing the power consumed in wasteful standby mode. Renewable energy, including wind energy, will cut carbon and a continued nuclear contribution is also important. &#147;Wait and see&#148; is not a sufficient policy in this area, but to drive down energy-related emissions we need to go further in respect of the business sector and households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70326-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0703263000280">The business sector accounts for 40 per cent. of all carbon emissions. I am pleased that large businesses and large emitters are now covered by the European Union emissions trading scheme, covering nearly half of all carbon emissions in this country&#151;and more than half if aviation is included. For medium emitters, we are consulting on an energy performance commitment, but small business needs high-quality advice on energy reduction. That is why the Chancellor announced that the regional development agencies are increasing their expenditure on environmental and energy efficiency initiatives from &#163;140 million to &#163;240 million over the next year. In addition, all firms, whether or not they are in taxable profit, will have access to an enhanced capital allowance for more than 14,000 energy-saving and water-efficient products.</p>

We have reformed the planning rules for wind turbines so that they are no more difficult to install than a satellite dish and we are committed to help all householders take advantageof cost-effective energy efficiency measures. We also believe that individuals should be able to export electricity more easily to the grid, which is why Ofgem is conducting a special study of how we can better reward people for taking the step of becoming an electricity producer, not just a consumer.</p>

The principle is simple: instead of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels being released into the atmosphere, it is captured at source and stored safely underground. The results are transformational, with about 85 to 90 per cent. of carbon emissions removed from coal-fired power stations. The requirement is now urgent, which is why we are determined to have a demonstration plant in the UK, why a competition is now being launched by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and why we want to show the world, especially developing countries, that this is not a technology to fear, but one to embrace.</p>

The commitments on fuel duty, over the three years, make that choice more likely. We predict that they will save 160,000 tonnes of carbon a year by 2016. Fuel-efficient cars in band B have CO2 emissions of about half those in band G.

Different people have to make different choices for all sorts of reasons. This is not about forcing Nissan Micras down the throats of farmers, as was suggested earlier. However, if we are to have a graduated system that does not become impossibly complex to administer&#151;for example, many people in rural areas might have a larger car but will not drive it only in that area&#151;there will always be a balance to be struck with simplicity.

 I am sorry to disappoint the Secretary of State, but one difficulty with &#147;tallying up&#148; the environmental effect of the Budget is the precise result that the Government intend with their alterations to the climate change levy.

 The climate change levy has been raised by inflation, and the associated climate change agreements work with it. I understand the hon.

Obviously there is an arithmetical relationship between tax and output, but my experience of talking to businesses suggests to me that the climate change levy and the associated agreements are causing them to take a whole new attitude to the way in which they deal with energy. In other words, the climate change levy&#151;which, as I shall make clear later, has saved about 16 million tonnes of carbon so far&#151;has had a bigger effect than an arithmetical calculation might suggest.

They have left behind a trail of missed targets on the environment, and they are going to miss the most important target of all. It must be the most important of all, because it has appeared in three successive Labour party election manifestos: the 20 per cent. cut in carbon emissions by 2010.</p>

However, unlike our proposals, he is using green taxes not as replacement taxes, offset by tax cuts elsewhere, but as a stealth tax. I cannot think of a better way to alienate public support for measures to tackle climate change than to dress up stealth taxes as green taxes.

In Wednesday&#146;s response to that letter, the Chancellor cut the bottom rate by &#163;15&#151;heady stuff&#151;and increased the top rate by &#163;200. Does the Chancellor seriously think that someone thinking of paying &#163;75,000 for a Porsche Cayenne will have second thoughts because of a &#163;200 hike in vehicle excise duty? This is a classic example of ineffectual tinkering. We need to be far more ambitious and radical. It is high time that the Government backed a commitment to getting car emissions down to 100g per kilometre, with a clear package of incentives and regulations to ensure that the goal is met.</p>

 The concerns that were expressed were in relation to the impact on people in remote rural areas who need to use heavy-duty cars to go about their business. There is a genuine problem there, and the Government have admitted as much.</p>

He asked the Chancellor to look into stamp duty rebates for new zero-carbon development. In Wednesday&#146;s response to the letter, the Chancellor did indeed promise no stamp duty for new zero-carbon homes, but with this Chancellor nothing is straightforward. He sneakily put a five-year time limit on the stamp duty exemption. How many zero-carbon homes does the Secretary of State honestly think will be built by 2012&#151;the deadline for the exemption? Will he explain why a Minister killed off the Local Planning Authorities (Energy and Energy Efficiency) Bill, which was promoted by the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) and which had all-party support. Itwould have allowed local authorities to set tougher environmental standards for new homes. It is extraordinary: the Government wreck a Bill by one of their own Labour colleagues that could have made a real difference and instead offer a hollow headline about stamp duty relief on houses that do not exist.</p>

In Wednesday&#146;s response tothat letter, the Chancellor attempted to support microgeneration. First, he promised an income tax exemption for domestically produced energy sold back to the grid. That looks like a good move&#151;until one reads the small print. The move is not exactly life-changing. Experts say that it would be worth, at most, &#163;22 a year to householders who go through the hassle of installing renewable energy in their homes&#151;big deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70326-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07032618000035">It gets worse. Income tax is not currently collected on microgenerated energy anyway, so we have something completely new here. It is not a stealth tax; it is a ghost tax. The scheme does nothing to makeit easier for home owners to sell their energy. The Chancellor made no effort to push for a higher grid price for microgenerated energy or for smart meters to allow everyone to buy and export energy more easily. The Chancellor claims that he has asked Ofgem to look into the matter. We are so bored of his asking peopleto look into it. We have seen endless consultationsand dither, timidity where we need boldness, and half-hearted and piecemeal meddling where we need consistency and leadership.</p>

Then in December we were told that a monthly cap would be placed on grants to try to draw the scheme out. Then last week we were told that the scheme was being temporarily suspended. Is it not utterly typical that the Department of Trade and Industry released a stealth announcement on Budget day that suspended the low-carbon buildings programme for at least two months?

 The hon. Gentleman has not exactly answered the question. The ominous silence on the question of the impact of the Lyons report on farming will echo around the countryside.

In sum, the 2007 Budget was full of headline-grabbing half measures and wholesale omissions. The Chancellor might have commissioned the Stern review, but it is clear that he has not taken its findings to heart. He just does not get it. It is because there are still people in British politics who do not get it, such as the Chancellor, that the forthcoming Climate Change Bill should provide for annual rate-of-charge targets to be set and auditedby an independent body. The Government need a better annual yardstick than a leaked letter from the Environment Secretary. We need a climate change policy that is based on science, not spin.</p>

I probably do not need to remind you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Brains was a slightly weird, geeky character. However, above all, he was a plastic puppet jerking around on the end of a piece of string. We all know who the puppet master is; the strings are held in a clunking fist belonging to the man who assumes that he will soon be the next Prime Minister. People are sick of spin, stealth taxes, tax cons and puppet Secretaries of State whose ambitions, when they exist at all, are ignored and ridiculed by the Chancellor. We need a step change in our approach to the environment. We need a sense of urgency and a message of hope, opportunity and determination. This Budget proves beyond doubt that the last thing that anyone who cares about our fragile environment needs is the change at the top that is being engineered by the Labour party.

 That is what I thought my right hon.

What my right hon. Friend did not say which needs to be said is that the EU emissions trading system is very poorly crafted. The baselines are far too lax, the allowances are far too generous, and the net deductions are, in reality, very much smaller than is claimed. If that somewhat deceptive scheme, which needs to be sharpened up hugely, is excluded, as I think it should be, I fear that our greenhouse gas emissions have hardly gone down at all since 1997. I am not saying that they have not gone down, but they have gone down by a very small amount. My real point is that they have gone down by much less than the 2 to 3 per cent. a year that is needed if we are to achieve the target of a 60 per cent. reduction by 2050.</p>

 We all know that there have been considerable problems with tax credits. We are perfectly well aware of that&#151;and I know that the Government are striving to overcome those problems&#151;but the principle of tax credits for working families is a very good one. One of the problems is that not every one who is entitled to a tax credit necessarily claims or receives it. The principle is a good one, but I am worried that through the tax system, the Government are effectively supporting employers who pay their lowest-paid employees too little. That is the fundamental cause of the problem.</p>

Their share of national income fell from 13 per cent. in 1937 to just over 4 per cent. in 1974, but in the Thatcher-Major years it rose rapidly back to almost 11 per cent. in 1997. I submit to the House that we are now returning to the inequality of the 1930s, if not of the Edwardian era. Their share of national wealth has ballooned even more. It shot up from 17 per cent. in 1990 to 23 per cent. in 2002, so fewer than half a million adults&#151;the group that I am talking about&#151;controls nearly a quarter of the entire wealth of the nation, while half the population, over 20 million individuals, have seen their share fall to just 6 per cent. in 2002.

Those at the very top, the richest 1,000 in Britain, have seen their wealth triple from &#163;99 billion to &#163;301 billion since 1997. In the past year alone, the overall wealth of this group soared by 21 per cent. or by more than &#163;50 billion, and the number of billionaires has tripled from 14 to 54.

 I am certainly not opposed to that. The previous Prime Minister of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party, Lady Thatcher, made a very considerable effort in the 1980s to achieve an extension of share ownership. To a degree, she did, but it stuck at around 9 to 12 per cent. If anything, the concentration of share ownership among the most wealthy has continued since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07032618000078">All this matters for three reasons. First, the corollary to this extreme maldistribution in income and wealth is the persistence of poverty and inequality. It is worth noting&#151;I say this for illustrative rather than practical purposes&#151;that if all the gains made by the top 1 per cent. since 1997 were transferred to the poor, poverty would be abolished overnight. I do not expect that to happen, but it illustrates the point that I am trying to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07032618000079">Secondly, such excessive widening of inequality cannot conceivably be justified. Like everyone in the House, I believe in merit, fair rewards and incentives, but this is on a completely different scale. It in no way reflects improvement in business performance. Indeed, we read every week in the paper about rewarding failure, which has become commonplace. Rather, it is self-enrichment on a mega scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07032618000080">In 1980 a chief executive of a top company might have earned some 25 times more than the average worker. Today, it is 120 times. Last year the average pay of the FTSE 100 chief executives, including bonuses, share options and so-called fringe benefits, was&#163;2.8 million. I have done a quick sum. That works out at &#163;46,155 a week, which is 550 times more than the state pension and 230 times greater than the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07032618000081">There is a third reason&#151;for me, it is the most profound&#151;why such drastic inequality matters. There is now abundant international data showing that the greater the inequality between the richest and the poorest, the higher the levels of ill health, crime and social breakdown across society. The price of extraordinary material success for a tiny number is social failure and dysfunction within society, which is not a bit surprising. Increased social hierarchy and increasing social inequality significantly raise the stakes on personal worth, and for those who lose out, the feelings of inferiority, resentment and inability to compete inevitably generate antisocial reactions towards the society that demeans them.</p>

tried very hard to limit social dysfunction by relentless targeting to deal with inefficiency, misdemeanours, crime, poor performance and inadequate effort. I praise all that, although I sometimes think it a bit excessive. However, it is not perceived that those policies are incompatible, because the pursuit of inequality persistently undermines the Government&#146;s real efforts to improve health and educational outcomes, to cut crime, to improve social mobility, to build sustainable communities and, obviously, to reduce poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07032618000084">There are some other lessons for the Government. The Chancellor&#146;s predilection for giving the market its head to work in its normal way as an engine for generating huge and growing inequalities and for then, very commendably, trying to correct some of the worst excesses at the margin by improving benefits and allowances of some of the neediest groups in the Budget will not work.

The net cost of that measure would be about &#163;7 billion, although if it were confined to the over-85s, which I would understand, it would be less than &#163;3 billion.

That is affordable, when many companies continue to pay dividends each year which exceed their pension scheme deficits. I shall give one example from the Lane, Clark and Peacock survey: in 2005, Vodafone paid out a dividend of &#163;2.7 billion, which was significantly more than its accounting deficit of &#163;136 million, and24 companies declared dividends in excess of twice the amount of their pension scheme deficit.

It should be increased straight away to &#163;6 an hour, and soon after that it should be increased again to at least &#163;7 an hour&#151;incidentally, that would be without any risk of higher unemployment from internationally traded goods and services. As for top incomes, which may be of more interest to hon. Members, they need to be justifiedand not simply appropriated. We should require companies&#151;at least the larger ones&#151;to call a meeting once a year of representatives of all the main grades in the company from the highest to the lowest to open the books, to examine what is left for increasing wages and salaries after all the costs have been met and to allow people to justify their claims, if they can, to all those present. Transparency would not prevent fair or even large differentials, which I am certainly not opposed to if they are justified, but it would make the naked greed of some much harder to carry off at the expense of everyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07032631000002">I am happy to say that there is a good deal to welcome in this Budget&#146;s environmental measures. I should particularly congratulate the Chancellor and the Secretary of State on the Congo basin initiative. Tackling deforestation will be a key part of a global attack on climate change, because, as we know from the Stern review, it is responsible for 18 per cent. of carbon emissions. It is essential that we develop a policy that works not only in the Congo basin, but in Brazil, Indonesia, Borneo and Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07032631000003">I also welcome the competition to develop a full-scale demonstration of carbon capture and storage, which is a vital interim technology. The rise of the climate change levy in line with inflation is overdue, as are the rises in the landfill tax and the aggregates levy. Zero carbon homes are to have no stamp duty levied on them, so let us just hope that house builders are encouraged to build some and that it will prove to be a reassuringly expensive concession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07032631000004">The Budget&#146;s key importance is that it is the prime statement about the economy in the parliamentary year. The climate change debate is an economic one: it is about how we change our economy and how we undergo a new industrial revolution. There is a big difference between the new industrial revolution that we shall require over the next four decades andthose that have occurred, all of which were driven overwhelmingly by the desire to satisfy new consumer needs, whether we are talking about moving from gas light to electric light or from the steam engine to the internal combustion engine. There are advantages in tackling climate change, but this will be the first major technological change that will have to be driven both globally and by policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07032631000005">The Government&#146;s record is, unfortunately, disappointing. I look forward to the figures that the Secretary of State has promised us. The published figures in the &#147;Environmental Accounts&#148; show that emissions have increased since 1997, even given the enormous advantage of the electricity generating sector&#146;s movement from gas to coal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07032631000006">I turn to the spending side of the Budget, where flood defences cuts this year look exceptionally short-sighted, as do biodiversity research cuts at the centres for ecology and hydrology, such as the centre at Wool in Dorset, which have done so much important work in understanding how our natural system&#151;our flora and fauna&#151;will adjust to climate change. Even more ridiculously, there have been cuts in expenditure on the Hadley centre, which is probably the world&#146;s leading research centre on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70326-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07032631000007">On the broader environmental front, I noted that the Secretary of State was proud of the Government&#146;s record on recycling. I should merely add that we started at an extraordinarily low base and that the latest environmental comparisons within the European Union show that our recycling rate remains the third lowest of all member states.</p>

impact of the Budget would be. The Red Book devotes a whole chapter to the environment and hardly a week goes by when the Chancellor and his Treasury team do not tell us that it is essential that there should be environmental impact assessments and assessments of compliance costs, yet the Secretary of State is unable to tell us what the impact of these measures will be. I look forward to hearing his reply, because the research that we have conducted appears to show that they will have combined effect of reducing the amount of carbon emissions by about 330,000 tonnes&#151;or 0.15 per cent. of the UK&#146;s total. That makes the point that this is far from the planned route march towards a decarbonised economy that is essential if we are to grasp our opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70326-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07032631000009">Transport has largely been ignored on the tax side, yet its emissions are key. The Environmental Audit Committee&#146;s recent report told us that such emissions have increased by 18 per cent., yet the Chancellor, as we all know, was spooked by the fuel duty protests in 2000 and since then, green taxation as a share of gross domestic product&#151;the only sensible measurement of the tax burden&#151;has fallen from 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1999 to 2.9 per cent. on the latest figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70326-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07032631000010">Is that a good measure of effort? It is a summary measure. The idea that if green taxes work they may vanish is simply wrong, because a continued high tax and high price on bad activities may be necessary to sustain a continued change in demand. Many Chancellors have discovered that sin taxes pay, and this Chancellor would have an exceptionally large hole in his Budget if he were not able to rely on the ongoing revenue from tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70326-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07032631000011">The specifics of this Budget on the environment, and on taxation in particular, are not good. The Liberal Democrats are unequivocal that the vehicle excise duty changes do not go far enough; we know exactly what the likely impact of the increase to &#163;400 will be, because the Energy Saving Trust commissioned a MORI opinion poll that examined the likely impact on purchases. It found that 33 per cent. of car purchasers were likely to change their view as a result of that increase in vehicle excise duty.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has used the Energy Saving Trust&#146;s figure that there will be an impact on 33 per cent. of people. Will he confirm that he is citing a poll from 2003 and that the differential in the bands was &#163;50? There was not the &#163;300 to &#163;400 versus &#163;35 differential that will exist.</p>

 I can confirm that the poll was from 2003, but it is the latest poll that has been conducted. The Secretary of State is misinformed if he believes that the use of the &#163;50 per band is inappropriate, because the &#163;400 applies to band G&#151;the highest band&#151;and if one were to add up the &#163;50 for each step, funnily enough one would reach that sort of figure. I am sorry that his arithmetic is as challenged as it appears. I rest my case: if we were to adopt the &#163;2,000 figure that the Liberal Democrats have proposed, we would change the purchasing decisions of 72 per cent. of the population, rather than 33 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70326-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07032631000015">On the aviation proposals, we have seen that the increase from &#163;5 to &#163;10 merely gets the Chancellor back to where he first started. There is nothing in these proposals to base our national aviation tax on the emissions of the flight, which is the only sensible way to proceed because doing so would ensure that where a flight takes off half full the amount of tax that is paid is not halved. There would be an incentive to fill up the flight and the airline would have an incentive to move more rapidly towards having low emissions aircraft.</p>

We know from opinion poll evidence from Populus that71 per cent. of the British population will back green taxes if they are not regarded as a stealth tax and ifthe revenue is handed back. However, 62 per cent. of the population do not believe that that is what the Chancellor is doing&#151;unfortunately, they believe that he is merely raising revenue in another stealth tax.</p>

 My understanding is that the hon.

He likened green taxes to sin taxes in that they would become a permanent part of the Government&#146;s revenue-raising measures and so would not be designed to change behaviour, but now he talks about giving things back. There is a contradiction in his position.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a highly intelligent Member of the House and knows very well that changing behaviour on an ongoing basis often requires ongoing changes in price. Green taxes will change people&#146;s behaviour. For example, in the case of vehicle excise duty, 72 per cent. of the populationwill change the car purchases that they make, but that will leave 28 per cent. continuing to buy gas guzzlers and paying substantially more as a result.</p>

It will have legally binding targets for carbon emissions. It anticipates the first carbon budget period being between 2008 and 2012, which is roughly concurrent with the comprehensive spending review and its parallel public spending agreements. The Government now have an opportunity to tie together their investment and activity with our obligations to cut emissions under Kyoto and our own self-imposed obligations under the draft Bill.</p>

We will get the joining up of the East London line with Highbury and Islington and the breathing of new life into the tragically neglected North London line. We will get hybrid buses introduced across London&#151;first, I hope, on to Islington&#146;s badly polluted streets.

 The answer is many but not enough&#151;we can always do more. Our ambition is clear and we are moving in the right direction.

As we proved with social housing, that will not happen as result of market forces alone. We can achieve our goal only by stepping in as a Government commitment to working together. We cannot simply leave matters to the market. When Labour Members talk about housing, we know that it is a priority for our houses to be green, but that we also desperately need more of them and that they must be affordable.</p>

There will be an extra credit of &#163;60 a week for the first year compared with &#163;40 for parents in other parts of the UK. Some parents in London who do not go to work currently feel that they cannot afford it because of the high costs of housing and child care.

However, we need to make sure that all children across London and the rest of the UK can get the help they need from the centreas well. The patchiness of response from PCTs and strategic health authorities has been recognised in the review and I hope that the upcoming comprehensive spending review ensures that there is dedicated funding for children with communication difficulties and disabilities in general.

They will not spell out their policy positions because they know that they are unpopular. The Lib Dems, on the other hand, have never had to take responsibility for anything, so they have no track record. In their 36-page paper on tax policy, child poverty is not mentioned once. They should be ashamed. The Lib Dem tax plans hardly mention tax credits, which is not much of an assurance for those hard-working families who rely on them.

All the other Budget speeches, including the previous ones from the current Chancellor, have been political: after all, we are politicians, and one expects politics from politicians. Until this year, however, all those Budgets, even this Chancellor&#146;s, have concentrated on the needs of the real world. But this Budget was about two things only: trying to secure the Chancellor&#146;s position as the next Prime Minister; and trying to embarrass and discredit the opposition&#151;although I am not sure whether he had in mind the Opposition on this side of the Chamber, or the opposition from within his own party to his prospective leadership.</p>

If my reading of the figures, all the expert comment and the Red Book is wrong, and the Chancellor really was offering tax cuts, I would welcome such a remarkable U-turn.

 Until one gets round to reading the Red Book, it is easy to be taken in by the Chancellor. Only a close reading of the Red Book, as I will show in my speech, will reveal the true nature of the Budget. It is important to repeat the point that I implied earlier: the most breathtaking aspect of the Budget was the way in which the Chancellor appeared&#151;I say &#147;appeared&#148; for reasons that I shall explain&#151;to embrace Conservative party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70326-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07032631000090">As I was saying, the Chancellor&#146;s great mistake was to think that the British people would be taken in&#151;but they will not be. After all the stealth taxes of the past 10 years, they are paying more, and getting less for it, and they know it. An attempt was made to presentit as less pounds or bang, whatever the phrase is, for your buck&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am glad to see that my colleague on the Trade and Industry Committee,the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), is in the Chamber and making sedentary interventions, but he knows what I meant. The Chancellor tried to present the Budget as fiscally neutral, and then offered us tax cuts. We know that the two things are contradictory, and the Chancellor is nothing if not a man of ruthless logic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70326-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07032631000091">Instead, however, the Chancellor invited us into the looking-glass world of Alice. You will remember the moment, Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70326-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07032631000092">The happily named Red Queen did not persuade Alice, and the red Chancellor certainly has not persuaded the country. Well before breakfast on the day after the Budget, the British people knew exactly what was going on. Sadly, some right-wing commentators did not. One, writing in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> the following day, said that the Conservative economic policy now lay in smoking ruins after the Chancellor&#146;s tax cuts. Admittedly, he described the cuts as symbolic, recognising that they were not really tax cuts at all. He seemed to believe, however, that British people would be taken in. I have more faith in my fellow countrymen and women. The commentator wrote:</p>
<a name="70326-0012.htm_brev7"><a name="07032631000279"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The message is simple; the Tories are now the party of high taxation, Labour is the party that gives you tax cuts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70326-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07032631000093">Just how wrong can a clever man be? The so-called tax cuts were all offset, to use the appropriate phrase, by tax increases elsewhere in the Budget&#151;as they had to be to achieve neutrality, not of carbon but of tax rates. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70326-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07032631000094">Let us consider, for example, the massive growth in the revenue from stamp duty shown in table C8 of the Red Book&#151;a growth of &#163;4 billion in two years. In London and the south-east, and now in many other parts of the country, that is a tax on hard-working families, not on the rich. There is no real danger of the Labour party being seen as tax cutters: the British people know a con trick when they see one. Incidentally, promising the illusory tax cut in a year&#146;s time did not help the Chancellor&#146;s cause much either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07032631000095">Although the British people are wearying of their growing tax burden, they want the real thing when it comes to tax cuts, not deception. They know that the Chancellor had already increased taxes by &#163;2.5 billion since the last Budget, so it was never going to be a day of announcing bad news&#151;he had &#163;2.5 billion in the bank. Those tax increases, which would normally have been part of this Budget, were announced in the autumn statement, and included a massive increase in air passenger duty that is already being paid by hard-working people without the traditional legislative scrutiny or authority. That is really stealthy&#151;a tax that was imposed in February and not mentioned in the Budget will get legislative authority only tomorrow night.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07032631000096">Conservatives should not be worried about the Budget in relation to tax cuts; the real danger is that the Chancellor has adopted our fundamental economic policy, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made clear in his response to the Budget. The Chancellor has done that cautiously, but he has adopted it, and it is called sharing the proceeds of growth. The same right-wing commentator whom I mentioned described that policy as a &#147;silly little catchphrase&#148;, but he is badly, dangerously wrong. It is not a catchphrase; it is a very good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07032631000097">Let me try to explain this simple concept to the clever people who seem to find it elusive. There are, in essence, only three things that a Chancellor can do. He can steadily increase the share of the national wealth that is taken by the state, he can keep it broadly stable, or he can reduce it. The Conservatives believe that he should reduce it. Then comes the choice about the rate at which to reduce it. The route that we have chosen would mean that some of the growth would be used to provide improved public services in real terms and some to reduce taxes. That is the prudent route. It is prudent politically because we know that the British people rightly value public services such as health, education, the police force and defence. It is an economically prudent route because it offers the best guarantee of economic stability and of increasing competitiveness. The Chancellor plans to increase public spending in each of the next three years by less than the growth rate of the economy as a whole, but he could have gone further. He has planned for a gap of only about 0.5 per cent. in his sums&#151;increasing public expenditure by 2 to 2.5 per cent. a year while the economy grows by 2.5 to 3 per cent. However, it is a step in the right direction. He is sharing the proceeds of growth timidly, but he is doing it.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his thesis that an economy with low taxes and low public expenditure is a strong economy is fatally flawed? Last year&#146;s Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures show that Sweden spent57.1 per cent. of its gross domestic product on public services, while Denmark spent 53.8 per cent., Finland spent 50.6 per cent. and the UK spent 45.4 per cent., so we are at the bottom of that league table. However, the highest growth figures are in the countries with the highest public spending figures, such as Sweden. We are also at the bottom of that list. Does he accept, therefore, that his argument is entirely wrong?</p>

rather stronger than would otherwise have been the case&#151;again, I deny the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. That is the real danger of this Budget for my party, but itis good news for the country. Our economic competitiveness has been slowly declining under this Government, but the planned reduction in the share of national wealth, to be taken by the state, could begin modestly to correct that, although the Chancellor&#146;s borrowing plans in table C5 of the Red Book remain a cause for real concern.</p>

 I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, but given that the state spends money mainly on benefits and salaries, there are only three ways in which to achieve what he and the Chancellor propose. They are to reduce benefits, to ensure that public sector pay stays behind the national average or to choose different Budget priorities. Is not that the case? Which of those three options does he advocate?</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="07032631000101"><a name="70326-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032631000356"><b>Peter Luff:</b>
 My hon. Friend the Member forBeverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) just helpfully said, &#147;Zero-sum economics&#148;, and I deny the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point on that ground as well. If expenditure on public services continues to increase in real terms, that choice is nowhere near as acute as he maintains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07032631000102">Other than in the early years, when the Chancellor stuck to Conservative spending plans, the Government steadily but surely eroded our competitiveness. In the past 10 years, our economic growth has been sustained for three reasons, and I hate to disappoint the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, but I disagreed profoundly with one of her remarks. The first reason is the golden economic inheritance, including significant supply side reforms, that the Chancellor had from the previous Conservative Government. The second reason is the decision to give the Bank of England independence. The third reason is the decision not to join the euro. I salute the Chancellor for making the latter two decisions, which were positive, if one can call a decision not to join something positive. If I were Chancellor, and the Bank of England were not independent, I might have tried to use my influence to persuade it not to remove Elgar from the &#163;20 note in the year of the 150th anniversary of his birth, but that is another matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07032631000103">Sadly, all the Chancellor&#146;s other decisions have worked to undermine our competitiveness. In the uniquely benign world environment of the past 10 years, it would have been a scandal if the British economy had not flourished. Things have got better, but they should have been much better still. That is the real scandal. The Chancellor has nothing to boast about except for those two crucial decisions on the Bank of England and the euro. He was simply in the right place at the right time, and is a lucky Chancellor. Even the Government&#146;s supporters are beginning to realise that the clunking fist might have been clutching at straws. Derek Scott, the Prime Minister&#146;s former economic guru said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07032631000105">Let us look at some of the specifics. On business taxation, I am happy to reassure the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton that taxes on business will rise as a result of the Budget, not go down. There will be an extra &#163;1 billion in 2008-09 and &#163;1.8 billion in the following year, despite the apparent headline cut in corporation tax. I welcome the cut in corporate tax: the embodiment of the Conservative policy was that the corporate tax regime should be simplified and the simplification used to reduce the headline rate. That is a good idea. Bizarrely, however, the Chancellor then behaved exactly as the Red Queen would have him behave by not simply wishing to do two flatly contradictory things, but actually doing them. He simplified the main corporate tax system and used the simplification to cut the headline rate, but he also made the small business scheme more complex and used the complexity to increase the headline rate. Make sense of that if you can, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07032631000106">The clunking fist has been clunking all over our nation&#146;s smaller businesses. The Chancellor is raising corporation tax by 3 per cent. for some companies, thus taking from them a further &#163;820 million by 2009-10. Considering that the small business sector employs nearly 60 per cent. of the private sector work force and contributes half of the national GDP, the Chancellor should realise how angry people&#151;not anonymous businesses, but real voting people&#151;will feel about that. The British Chambers of Commerce surveyed its members and found that 71 per cent. of UK businesses believe that the rise will harm them. The BCC commented that, as the Chancellor</p>
<a name="70326-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07032631000281"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;champions enterprise and acknowledges the importance of small business to the UK economy,&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07032631000108">It adds, most worryingly, that it will especially harm those that are looking to grow their business. It is a pleasure to reassure the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton again by saying that that comes on top of the massive &#163;50 billion tax increases on British businesses since Labour came to powerand the roughly similar cost of regulation that the Government have added to the cost of doing business.</p>

On eight pages headed, &#147;Business information No. 134&#148;, Alan Roxborough enumerates the 57 varieties&#151;literally&#151;of Government actions that demand the attentionof small business in this two-month period, some of which are very important, such as the first provisions of the Companies Act 2006 about the changes that they will have to make to their websites and letterheads. Others include the working restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, the new rules for cutting waste crime, the implementation of the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, the new money laundering regulations, access to good quality pensions  <br>

and the penalties for incorrect tax returns. Another variety concerns streetworks permits, which are an important matter for small businesses when roads outside their front doors are dug up without any notice. I am sure that all those changes are worthy and necessary, but 57 in a two-month period? No wonder small businesses are hurting so much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70326-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07032631000110">Such a hostile attitude towards business is not unsurprising. A CBI poll suggested that 22 per cent. of British-based businesses have relocated one or more of their assets abroad, and that a further 17 per cent. are thinking of doing so. In the majority of cases, tax was the reason for that. There is another answer for the right hon. Gentleman. Indeed, 70 per cent. of the UK&#146;s business leaders believe that the UK&#146;s tax regime has got worse and more complex.</p>

 Over time, yes. It would generate more wealth for the country, and there would be moremoney to be spent on vital public services. The hon.

I do so with some trepidation, as I know that mention of that organisation sends a certain shiver of apprehension up many people&#146;s spines, but it has done a very good and detailed job of work on economic competitiveness and similar issues. Among other things, the survey provides a vital measure of our economic freedom from Government, which shows that we are doing particularly badly.

Perhaps that is what he was referring to. I tabled a named-day question that should have been answered before this debate began, seeking clarification from the Treasury. I have not received that clarification, and I must tell the Economic Secretary that while I realise that some of my speech has been knockabout in style, this is an extremely serious point. If the Chancellor plans to take too much money from the sale of spectrum by Ofcom, he may have a devastating effect on a whole sector of the economy that I know he does not actually wish to harm. I seek reassurance, and the answer that I should have had today.</p>

The Budget claimed to put education at its heart, but&#151;probably rightly&#151;kept education spending increases in line with growth in gross domestic product. The hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) denied that in a radio interview in which I took part with him last week, but it is true: 2.5 per cent. is the figure. That means that the years when it would have been easy to reduce the growing gap have been wasted. I refer to the years in which everyone was receiving larger increases. Those were years when a slightly higher percentage for the least well-funded local education authorities, such as Worcestershire, could have been offset by slightly smaller increases for LEAs such as Birmingham. If that had been done, the gap would have been painlessly closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07032631000136">In fact, those years were worse than wasted. Because of the iron law of compound interest, places such as Birmingham became immeasurably richer, and shot ahead of Worcestershire in terms of per-pupil funding. Now that future increases in the overall budget will be so much more modest, it will be harder to close the gap without squeals of pain from people at the top of the league table of expenditure who have grown used to living on their high spending.</p>

For me, and for Worcestershire, these are the politics of a regrettably political Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07032631000141">I want to talk about the environment, and particularly about energy and renewable energy as that is the headline subject of the debate. The Government have gone some way in the right direction in the Chancellor&#146;s Budget, but we have not gone anywhere near far enough. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) spoke last week, and he said that in Germany there are a hundred times more buildings with solar roof panels than thereare in Britain. That highlights that something is fundamentally wrong. He also mentioned the renewable energy approach taken in Freiburg, where I understand that a third of people cycle to work. The Germans are far ahead of us, and our Government and Chancellor must go much further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07032631000142">In terms of renewable energy, there are many other areas in which we could improve. We should be building barrages across the Thames and the Severn to generate electricity. They would also help in defending us against rising sea levels, which will occur as a result of global warming. If we do not do that on the Thames and do nothing about rising sea levels, we in this Chamber might find that we have wet feet. A barrage across the Thames&#151;another barrage&#151;with generators right across it would be beneficial in many respects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07032631000143">There are many other forms and sources of renewable energy, such as geothermal energy and biofuels. If we were to invest heavily in them&#151;including in wind, wave and tidal power, and in solar panels&#151;we would not need nuclear and we wouldbe become strategically much more independent. At present, we are heavily dependent on imported gas. That gas comes from countries that are currently sort of friendly, and it comes across countries that are sort of friendly. Even the Germans were recently made very pleased by the fact that gas is delivered to us through Germany; that gives them a certain political leverage, which might be useful in the future. We are aware of the situation that arose between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine was beholden to Russia for its gas, and we do not want to be in that situation. The more independent we become by producing renewable energies, the better it will be for us in every sense, making us a genuinely independent democratic country and not at risk of having political difficulties in the future because we import much of our energy.</p>

However, I suggest to Members&#151;including the Chancellor&#151;that it is possible to achieve that, and that if we have the political will we can do such things. Six or seven years ago, we had the lowest level of basic state pension in  <br>

Europe by a considerable margin, and I think that that is probably still the case. The next lowest level was &#163;150 a week, which was the rate in Germany. We have a long way to go to catch up, and to set a target pension worth 25 per cent. of earnings would be thoroughly justifiable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07032631000145">How would we pay for that? We would have to do many things, and I suggest that we should start by raising revenue, which would mean raising national insurance contributions. I recently tabled a written question on that, asking that we remove the upper earnings limit and have a standard percentage allthe way up the income scale. That would bring in&#163;6.6 billion, which could go straight into pensions. An hon. Friend has asked a question about the current surplus in the national insurance fund; it is about&#163;73 billion, which is a considerable sum. I know that it is useful for the Treasury to be able to live off the income of that surplus, but we should use some of that surplus to boost pensions now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07032631000146">We must also go further in order to raise income to finance a higher basic state pension, but it is not impossible to take the necessary measures. We could secure income from other areas. There is an entire chapter in the Institute for Fiscal Studies green Budget report of this year about VAT fraud, which currently amounts to about &#163;1 billion a month. We should pursue that fraud more assiduously. If we could get back just half of that sum, that would give us an extra &#163;6 billion a year. There is also a massive gap in other areas between the tax that should be paid and how much is actually paid. Some people suggest that the total tax gap is more than &#163;100 billion a year. That sounds like a phenomenal figure, but even if it was half that and we got half of that amount, we would have &#163;25 billion a year in extra income. Such is the sum that we would receive if we pursued that taxation rigorously and assiduously. The Chancellor should do that. Some years ago, I went to my local VAT office where I was told that for every extra VAT officer employed, five times the salary of that officer could be collected&#151;apparently, that is true in other areas of revenue collection as well. I wrote to the Treasury suggesting that we employ many more VAT inspectors and thereby collect much more revenue.</p>

account the level of income tax that is paid now is tiny, particularly at the top end, compared with the level in that period. I remember the figures well&#151;I am of an age to do so. The top marginal rate when Jim Callaghan was in office&#151;which I call the golden age of socialism&#151;was 83p in the pound, and in addition there was a 15 per cent. unearned income surcharge. Therefore, some people&#151;the genuine billionaires&#151;were paying 98p in the pound on the top part of their income. I do not suggest that we should go quite that far, but I do suggest that a compromise position in respect of those people could be found that is between that 98 per cent. rate and a 40 per cent. rate.</p>

 The odd pop singer or footballer might leave the country, but that would not seriously damage our economy. Let me draw attention to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics on top marginal personal income tax rates for employees in 2006. All of the following countries have considerably higher top marginal rates than us: France, Japan, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Denmark. Denmark&#146;s top rate is 62.9 per cent. and Germany&#146;s is 60.5 per cent. and ours is down at 41 per cent. I suspect that floods of wealthy people have not left those countries, thereby damaging their economies.</p>

 I just do not believe that. Some people whose income is at the top end of the tax system might even think that it is a good idea to pay a little more tax and to make a bigger contribution to society. Some years ago I had lunch in the City&#151;I do not often go to the City&#151;and I talked with people who had been watching television when Nigel Lawson announced his 1998 Budget in which he cut the top marginal rate from 60 per cent. to 40 per cent. They were all amazed; &#147;But we do not need the money&#148;, they said. They were City people, who are probably represented by Opposition Members. I suspect that not many people would leave the country if there was a higher rate of tax, and that that would certainly not change the way that most people voted.

 I have no doubt that there would be some marginal effects, but I suspect that they would not be anything like as significant as the hon.

 They are very welcome and I am happy to see them here; they are no doubt making money and repatriating some of it to their own countries. Such effects might prove marginal, but they would not have a fundamental impact on our economy. What would have such an impact is greater income, collected in a much fairer way, for spending on the poor and the needy, and on public services. We need to make a serious attempt at redistributing income that goes some way back toward the position in the 1970s&#151;and, indeed, in the 1950s and 1960s, under Conservative as well as Labour Governments. The people of Britain would massively welcome our moving in that direction&#151;toward the social democratic regimes of Scandinavia&#151;and it would not be economically damaging.

We have the poorest health in the region, the biggest health inequalities and serious problems with heart disease and other illnesses.

A royal commission recommended that some years ago, and we have had early-day motions&#151;I myself tabled two in two Parliaments&#151;calling for free long-term care, which more than 100 Government Members have signed. This has been a big issue on the doorstep. I do not want working-class people who have bought for the first time in their family&#146;s history a little terraced house, or even a council house&#151;I do not approve of that principle, but it is understandable that they would wish to buy it because it is a bargain&#151; to be forced to sell the little bit of equity that they have because granny then starts suffering from dementia and they have to pay for her care.</p>

I urge my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to give serious thought to that idea, and to recognise the wisdom of the royal commission&#146;s report all those years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07032631000168">This has been an excellent Budget debate so far, and fascinating to follow from its beginning at 12.31 pm last Wednesday. The fascination has been not so much with the Budget itself, but with the way in which it has been assessed and reported. Every year under this Chancellor, the initial positive coverage has given way to a more considered assessment. This year was no different&#151;only that the Budget unravelled even quicker than usual. We saw the initial cheering on the Labour Benches behind the Chancellor, but by the opening of today&#146;s debate three Labour Back Benchers were present. At one point we were down to two; we went up to a maximum of five; and it looks like we are back down to four at the moment. It seems that the Chancellor gave his incomplete view of the tax changes merely to put the Leader of the Opposition on the wrong foot, and to gain a cheer from his own side. If so, that is an absurd way to run the finances of the world&#146;s fourth largest economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70326-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07032631000169">The Chancellor's speech gave us only half the story, and the whole Budget took me back to my childhood in the 1970s when we had a black and white television of dubious quality with a grossly distorted picture. The distortions on the TV were amazing&#151;people had elongated foreheads, and I remember thinking that the poor bald man who presented the cricket in those days looked like a cucumber. The most tragic thing for me was at 4:45 pm each Saturday, when &#147;Final Score&#148; came on, and the far right-hand side of what should have been on the screen was not visible at all. One could see the home team score and one could cheer if one&#146;s team had scored three goals, but I had to wait until the next day&#146;s newspapers to find out the complete score, and realise that one&#146;s team had lost 3-4.</p>

I shared with Government Members an initial cheer when I heard the 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax, but it turned to dismay when I learned that it was more than made up for by the abolition of the 10p rate and the increase in national insurance contributions. In fact, the cut in the basic rate cost &#163;8 billion, but the other increases will raise about &#163;8.4 billion.</p>

The first is stamp duty, or more precisely, stamp duty land tax. According to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the stamp duty yield from residential property throughout the UK has gone up sevenfold under Labour, from &#163;675 million in 1996-97, to &#163;4.6 billion in the last financial year.

there has been an eightfold increase. Five times as much of that tax is raised from London as from Scotland, and 16 times as much in London as from the whole of the north-east.</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="07032631000172"><a name="70326-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="07032631000381"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 Why is that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o304"><a name="07032631000173"><a name="70326-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032631000382"><b>Mr. Hands:</b>
 I am coming to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07032631000174">The yield from all stamp duties is projected to rise from &#163;10.9 billion last year to &#163;14.3 billion in 2007-08, all because the higher thresholds remain at &#163;250,000 and &#163;500,000, and there is no sign of the Chancellor upgrading them in line with inflation&#151;past, present or future. It is a London stealth tax. Because the average London home price is more than &#163;300,000, and far higher in constituencies such as mine, and because the percentage rate rises from 1 per cent. to 3 per cent. at the &#163;250,000 threshold, the majority of London home buyers need to find at least &#163;7,500 in cash just to buy a property, and that is on top of the deposit, survey fees, legal fees and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07032631000175">The effects of stamp duty banding are serious. Itis a mobility tax and combined with the inflexible policies pursued by many councils, such as preventing otherwise reasonable loft extensions, the huge risesin stamp duty land tax are making previously uneconomic home improvements worth while; for example, light wells and basement conversions, which have sprouted up all over Fulham and south Hammersmith, especially since the punitive stamp duty regimes came in. Light wells tend to flood, and there is a real fear that their increasing prevalence maylead to long-term structural damage to neighbouring properties. Ironically, my constituency is reckoned to be one of the first in Britain that would disappear if some of the more dire predictions of global warming were to come true. The flooding may get much worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07032631000176">The impact of stamp duty on mobility in London is severe and leads to a number of effects that other Members frequently remark on in their constituencies. Before the big increases in stamp duty, families used to move within Hammersmith and Fulham when they wanted more space because of, for example, an expanding family, or even just a better-paid job. Now, the move from a two-bedroom house, perhaps costing &#163;450,000, to a &#163;600,000 three-bedroom house will cost &#163;24,000 in stamp duty alone, plus the extra &#163;150,000 difference between the two sale prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07032631000177">If we compare the &#163;24,000 stamp duty bill with aloft conversion costing on average &#163;35,000, a side conversion costing &#163;45,000 or a light well at around &#163;60,000, we start to see why such home improvements are all the rage. An argument might be made that those buying and selling simultaneously should pay stamp duty on the difference between the prices of the two homes, as long as they are below a certain level and there is a minimum fee. In my view, that idea should be explored. It would be rather like capital gains tax, which is paid only on an increase in asset price. It might be said to discriminate against first-time buyers&#151;I shall come back to them&#151;who, by definition, have no property to sell, but I believe that the proposal would have an impact on the supply of homes to the market, in London in particular, which would have a huge knock-on benefit for first-time buyers. It would also encourage people, mainly retired, who wanted to trade  <br>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making those important points about the impact of stamp duty on mobility in the labour market and housing market, but I urge him to pursue the argument with our Front-Bench colleagues because it is not just in London that it is a major issue. I can tell him from my personal experience that it is a problem around the country with people delaying housing changes that they might have made because they do not want to write out a very large cheque to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

 My hon. Friend is quite right. The problem extends throughout the south-east, parts of the south and probably into Wales, the north of England, and doubtless elsewhere. It is certainly not exclusive to London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07032631000180">Mobility is vital to the housing market, yet the Chancellor has done a great deal to harm it. At the moment, the supply of homes is severely constricted as prices continue their meteoric rise as demand vastly outstrips supply. It has also had an effect on second homes. One hears constantly from Members with rural constituencies&#151;for example, in Cornwall, where I first lived in this country&#151;about the impact of Londoners and others from the south-east buying second homes, and it is important to understand the economics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07032631000181">Ironically, many of the professional people in my constituency are more tempted to buy second homes than they used to be, by the perverse effects of stamp duty land tax. Someone in my London constituency with &#163;100,000 of capital and mortgage financing could spend that sum on two extensions to their home&#151;a loft extension and a side extension to the kitchen&#151;or they could move within Hammersmith and Fulham or within London and trade up to a house with an additional bedroom, but they would have to pay the Exchequer stamp duty of between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 to do so. Increasingly, my residents take a third option: to buy a bolthole in the country for their extra space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07032631000182">I was looking at the prices advertised by an estate agent in Looe, in Cornwall, where I spent a large part of my childhood: a one-bedroom cottage was on sale for &#163;90,000. For many of my constituents, getting their additional space at that price would be extremely attractive, because no stamp duty whatever would have to be paid on that home. Given the punitive taxes on moving, is it any wonder that many of my constituents find their extra space by building extensions of doubtful wisdom or buying second homes in far-away places, adding to all the other effects we dislike about that trend, such as carbon emissions, road and rail congestion and rural depopulation?</p>

how his meddling has undermined health services in my constituency. Since the last Budget, Ravenscourt Park hospital has closed&#151;a remarkable fact; but even more remarkable is the fact that the closure took place only four years after the hospital opened. The chief executive of the hospitals trust announced 150 sackings at the time of the closure, yet when the hospital opened four years ago he said:</p>

Hammersmith and Fulham is a centre for the British film industry and for a large number of other media jobs related to it. The criticism from the sector is not that the Government have neglected it, but that they are constantly chopping and changing their policyon it. A producer who visited my surgery this morning told me:</p>
<a name="70326-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="07032631000289"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It&#146;s as if every producer in this country is trying not to make films here...outside of this country, producers have given up on us altogether.&#148;</p>

It is impossible to secure the long-term funding that is needed to make films, partly due to the fact that some of those changes in policy have taken place with retrospective effect. The attitude from many of the funders is: once bitten, twice shy with the UK film industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07032631000190">For example, almost the entire industry used to use sale and leaseback finance.

Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), I attended the budget meeting of the new council last month. The 3 per cent. council tax cut will ensure that Hammersmith and Fulham residents are set to be the only people in the country to receive a reduction in their council tax bills this year. A further programme of tax cuts was announced for the next two years as well. There were no stealth taxes or tax cons&#151;unlike in the Chancellor&#146;s Budget. It was a pure cut in the basic council tax rate. The new administration ran on a clear policy of a tax cut to bring council tax down to Wandsworth&#146;s levels within two terms, over eight years. What a shame that we do not hear that level of ambition from Members on the Labour Benches.

demonstrating that that is not the case. The 3 per cent. council tax cut has been well documented, but the council is also spending new money on the things that matter to residents. It is investing &#163;1.5 million over the next two years to pay for round-the-clock beat policing in our town centres, as well as spending more on schools and, as was mentioned earlier, providing free personal care at home for our most vulnerable residents. It is one of only two councils in London to do that.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave away some &#163;8 billion by cutting the basic rate of tax from 22 to 20 per cent., but largely offset that by doubling the starting rate of tax from 10 to 20 per cent. This tax measure therefore joins a long list of measures introduced by this Government and then abolished by them a few years later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07032631000203">The measure was probably designed to fool about three audiences, since it could never have been expected to fool serious analysts. The first audience was the Chancellor&#146;s supporters on the Labour Benches, who, astonishingly, cheered a Budget that doubled the rate of income tax for those on the very lowest incomes and raised it for many others earning less than &#163;18,000 a year. The second audience that it was deigned to fool was the right hon.

 Why does the hon. Gentleman think that there is anything dishonest whatsoever about having structural changes that are fiscally neutral?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention. I will come on to whether the changes are fiscally neutral for poor families in a minute&#151;well, in fact, why not straight away? There were many costs to this piece of political theatre. One is going to be paid by the lowest-paid in our society. Labour Members will argue that the cost of doubling the starting rate of income tax will be offset by tax credits. Tax creditsare clearly a favourite of the Chancellor. But the Government&#146;s figures, in the Budget documents, show that only 82 per cent. take up child tax credit at the moment. That means that 18 per cent. do not. Only65 per cent. take up working tax credit, so again a large number of families miss out on a benefit that is designed to offset the rise in income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07032631000207">Many of us are aware from the casework that we get in our surgeries and constituencies that, even among the families that do claim tax credits, the repayments that are an integral part of the system cause particular families huge problems when they are called upon to repay adjustments. It would be far better to do the right thing with the tax system from the start than to do the wrong thing and then introduce a complicated system to try to compensate for it. We need real tax breaks for the lowest-paid, which can be paid for by green taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70326-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07032631000208">The piece of trickery with income tax also has a cost for charities. Income tax is crucial to the earning of gift aid by British charities. The Chancellor has breath-taking cheek, because in his statement, he said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07032631000215">Commercial is one of the dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises that make up 99 per cent. of UK businesses. Given that those enterprises provide59 per cent. of UK jobs and create 51 per cent. of UK turnover, they make up a vital sector. However, they are neglected by many of the Government&#146;s environmental measures. For example, as Commercial has only 130 employees, it is too small to receive an onsite visit from the Carbon Trust to help its programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07032631000216">How is Commercial planning to achieve such a drastic reduction in emissions? It is trialling low-energy light bulbs to replace not only traditional incandescent bulbs, but all its high-intensity halogen bulbs. It is encouraging its employees to walk and cycle to work and providing showers on site for those who do. It is also encouraging its customers to look at competitively priced and high-quality recycled paper instead of more traditional paper stock. I did not notice any measures in the Budget to help Commercial in any of those initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07032631000217">The most important plank of Commercial&#146;s carbon-reduction programme is shifting its van fleet from fossil fuels to biofuels. Its ambition is to achieve not the 5 per cent. target on biofuels by 2011 envisaged under the renewable transport fuels obligations, but a 75 per cent. biofuel-powered fleet in three years. When I showedthe Chancellor&#146;s measures on biofuel to Mr. Simon Graham of Commercial, he was not very impressed. He said:</p>
<a name="70326-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="07032631000294"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Personally, I think the initiatives are piecemeal, driven by promoting technology rather than providing value, difficult to find and apply to, difficult to plan with ... and seem to be directed away from the SME sector. What would be so much better from my point of view would be to have a system based simply on a given environmental benefit (say reduced CO2 or waste going to landfill) by whatever technology&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07032631000218">However, I have to give the Government some credit because some elements of the Budget were designed to support biofuels. The fuel duty differential of 20p a litre will be extended to 2009-10. That is welcome in that does not stop doing something positive. The lightening of the burden of regulation on biofuels is also welcome, although an opportunity was missed to differentiate clearly between environmentally beneficial  <br>

biofuels and harmful biofuels that cost more inenergy than they save and that are grown at the costof biodiversity in the rain forests. Although the Government have said that they are exploring the question of providing certification for the biofuelsthat are most environmentally-friendly, a standard is already on offer&#151;EN14214&#151;although it was not mentioned in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07032631000219">The Government have also produced an incentiveof a 2 per cent. discount on company car tax forthose using bioethanol, but as the spokesman for Commercial said, the measure is a drop in the ocean that is targeted at one specific biofuel. Why not give an incentive that applies to all biofuels that reduce CO2? The Government plan a 100 per cent. first-year capital allowance for biofuel plants and have made an announcement on an international taskforce involving Brazil, South Africa and Mozambique. While both those steps are welcome, will they tackle the major obstacles to the take-up of biofuels faced by companies such as Commercial? Simply put, the answer is no.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07032631000220">A major barrier to the take-up of biofuels that stands in Commercial&#146;s way is manufacturers&#146; warranties. In some countries, certain warranties will protect a vehicle using as much as 100 per cent. biofuel. However, in the UK, manufacturers generally offer a warranty only for cars using as much as 5 per cent. biofuel. What incentives does the Budget give for diesel car manufacturers to get their act together? None, sadly. The Secretary of State said earlier that Professor Julia King has been asked to examine technological developments, but she is being asked to look at developments over the next25 years, which is too long. If the programme is successful, it will come too late for the drastic change that we need to make in the next 10 years.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07032631000222">That statement was made by Rudolf Diesel himself in 1912. The diesel engine was originally designed with peanut oil in mind. Green Fuels, another company in my constituency, assures me that, if the problem with manufacturers&#146; warranties could be tackled, many vehicles on the roads today could happily run on 80 per cent. or even 100 per cent. biofuel. The technical barriers to such a move, which would make an enormous difference to this country&#146;s carbon emissions, would be quite slight.</p>

The &#163;10 million clear skies programme, which started in 2003, had to be boosted by &#163;2.5 million and extended to March 2006, presumably to bridge the gap until its successor, the low carbon buildings programme, was ready. The photovoltaic demonstration scheme, which started in 2002, had to have its budget of &#163;26 million to &#163;28 million boosted by &#163;750,000 so that the scheme would last until March 2006.

&#163;28.5 million because &#163;1.5 million was used for the bridge funds from the old schemes. The programme was supposed to last for three years, but only &#163;6.5 million of the budget over those three years was for households, so there was barely half as much available for households as when the clear skies programme and PV demonstration schemes were running.</p>

The Budget has added an extra&#163;6 million, which is welcome given that the money really is additional, but that measure was immediately undermined when the Department of Trade and Industry suspended the whole programme. And of course, we have had the ludicrous spectacle in the past year of the Energy Saving Trust offering grants on the first day of each month and almost immediately running out of funds.</p>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the Budget debate. I was pleased to hear all the firm environmental commitments that the Chancellor made last week, but I want to focus on the measures to reduce child poverty. I welcome the decisions that will lift 200,000 children out of poverty, and the recommitment to halvingchild poverty by 2010 and to abolishing it by 2020. I found the criticism that people could not understand the redistribution in the Budget rather strange.

the phenomenon of child poverty, which is presumably why they allowed it to treble under the last Tory Government. It has also become clear to us that the right hon. Member for Chingford and WoodfordGreen (Mr. Duncan Smith) has completely misled his colleagues by suggesting that family breakdown is the prime cause of child poverty in this country. In January, there was a lot of talk about the UNICEF comparisons of child well-being among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but I have looked at the more up-to-date comparisons between European countries by Jonathan Bradshaw of York university. They were published in a journal called <i> Social </i><i> Indicators</i><i> Research </i>in January this year, and they show that family breakdown isnot the prime cause of child poverty in any of the European countries. Indeed, if we strip out the experience of the United Kingdom, we see that there is a positive correlation between child well-being and the number of single-parent families, with Finland and Sweden at the top of the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07032631000230">That large, comprehensive study looked at overall child well-being. It referred to all the European countries and included 51 different variables, which covered the material situation of children, their housing, their health, their subjective well-being, what they thought of their situation, their education, their relationships, their civic participation, and the level of risk and safety for children. The key factors influencing child poverty were found to be income inequality, child poverty itself, obviously, gross domestic product per capita&#151;that is, the overall wealth of a country&#151;social spending and spending on children and families. That is why the strategy announced in the Budget for tackling child poverty is the right course of action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07032631000231">The key decisions that have been taken are absolutely what are needed to achieve reductions in child poverty. The increase in the child tax credit by &#163;150 over the level of earnings growth, and the increase in the working tax credit threshold by &#163;1,200, will have a significant impact. In my constituency, nearly 4,000 families and nearly 7,000 children will benefit. Those changes to tax credits are worth &#163;2 billion in total, and that will be far more effective than the increase intax allowances proposed by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). The problem with raising personal tax allowances as a route to addressing child poverty is that raising such allowances benefits the rich far more than the poor.</p>

 I am sorry, but the hon.

At the moment, 82 per cent. of those who are eligible claim tax credits, and 97 per cent. of those on incomes of under &#163;10,000 a year claim tax credits, and that is a far more successful record than that of the Tory Government, who operated something called the family income supplement, for which the take-up was roughly 50 per cent. I welcome the increases in child benefit. It is clear that they will have a stronger impact in addressing child poverty than Opposition Members&#146; rather bizarre suggestion of reintroducing the married couple&#146;s allowance. I simply cannot understand why they want to throw away money that they could use to good purpose, and to reduce child poverty, on people who are happily married, do not need the money, are high up on the income scale and may not even have children.</p>

People whose household incomes are in the bottom 10 per cent. will experience, over that period, a rise in income of 27 per cent., whereas those in the top 10 per cent. will have their incomes fall by 1 per cent. A single-earner couple with mean earnings who have two children will get a rise in their income of &#163;320. A single-earner coupleon median incomes with two children will have arise of &#163;500. Contrary to what has been claimed by Opposition Members, a single-earner couple on half median income with no children will also have an increase in their annual income; they will get a riseof &#163;175.</p>

Last week, the Cabinet Office published an interesting paper on families with multiple disadvantages, which showed that children with four experiences of familyproblems had a 70 per cent. risk of suffering multiple disadvantages by the time they were 30 years old. Interestingly, children from the 5 per cent. most disadvantaged households were more than 50 times as likely to suffer problems when they reached the age of 30 as children not in the top 5 per cent., but in the top 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07032631000241">One of the disadvantages that is being looked at is the disadvantage of being the child of a teenage parent. In October, I undertook an experiment, and tried to live on the income support rate for people under 25. Using the information from York university, I found that that gave me &#163;21 a week for food, taking account of everything else for which one might reasonably expect to have to pay. I wanted to see whether or not  <br>

on that &#163;21 I could have the kind of healthy diet recommended for pregnant women. At the end of the week, I had lost weight. Hon. Members may think that in my case that is not a problem and that there were advantages for me personally, but it is obviously not satisfactory for a pregnant 19-year-old to do so. I was therefore pleased by the improvements to benefits for pregnant young women. First, the Sure Start maternity grant is now &#163;500, and it goes to young mothers on low incomes. Secondly, the payment of child benefit has been extended, and it will begin at week 29, so all mothers will be up to &#163;200 better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07032631000242">That sort of practical measure makes a genuine difference to the people who need it most. The Budget documents include measures to help young people who are not in employment, education or training, but may I point out to my hon. Friends a contradiction that should be addressed? At the moment, teenage mothers, if they are still at school, are expected to return to school 18 weeks after the birth of their baby. This April, we will extend maternity leave to 39 weeks, so I suggest that young mothers need at least as much time to adjust to their new role and bond with their babies as older mothers. We should bring targets for those young teenage mothers into line with maternity provision for the rest of the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032631000243">Frequently, what is said about children and child poverty is a way of thinking about how to construct a new and better society. Looking at things from a child&#146;s point of view offers a vantage point from which to offer critiques of society as a whole. It is the child&#146;s position as a future adult that is of interest to politicians. That has always been true&#151;it was true in ancient Sparta, it was true under the Jesuits and it was true for Bismarck. That is largely because we know, or we think we know, that what happens to us as children is a significant influence on our lives when we become adults. It is extremely tempting to believe that by controlling the condition of childhood we can reach into the future and control the society that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032631000244">I believe, however, that we should be concerned about child poverty for a more important reason. Children are not human becomings&#151;they are human beings. Childhood is part of life. It accounts for about 20 per cent. of life, so it matters in itself, as well as providing a good basis and preparation for adulthood. It needs to be enjoyable and fulfilling. Last year, Shelter and &#147;End Child Poverty&#148; put together a collection of poems written by children living in poverty across the country. If anyone was in any doubt about the importance, urgency and significance of the need to address child poverty, they would not be after reading those poems. I want to end with a poem written for that book by an eight-year-old child in my constituency called Lucas. It is called, &#147;I Can't Live There&#148;:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032631000246">Although today&#146;s debate centres on the environment, I should like to discuss the moral case for ending tax poverty. I believe that the Government&#146;s commitment to alleviating poverty is genuine, but I am concerned that there is a growing industry around poverty, with huge fortunes being spent on entrenching an immobile underclass. I am concerned that in the past 10 years, or perhaps even longer, the state has created an expanded pool of supplicants, with more and more people deriving an increasing share of their income fromthe state. It is wrong that those people should be patronised with benefits and hand-outs, which have a corrosive effect on their self-worth and self-esteem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70326-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07032631000247">There are perversities in the benefit system, which is, in itself, extremely complex. As an MP, I try to helpmy constituents navigate it, but often it is beyond comprehension. There are tens of thousands of pages of legislation, backed up by thousands of forms, classes, groupings and exceptions. In too many cases, benefit recipients simply have their own money laundered back to them, minus the Government&#146;s handling charge.</p>

That is a soul-destroying process, and it is not just or fair. It is wrong, for example, that tax is levied on pay rates once they exceed &#163;2.65 an hour. Why should people earning the minimum wage or a sum just above it be forced to turn to the state to recover their confiscated earnings in the form of tax credits? Who is best served by that process? I do not believe that my constituents should have to go through that process to claim back money that is rightfully theirs. Another problem across our constituencies is the expanding poverty trap. Again, the Government are not deliberately making it bigger, but it is there. Some 2 million low earners still pay marginal rates of tax of between 60 and 90 per cent. Indeed, 200,000 people still pay marginal rates of tax in excess of 90 per cent. We in the House should not allow that to continue.</p>

 We can assist single parents through universal child benefit.

I understand that the Department of Trade and Industry has made available some capital grants to support demonstrations of capture-ready plant and CO2 storage.

 I agree with my hon. Friend that incentivising new environmental technology perhaps represents a better way forward for tackling carbon emissions than reliance on blunt green taxes.

There are many reasons why domestic coal production will continue to decline, but they are quite unrelated to demand. Indeed, during last winter, which saw a significant upswing in demand for coal as gas prices spiked, the additional demand was met entirely by imports rather than any increase in domestic supply. I believe that our coal will come increasingly from Russia, South Africa, Australia and south America. To my mind, that creates the conditions for enhanced energy security rather than a return to reliance on domestic coal production. Hon.

 My belief is that in future decades we are going to need a basket of different energy supplies. I reject the football supporter approach whereby we have to be in favour of nuclear or coal or biofuels when the truth is that the UK is going to need a whole different spread of energy sources in the decades ahead. My belief is that nuclear will still feature in the mix, though it may have less of a share than it does now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07032638000051">Returning to carbon capture and storage, which was referred to in the Chancellor&#146;s Budget statement, it is not clear to me what contribution CCS can maketo cleaning up the UK&#146;s coal-fired power stations.The Science and Technology Committee produced an excellent report on this subject in February last year, in which it noted that there were significant technical difficulties associated with retrofitting capture technology on to Britain&#146;s ageing fleet of coal-fired stations. Even if those difficulties could be overcome, it might not be economically viable to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07032638000052">The value of the CCS demonstration project surely lies in its application overseas, particularly in countries such as India and China, which are adding huge amounts of coal-fired generating capacity each month. At the beginning of February, I was in India and saw a news report in the <i> Hindustan Times</i>, which referred to the previous day&#146;s announcement by the Indian Prime Minister that India will need 56,000 MW of coal-fired generating capacity just for the next five years. Given the lifetime of those coal-fired plants and the associated carbon emissions, it is clear that countries such as Brazil, India and China&#151;without downplaying the moral obligation on this country to do its bit to tackle climate change&#151;are where the serious potential lies for cutting carbon emissions. The focus of the UK&#146;s demonstration project must surely be on showing how it can work across different countries with different electricity-generating systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07032638000053">Like other environmental technologies, carbon capture and storage represents a significant export opportunity for the UK. As I have said, the UK is a world leader in geosciences and the oil and gas sectors, and there is no reason why that expertise cannot be extended to carbon capture and storage so that it becomes an export opportunity. The barrier to that lies less in the technical skills involved in the process than in our abilities as an exporting nation. In the remainder of my contribution, I should like to focus on trade and exports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07032638000054">Exports are an extremely important component of GDP growth. Those of us who have been concerned about the over-reliance in recent years on household consumption as a driver of GDP growth believe that exports have not been sufficiently strong. In comparison with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development competitors, our export performance is simply not good enough. The UK has a smaller share of total world exports than many of its key competitors, with the exception of Italy. In the export of goods alone, the UK lags well behind Italy. In part, that reflects the UK economy&#146;s specialisation in services, which make up a small percentage of total global trade, but we should not hide behind that argument to excuse our poor performance as an exporter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07032638000055">For example, if we read across from the UK figures to the German figures for exports in the past 10 years, we will see immediately that Germany is competing as an export nation in the new globalised world far better than we are. When our exports were flat between 2001 and 2003, Germany posted increases of 7 per cent.,4 per cent. and 3 per cent. While the export growth rates registered by the UK in the past two years have been much more impressive, we now know that soaring  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70326-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07032638000056">In this year&#146;s Budget statement, the Chancellor forecast growth and exports of 5.5 per cent. and 5 per cent. going down to 4.5 per cent. in three years&#146; time. Those figures are hardly stellar or ambitious. In last year&#146;s statement, he had rather more to say about foreign trade. He seemed to be on the verge of announcing a major new Government initiative for boosting our trade with key industrialising nations such as India and China. He said:</p>

 My hon. Friend may ormay not be aware of my long-standing interest in manufacturing, which, in my view, is the only source of long-term, sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. How does he respond to the fact that manufacturing jobs in this country are being lost at a rapid rate? How can we capture opportunities overseas other than in financial services, in which we are highly qualified, if our manufacturing base is shrinking year by year because it is less competitive? The chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company told me that we are one of the least attractive countries in which to invest. Ireland and the Netherlands are far more attractive in that regard.</p>

 My hon. Friend is exactly right. A key component of the great narrative around the 10 years in which the Chancellor has been in place is the consistent erosion of the UK&#146;s competitive position. My hon. Friend talked about the loss of manufacturing jobs. He will be aware that, back home in Wales, the loss of a great many high-quality manufacturing jobs in the past year or two has been hugely sad. Excellent companies, some of which came to Wales in the 1980s because they were attracted by the UK&#146;s competitive position, are now vacating the country.</p>

We feel for the workers who have been made redundant, but if those Labour politicians were serious about protecting those jobs and were genuinely concerned about the future of manufacturing workers in south Wales, they wouldnot be issuing press releases accusing Burberry of corporate greed, but be getting into the Chancellor&#146;s face and talking to him about the erosion of ourskills base and of our competitive position as a manufacturing economy.</p>

 Is not it key that those who seek employment in this country have a good education? One of the tragedies of the Budget is that the growthof spending on education is being slashed in half to2.5 per cent. We have heard much from the Chancellor about how he wants to spur on science and technology, but if he does not invest in education, we will not be able to produce employable people.</p>

 My hon. Friend is exactly right. The key to success in a globalised world is to have innovation, a skills base and investment in an education system that will help the country to stay competitive in the years ahead, especially at a time when countries such as India and China are pouring out tens of thousands of extremely well-motivated, highly educated engineers and scientists.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I am a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology. We have some brilliant scientists in this country, but, unfortunately, the interest of students in our primary and secondary schools in being scientists or going into jobs in which science is applicable is declining. That problem is compounded by the closure of chemistry departments in universities such as Exeter. We should be asking what the Government are doing to stimulate interestin the sciences and to support science in our great universities.</p>

 That is an excellent intervention. In Wales, sadly, the chemistry department of Swansea university has also closed. A big concern of the Royal Society of Chemistry is the number of hours of science teaching in schools that is being done by teachers who have no science degree. As a result, the subjects are not interesting and are not being taught from a well-informed position. That is leading to a lack of interest at A-level and feeding through to the decline in demand at university level, thus making it difficult to maintain and make viable expensive university science departments.</p>

For a long time, Members of Parliament had made the case for a concerted effort on the part of Government to help United Kingdom exporters take advantage of the increasing opportunities in major industrialising markets such as China and India.

That is an insult. What it does&#151;and irony upon ironies, a Labour Government are doing it&#151;is make the poorest in society, who will lose the most from the abolition of the 10 per cent. rate, subsidise tax cuts for people who are better off. That almost amounts to a contradiction in terms. It takes the biscuit that that has been done by this Chancellor of all people. He has said so much, but although he talks the talk he does not walk the walk, except to inflict damage on those people in society who can least afford it. Those people should be getting help, not the more wealthy people at the expense of the poorer members of society.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem that he rightly addresses is compounded by the fact that the tax credit system is not only a shambles but that the people who have to fill in the forms do not understand them, so that up to 40 per cent. of people do not even claim their entitlements?</p>

 My hon. Friend identifies a significant problem. Not only do such people not understand because the system and the forms that they have to fill in are so complicated, but when the Government overpay them they add insult to injury by seeking to claw back all the overpayment and saying that despite the complexities in the system people should have been able to identify at the time that something was wrong with the payments they were receiving. <i> [Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) says, that is shameful. It also imposes a severe burden on people who thought they were getting the right sums in tax credits and who now find that they face significant penalties in respect of the repayments that the Government are hell-bent on taking back from them. That is causing considerable hardship. Those of them who are working and paying the 10 per cent. rate in tax will have the double-whammy of having that withdrawn from them when the 2p tax cut comes into force, so they will face an additional financial hardship that will leave them less well off than they are at present.</p>

It is the elephant in the room. As all Members have problems in their constituencies with the national health service, it is extraordinary that the Chancellor said nothing specifically about it during his Budget speech. The problem is so great&#151;this is interesting in terms of the concept of collective responsibility&#151;that Ministers demonstrate in the streets in their constituencies against measures that have been taken within the health service in their local communities that are a direct result of Government actions.</p>

One would have thought that at the beginning or end of a Cabinet meeting, or even during, she could have passed a note to the Secretary of State for Health to see what could be done, but no. The only redress that that Cabinet Minister has is to demonstrate in the streets against the very policy that her own Governmentare implementing. We have been reduced to an extraordinary system: the only way in which Ministers can try to change Government policy, even when they are in the Department responsible for it, is by demonstrating in the streets.</p>

However, what is causing problems for my constituents and for people who work in the health service is that the money is not reaching front-line services in the expected amounts, as a proportion of the extra money being made available.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman said it. That came in 304,974th, but it was streets ahead of the third work he has authored, this time with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] They are all on Amazon.

 So why on earth does it rank 1,465,145th in Amazon&#146;s bestseller list? The Economic Secretary may feel that he is the Harry Potter of the Treasury, but he is certainly not the J.K. Rowling of economics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07032638000092">I urge Labour Back Benchers, few as they are, not to go out to buy that book because it needs a rewrite. The first rewrite is to make sure that Economic Secretary writes a full defence of the third fiscal rule&#151;the one the Chancellor announced on Wednesday. Having told us for months that he rejected our policy of sharing the proceeds of growth, the Chancellor announced on Wednesday that he would adopt it, so over the next spending review period, Government spending will grow at a slower rate than the economy as a whole&#151;yet another Conservative policy adopted by the Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07032638000093">Typically, the Chancellor has not even told his close colleagues about that change in policy. Even his campaign manager, the Leader of the House and the hot tip to become the Economic Secretary&#146;s new boss, did not know about the third fiscal rule because yesterday he managed to launch an attack on it during his interview with Andrew Marr. No one should be surprised that the Chancellor did not tell anyone about it because, as Andrew Turnbull said:</p>
<a name="70326-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="07032638000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There has been the absolute ruthlessness with which Gordon has played the denial of information as an instrument of power.&#148; </p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07032638000094">That is not the only rewrite required in the book. Let me read out a couple of extracts from the section entitled, &#147;Maximum transparency for credibility&#148;, a title which, after 11 Budgets, catches the hubris of the Chancellor and his sidekicks. On page 39, it states that</p>
<a name="70326-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="07032638000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the suspicion that the government is manipulating information or policy for short term motives is as damaging to credibility and the economy as evidence that it has done so.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07032638000095">As the Budget was analysed, it became apparent that there was both suspicion and evidence that policy was being manipulated for one, single short-term motive: the Chancellor&#146;s coronation as Labour leader.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07032638000096">Let me read out another passage from the same book:</p>
<a name="70326-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="07032638000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Recent history shows that credibility of macroeconomic policy making is a valuable commodity&#151;once promises on tax, borrowing or interest rates are broken it is hard to rebuild credibility in future promises.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07032638000097">How right that is. In each of the last seven Budgets, the Chancellor has had to revise upwards his borrowing forecasts. As for tax, the Chancellor lost his credibility many Budgets ago. There is more where that comes from in the book, so perhaps it is time for the Economic Secretary to rewrite his book and to admit the mistakes of the past 11 Budgets. Perhaps then he will have a bestseller on his hands.</p>

one of them could not stomach to be here at the end and one of them arrived half-way through. On the Opposition Benches there were eight speakers. Let me turn to some of the comments that were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07032638000099">The Chancellor has been likened to Stalin in the last week, but the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) was certainly the voice of old-fashioned socialism. He made the point that politics prevailed over social justice in this debate. He accepted, as I think that most people on both sides of the House accept, that there had been problems with tax credits. He then argued that the inequality of the 1930s and the Edwardian era was returning and that the politics of the Government contributed to that. Given his attack on the Government and their record, it is amazing that he managed to be a Minister in that Government from 1997 to 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07032638000100">The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), who is not in his place, recognised, as we do, that the share of tax from green taxes has fallen since 1997. He also supported the argument that there is popular support for green taxes as replacement taxes, but not, as the Chancellor has used them, as stealth taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07032638000101">The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), who has apologised for not being here for the winding-up speeches, talked about history. She said that, in the past, Departments were dependent upon being in favour with the Prime Minister for their funding, but now their funding clearly depends on whether they are in favour with the Chancellor. We saw what happened to the Home Office budget when the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) was Home Secretary. It was frozen in real terms for the duration of the next comprehensive spending review. As many colleagues on the Opposition Benches have pointed out, there has been barely a mention of the NHS in two Budgets and one pre-Budget report, so clearly the Secretary of State for Health has fallen out of favour with the Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70326-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07032638000102">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), a distinguished Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, explained exactly why the Budget had such a short-lived good press. He said quite clearly that the Chancellor has tried to fool people in this country too often. People expect the damage to be hidden in the small print and have woken up very quickly to the reality of the Budget. He rightly pointed out that in the pre-Budget report, taxes on businesses had gone up by &#163;2.5 billion.</p>

Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)&#151;another Member not in his place&#151;echoed the sentiments of the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton. While the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton came out with a list of spending commitments for the Government he aspires to lead, the hon. Member for Luton, North had a comprehensive list of tax increases that he wanted to levy upon us. He said that he was harking back to a golden age of socialism, when Jim Callaghan was Prime Minister and the highest rate of tax was 98p in the pound. He looked back to those days fondly and wistfully. But, like many hon. Members, particularly on the Opposition Benches&#151;although, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford indicated in his speech, a number of Members of Her Majesty&#146;s  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07032638000104">My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) referred to that theme in his speech. He talked about the tragedy of boom and bust in the NHS. Ravenscourt Park hospital was openedjust four years ago, but was closed this year as a consequence of the taps on spending being turned off. He also eloquently identified the concerns of his constituents who wish to move to a new house, or to buy for the first time, and the barriers to social and labour mobility that stamp duty creates.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) rightly highlighted the fact that people in the NHS in his area were being made redundant. However, the effect on NHS employees of the cuts in NHS trusts throughout the country where redundancies are not being announced, but job cuts are being made, is just as serious for overall morale in the NHS. In my trust, 700-odd jobs have been lost; mercifully, there have been only about 12 compulsory redundancies. However, the net effect of that on the NHS is just as devastating for nurses, doctors, laboratory technicians and the rest, who have fewer job opportunities as a result of the Government&#146;s boom-and-bust policies on the NHS.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is interesting that while the Secretary of State for Health will focus on the number of redundancies that are being made, she will not talk about the number of posts that are being lost as a consequence of the changes in spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07032638000107">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) accepted, as we do, that the Budget was a tax con, not a tax cut. He pointed out some of the weaknesses in the argument that the effects of scrapping the 10p starting rate of tax would be offset by tax credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07032638000108">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), who is in the Chamber, spoke about child poverty. I was brought up in Durham, so I know her constituency, and I understand why she speaks passionately about her concerns. However, she must remember that the proportion of young people who are not in employment, education or training has risen since 1997, so the Government have problems in this area. We need to ensure that we focus on tackling both the causes and the symptoms of child poverty throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07032638000109">My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) made a contribution to the debate about the alleviation of child poverty and talked about the way in which the tax credit system draws people in. He also cited the bureaucracy and problems of the system. I will take his comments about increasing personal allowances as an early submission for our 2009 Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07032638000110">My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) referred to the Chancellor&#146;s failings and his failure to produce a full picture of the Budget.

insulation of their houses. It was timely that he talked about the off-budget accounting of private finance initiative projects on the day when the Financial Reporting Advisory Board suggested a change to accounting policy to bring more of those projects on to the Government&#146;s balance sheet. The challenge for the Government will be whether they apply that policy retrospectively, as well as to future projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07032638000111">My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) launched a debate about the future of coal in a way that he might not have anticipated at the start of his speech. It was important that we had such a debate because it allowed us to hear a range of views about the future role that coal can play. I heard the Economic Secretary say from a sedentary position that the Conservatives had closed the pits, but as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will know from his constituency experience, a Labour Government closed three out of the four pits in South Shields&#151;that fact was pointed out to me when I fought the seat in 1997. As the grandson of a miner and the son of a former colliery electrician, I understand the important role that coal has played in the history of energy generation in this country. I hope that we will find ways to allow it to play a role in the future, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07032638000112">My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford spoke with eloquence and passion about the Budget and the Chancellor&#146;s failure to tackle the situation in the NHS. One of the recurrent themes in today&#146;s debate has been the question of where the money has gone. As the Government have said time and time again, there has been unprecedented investment in our public services. However, people in our constituencies often see a litany of lost post, closed hospitals and school standards that are not rising as quickly as they should do, given the amount that has been spent. That fundamental point weaved through the speeches of many of my hon. Friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07032638000113">The clunking fist has hit hardest people on low incomes and the small businesses that are the backbone of the economy. When I was growing up in the Labour heartland of the north-east, I was always told that the Labour party was the workers&#146; party, and that it stood up for those on low wages. On Wednesday, the clunking fist dealt a blow to that reputation. By doubling the tax paid on low incomes from 10p to 20p, the Chancellor made 3.5 million households worse off. A Labour party that boasts about the minimum wage has doubled the tax paid by the people who earn it. Is that what Labour Back Benchers were cheering last Wednesday&#151;a hammer blow to people on low wages? Where are those Back Benchers now to defend the Budget? One thing is certain: I would not like to be a Labour MP defending the Budget on the doorsteps in the run-up to May&#146;s elections. How would I justify doubling tax for people on low incomes?</p>

She e-mailed me last week, and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury should listen to what she said, because there are many people like Jenny across the country. She said:</p>

Just last week, it was announced that the retail prices index was at its highest level in 15 years. No wonder Mrs. Whiffen struggles to pay for private dental treatment. I bet the Chancellor did not have to think twice about how he would pay for his.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07032638000117">People on low incomes have been hit by the Chancellor&#146;s clunking fist, and so, too, have small businesses. The increase in the corporation tax rate for small companies hit the backbone of the economy. Small businesses are the lifeblood of constituencies such as mine. It is hard to understand the Government&#146;s strategy; they introduced the zero per cent. corporation tax rate to stimulate enterprise as recently as 2002 and then scrapped it just last year. Now they want to increase, in stages, the small companies rate to 22p, costing small businesses&#163;1.2 billion over three years. Surely hard-working small business men and women deserve a break from the Chancellor&#146;s constant tinkering with the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07032638000118">The Treasury says that it will recycle the proceeds of the tax hike through higher capital allowances and research and development tax credits, but that does nothing for the small companies in the service sector that do not need to buy many assets&#151;the caterers, the builders, the hairdressers. Even small manufacturing companies will feel the pinch under the Government&#146;s tax hike. The Chancellor did the right thing for large businesses by cutting the headline corporation tax rate, but he has hit small businesses hard. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that for businesses, last week&#146;s Budget was all about good headlines, not proper, well thought through tax reforms to benefit businesses regardless of size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07032638000119">There is no clear direction in the Budget. It increases corporation tax for small businesses but cuts it forlarge businesses, and cuts capital gains tax for large businesses but increases capital allowances for small businesses. There is simply no logic in the Budget for business. It is no wonder that it has been greeted with scepticism by a number of people from across the business community.

<a name="70326-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="07032638000155"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a piecemeal budget which tinkers with the system rather than starting the comprehensive reform which is so overdue.&#148;</p>

 This has been an interesting debate, characterised by speeches which, particularly in the early stages, were expert and, in the later stages, a little more passionate than expert.

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07032642000011">I shall start with the environment, following the example of the opening Front-Bench speeches. AsSir Nicholas Stern said in his path-breaking report last autumn, unless the world takes urgent action to tackle climate change not only will the environment suffer but the global economy and the planet&#146;s poorest people will face catastrophe too. He is right. The global challenge that we face in dealing with climate change has never been starker; the case for action has never been so overwhelming; and the costs of doing nothing have never been so high. It is right to say that we all have responsibilities. Every section of society&#151;individuals, businesses and Government&#151;has a role to play. However&#151;and this important point was stressed at the outset by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#151;the Budget has no truck with the false choice between action on climate change on the one hand and lower growth and greater unfairness and poverty on the other, whether in Britain or the developing world. The Stern report concludes that</p>
<a name="70326-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="07032642000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the world does not need to choose between averting climate change and promoting growth and development.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70326-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07032642000012">Those who argue that protecting the environment means that economic growth cannot continue or that open trade should be curtailed are seriously misguided. If we put in place the right global incentives to cut carbon and emissions, we can be both pro-growth and pro-green, and meet our international responsibilities to developing countries.</p>

In the Budget, we have set out further actions to advance the environment agenda, including a renewed commitment to the EU emissions trading scheme; a new &#163;800 million international window for the environmental transformation fund; a competition for Britain&#146;s first full-scale carbon capture and storage; the extension of the biofuels incentive; a time-limited stamp duty exemption for zero carbon homes; a fuel duty increase of more than inflation; and a change to vehicle excise duty to sharpen the environmental signals that it sends, alongside a higher landfill tax escalator and an increase in the aggregates levy. The environment package in the Budget demonstrates the Government&#146;s commitment to tackling climate change and other environmental challenges while taking account of wider economic and social objectives.</p>

She made a strong case that this is a progressive Budget which takes 200,000 children out of poverty, in addition to the 700,000 children who have been taken out of poverty since 1997, following the doubling of child poverty that occurred in the preceding 18 years.

There is still one question that neither he nor his Front-Bench Treasury colleagues will answer: will they match our spending plans? The Budget announced that total expenditure, which is &#163;552 billion this year, will rise by &#163;34 billion to&#163;587 billion in 2007. It will then rise by &#163;29 billionin 2008 to &#163;615 billion, by another &#163;29 billion to&#163;644 billion in the next year and then by an additional &#163;29 billion to &#163;674 billion in the following year.

The whole House knows that the Conservative party, for all its rhetoric, stunts and opportunism, has consistently opposed the measures that the Government have taken to address climate change and to protect the environment. It has consistently voted against the climate change levy and opposed planning permission for wind turbines and renewable energy schemes. It also opposes, through its stridently anti-European stance, the efforts that we are making to reach agreement on the next stage of the European emissions trading scheme.

 The Conservative policy is a gesture and a signal, but what signal does it send? Ordinary families will be taxed more for their domestic trips, whereas business travellers will be able to claim back the money and foreign holidays will be exempt.</p>

Over the past year, he has taken many flights both within the UK and abroad. I have no problem with that, but as his Register of Members&#146; Interests makes clear, many of them were private flights on private aircraft or helicopters, and many of his trips were so short that by the time his plane was at cruising height, the flight crew were already prepared for landing. Only yesterday, we learned more about his private jet-setting and helicopter hops, which included a 20-mile trip one month and a 30-mile trip the next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="70326-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07032642000049">What signal does that send?

It means do as I say, not as I do.

One might say that carbon is not the only thing that the he has been offsetting in recent months. He says that he will put stability first, but then backs a &#163;21 billion a year tax cut proposed by the Forsyth commission. He says that he supports the national health service, but offsets that with a proceeds of growth rule that would mean a &#163;20 billion tax cut. He claims concern about child poverty, but offsets that by saying that he would abolish tax credits and the new deal.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a subject that is dear to my heart and to that of many people throughout the United Kingdom&#151;IVF treatment, especially that provided by the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07032642000067">In February 2004, the then Secretary of State for Health announced at the Dispatch Box that he was minded to accept recommendations by the then National Institute for Clinical Excellence to provide at least one cycle of IVF on the NHS for infertile couples throughout the country. I remember the announcement not because I sat here&#151;I had not been elected at the time&#151;but because my wife was pregnant with our twins, who were born through the IVF procedure. I turned to her and said, &#147;This is great news. I&#146;m so delighted by today&#146;s announcement.&#148; The anxiety caused by IVF treatment is roughly split into psychological effects&#151;it is an enormously stressful time for women, and couples in general&#151;and physical effects. It is a punishing schedule, what with all the drugs that have to be taken, the waiting and the invasive procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07032642000068">The other element of IVF treatment is its financial aspect. I was delighted by the then Health Secretary&#146;s announcement simply because others would not have to go through some of the stresses and strains that we had to undergo in funding several IVF cycles. The twins came on our third cycle. We already had an older boy through IVF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07032642000069">I therefore looked forward to couples not having to undergo at least the financial aspects of the stressand trauma. However, I was contacted last year by constituents in Hatfield, Mr. and Mrs. Smalley, who said that they had been trying to obtain IVF through the NHS and could not understand why the primary care trust was turning them down. I did not know the primary care trust&#146;s criteria, so I contacted it and got a copy. There were 12 different points that the Smalleys would need to fulfil to get IVF treatment through the NHS and I sent them to the couple. They came back to me and said that they believed that they qualified on all fronts. They went back to their doctor, were told that they indeed qualified on all fronts and applied again for IVF on the NHS. Again, they were told that there was none available through our PCT, which was the Hertfordshire primary care trust. That did not make sense, so I wrote to the chief executive to try to gain some clarity. He insisted that, as long as my constituents fulfilled the criteria, they could get the treatment. I told them, they returned to their doctor and the whole thing went round in circles again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07032642000070">We are now at the end of March 2007, and Mr. and Mrs. Smalley have yet to receive any IVF treatment through the NHS, despite the fact that they appear to qualify on every count and despite the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement at the Dispatch Box three years ago that infertile couples could get at least one cycle on the NHS, within specific criteria, which Mr. and Mrs. Smalley happened neatly to fulfil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07032642000071">I therefore decided to look further afield and discover whether we were considering an isolated case or whether it was a problem throughout the country. I undertook some research, which ended up in a report that I entitled, &#147;The Messy Business of Conception&#148;. It deals with the picture throughout the country. I have the raw data, which now cover nearly 90 per cent. of PCTs. They have given us their list of criteria, such as the age groups they accept and whether a couple who already have children through their relationship or another can have IVF. The raw data make up the document, which I have subtitled, &#147;How the Postcode Lottery in NHS IVF Treatment is Creating &#145;Baby Boundaries&#146; for Childless Couples&#148;. Sadly, that is exactly what has happened three years after the Secretary of State announced to the House that everybody could have a cycle of IVF on the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07032642000072">Some stark examples illustrate that. A woman who happens to live in Luton and is 35 would probably be told that she is too old to have IVF. However, if the same woman lived in Hampshire, she would be told that she is too young to have the treatment. There are huge disparities between different areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_o392"><a name="07032642000073"><a name="70326-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032642000163"><b>Martin Horwood (Cheltenham) (LD):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important subject, of whichmy constituents are acutely aware because Gloucestershire&#146;s PCT does not fund IVF routinely, as I hope that his survey reveals. How many other PCTs like mine made the decision as a result of short-term financial problems, not policy, despite the fact that, in Cheltenham&#146;s case, the original PCT did not have a deficit?</p>

 I have all the criteria here&#151;whether people are 30 to 39 years old, and so on and so forth. The trust said that it still provides the treatment. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is at the heart of the problem of establishing how many PCTs do, in fact, provide this treatment and how patchy or otherwise IVF provision is across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07032642000077">The report officially names three PCTs that say that they do not provide IVF treatment. Subsequent to the report&#146;s publication, we found a further three that no longer provide it, either on a limited basis until the new Budget arrangements come through or perhaps on a permanent basis&#151;we simply do not know yet. It is the first I have heard of Gloucestershire PCT, so I will check it out and add it to the list.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his campaign and for drawing national attention to the lack of treatmentfor IVF. Does he agree that it is even worse in Northamptonshire because IVF treatment was available last year, but is no longer available because of financial cutbacks? When it is introduced again next year, the age criteria will be tightened. It is in many ways worse when couples who thought they were going to get IVF treatment from the PCT do not get it.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Arbitrary rules and regulations that were originally designed to fit in with expert medical opinion have now been twisted to fit not with medical opinion, but with the financial realities of the PCTs. I suspect that that is exactly what happened in my hon. Friend&#146;s PCT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07032642000080">That brings me to the wider picture of the patchiness of the service across the country. The survey reveals,as other contributions to this evening&#146;s debate have suggested, that rather than IVF moving forward by being more and more available throughout the nation, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction. It is a service very much in retreat, where PCT after PCT is no longer offering the service that constituents legitimately have a right to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07032642000081">In fact, because of the Secretary of State&#146;s statement that IVF was going to be freely available across the country, people rightly expected to be able to visit their GP and receive the service. In reality, it might have been better if the Secretary of State had thought twice before making such a statement. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the point&#151;I say it with some personal experience&#151;that if infertile couples&#146; expectations are raised and they believe that they can go to their doctors for referrals to an IVF specialist, they will expect to receive the treatment. If they are unable to, it will leave them worse off than they would have been if the Secretary of State had not stood at the Dispatch Box and made it sound as if the service was to be universally available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07032642000082">I am afraid that what we are probably talking about is simply the latest priority. Back in February 2002, it happened to be provision of IVF treatment, but it was piled on top of other priorities that changed again later. For example, I was studying the position of audiology treatment the other week and discovered that it took an average of 40 weeks for people to get hearing aids fitted. Then the Government issued their review and decided that there should be an 18-week target&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>If the Minister listens, she will understand my point. What happens is that, week after week, month after month, new priorities are set from the Dispatch Box, but they are willed without the means to make them happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07032642000083">Before anyone suggests it, this is not a matter of my standing here calling for additional resources. What I am saying is that it is wrong falsely to raise the expectations of couples who are often in the desperate situation of wanting to have IVF treatment to help them have children, only to find, when it comes to it, that they are unable to get it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07032642000084">As &#147;The Messy Business of Conception&#148; has revealed, the way in which the process is operating has set up baby boundaries across the country. In some areas, couples can confidently expect to receive IVF assistance, but in others, entirely arbitrarily, they will be unable to get that treatment. It is unfair for those couples to be treated in such way and sets entirelythe wrong expectations. It is incumbent on the Government to do something about that, and I know that they are interested in doing so: the Secretary of State for Health has said that the Government will listen carefully both to my report and representations from Infertility Network UK, which is being funded to do work that I am sure that the Minister will tell us about.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) on securing the debate. The hon. Members for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) have also made significant contributions, and some important points have been raised. I agree that we all wish to see the considerable resources available to the NHS used, in part, to increase the provision of fertility treatment for those who would not otherwise be able to conceive. Certainly, the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) gave the issue considerable attention, even before the survey by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield was published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07032642000087">In a number of areas, people&#146;s expectations of fertility services are not matched by the provision of those services. There is variation from locality to locality. Undoubtedly, local needs and priorities are issues, and it is right that PCTs take them into account when allocating resources. The NICE guideline does not rule out variation in provision and, unlike a NICE technical appraisal, is not mandatory, although we recognise that it is of great significance to those who have fertility problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07032642000088">The profile of fertility services was raised by the publication of the NICE fertility guideline in 2004, commissioned by the Government. No previous Government had taken such action on the matter. Disappointment remains in some areas, however, for some people with fertility problems. As I have said, some of that is due to PCTs considering local needs and priorities and making decisions accordingly. We certainly recognise, however, that there is room for improvement, and that enabling patients&#146; voices to be heard in decisions about priorities is an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07032642000089">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s survey refers to Hampshire as an area where provision is limited to couples in which the woman is in a specific age range. Not long ago, however, Hampshire provided no IVF treatment at all. Most PCTs are now funding a minimum national level of one cycle of IVF, although, as I have said, that is subject to some variation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07032642000092">The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield referred to the NICE guideline and the Infertility Network UK project. When the NICE fertility guideline was published, we advised the NHS that those PCTs that were providing no IVF were to offer a minimum national level of one cycle of IVF, and that all PCTs should progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term. Opposition Members asked whether the NHS was ignoring that advice in some instances. It is true to say that there is room for improvement. One way in which we want to address that is to look at those PCTs that are successful in implementing the guideline and to learn lessons from them.</p>

 I believe that there is a sincere effort to improve the service, and the work that is being sponsored and done by Infertility Network UK is to be welcomed, but does the Minister agree with the findings of the report, and additional findings since, which suggest that the service is retreating? NHS provision of IVF probably got better initially, but it is now getting worse.</p>

<p><a name="st_o402"><a name="07032642000094"><a name="70326-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="07032642000173"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 There is certainly variation. The purpose of the programme that we are trying to carry out is to address where IVF might have been given greater priority but, for one reason or another, problems have occurred, perhaps because of the local decision-making process. As I said, the Minister of State, as Minister with responsibility for public health, recognises that there are lessons to be learned from some PCTs. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, in 2005 she met a leading patient group, Infertility Network UK, and discussed the provision of IVF and what we could do to understand the difficulties in some areas and how we could get greater consistency. That is why she invited Infertility Network UK to work with the Department on a specific project to consider the strong areas of IVF provision and those that are not so strong, first, to identify good practice and, secondly, to share good practice between PCTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para17"><a name="07032642000095">Infertility Network UK is working towards making the expertise developed by some PCT commissioners available to all. It will shortly be working directly with some PCTs to ensure&#151;this is the crucial issue&#151;that the patient&#146;s voice is heard at a local level and to look at best practice on the implementation of the guideline. It is right to say that the starting point for Infertility Network UK is that some PCTs give higher priority to IVF than others. There may be many complex reasons for that. For example, Cheshire and Merseyside PCTs carried out a major consultation exercise in 2005 on access to NHS-funded fertility services across their areas. A number of public meetings took place, and the outcome was the decision to provide two cycles of IVF in appropriate areas. We want to establish whether other PCTs have done the same and concluded after consultation that IVF is not yet a priority in the areas concerned, or whether there has been too little consultation. We are trying to identify the differences in approach, and how they relate to the differences in outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07032642000096">Another aspect of the PCT project is also very important to prevention. I refer to Infertility Network UK, which will ask about PCT plans to implementthe chlamydia screening programme which is being  <br>

introduced throughout all PCTs during the year. Asthe hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield may know, untreated chlamydial infection may have serious long-term consequences, especially for women, in whom it is a well-established cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Tackling the prevalence of chlamydia through the screening programme is one of the key commitments in the &#147;Choosing Health&#148; White Paper, and we are investing an extra &#163;80 million in it. That is a clear signal of the Government&#146;s commitment, and supports our broader strategy to improve sexual health in the population as a whole.</p>

 Will the Minister give way?</p>

 I will, but only once more, because time is running out.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister, who I think was agreeing with me that the IVF service may be somewhat in retreat, although it is trying to remedy its problems. Is she aware that Infertility Network UK itself agrees with my proposition that the service is in retreat?</p>

 Obviously the Infertility Network UK project is reporting back to Ministers, who will examine its findings carefully. That may arise in what I am about to say about how the project will work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para19"><a name="07032642000101">As the first stage of the project, PCTs have been sent a questionnaire by Infertility Network UK to establish their current provision and practices. The figures are being analysed, and my hon. Friend the Minister of State will examine them closely. We will then convey them to the NHS, which will use them as a basis for assessing some of the variations in provision. I am happy to say that Doncaster PCT has responded to the questionnaire. Members may wish to ask their own PCTs whether they have done so as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07032642000102">The next stage of the project will involve direct contact between a member of the Infertility Network UK project team, with a patient and a clinician, and  <br>

the NHS. In some areas that will mean visits to PCTs for more in-depth discussions about the situation and an exchange of information. We will emphasise the importance of patient involvement in the determining of local services, and ensuring a real focus on best practice in the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para21"><a name="07032642000103">The all-party parliamentary group on infertility has done excellent work in raising awareness of fertility issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), who chairs the group, met my hon. Friend the Minister of State recently, along with members of Infertility Network UK, to discuss how the project was going. We are trying to keep the group involved. My hon. Friend the Minister is aware of the differences in provision of IVF services and of issues raised by the hon. Gentleman relating to the application of social access criteria, and also of emerging information on different treatments and their effectiveness in terms of safety, value for money and success. It is important that we take all of those issues into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07032642000104">We are all aware that fertility problems cause great distress that is hard to bear for those affected. It is important that decisions are made at local level so that account is taken of local priorities. It is also important that we all do we can to raise awareness of fertility issues. We must all work towards achieving that, but we should also look into ways in which infertility can be prevented in some cases&#151;not only through chlamydia screening, which I talked about, but also by addressing issues such as smoking, obesity and general sexual health, so that we can be sure that we are taking account of prevention strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70326-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07032642000105">We have had a thoughtful discussion of some of the key issues to do with fertility, and I hope that I have been able to reassure Members that we take this matter seriously, and that we are taking specific action by examining whether, and how, we can eradicate some of the variations that have been mentioned.</p>
