 (Con): If she will make representations to the Olympic committee to introduce full bore target rifle shooting as an Olympic sport. [64570]

 It is obviously the transport, Mr. Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">There are no current plans to make representations to the International Olympic Committee to introduce full bore target rifle shooting as an Olympic sport. Indeed, there would be no immediate opportunity for us to do so. The 2008&nbsp;and 2012&nbsp;Olympic programmes have already been confirmed by the IOC. The 2012&nbsp;programme was decided in Singapore last year, after the IOC announced that the games would take place in London. I understand that the IOC will meet again in three years&#039; time to decide the Olympic programme for 2016.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60424-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister&#039;s response. The Government have imposed restrictions on British sportsmen in certain shooting events. If target rifle shooting had been incorporated in the Olympic games&#151;it is legal to practise the event in this country, we excel at it and we won medals in it at the Commonwealth games&#151;that would, in part, compensate. Will the Minister reconsider and urge the Olympic committee, for whatever Olympics, to include target rifle shooting?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60424-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I do not think that we have put those restrictions on. Three out of the 17&nbsp;shooting disciplines were affected by the ban on firearms. I acknowledge that strong representations on the matter have been made. They have been forwarded to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and are being seriously considered. The hon. Gentleman acknowledges that when we held the&nbsp;successful Commonwealth games in Manchester, we made special arrangements so that all the disciplines 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 342</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>could take place and, indeed, people could practise them. The strong representations that have been made are justified.

<a name="stpa_o1">On a lighter note, I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell), on doing the marathon in four hours and 37&nbsp;minutes yesterday. It was a bit churlish of Black Dog to say that he was likely to pull out, and it would be good if Black Dog mended his ways by making the gesture of doubling my hon. Friend&#039;s sponsorship.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60424-01_spnew2"><b> Derek Wyatt  (Sittingbourne and Sheppey)</b> 
 (Lab): May I ask a small favour of my right hon. Friend? If one looks at all the international, world and Commonwealth games over the past 20&nbsp;years, one sees that shooting has been the most successful discipline&#151;more so than rowing. However, the people who won gold, silver and bronze medals never received a single honour&#151;not an OBE, CBE, or MBE&#151;from not just this Government, but any Government. Can that situation be changed, and will my right hon. Friend reflect on it before the next honours list?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60424-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 May I congratulate our team that was out in Melbourne, because it increased the medal take from five gold, six silver and eight bronze medals in Manchester to six gold, eight silver and five bronze medals? I have no doubt that my hon. Friend will be soliciting a lot of support from throughout the House for making nominations for those who won the medals. As he knows, Back Benchers and others can make such nominations, so I will expect to see some nominations coming in for those people who did extremely well in the Commonwealth games in Melbourne&#151;I am talking about representatives of England, if I may say&#151;and did our country proud.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60424-01_spnew4"><b> Hugh Robertson  (Faversham and Mid-Kent)</b> 
 (Con): But there is an illogicality because if I have read the UK Sport funding submission correctly, it gives shooting &#163;4.8&nbsp;million each year, but the participants are not allowed to train in this country. I am sure that everyone in the House realises the sensitivity of the issue post-Dunblane, but is it not now time, especially in view of London 2012, for the Minister to support us in granting an exemption for target pistol shooters at the Olympic games?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60424-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I have just explained that of the 17&nbsp;disciplines&#151;I think that that will come down to 15&nbsp;disciplines&#151;that were operational, only three were affected by the ban. My officials and I have been in dialogue with the organisations to find out whether we can come to some arrangement. As I said earlier, when the Commonwealth games were held in Manchester, we facilitated the training for all the 17&nbsp;disciplines and the events that took place. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is considering whether we can come to some arrangement to give the three disciplines practice facilities in this country and I will report back when he has made his decision.

<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60424-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Sport  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 Obviously, you are very magnanimous, Mr. Speaker, as we all, particularly those of us on the Front Bench, expect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">I am pleased to report that Sport England has made a significant impact on the development of sport in the south-west. I pay tribute to the south-west sports board, under the leadership of Ged Roddy and Jim Clarke, the chief executive. They have overseen the investment of about &#163;150&nbsp;million into grass-roots and community sport in the south-west since 1997, including &#163;1.3&nbsp;million invested in sport in Plymouth since 2004. In 2005&#150;06&nbsp;that meant that in the south-west 29&nbsp;projects were awarded a total of &#163;3.8&nbsp;million from the community investment fund, which has in turn generated &#163;12.3&nbsp;million of partnership funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">It was the foresight of the south-west sports board and the regional development agency that led to investment in Weymouth of over &#163;4&nbsp;million, which played out very well in our bid for the Olympics, as the sailing centre there is probably now one of the best in the world. Those bodies have been very proactive in this area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60424-01_spnew7"><b> Alison Seabeck: </b> 
 I am very grateful to you, Mr.&nbsp;Speaker. I was not as quick as usual. I would like to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that the injury happened in a sporting circumstance, but unfortunately it was caused by a hoover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">I thank my right hon. Friend for his reply. I accept that Sport England has had some significant successes in sports development in the south-west, but I have concerns about its impact on the development of swimming. The south-west has well below the national average number of swimming pools per person, and as I speak we face the closure of another swimming pool in Plymouth on health and safety and cost grounds. What is the Department doing to assist Sport England in targeting local authorities and aiding them to develop affordable swimming facilities? &quot;Affordable&quot; is the key word because we all understand how expensive swimming pools are, but we also know how vital they are.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60424-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 For the record, since 1995, when sport funding began to come from the lottery, Sport England has invested &#163;43&nbsp;million in the south-west in projects related to swimming and diving. That is out of a total of &#163;181&nbsp;million, so about 23&nbsp;per cent. has been invested in swimming in the south-west. Sport England is in discussions about the development, and indeed the redevelopment, of swimming complexes in Plymouth, including a 50&nbsp;m pool.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o5">My hon. Friend makes a good point about affordability, and we are encouraging local authorities to look at all sports facilities, particularly swimming, to make sure that they are in the right place and of the right standard. We are also asking them to have, where possible, schemes that encourage swimming, which in some areas may well mean subsidising the cost. I know 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 344</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that subsidised schemes in Birmingham and Glasgow have been highly successful in attracting people into swimming.

<p><a name="qn_o2">5. <a name="60424-02_wqn0"><b> Jon Trickett  (Hemsworth)</b> 
 (Lab): What steps she has taken to ensure that lottery funds are directed to areas of social deprivation. [64572]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60424-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 Nearly half the total lottery money has gone to the 100&nbsp;most deprived local authorities. It was this Government who directed lottery distributors to take into account the need to reduce economic and social deprivation in making awards. The largest programme to address deprivation has been the fair share programme operated by the former Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. With a total value of &#163;179&nbsp;million, including a &#163;50&nbsp;million 10-year expendable endowment, many rural areas, former coalfield areas and seaside towns have already benefited, including my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60424-02_spnew0"><b> Jon Trickett: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that response. I commend the work of the ministerial team with the lottery to ensure that money is diverted to areas of social deprivation. Undoubtedly, my constituency, and many other coalfield areas, benefited from the fair share initiative. Does my right hon. Friend agree that deprived areas tend disproportionately to be engaged in putting money into the lottery? Now that the initiative has ended, organisations such as the Hemsworth and South Emswell homestarts group are experiencing difficulty in finding the necessary money. Will my right hon. Friend keep this matter under close scrutiny and, if necessary, ring-fence money, as she did in the fair share initiative, should we find that areas such as mine are beginning to suffer again?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60424-02_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. I can give him the assurance that we shall do just that. If the share of lottery money going to deprived areas shows signs of falling back, we shall take steps to ensure that every part of the country, including the poorest communities, has the benefit of lottery funding. It is worth noting that we started on this course back in 1998&nbsp;and, having established the under-investment by the lottery in the former coalfield areas, the number of awards to the coalfield areas is now five times as much as it was in 1998. We are determined that that important progress for those communities is not lost.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60424-02_spnew2"><b> Paul Holmes  (Chesterfield)</b> 
 (LD): The Department&#039;s stated aim for the lottery is to improve quality of life for all, yet a deprived region such as the east midlands receives only about 37&nbsp;per cent. of lottery money per capita when compared with London. Of the 12&nbsp;regions, the east midlands receives the 10th lowest amount of money from the lottery. What steps can the right hon. Lady take to ensure that this inequality of distribution is rectified? Can she put in a good word for some lottery money via Sport England to help the council in Chesterfield to rebuild the dilapidated leisure centre and swimming pool, the entire cost of which is falling on the council at present?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 345</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60424-02_spnew3"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 On the second point, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would welcome the intervention of Ministers in decisions about specific lottery grants. His first point is about what he believes to be the unfair share that has been awarded to the east midlands, and about that I would say two things. First, every Member of the House is in a position to act as an advocate for their local community; secondly, if the hon. Gentleman would like organisations in the east midlands to meet my officials or officials from the relevant lottery distributors, I will be happy to ensure that that happens.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60424-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  (Nuneaton)</b> 
 (Lab): My constituency has had moneys from the lottery fund. However, it seems to be rather bizarre that a rich football club such as Manchester United has access to lottery funds, which could have been spent in many more deprived areas throughout the country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60424-02_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I am glad that my hon. Friend, who is a great champion for the lottery for his constituency, has raised this point, which has been the subject of some controversy over the weekend. This is not a decision to which Ministers were party. Decisions about lottery spend are taken by the lottery distributors and not by Ministers. The decision was taken by the regional board of Sport England in pursuit of the objective of getting employers to boost the levels of activity and fitness of their employees. The point is that this is a grant&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It involves rich employers and less rich employers. That is absolutely right. There is a challenge to those employers. It involves &#163;30,000&nbsp;over three years, matched by &#163;100,000&nbsp;from the employer. The judgment of the lottery board is that that money is worth risking to get those who work for Manchester United, or any of the other 40&nbsp;companies in the north-west who have been funded by the initiative, to become more active. Sometimes, it is worth looking at the broader context in which those grants are made before leaping to judgment and cheap headlines.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60424-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hugo Swire  (East Devon)</b> 
 (Con): One of the lottery&#039;s aims was to help people in deprived areas by supporting projects and good causes in those areas, but given what the Secretary of State has said, does she not fear that the award of &#163;30,000&nbsp;grants to wealthy football clubs and the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; serve further to undermine the national lottery? Does she not accept that the best way to distance Government from lottery decisions, which is what she is arguing she wishes to do, is to agree with us in the other place this afternoon both to restrict the Government&#039;s prescriptive powers on lottery grants and to define the principle of additionality?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60424-02_spnew7"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 With great respect, the decision was made by the regional sports board of Sport England to fulfil its obligation to increase participation in sport and physical activity, given the inactivity and consequent ill health of many people in the north-west. We will never reach a point where every single lottery grant is greeted with universal enthusiasm and acclaim. I accept&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, it is not a huge embarrassment. It is a small investment that is clearly within the rules. It is a pilot that targets 40&nbsp;businesses in the north-west of England, with the aim of making people in that part of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 346</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the country more active and fitter. Rather than joining the campaign of condemnation the hon. Gentleman should be prepared to suspend judgment until the pilot exercise has worked by producing more physical exercise.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60424-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Swire: </b> 
 We have suspended quite a lot of judgment recently, so perhaps the Secretary of State will indulge me this afternoon. It is not my business to get her out of this particular hole. Because money has not gone to deprived areas&#151;many Labour Back Benchers clearly want it to go to such areas&#151;support for the national lottery has been eroded. Indeed, a new lottery, Monday, has just been created in response to the concerns of 70&nbsp;of Britain&#039;s most respected charities. When will the Secretary of State take on board the argument that the lottery has been consistently undermined, not least by the creation of the Big Lottery Fund? What will she do to stop the haemorrhaging of support for the national lottery, and does she share the concern of bodies that are not involved in Monday that yet again they will be the losers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60424-02_spnew9"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 First, many of the staff who work in the 41&nbsp;organisations funded by Sport England come from precisely those deprived areas in Greater Manchester at which lottery money should be directed. <i>[Interruption.]</i> They may work for Manchester United football club, but they live in some of the deprived areas that should be beneficiaries of lottery money. Secondly, it is nonsense to suggest that support for the lottery is haemorrhaging. Ticket sales have increased, and the lottery is succeeding. The Olympic lottery has already exceeded expectations, and if the hon. Gentleman is as concerned about the future of the lottery as the people of this country he should not talk it down.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60424-02_spnew10"><b> Jonathan Shaw  (Chatham and Aylesford)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is quite right to distance herself from the decision, but assessment is important when we look at the long-term viability of capital projects such as Buckmore park in my constituency. Sport England awarded it a grant, but did not talk to the local authority. When I asked the National Audit Office to investigate, the papers on the decision were missing. Is it not vital that there is a clear assessment of long-term viability so that a project that is welcomed by the community is sustainable?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60424-02_spnew11"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Again, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is worth taking this opportunity to reflect on the fact that, on average, every single parliamentary constituency in England has about 50&nbsp;lottery-funded projects, enriching the lives of those in the local community and bringing important local value. Every single Member of this House has a role as an advocate for the lottery in their local community, as he is.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60424-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b> 
 (LD): While the Secretary of State&#039;s statement today that the Government should not be interfering in lottery distribution is very welcome, it is clearly in marked contrast to her Government&#039;s previous decision to establish the New Opportunities Fund, which was in clear breach of that additionality principle. Does she accept that, within the national lottery, there are clear rules ensuring that areas of social 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 347</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>deprivation benefit from it? Will not that benefit be put in jeopardy by the establishment of the new online Monday national lottery, for which there are no such rules? Was that lottery not established as the result of a loophole in current legislation, and what action does she intend to take about that loophole?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60424-02_spnew13"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 To deal specifically with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, no, we would not accept that the new lottery was funded by a loophole. It was licensed by the Gambling Commission. Secondly, he is right that the national lottery, which I believe will always be the dominant lottery in this country, has now and will continue to have an obligation across all its distributors to give particular attention to the needs of deprived communities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60424-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): If we can get back to these deprived communities, does my right hon. Friend recall that in the coalfield area of Bolsover, we lost our baths because of subsidence, which is part of what happens in mining. We tried to get it back. Sadly, the lottery funds began to decline because some people over there on the Opposition Benches were talking it down. I do not want that to happen again. We want the lottery funds to increase. Why? Because we have got the Bolsover baths idea back on the agenda. I think that she might have a word with somebody&#151;I know that she cannot make the decision&#151;to make sure that we get the baths for this deprived area. It will help in the Olympic games, as we can send all those Bolsover swimmers to win the medals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60424-02_spnew15"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 First, let me say how much it is my hope that my hon. Friend is successful in his long campaign of advocacy for a new swimming pool for Bolsover. He makes a second important point in relation to potential Bolsover champions. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport has also been very keen to pursue the campaign for the new baths in Bolsover, and I want hon. Members from all parts of the House to do everything that they can to ensure that their constituents benefit from all available funds to promote sport and participation, and ensure that every part of the United Kingdom benefits in the multitude of available ways from the fact that London is hosting the Olympic games in 2012.

 I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. A few months back, I was lucky enough to see the RSC&#039;s touring production of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, which was excellent and packed to the doors, but what can he do to ensure that the two theatres take on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more touring commitments than they currently undertake, so that people in constituencies such as mine, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 348</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who pay towards the theatres&#039; subsidies, get the opportunity to see them, and so that they become truly national theatres, not London or Stratford theatres?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="60424-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise that issue, and I know that she also raised it with one of my predecessors, who has gone to another place. The National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company have increased their national touring in the past year&#151;the National Theatre spent 21&nbsp;weeks touring the regions, and the Royal Shakespeare Company has 150&nbsp;touring dates in its calendar. Furthermore, the Royal Shakespeare Company will do more regional touring next year because of the changes at Stratford. I know that both of those companies have performed in my hon. Friend&#039;s area in Chester, Salford, Manchester and Liverpool, but the people of Warrington should be able to experience the best of our national talent, so I am sure that her comments will be made available to the chairman of the Arts Council.

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60424-03_spnew2"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister is right to address the importance of national companies undertaking regional tours, but it is also important to provide regional arts companies&#151;for example, the Lichfield Garrick theatre&#151;with sufficient funds to conduct tours of their own and to operate as production houses as well as receiving houses. What is the Minister&#039;s advice to the chairman of the Arts Council on how to strike that balance?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60424-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My advice, which is directed not to the chairman of the Arts Council but to the people of this country, is to vote Labour, because when people vote Labour they get a 70&nbsp;per cent. increase in Arts Council funding, some of which goes to regional theatres. That is why we have seen an expansion, and that is my advice to his constituents.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="60424-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right.

As the Minister knows, there are already great pressures on his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department&#039;s non-sports budget due to the 2012&nbsp;Olympics and the fact that the running costs of the Arts Council are some &#163;50&nbsp;million a year and rising.

<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="60424-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The money is coming from the reform of the national office, which will allow money to be put precisely into funded organisations so that theatres and musicians receive funds to grow the arts in this country. Labour Members make no apology for increasing Arts Council funding by 70&nbsp;per cent. since we came to power. I remind the hon.

 The Government are committed to increasing the amount of physical education and sport played by all young people. Cricket has an important role to play in that. It is one of the 22&nbsp;key sports within our national school sport strategy and is receiving &#163;1.24&nbsp;million over the four years to 2007. The 2004&#150;05&nbsp;school sport survey found that cricket is the sixth most popular sport, with 85&nbsp;per cent. of schools offering it to their pupils. Interestingly, the survey also found that cricket was the second most popular sport in terms of club links: 46&nbsp;per cent. of our schools have links with a local cricket club. We hope to reinforce that by investing some &#163;8.5 million in cricket through Sport England during 2006&#150;07.

<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="60424-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hepburn: </b> 
 One of the best ways of encouraging cricket, certainly in the north-east, would have been to have an Ashes match at Durham. My right hon. Friend will understand the disappointment of old and young cricket fans in the north-east when the decision was made to play the Ashes match in Cardiff, not Durham. I am led to believe that that decision was made largely through the influence of the Welsh Assembly. What does the Minister&#039;s Department intend to do to ensure that the north-east, or any other area that does not have the cover of a Welsh, Scottish or London Assembly, is not put at a disadvantage in bidding for major sporting events?

<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="60424-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I can obviously understand my hon. Friend&#039;s disappointment. I had the opportunity to visit Durham on a couple of occasions last season; it is a fantastic ground. At the end of the day, however, it is for the England and Wales Cricket Board to make those decisions. I know that it was a pretty tough decision. The ECB had several people going around the grounds to evaluate their potential, and that is the decision that it came to; it was not a Government decision. Nevertheless, I can understand my hon. Friend&#039;s disappointment.

 (Con): Given the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s commitment to promoting the sport, what discussions has he had with formerly or currently successful professional cricketers about the possibility of their devoting just a tiny fraction of their spare time to acting as ambassadors for the sport in schools to encourage its take-up or the continued pursuit and development of interest in it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60424-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 If there is any sport that one can say has modernised and got itself into the 21st century, it is cricket. The delivery of the Ashes last year says much for Lord MacLaurin&#039;s reorganisation of the ECB five or six years ago, including central contracts and 20&#150;20&nbsp;cricket. Its new academy at Loughborough has been very important, including in relation to the women&#039;s team, who also took the Ashes. Every secondary school in the country has appointed a senior person from the ECB, and that is playing a considerable role in enhancing quality. The first grant given by the newly established National Sports Foundation this week goes to cricket. That is a response to the Lords Taverners&#039; initiative whereby it has matched funding of &#163;177,000&nbsp;to buy kit for schools and clubs. That shows how the ECB and other bodies are rolling out a clear policy of grassroots development. I am sure that that will help us to retain the Ashes when we go down to Australia later this year.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60424-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 It would be wrong to run away from the&nbsp;question about broadcasting. Eighty per cent. of the investment that I alluded to came from television. The BBC did not put a bid on the table and some of the bids by other terrestrial channels were well below what had been put on the table by Sky, so the ECB was left with no other option but to accept. Had it not, the central contracts and investment in the grassroots that I mentioned would have been reduced. One cannot have it both ways.

Will he join me in urging the Assembly to ensure that there are plenty of facilities, resources and coaches available so that the young people of Wales learn to play cricket well and that plenty of Welshmen represent England in 2009, thus helping us to retain the Ashes?

<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60424-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b>

 My hon. Friend is right that Ofcom has a duty to ensure plurality of music across the digital stations. He knows that, in the end, the decision is for Ofcom. To be fair to Jazz FM, now Smooth FM, it claims that there is as much jazz on the station as before; it is simply played in the evening rather than the afternoon. I appreciate that my hon.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o80"><a name="60424-05_spmin1"><b>The Second Church Estates Commissioner  (Sir Stuart Bell): </b> 
 In common with most other organisations that provide defined-benefit pension schemes, the Church of England is having to review its pension arrangements as a result of increased costs and new regulatory requirements. The hon. Gentleman asks for a statement. There will be widespread consultation in the Church before any decisions are made, which will include reference to the General Synod.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="60424-05_spnew12"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the concern among people working in the Church about the future of their pensions, and of the concern about whether new people joining the clergy will have final pension schemes. Is he prepared to go as far as the John Lewis Partnership? In that instance, not only is the existing pension scheme secure, but future members of the partnership will have final pension schemes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="60424-05_spnew13"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, under the Pensions Act 2004&nbsp;new regulations were introduced that have altered the way in which pension funds must calculate their liabilities and returns on contributions. The Act requires pension schemes to make prudent assumptions about investment returns, and to make good any deficit more quickly. I referred earlier to widespread consultation in the Church. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s points will be taken into account in that consultation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o83"><a name="60424-05_spnew14"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold)</b> 
 (Con): The hon. Gentleman will know that the subject of pension fund returns to the clergy has been controversial for, I believe, as long as I have been a Member of Parliament. Can he tell us whether the Church of England uses benchmarking for the performance of its pension fund? If so, how does it compare with others?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="60424-05_spnew15"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 In fact, the benchmarking of the pension fund refers to the investments of the Church Commissioners, which are appropriately benchmarked. The hon. Gentleman will see from next week&#039;s annual report that, as I am happy to inform him, our returns will be some &#163;4.7&nbsp;billion, which shows that we are not merely adequately benchmarked but ahead of the field.

 My hon.

It was described by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury as a tour de force&#151;it was written, of course, by the NAO and I take no credit for it&#151;and it looked at how we can reduce waste across government. Whatever may divide this House in policy terms, surely we are united in the view that there is always room for improvement in abolishing waste in government, hence the report.

 I agree; indeed, we have conducted a long-standing campaign to open up the BBC&#039;s accounts and have reached a voluntary arrangement in that regard.

 Order. I am going to reply to a point of order, and then we will have today&#039;s points of order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">On 15&nbsp;February, I undertook to investigate a matter raised with me by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). I know that the House will understand why my response is a little later than I would have wished. On 26&nbsp;January, the hon. Gentleman tabled a priority written question to the Department of Health about a private finance initiative contract at his local hospital. The question was for answer on 31&nbsp;January. On that date, the Department gave a holding reply, but it did not answer the question until a fortnight later, on 14&nbsp;February. The hon. Gentleman also raised with me the fact that the text of that answer had been e-mailed by the Department to a journalist the previous day. The Minister concerned&#151;the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterton)&#151;wrote to me on 15&nbsp;February apologising for the delay. She undertook to redouble efforts to ensure that questions were answered promptly. I am grateful, but the delay in this case was far too long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">On the sending of the e-mail, the Minister said that her Department received many requests for information through parliamentary questions, letters and telephone inquiries, and that she would expect answers to be consistent. This misses the point. Parliamentary questions are not to be regarded as just one sort of request for information. They are a key element in the accountability of Ministers to Parliament, and must be treated as such. In this case, the reply given to the journalist was more than simply consistent with the reply later given to the hon. Member: it was identical. This should not have happened, and I hope that lessons have been learned.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60424-06_spnew10"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Have you been notified of the Health Secretary&#039;s intention to make an urgent statement to the House and answer questions on the crisis in the NHS? Otherwise, we will be in the same position on this matter, with the Health Secretary out and about giving all sorts of information to the media and answering questions from them, but saying nothing in this House on a matter of grave concern to right hon. and hon. Members on both sides.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60424-06_spnew11"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Following the remarks by the Secretary of State for Health, I looked at the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accounts of a hospital in Fullwood in my constituency, and found that it has a deficit of &#163;4&nbsp;million. I will not now have an opportunity to question the Secretary of State on that until after the Whitsun recess. Could she be brought to the House so that MPs have an opportunity to question her on her statement?

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60424-06_spnew13"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. This matter has been raised in the House, and it will be raised again. Therefore, what the Secretary of State has said outside the House has already been brought to the attention of the House. It is my priority that the Secretary of State keep the House informed, and as long as she does so, she conforms to the requirements that I have always stipulated. There are ways of questioning a Minister other than orally; as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evans) knows, questions can be put in written form.
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60424-06_spnew14"><b> Mr. Richard Spring  (West Suffolk) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Following your comments and the points about the Health Secretary, I was a porter at Newmarket hospital on Friday morning, and there has been a collapse in morale in the health service&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> That was because I offered them a visit by the Health Secretary. Given the problems of closure of wards and theatres and the collapse in morale, I hope that the Health Secretary will come to the House as a matter of urgency to explain the rising deficits and all the other problems of the NHS.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. [Hon. Members: &quot;Mr. Speaker!&quot;] I apologise, Mr. Speaker. Following your comments that the House should be fully informed, may I say that 700&nbsp;jobs have been lost at my hospital trust since the Secretary of State came to the House for questions, and that we have a deficit of &#163;30&nbsp;million? Doctors, nurses and porters are being made redundant, and the House has not been informed about that.

<a name="60424-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">In the Chancellor&#039;s 10th Budget, my right hon. Friend set out our position of economic stability and growing economic strength: 54&nbsp;quarters of consecutive growth, inflation at the 2&nbsp;per cent. target, interest rates at sustained lows and growth of 2&nbsp;to 2.5&nbsp;per cent. above France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The Bill will maintain that position and strike the right balance between tax, spending and borrowing. It is part of the mechanism whereby we will deliver on the wider commitment and vision of a productive, enterprising, competitive Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_3">With the pace of world economic change accelerating, the pre-Budget report, the Budget and the Bill combine to strengthen Britain for the global opportunities ahead. Through those measures, we can lead the world in the new industries and technologies that increasingly shape our future, with more highly skilled jobs with higher wages; new choices for parents to balance careers and family life; investment and reform in public services, housing and our infrastructure; building on the climate change levy to meet the energy and environmental challenge; and securing fairness for each child by investing in every child. That is our vision&#151;equipping Britain for the global challenges ahead; it is a vision of a modern Britain that leads in enterprise and prosperity because we lead in opportunity and fairness.

 When I deal with the Bill&#039;s provisions I will come to our expectations in terms of carbon emissions, but I can reassure the right hon.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60424-07_spnew4"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b> 
 I do not know whether my right hon. Friend is familiar with the document &quot;Climate Change: The UK Programme 2006&quot;, published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I am dismayed that less than 10&nbsp;per cent. of the document deals with adaptation to climate change, on which the UK is significantly behind. It is all very well to go on about carbon emissions and so on, which is important, but the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 364</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>UK produces only 2&nbsp;per cent. of greenhouse gases. We need to adapt our country to deal with rising sea levels and the other challenges caused by inevitable climate change.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60424-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for setting the wider context for the debate in relation to climate change, and for indicating something that the House may already know: not only does the Treasury have responsibility, through provisions in the Finance Bill, for part of the programme addressing such issues, but that responsibility is shared across the Government, principally by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and her ministerial colleagues in DEFRA. My hon. Friend is right to point out that only 2&nbsp;per cent. of carbon emissions are produced in the UK. That was a significant part of the reason my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made the speech at the weekend to an international audience, explaining our international responsibilities for dealing with such issues, including protecting our environment from the effects of climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_4">I turn to the details of the Bill, and I will talk first about productivity and competitiveness. To raise our game as a nation we must meet the productivity challenge. The logic is simple. With the right long-term decisions Britain can lead in some of the fastest growing and highest value-added sectors&#151;City and business sectors, education and health, creative and science-based industries. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, those once small sectors now cover a third of our economy and exports, and will soon see a much higher share of jobs and wealth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_5">The House will remember the cycle that ended in 1997, and productivity is estimated to have grown at a rate of 2.59&nbsp;per cent. over the first half of the current economic cycle&#151;higher than the growth of 2.04&nbsp;per cent. over the previous economic cycle. After decades of being behind, Britain has caught up with Germany in productivity, is ahead of Japan and has halved the gap with France. We must not put that opportunity at risk.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60424-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 The Chief Secretary has just explained how well he thinks Britain is doing in terms of growth in the economic cycle, but will he explain why our balance of payments is getting so much worse month by month? What can be done to halt that trend?
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60424-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Of course the hon. Gentleman recognises that we are a trading nation and that our ability to trade will significantly contribute to our future. If he had listened to the last few chapters&#151;or rather, paragraphs&#151;of my contribution, he would know that I have set out clearly which sectors we in government have identified as providing the growth in our trade, and I had not understood that there was any difference across the House on the sectors where growth and improved productivity are possible and ought to be encouraged. Indeed, I have shared television studios with the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer when he has made the very same point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_6">Our duty is to support such growth for years to come, and the Bill delivers on that promise, by targeting support to the cutting-edge sectors of our economy, to

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 365</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the creative industries&#151;to our athletes, indeed&#151;and to business. It is both a flexible and a tailored response. It introduces and builds on generous film tax relief for the production of culturally British films, with an eye on the benefits that those films bring, by replacing the existing relief and providing a new foundation to ensure the proper taxation of film production companies in general.

When the Financial Secretary wrote to me in October last year, he told me that only &#163;290&nbsp;million had been allocated&#151;so what confidence can we have that all the money set aside for the R and D tax credit will in fact go to that cause?

 Of course the hon. Gentleman well knows that the Government make available resources for certain purposes, and that those are drawn down.

 My right hon. Friend referred to the package of measures for the film industry. He will know that it is particularly important for the film industry to know some considerable time in advance what package of measures will be provided for it.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60424-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware, because it has been explained before in the House, that not only have this Government been significantly more generous in supporting local government than his party was at any time when it was in power&#151;indeed, his party cut the support that it gave to local government&#151;but we found additional support across Government for this year and next year, too. I was involved in that. As he will remember, the &#163;200&nbsp;was announced in two stages, in the previous pre-Budget report and the previous Budget. It was made clear that that payment was for 2005.

<a name="60424-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_11">I want to mention not only competitiveness and productivity, but fairness, too. If Britain is to lead in the global economy, we must be not only a prosperous but a just society. That means helping those who can excel and offering a fair chance of a bright future to everyone. The Bill supports our sporting potential, but it also supports our giving potential. We are introducing measures, which are welcomed by charity representatives, to protect the integrity of reliefs for charitable giving and to assist greater collaboration by charities in trading companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_12">This is all about fairness. On that theme, and following the Paymaster General&#039;s statement last July, the Bill also legislates to ensure that compensation payments paid by foreign banks to holocaust victims or their heirs are exempt from tax. Fairness is important in our society, so the Bill also legislates to clamp down further on tax avoidance and tax fraud&#151;two activities that cheat the majority of our people who pay their fair share.

 May I just go back to the issue of the &#163;200? I want to understand why it was necessary to give &#163;200&nbsp;to pensioners before the election but it is not necessary now, when gas prices&#151;energy prices&#151;have increased. If ever pensioners needed support, it is now.
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60424-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman asks me why one should provide support for council tax. If there is to be consistency of argument, it hardly seems logical that support for council tax payers should be a reflection of the pressure of energy prices. The specific answer to his question is that there were a number of years of rises in council tax of about 7&nbsp;per cent., and at the conclusion of that, among other things, the Government offered support to pensioner households. As I have explained already to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright), that support was first announced at &#163;50&nbsp;for households with pensioners in a certain age group, for 2005, and then increased to &#163;200&nbsp;in last year&#039;s Budget, because my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was able to find more resources for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">Like all hon. Members, I have significant sympathy for those on fixed incomes who have to face the pressures that increased energy bills generate. However, it is unlikely that I, as a Minister, or any other Labour Member, will take any lessons from a party with such a record on VAT on energy and a lack of support for the steps that we have taken to help the poor. The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is that year after year while we have been in power, we have supported pensioner households with specific payments to help them with their energy costs. We have given winter fuel allowances to households, and increased and maintained them. We indicated in the Budget that year on year, pensioners can look forward to such support.

He can look forward to the Government&#039;s response to the report being made in the normal manner. He is right to record that by dint of significant engagement with, and additional support to, local government, we have managed recently to sustain increases in council tax that reflect that support and indicate that there is now efficiency that was not there before.

<a name="60424-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_15">I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House agree that we have a duty to act swiftly, yet proportionately, to prevent abuses due to avoidance and fraud. After all, as we all know, such tax avoidance can undermine the funding of public services and is unfair on those who pay their fair share. Minimising its impact on the majority of taxpayers is vital. However, fraud is a complex area and our response to it must be sophisticated. For example, on missing trader fraud, the Bill provides for a change in accounting procedures for certain goods in clause 19. It clarifies the power to inspect goods in clause 20. It will also enable Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs to target businesses&#039; record-keeping requirements to help to identify fraud. On a matter that is more widely reported, clause 2&nbsp;will make it harder for smugglers to source illicit cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_16">The tax system will be significantly simplified for small businesses by replacing the starting and non-corporate distribution rates of corporation tax with a single banding for small companies set at the current small companies rate, which will allow small companies to spend less time dealing with their tax affairs and more time growing their businesses. As the Institute of Directors noted when it welcomed the announcement, that will also increase the fairness of tax treatment between small businesses that operate in different legal forms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_17">Fairness extends to a range of areas. For example, many employees have benefited from the home computer initiative exemption to get a computer in their homes for personal use. The initiative has worked well, but times have changed and are changing rapidly, so the Bill repeals that exemption for a loan of computers to employees for personal use. However, I make it clear that personal computers and mobile phones provided for business use are not affected by the change. If a person already has a PC, the arrangements will not be affected by the change.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_18">We are making the change to reflect the reality on the ground. The cost of computers has fallen dramatically, and for the vast majority of those using the exemption, access to information technology has improved, too. In the interests of fairness, we must now target resources on those who need them most: the poorest groups in society, which cannot always access IT. That is why we are looking to build on the success of our UK Online centres, which now number more than 6,000&nbsp;throughout the country; it is why the Department for Work and Pensions is examining how to improve access to IT for the elderly; and it is why we will continue to consider this area throughout the comprehensive spending review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_19">Fairness is also about giving a fair deal to hard-working families, which is why clause 156&nbsp;raises stamp duty thresholds. That takes some 40,000&nbsp;home buyers out of stamp duty each year and, when added to the doubling of the threshold last year, means that some 400,000&nbsp;home buyers are now out of the stamp duty range.

 I thank the hon. Lady for her question, and take this opportunity to welcome her to her position on the Front Bench. With respect, I think that crude assertions, drawing arbitrary lines in percentages and then making comparisons, does not assist us in deciding what is fair. [Interruption.] The shadow Chancellor says from a sedentary position, &quot;They&#039;re your figures.&quot; It is irrelevant whose figures they are; I am referring to the comparison. It is not a test of fairness to produce two sets of figures and compare them. The operation of the tax system and the various means of support that the Government provide for many hard-working families contribute to the overall fairness of the system.

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_20">Measures in the Bill will also ensure continued fairness, innovation and a level playing field for the alternative finance arrangements used in particular by the Muslim community.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_21">We have also acted to change part of the inheritance tax regime for trusts, specifically bringing accumulation and maintenance trusts and interest in possession trusts into the mainstream rules for other kinds of trusts. The Bill limits the scope for people to use trusts to avoid paying inheritance tax and reduces from 25&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;the age at which children gain access to trust assets. In effect, that continues our work to close loopholes in the inheritance tax and trust regimes and to ensure that people pay their fair share of tax, while protecting vulnerable people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_22">What the Bill does not do, however, is also clear. This measure is not retrospective, and we have provided a two-year transition period to give time to reorder financial affairs if needed. Only trusts with assets above the inheritance tax threshold will have to pay any charge under the revised rules, and no one who wrote a life insurance policy in trust before Budget day will have to pay a new inheritance tax charge as a result of these changes. On the point about reducing the relevant age for those trusts, let me just say this: on reaching their 18th birthday people can vote, fight for their country and even get their child trust fund, but as things stand they may not get their trust assets for another seven years. That is an anomaly, and the Bill fixes it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_23">Fairness is a matter for all parts of our economy and for all industries, so let me turn briefly to oil. Sustained increases in oil prices since spring 2004&nbsp;have led to an upward shift in the medium-term outlook for oil prices. The same is true of a significant unforeseen economic rent from North sea oil and gas production. That is why we are introducing a package of measures to reform the North sea fiscal regime, including an increase in the rate of supplementary charge on profits from exploitation of our oil and gas reserves. That will ensure that the regime continues to strike the right balance between oil producers and consumers. Let me be clear on this: North sea oil is a critical sector for the UK, and it is only right and fair that we should all share in the profits of increased prices&#151;producers and consumers alike.

By 2010, that will amount to some 40&nbsp;per cent. of our total carbon reductions. Given the climate change levy, more than 10,000&nbsp;businesses have signed climate change agreements. Under the carbon trust, some 3,000&nbsp;businesses have reduced their emissions. Enhanced capital allowances have underwritten investment in 13,000&nbsp;energy-saving products.

Gentleman will know, a number of airlines have introduced fuel surcharges. For example, British Airways charges &#163;8&nbsp;for flights in Europe, which is equivalent to a 60&nbsp;per cent. increase in air passenger duty. British Airways charges &#163;35&nbsp;for non-European flights. These charges have not had an appreciable impact on demand.

<a name="stpa_39">That instability is illustrated by a number of the Bill&#039;s more controversial clauses. Let us take clause 61, on the home computing initiative, which was announced with a fanfare in 1999, repackaged in 2004&nbsp;because not enough people were using it and suddenly shut down in 2006&nbsp;because too many people were using it. Many people will lose their jobs as a result of that change.

<a name="stpa_40">It is impossible for businesses to plan sensibly for the long term if their whole business model becomes redundant overnight because the Chancellor suddenly changes his mind on a tax break. Even Government Departments have found it hard to keep up with the Chancellor on this one. Both the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Trade and Industry were in the process of rolling out the scheme for their employees when the axe fell. As recently as January, the Minister for Industry and the Regions said:


</p>
<ul>

If the Government really believe that the scheme is being abused, we are happy to work with them on tightening it to prevent such abuse. We urge the Government not the abolish the HCI scheme.

 I have followed the hon. Lady&#039;s comments on this relatively minor area of taxation with interest. I sat through almost all the first day of the Budget debate, when I cannot recall Conservative Members mentioning the matter, which has suddenly become important to them. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) says from a sedentary position that the matter was not mentioned in the Budget, but it was included in the press release notices, which were available immediately after the Budget and to which Conservative Members referred in the Budget debate. The topic has suddenly become important for Conservative Members.

 I find it staggering that the hon. Gentleman has complained about our not mentioning something in the Budget debate when the Chancellor leaves out crucial aspects of the Budget year after year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_45">The pattern of instability in the Finance Bill recurs with clause 26, which abolishes the 0&nbsp;per cent. rate of corporation tax. That made for a good headline on Budget day 2002, but it was scrapped four years later because people actually used the scheme. The Opposition, including my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), warned at the time that it would encourage people to incorporate who might not otherwise have done so. We introduced suggestions to reduce that problem and achieve a more level playing field for incorporated and unincorporated businesses, but the Government now propose to abolish that scheme because people have done exactly as we predicted. As one commentator put it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Back in 2004, a zero corporation tax band was billed as a heartwarming aid for micro-business. Within months it was transformed in Treasury thinking into an evil tax-loophole that must be slammed shut&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para9">

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_47">Then we come to part 2&nbsp;of schedule 21, which is the biggest U-turn of them all&#151;self-invested personal pensions, or SIPPs. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton was among many who pointed out the anomalies that would result if people could occupy properties purchased by their SIPP. Over-excited estate agents hailed SIPPs as property price Viagra, yet the Chancellor blithely continued on course until he suddenly woke up to the problem last December. In the meantime, thousands of pounds have been wasted in preparing for a tax regime that was suddenly scrapped at the last minute. In schedule 21, we are left with a proposed new structure of positively Byzantine complexity on top of the new framework only just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introduced for A-day. Andy Bell of SIPP provider A J Bell says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Once again, when faced with a simple solution and a complex solution, the government has opted for the latter.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_48">Some of the most controversial proposals in the Bill are those on trusts contained in clause 157&nbsp;and schedule 20. The current rules treat gifts on trust in largely the same way as outright gifts, and tax them accordingly. The Chancellor proposes to place new penal inheritance tax charges of 20&nbsp;per cent. on entry to a trust and 6&nbsp;per cent. of the value of its capital every 10&nbsp;years. Those new taxes will be levied on two types of trust: interest in possession trusts, such as those with a flexible life interest; and accumulation and maintenance trusts, which are generally set up by parents or grandparents for children. We believe that these new charges are unfair and we oppose them: first, because they are retrospective, as they will apply to existing wills and trusts unless their terms are changed before April 2008; and, secondly, because they are a new tax on hard-working, prudent families seeking only to plan responsibly for their future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_49">The Government would have us believe that this change will affect only 23,000&nbsp;of the super-rich who are somehow using trusts as a way of getting out of paying their fair share of tax. The reality is very different. The wide-ranging coalition of experts and professionals who have come together to oppose the changes inform us that they will have an impact on millions of ordinary families. The Opposition are happy to work with the Government on measures to prevent trusts from being used for complex and artificial tax reduction schemes, but only a very small minority of trusts fall into that category, and the measures in the Bill will have little impact on them. As the professional groups point out, the vast majority of trusts that will be caught by schedule 20&nbsp;are set up for reasons that have nothing to do with tax. They are set up for social and family reasons&#151;for very human reasons&#151;to provide responsibly for family members in a considered and flexible way and to help people to tackle some of the many complications of family life in modern Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_50">The proposals threaten to undermine the long-established principle that inheritance tax should not apply to transfers of property between husband and wife. Unless amended, they could give rise to many more instances whereby inheritance tax will apply in such situations. For example, a typical arrangement is for a husband in a second marriage to leave his property on trust to his widow for life, passing to the children of his first marriage on her death. That arrangement has nothing to do with tax, as under normal circumstances 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 377</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the property would be taxed on the second death&#151;that of the widow. It is merely an attempt to divide property fairly and sensibly between family members and to provide for their different and sometimes competing needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_51">Proposed new section 49A of the Inheritance Act 1984, which is set out in schedule 20(5), imposes the new charges on trusts with a life interest, except where a series of six stringent and opaque conditions are met. For most modern life interest trusts, those conditions will not be met, so the new inheritance tax charges would apply in the situation that I outlined. Ironically, many people who have just drawn up a will that they have made following a civil partnership will have to review and rewrite it, because setting up a trust for a surviving partner is an extremely common approach. It seems bizarre that, having only just granted the spousal exemption to civil partners, the Government should seek to undermine it a few months later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para15">
<a name="stpa_52">The House should note that divorce settlements also frequently involve trusts, often set up by court order. Many of those will not meet the six conditions of new section 49A. Consequently, we face the chilling prospect of an inheritance tax bill being added to the many other costs and miseries associated with divorce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para16">
<a name="stpa_53">Moreover, it sits oddly with a Chancellor who once prided himself on his reputation for prudence that he is taking measures that will put pressure on parents to pass significant wealth to teenagers well before they may be old enough to deal responsibly with the consequences of such a gift. Schedule 20(3) imposes the new IHT charges on accumulation and maintenance trusts unless all property in the trust passes outright to the beneficiaries when they are 18.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para17">
<a name="stpa_54">Those sorts of trust were first devised by a Labour Government&#151;by Denis Healey and Joel Barnett in the 1970s. They were introduced not to help the super-rich&#151;I do not think that either of those gentlemen were keen on helping the super-rich&#151;but to allow ordinary families to provide for their children without giving them control over too much money at too early an age. Let us compare two cases that were raised with me. In one, the capital was transferred to a young adult who bought a fast car and crashed it with fatal results. In the other, a young adult became prey to a drug dealer at university, but the terms of a family trust enabled his relatives to prevent him from dissipating the assets that had been passed to him. Common sense is surely with Mr. Healey rather than the current Chancellor. Passing significant wealth to teenagers is not a great idea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para18">
<a name="stpa_55">The third reason that we oppose the changes is because they could require millions of wills to be rewritten. A cautious estimate by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners suggests that 1&nbsp;million wills would have to be reviewed and redrafted. Assuming a modest cost of &#163;250&nbsp;per will, that leaves an unnecessary bill of &#163;250&nbsp;million. The actual total could be considerably greater, with the huge and unnecessary legal bill, not to mention the prohibitively expensive High Court hearings that may be needed to vary thousands of existing trusts and divorce settlements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-10_para19">
<a name="stpa_56">Furthermore, Skandia Life said that 4.5&nbsp;million people will need to review their life assurance policies because they are usually written in trust and could therefore fall foul of the new rules. The Chief Secretary 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>suggested today that that anxiety is unfounded. Of course, I welcome his and the Treasury&#039;s indications that trusts in relation to life assurance, as well as those arising out of intestacy, will not be affected by the new rules. However, even though that last-minute assurance came too late for the paper copy of the explanatory notes, it was rushed into the electronic version. We want the assurances to be placed on the face of the Bill.

<a name="stpa_57">The great legal historian, Frederic Maitland, once described the trust as the

Much of the measure increases complexity and instability in the tax system, discouraging business investment and damaging productivity growth, both of which have slumped under the Chancellor&#039;s stewardship of the economy. Much of it undermines attempts to improve Britain&#039;s IT skills, which are vital in competing for high value jobs with India and China and the world&#039;s emerging economic giants. It leaves Britain with its highest tax burden ever, excluding North sea oil revenues, damages our competitiveness and fails to prepare our country for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century globalised world economy.

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_61">One of the issues that the Committee considered was energy prices. The rise in energy prices appears so far to be having muted second-round effects&#151;in terms of increased demand for wages, for example&#151;but we greatly welcome the Government&#039;s proposals to encourage an independent investigation into European gas markets and into energy markets in general. We would like the Government to provide an update of the outcome given in the 2006&nbsp;pre-Budget report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">In regard to the energy market, we took evidence from the Governor of the Bank of England, which published its inflation report during our hearings. We asked the Governor about the lack of competition in European gas markets, and it is worth quoting his response:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;It is true that there is the inter-connector with Belgium through which it had been hoped that gas would flow into the United Kingdom when prices were higher here than on the Continent, but I am not sure whether it was entirely reasonable to expect that, given that the gas market on the other side of the Channel is not exactly reminiscent of the group of atomistic competitors of textbook theory&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">I endorse that lucid academic comment, and urge the Government to seek the liberalisation of those energy markets, because the present situation is having a detrimental effect on United Kingdom business and UK consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">On consumer spending, the Committee noted:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;While the forecasts of the Budget do not suggest that consumer spending growth will reach the previously high levels seen in the recent past, several outside observers note significant downside risks to these forecasts. We recommend that the Treasury provide all necessary assistance to the Office for National Statistics in its task of understanding and measuring consumer spending, such as on services rather than retail sales, to help improve the quality of consumer spending forecasts.&quot;</p>

<a name="60424-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">There is an abundance of information on our manufacturing industry but very little on the retail and services sectors. Given that those sectors now account for 70&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, it is important that the collection of the relevant figures for those sectors improves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">The Committee also considered the labour market and migration, and noted the Home Secretary&#039;s statement about a points-based immigration system. It is important to underline the fact that this country needs skilled immigration. Among the successes of London that have been noted recently, particularly since the tragic events of 7&nbsp;July last year, are the effect of its cosmopolitan nature and the way in which people come into the city and use it to work in. It is therefore important to consider immigration in that context. Economically, we need immigration. No expert commentator, including the Governor of the Bank of England, would appear before our Committee and say that we did not need immigration. We need appropriate immigration, however, and it is important that the system to be implemented by the Home Secretary should work well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_67">In the Budget the Government have recognised the need to encourage a higher rate of female labour participation. The Women in Work Commission has made more than 40&nbsp;recommendations on this matter, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 380</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and I hope that the Government will take them up. The economies in Europe that are doing well are those with labour market flexibility and a high participation rate of women in labour markets. The female employment rate in this country is nearly 70&nbsp;per cent., but the Women in Work Commission&#039;s report suggests that, by increasing female labour mobility and participation, the economy could benefit by up to &#163;23&nbsp;billion, which is roughly 2&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. Therefore, the provision of more funds to train women who have lower skills to get higher skills is important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_68">We also considered the golden rule, on which my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) intervened. I saw a biased report about that rule in the newspaper this morning. I hope that there has not been a leak from the Committee, but that newspaper report indicates that a vote had been taken about it in Committee. That account is very much to be regretted, because the Treasury Committee, which I have had the privilege to chair in both this and the previous Parliament, has largely produced unanimous reports. We investigate subjects deeply and spend a lot of time debating issues when compiling reports. I do not think that I am speaking out of turn when I say that we spent about three hours debating our Budget 2006&nbsp;report to ensure that all members were as happy with it as they could be. I will bring that issue to the attention of fellow members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_69">The Committee&#039;s report noted the Treasury&#039;s projections showing that the Government are on course to meet the golden rule after the end of this economic cycle. However, we remain concerned that fiscal policy towards the end of a cycle might be constrained unnecessarily by spending levels or data classification from, say, 12&nbsp;years earlier, at the start of a cycle. In particular, revisions to data might be held to require sudden and undesirable changes to tax or spending in the final years of the cycle, for the sole purpose of meeting the mechanical calculation implicit in the golden rule. We have said previously in reports, and will repeat in this one, that we remain of the view that it would be appropriate to review the fiscal rules, so that any improved formulation of the rule could be introduced at the start of the next economic cycle. The Governor of the Bank of England and others have said to us that a forward-looking approach to the golden rule should be adopted, focused solely on the sustainability of public finances. In many ways, that would take away the mechanistic element whereby the golden rule is considered over a fixed economic cycle. I note, however, that the golden rule has worked on that basis to date.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_70">One of our expert witnesses, Robert Chote of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, made a point that is worth repeating. He cautioned:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;The Golden Rule at best was only ever a reasonable rule of thumb .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The idea that over a period of seven or 12&nbsp;years if you beat it by one billion that is terrific and if you miss it by one billion that is a disaster just is not sustainable on any analytical grounds.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_73">Like the Government, the Committee is also focusing on the comprehensive spending review. We welcome specifically the Government&#039;s decision to initiate a national debate as part of that review. It is important, however, that that debate is set in a context that allows an opportunity for full consideration of options and priorities, rather than simply providing an opportunity for Departments to canvass public support for their bids for increased expenditure. It is therefore important that departmental Select Committees of the House of Commons ensure that they are fully engaged with the process. As a first step, the Treasury Committee expects to hold an initial inquiry on the CSR, following the publication of the report, which we expect to be in mid-2006. To assist with the timely parliamentary scrutiny of matters arising from that report, we urge the Government to ensure that that document is published no later than June 2006, so that the Committee can get its teeth into it in July, before the recess. The debate can then continue when Parliament returns in the autumn.

<a name="stpa_74">As the Chief Secretary knows, the Select Committee looked closely at the issue of efficiency savings and the public sector work force, and the Government&#039;s targets in that regard. We welcome the contribution made by the recent National Audit Office study to understanding of the efficiency programme, but we should like future documents to contain further analysis of the programme as a whole, including an indication of the proportions of the overall reported savings that are attributable to central and local government and that are cashable and non-cashable, as well as an analysis of savings in relation to the themes identified in the Gershon review.

Many of us who have been in the House for years became used to being told by pensioners that they were losing 100&nbsp;per cent. as a result of being a few pence over the Government&#039;s limit.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 382</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unconvincing. Why did we say that? Between 2000&nbsp;and 2004, the annual number of chargeable passengers increased by 25&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;per cent. The emission of greenhouse gases has increased by 10&nbsp;per cent., or 0.8&nbsp;tonnes, and tax receipts for air passenger duty have decreased by 8&nbsp;per cent. Theirs is an unconvincing environmental approach to taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para18">
<a name="stpa_78">Last week, Professor David King spoke of a 3&#176;C increase in temperature over 100&nbsp;years, whose effect would be calamitous. He said that 400&nbsp;million more people would face hunger as a result, while 3&nbsp;billion more would risk flooding or no access to adequate water supplies. Cereal crops would be reduced by anything from 20&nbsp;million to 400&nbsp;million tonnes. This is the issue of today, as the Prime Minister said when he was in New Zealand. If I remember the transcript correctly, he said that the situation was worse than the Government expected it to be a year ago. Something must be done, but we should not kid ourselves: it is a hard decision for all politicians and all parties. It does not promote communion between us and our electorate, because people enjoy cheap flights, but we should bear it in mind that aviation is in many ways outwith the present scheme. It does not pay value-added tax or fuel duty, and is exempt from the climate change levy. So the situation has to change and the Government have to get a grip on this issue. The Treasury officials who came before the Committee said that they judge environmental taxes according to behavioural changes, but as we have said, the fact that there are now an extra 25&nbsp;million passengers shows that the behavioural changes are going in the wrong direction. The officials seemed too clever to understand that point, but people realise that, as such changes show, the system is not working as well as it could.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para19">
<a name="stpa_79">The Government tell us that they want aviation emissions to be included in the EU emissions trading scheme. I agree entirely with that idea, but it is only a partial response to the problem. The current scheme applies from 2008&nbsp;to 2012, and I am informed that any changes to it have to be in by 30&nbsp;June and must be internationally agreed. So we are not going to get such agreement, and aviation will not be included from 2008&nbsp;to 2012. I am told that there is a theoretical possibility that aviation could be included from 2010, but again, that is not going to happen; it will be kept out until 2012. The Government say that they are meeting their Kyoto targets, which is true, but Kyoto finishes in 2012&nbsp;and the EU emissions trading scheme must be renegotiated from 2012&nbsp;onward. So we may think that the current situation presents problems, but they will increase enormously from 2012.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-11_para20">
<a name="stpa_80">So, be it at a domestic level&#151;the Government have fallen behind on their domestic carbon dioxide emissions targets&#151;or internationally, the situation regarding climate change is bleak. Whether or not the report&#039;s recommendation that the Government consider increasing air passenger duty is taken seriously, it highlights a problem that we all have to tackle, but which, sadly, we so far have not. We cannot simply continue with our current lifestyle, without making sacrifices to reduce carbon emissions. We have to strike a balance, and I hope that the Committee has helped to focus public debate on this issue.

The CSR is a very important review and my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary confirmed that it is from a zero base. We examined three departmental budgets&#151;International Development, Education and Skills, and Health. The increase for DFID, year on year, is 10.6&nbsp;per cent. The DFES and the Department of Health have been singled out for extra increased expenditure. That means that some other Departments will get as little as 1.7&nbsp;per cent., so it is important that the process is transparent so that parliamentarians may be assured that the Government&#039;s approach is proper and that every Department will get its fair share. In the context of the Budget, the sustainability of public finances is important, and we considered that issue time and again in our report.

 I thank the Chief Secretary for his kind welcome, and congratulate the Chairman of the Treasury Committee on an excellent report and on his quiet, unassuming&#151;but devastating&#151;analysis of the Bill. For me, the Bill&#039;s significance lies mostly in what it omits, not what it includes. There were great opportunities in the Bill, but they have been wasted. Perhaps the Chancellor is becoming a little slapdash in his impatience to move next door in Downing street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_89">It is the Government&#039;s failure to act on the environment that is the biggest opportunity wasted by the Bill&#151;a point already touched on by the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall). Last week, both the Chancellor and the Leader of the official Opposition made speeches about the importance of the environment. The Chancellor spoke of the &quot;moral duty&quot; of the developed world to tackle climate change and the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) spoke of the need to reduce carbon emissions by a third. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chancellor&#039;s Finance Bill contains very few environmental measures and the Conservatives have made no hard and fast commitments to explain how they would achieve such cuts.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60424-12_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 My party has always been clear about the need for fairer, not higher taxation. Under this Government, we have seen a fall in the proportion of the tax take from environmental taxes, and that is not helping the environment.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60424-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Henderson: </b> 
 Following the question put by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), can the hon. Lady tell us whether it would be fairer to increase taxes on gas-guzzling cars by 10&nbsp;per cent.? If air travel cost 5&nbsp;per cent. more due to environmental taxes, would that be fairer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60424-12_spnew4"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 We support aviation fuel duty and those increases would be fair, because the vast majority of gas-guzzling cars are expensive cars such as Ferraris that consume huge amounts of petrol.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they want action. A <i>Guardian</i> poll of 22&nbsp;February found that 63&nbsp;per cent. of respondents approved of green taxes to discourage behaviour that harms the environment. People accept that we will have to change, so why do we delay the inevitable? It seems that the Government have yet to come round to that way of thinking. The fall in green taxes as a percentage of our national tax take should be reversed if we are serious about tackling carbon emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_91">The headline issue in terms of environmental measures in the Bill, which was trumpeted in the Budget, related to changes to vehicle excise duty in clauses 13&nbsp;to 15. However, the environmental impact of those provisions will be laughable. For many gas-guzzling cars, the new higher band will cost less than half a tank of petrol&#151;a rise from &#163;165&nbsp;to &#163;210&nbsp;a year. The Energy Saving Trust calculated that the differential needs to be worth more than &#163;2,000&nbsp;to have an impact on behaviour. The changes proposed in the Bill fall far short of that.

<a name="stpa_92">My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) received a written answer about the impact of the proposals on carbon emissions, which stated that the estimated carbon savings will be 0.06&nbsp;metric tonnes of carbon emitted by 2010,

<a name="stpa_93">Can the Minister tell us on what basis the Treasury judged the proposal a good idea?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_94">Another area where urgent change is needed is air passenger duty, which was highlighted by the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire, yet the Bill proposes no changes in the structure of that duty. It should rise by at least as much as inflation and should be replaced by a charge on aircraft movements, not on passengers. That will encourage more fuel-efficient aircraft and discourage half-empty planes. I urge the Government to accept the recommendation in paragraph 102&nbsp;of the Select Committee report, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We recommend that the Government give urgent consideration to how it can best use the tax system to increase incentives to reduce the harmful environmental effects of aviation.&quot;</p>

Should not the Government have taken that opportunity to look at other options that will have a more direct impact on individuals&#039; behaviour? Should not there have been a move towards road user charging, or at least a more detailed and serious Government investigation of that option?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_97">Similarly, we support the revalorisation of the climate change levy in line with inflation&#151;again because it halts real-terms cuts in the levy&#151;but the Government should

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 386</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have looked at alternatives that might have a greater impact on behaviour and which are less complicated and cumbersome, such as a carbon tax. The introduction of the climate change levy was a welcome move in the right direction, but it is complicated. A carbon tax would be simpler and would reflect the importance of the principle that the polluter pays, but because of that it must be combined with energy efficiency measures and winter fuel payments for the elderly to ensure that vulnerable groups are not hit disproportionately hard. Although the Liberal Democrats are pleased that the Conservatives seem to be coming round to that point of view, I wonder whether they have grasped the fundamental point of the system. The Conservative leader seems to be proposing a carbon tax on general taxation, so there is no link to the polluter paying and I am not sure that he has thought through the consequences of his proposal. So at least the Bill may go some way towards halting the decline in revenues from green taxation as a proportion of the tax take, but it will not increase the tax take.
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60424-12_spnew5"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 The hon. Lady seems to be trying to have it both ways: she wants the proportion of general taxation raised from environmental taxes to rise, but she also wants behaviour to change. Surely, if behaviour changes and, for example, people take fewer flights or drive cars that are more fuel efficient, the proportion of taxation from environmental taxes will fall, and most hon. Members would regard that as positive. She seems to be having it both ways: she wants taxation to change behaviour, but taxation falls because behaviour changes, and she does not like it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60424-12_spnew6"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 But of course we need incentives to change. We are talking not about increasing the overall burden of taxation, but about trying to change behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_98">Moving away from the environment, another key omission is the failure to address the ticking time bomb in our economy that is personal debt. The Chancellor made no mention of it in his Budget statement, nor is there any mention of it in the Bill, yet personal debt now stands at &#163;1.2&nbsp;trillion&#151;roughly equivalent to the UK&#039;s gross domestic product&#151;and the legacy could be a disaster for many families, as one fifth of household income is now used to service debt. That is back at the level it reached when the country crashed under the Tories in the early 1990s. The immediate signs of stress are clear&#151;we are seeing rising bankruptcies and repossessions. What would counteract that is a network of advice centres, financial education in the curriculum, steps to prevent the mis-selling of mortgage payment protection insurance and action on non-income verified mortgages, for example.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_99">More generally, instead of creating a simpler and fairer taxation system, the Bill creates greater complication, confusion and uncertainty for individuals and businesses. That has become the hallmark of the meddling Chancellor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_100">On the measures for businesses, even the changes we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadly welcome bear the Chancellor&#039;s sticky fingerprints. For example, the changes to corporation tax outlined in clauses 24&nbsp;to 26&nbsp;will remove the zero starting rate of corporation tax. We hope that that signals the end of a long and meandering journey that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 387</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Chancellor has taken to end up virtually back where he started. In 1999, he introduced a 10&nbsp;per cent. rate to encourage investment and enterprise. In 2002, he introduced the zero rate to provide further support to new and growing companies. In 2004, the zero starting rate was restricted to profits retained within the company. The 2005&nbsp;pre-Budget report signalled the end of the zero starting rate. So we are back to where we were in 1998. Given that chain of unintended consequences, the Chancellor has effectively been forced to close a loophole that he created. We hope that that will be the end of a long run of uncertainty and complexity, but given the track record, what confidence can businesses have that that will be the case?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_101">For some very small organisations, those changes will, yet again, create more complication. For example, many small clubs and societies that have taxable income from bank and building society interest will have to fill in corporation tax returns once again, even though very small amounts might be involved. That detail needs more discussion in Committee, but it shows how such changes have many unintended consequences and can often set off a chain reaction that prompts the need for further changes, and we end up in a downward spiral.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_102">Of course, those changes to corporation tax will cross cut other changes proposed in the Bill, such as those to first-year capital allowances, thus continuing the pattern of small and short-term change. The key issue is whether the benefits of those changes are offset by the regulatory impact of uncertainty in the tax rates and the need for businesses to keep up with the changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_103">Research from Manchester and Nottingham business schools indicates that, except for the most generous capital allowances, most capital investment tax advantages are investigated only after the decision to invest has already been made. It seems therefore that those short-term changes may not always change business behaviour and, more importantly, undermine confidence in the stability of the taxation system. So the general picture is one of complexity and uncertainty, and another problem is caused by the speed with which the changes are introduced and the fact that they are unexpected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_104">Clause 61, on the home computer initiative scheme, is an example of how proposals can be totally unexpected, by not just businesses but even departments. Research undertaken by the Home Computing Initiatives Alliance shows that more than 500,000&nbsp;employees benefit from the scheme, of which more than 75&nbsp;per cent. are lower paid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_105">Why was the scheme scrapped without any prior consultation or warning? Many businesses have already sunk costs preparing schemes for beyond 6&nbsp;April. That is also true of the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Trade and Industry. In fact, I understand from the HCI Alliance that it went to see the Low Pay Commission and the DTI just a week before to investigate ways to help people on low incomes to access the scheme. From further discussions, it appears that the decision to scrap the scheme was taken only the day before the announcement was made. Will the Minister confirm that and explain the justification behind the decision? Were there any meetings across Departments 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 388</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to consider the implications? What notice was given to other Departments that the changes were about to take place?

That represents levels of inequality that are worse now than at any time under Thatcher or Major. Council tax, the most regressive form of taxation, which is unrelated to the ability to pay, remains.

<a name="stpa_109">I want to turn to trusts and inheritance tax, which are covered by clause 157. Like the home computer initiative, those proposals caught the industry and individuals totally by surprise. At this stage, it is not exactly clear what the proposals are, since there seems to be a lot of debate between professionals and the Treasury about the number of individuals and wills affected and the amount of revenue that will be raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_110">In some respects, the Treasury seems to contradict itself. On the one hand, it says that the changes will affect only a very small number of individuals and will raise a very small amount of revenue, yet, on the other hand, the change could not be put out to consultation prior to being announced, in case it had an impact on the market. How many people will be affected by the changes? How many people will have to go back and change their will or trust arrangements regardless of whether they are currently over the inheritance tax threshold? I urge the Minister to look at paragraphs 109&nbsp;and 110&nbsp;in the Treasury Committee report, which urge the Treasury to consider those issues prior to the Bill going to Committee.

<a name="60424-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_111">The scheme also seems to create anomalies, rather than resolve them, and assumes that trusts are mainly used for tax avoidance. At the moment, the taxation of trusts mirrors the taxation of individuals. Income tax is paid on income from a trust, and people are treated as the owners of the trust asset for inheritance tax purposes. That logical system need not necessarily be changed because discretionary trusts are already subject to a different regime. The anomaly is that those who are richer and have the liquidity to give money before their death will be unaffected because the ruling that allows gifts to be made tax-free still remains, provided that they are given seven years before death. Whatever the actual impact of the measure, it is clear that the changes will not create clarity and simplicity to help the public&#039;s ability to understand their effect on them. Perhaps, as was the case for self-invested personal pensions last year, a lack of planning will result in significant unintentional consequences and might yet force embarrassing compromises from the Government.

Individual learning accounts, self-invested personal pensions and even the changes to corporation tax are classic examples of the Government creating problems for themselves by rushing through changes and not investigating the likely consequences, which have to be addressed after the changes have already been introduced, thus creating a cycle of complication and change.

Globalisation is not a new phenomenon. Anyone who has read about the history of the 19th century will be aware of the challenge faced even then by British manufacturing industry and the excellent way in which the industry met it.

I refer to the downturn in the rest of the European Union market&#151;I use that term as shorthand because it is others as well&#151;which is the biggest area for our exports.

In October 2005&nbsp;the OECD said:

However, I submit that if one takes the package of statistics a clear picture emerges. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said, in 2005&nbsp;growth in the UK was higher than in any other major European country. We have had 54&nbsp;quarters of constant economic growth. As we all know, inflation is the lowest it has been since the 1960s. Consequently, we now have the lowest interest rates for a generation, and they are not only low but stable, which is crucial not only for those who want to invest in our economy but for those who want to purchase houses or to consume.

Unemployment is less than half what it was in 1997. Schemes such as the new deal are making a major contribution in edging into employment people who previously were unable to take advantage even of an economic upturn. Our employment rate is higher than that in the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.

 I have some ideas that I would be happy to discuss. I am not ducking the issue, but research and development assistance is not crucial. The ability to apply the results of research and development is often more important in the very small company sector. Someone who has conducted research and development at a local university may set up a small company with five or 10&nbsp;people to create a product range. It is important that that company can use scientific development to innovate. If that is what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, I agree.

At the Sony Pencoed site, a large factory space is devoted to taking new, innovative products from research and development to the shop floor. That is a good example of the way in which the Government provide funding so that people can develop products from the idea stage and go into production.

 Indeed. We are at the cutting edge internationally in many other engineering processes. It is important that we consolidate and build on those industries. At the heart of my argument&#151;in other circumstances, I would have been prepared to make it more briefly&#151;is the belief that we must exploit new opportunities. Education is a strong export for this country. It is fashionable to say so, but I am not a newcomer to that view, as I have held it for a long time. I have close links with the University of Newcastle, as well as Strathclyde university in Glasgow, and I have discussed the issue with academics and others. Education offers us a major export opportunity. Some people say that we should not engage too much in the international educational market, because foreign students whom we educate will go back home and undercut us when they start in business. I do not believe that that is the case. If we are ahead of the game, that issue does not matter, because other people and their sons and daughters will come here. It is a strength of the British Council that it is more likely that those who have benefited from education and gone out into the bigger world will maintain any educational links they have had. There might be what we could call an international old boys&#039; network. Such links are very important. People like to do business with people in whom they have confidence. If people have been in the same educational institution or nearby institutions, they will be given confidence in each other, even if they did not know each other previously.

If we are to base our future economy on knowledge-based industries, ingenuity of design and so on, we will need the best people to come to us.

<a name="60424-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_129">What has been done to improve the viability of education as an export? The basic argument is the same: investment in primary schools is what matters. In my constituency, we have two new primary schools, one in Westerhope and one in Gosforth. They are excellent examples of the best facilities from which young people can benefit. Investment in secondary schools will also show returns. As it happens, I do not agree with some of the structural arguments that the Government have put forward, but I agree on the emphasis on putting resources into secondary schools. The Chancellor said in his Budget speech that every school in the country should aim to have the same achievements, whether in the public or private sector. That can help to drive a great improvement in our people&#039;s ability to benefit from education throughout the community. Items in the&nbsp;Budget such as waiving further education fees for A-level students up to 25&nbsp;years old are also an important development.

<p>
<a name="60424-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_130">The second area in which there is scope for new opportunity is medical exports. As a nation, we are a world leader in many medical technologies and their application. We should be not only providing more opportunities for people to be treated in Britain, but driving the infrastructure that supports our health service. Biotechnology is a very important science in Newcastle. The University of Newcastle is a world leader in stem cell research&#151;an area in which I believe many future medical advances will be based, dealing with a host of problems. There should be more investment in such research.

I believe that such an industry can provide a lot of employment for areas such as mine in north-east England. It will not provide it for ever, because others in the world will soon be able to do the same thing, but it gives us the lead on which we can base future developments. As I said to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, the Bill, and clause 28&nbsp;in particular, help with many research, development and environmental issues, including in relation to the matters I have just mentioned. Clause 28&nbsp;is a very important clause.

I am a firm believer in a balanced energy policy and do not believe that one should have ideological views about the rights or wrongs of a particular energy source&#151;it is sensible to have practical views about such matters, but it is not sensible to take an ideological view. We must ensure that we have security of supply and sufficient supply, which is the first challenge on energy policy. As other hon. Members have rightly said, the second challenge is controlling emissions. The third challenge concerns export capacity: some might say that we exported coal 150&nbsp;years ago and ask what we can export now, but there

 My hon. Friend knows that the advent of China and India on the world stage means that carbon emissions will increase enormously.

This country has the chance to export clean coal technology to China. If we get our act together, we can help ourselves, China and global emissions.

 In the north-east of England, we used to say that coal was king, but its crown is becoming tarnished. New energy technologies can be king in future, and they can provide the basis for exports. Specifically, there should be investment in geothermal technology, which I will not dwell on because I am sure hon. Members have other things to consider. Geothermal technology can enable huge savings in energy provision both at the micro level, which involves individual factories and even individual houses, and at a macro level, where power stations can be based on geothermal technology. Geothermal technology is not a new technology, but it is a developing technology, and we have got to do more on it.

The regional development agency in the north-east of England is already working on some of those projects, but it needs to be given a little bit more support to enable it to do more. Clause 28&nbsp;could be used to provide such assistance, and &#163;20&nbsp;million for the enterprise capital fund, which addresses environmental issues, is a step, albeit a small step, in the right direction.

No reputable outside commentator or independent analyst believes that that is true. The latest figures show that in the past couple of years productivity performance has slowed down, not risen. Figures also showed&#151;until the Government stopped compiling them&#151;that the main problem with productivity stalling rests in the public sector: the area where the Government have most control and influence, and where they have been most generous.

 There has been some growth in the economy, but I am commenting on productivity decline in the public sector and public services. The manufacturing productivity growth rate has been pretty good. Part of that is due to the enormous influence of the international market, which is competitive and forces companies to compete better. However, I am afraid that part of it is due to a large number of factory closures, of which Peugeot and Rover are some of the most public in recent months, which have closed down the less efficient capacity. The average efficiency of what remains therefore increases.

It should worry the Government that the British economy is not as symmetrical or well balanced as it should be, so we are extremely dependent on imports, not only in manufacturing but in some services and commodities. That places enormous strain on the external trade balance, and on financing it. The Government need to think about that.

Many companies simply do not have the cash to spend on the investment that they would like or that would be welcome, because after the taxman has taken his cut, the second most important claim is the pension fund contribution&#151;and now the pension fund levy contribution, which they have to make under the new laws.

<a name="60424-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">Labour Members who feel that the pensions crisis is simply the result of companies taking pension holidays at the end of the previous century are way off the mark. No fund could stop paying money into its pension pot unless it was fully funded. They stopped paying extra money in when they were fully funded because, under Treasury rules, they had to. The Treasury regulator said that they could not keep putting money into a pension fund to build up a bigger surplus, as that was against the rules of pension funds. That is quite right. The deficits subsequently arose and they are now exaggerated by the long bond rate, the discount rate and the other assumptions made in deficit evaluation, and they are producing unfortunate knock-on effects for business investment throughout the UK productive sector.

Tax rates are being driven down by the competitive process of the world economy, and if we do not match the better rates we will see more investment going abroad and more people closing their factories here and setting them up elsewhere. There is growing evidence that we do not have to be a low-wage society to do well in this world.

I would also urge the Government to treat the productivity problem in the public sector very seriously indeed. It is already causing considerable political anguish in the run-up to the local elections, with the unfortunate stories about the sacking of nurses and doctors.

 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Does he agree, for example, that we could polderise new land in the Wash, and out of the profits from creating extra land, partly for development, build a much better sea defence?

 It is a rare occasion on which I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman, who makes a thoughtful suggestion. I do not want to stray too far from the Budget, Madam Deputy Speaker, but what the Treasury does with regard to green taxes tends to permeate our society and other Departments. The report published last month under the auspices of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, &quot;Climate Change: The UK Programme 2006&quot;, in a summary on page 130&nbsp;says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;The Government will take action to develop a comprehensive and robust approach to adaptation in the UK through the Adaptation Policy Framework; publish revised and expanded climate change scenarios for the UK in 2008; monitor and develop the knowledge on climate change impacts and adaptation through UKCIP.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_165">Publishing estimates and scenarios and developing the knowledge base are laudable, but that is not concrete action. The Budget does not start to address the things that we can do about the impacts, such as polderisation, if that is a word.

<a name="60424-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_166">On page 130, paragraph 7, the report continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;Some of the most widely expected adverse impacts in the UK include: an increased risk of flooding and coastal erosion; increased pressure on drainage systems; possible increased winter storm damage; habitat and species loss; summer water shortages and low stream flows; increased subsidence risk in subsidence-prone areas; increasing thermal discomfort in buildings; and health issues in summer.&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_167">Those examples are vague, but research is laudable. However, we do not even have a grasp on what will happen, in spite of years of knowledge about climate change. I was taught about climate change and greenhouse gases when I went to university in 1973, so it is not new. We still do not know&#151;we are still doing research on it&#151;whether we will get a Newfoundland climate, which is pretty awful, or a Mediterranean climate, which might or might not be pleasant in this country; it will not be pleasant if half the country is flooded.

I am open to correction, but I do not recall another Member making quite a long speech&#151;as I have done for almost 10&nbsp;minutes so far&#151;on what society should do about the effects of climate change. I do not hear that debate going on in our society. I have the honour to represent an urban seat, and I do not hear from rural Members on the subject. I heard a little at DEFRA questions last week about the hosepipe ban in the south-east. I am not a scientist, but I suspect that the hosepipe ban and the worst drought in the south-east in living memory might be connected to climate change. When will society and Government start to talk about what they will do about the effects of climate change? If I am right that the matter is not debated in the House or elsewhere, that is an appalling indictment of all Members on both sides of the House&#151;I can make enemies of everybody, I suppose.

From the little information that I have&#151;I always stand to be corrected, especially on this matter&#151;this society and Government, through our tax regime in the Budget and elsewhere, appear to be doing almost none of that, except for the general research and development tax breaks introduced in recent Budgets, including this one, which I welcome, especially as a west midlands Member, in the hope of a positive effect on manufacturing.

Neither I, as a Wolverhampton Member&#151;nor you, Madam Deputy Speaker, representing a west midlands seat&#151;want Birmingham to become the capital of the United Kingdom because London no longer exists, as it is under water because of climate change. That could happen. As I understand it, the Thames barrier, just a few kilometres down the river from where we are now, is being used more frequently, year on year, than when it was initially built to deal with climate change. I do not know which Government commissioned it, but it was a far-sighted piece of work. We need to do more of that sort of thing and we should change our taxation regime to do it.

Unfortunately, the federal Government bottled it by, for instance, excluding sports utility vehicles and pick-up trucks, which are big sellers in the United States.

<a name="stpa_181">First, the hon. Lady talked about tax complexity, which she linked with instability and unpredictability. If a tax regime is broadly similar and continues, as has been the case with ours, there are people who are paid a great deal to find the loopholes in it. When they have done so, the answer is either to plug the loopholes or to make fundamental changes in the regime. Broadly, the Government have tended to plug the loopholes. We have a broad base of stability and predictability for our tax regime, but when loopholes are plugged the process tends to become lengthy and somewhat complex.

Ireland has benefited greatly from the EU and it has dealt wisely with the structural funds transferred to it, but to describe it as a low-tax economy that is so successful that it now has a higher gross domestic product per capita than the UK is to overlook the factor to which I refer.

Green taxes were 3.6&nbsp;per cent. of GDP in 2000, but that has fallen to 3&nbsp;per cent. The Bill will do nothing to reverse that downward trend, but it is important to do so, because it is essential to have an ongoing tax to encourage an ongoing change in behaviour. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s earlier point about behavioural change.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60424-20_spnew11"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman puts his point more lucidly, perhaps, than the hon. Lady, but it is still a little vague. Perhaps he could give her a copy of his speech, so that she can be clearer next time. The hon. Lady mentioned the law of unintended consequences, and we should indeed beware of it. However, I caution the Liberal Democrats to beware of it when it comes to their intended levy on aircraft movements instead of individual passengers. It is possible that that could lead to jumbo jets flying around with four people on board&#151;

: Has my hon. Friend drawn the same inference as I have on the question of air movement taxes?

 It is not so much a pleasure as a relief to follow the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). The beginning of his speech was very moving, when he spoke about green issues and the environment, and he carried the House with him in his remarks at the inception of his speech. With respect, he began to lose the House, as he plodded through a rather tedious list of regulations, but as he and I are both members of Friends of the Earth, I will spare my criticism of him. I was going to say that, as he exhibited some independence of thought, I wish that he might serve with me on the Standing Committee, but having listened to him speak for an hour, I am not quite so sure that I want to spend the next two months closeted in a Standing Committee with him. My remarks will last a small fraction of the time of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_227">It is some 10&nbsp;years since I last spoke on a Finance Bill. As I was the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the Finance Act 1996&nbsp;has my fingerprints all over it. I think that the Paymaster General served on that Standing Committee. It was the only Finance Bill that I had anything to do with. I was appalled by the complexity and the length of the Bill. For three months, I had a good understanding of what it was all about. That information has now sadly decayed. However, I recall some gentle banter from Labour Members about the size and complexity of the Bill. I revisited it: it had 408&nbsp;pages. In the intervening 10&nbsp;years, matters have deteriorated: the current Bill has 475&nbsp;pages and the language is even less comprehensible than it was 10&nbsp;years ago. I was relieved to find one clause that I could understand without turning to the explanatory notes. It was the last clause&#151;clause 181&#151;which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;This Act may be cited as the Finance Act 2006.&quot;</p>

<a name="60424-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_228">I want to focus my brief remarks on an area of the Bill that no one else&#151;apart from, very briefly, the Chief Secretary&#151;has touched on: clauses 103&nbsp;to 146, which set 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 421</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>up the real estate investment trusts or REITs. I refer to my interest in the register as a director of McCarthy and Stone, which builds retirement flats, which could end up within a REIT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_229">The first question that I want to ask the Government is: why has this modest reform taken so long? When we left office some 10&nbsp;years ago, most of the spadework for REITs had been done. We consulted the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the British Property Federation and the City and the response was positive. There was all-party support for that sensible fiscal reform. There were models for it in other parts of the world. Indeed, this country had pioneered investment trusts and a REIT is, in effect, an investment trust for property. The transplant should have been straightforward and yet it will be nearly 10&nbsp;years&#151;1&nbsp;January 2007&#151;before we get the first REIT. I hope that whichever Minister makes the winding-up speech will have a plausible story to explain to the House why the reform has taken so long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_230">The second issue that I want to raise about REITs is more fundamental. There is a shortage of good housing in this country. Every constituency MP must know that there are people who need decent homes. The original thinking behind REITs was to promote investment in residential property. I remember because I was Housing Minister at the time the debate got under way in the mid-1990s. What we wanted was a vehicle to enable institutions and private investors to invest in property for rent, in the same way as they could invest in shares through an investment trust. At that stage, the vehicle was not called a REIT; it was called a HIT&#151;a housing investment trust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_231">HITs were envisaged as the last stage of a series of reforms to promote the increased supply of good quality rented housing. We introduced assured shortholds to put tenancies on a viable basis. Once we had that underpinning the private rented sector, there was going to be a new fiscal framework to get serious, respectable, long-term institutional funds into property for rent. If quoted companies invested in rented property, that would bring institutional funds into a market that needed&#151;and still needs&#151;more supply, and private investors could buy shares in those companies. Also, institutions that find it difficult to get exposure to residential property in their portfolio would be able to do that through REITs.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_232">The clauses contain the necessary changes to introduce that measure and I welcome that&#151;it avoids double taxation. However, something has happened in the intervening period that I find very worrying. Instead of housing investment trusts, they are now real estate investment trusts. As I will show in a moment, the emphasis is very much on commercial property and the original idea, if not abandoned, is certainly no longer centre stage. There was never an equivalent argument for REITs for commercial property, compared with residential property. If one wants to invest in commercial property, there are listed property companies and one can do that with great ease. There is no shortage of institutional capital to invest in shops and offices, whereas in many parts of the country, as I said, we need more good quality new accommodation for rent.

<a name="60424-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_242">I want to make one final point on REITs. When the concept was originally considered, there was concern that it should not simply be a new vehicle for existing property. Consideration was given to a requirement that, in order to qualify for a REIT, one would have to add to supply. Within the property market, there is a real risk that if one acts solely on the demand side, without doing anything about supply, one just pushes up the prices. The removal of double interest tax relief is a good example. I would be interested to know whether the Government have thought of there being a requirement to act on the supply side, as well as introducing this new vehicle on the demand side.

<a name="stpa_243">I just want to touch briefly on other subjects, including inheritance tax. I suspect that we have all had e-mails from constituents who are concerned at what they have read. <i>The Sunday Times</i> yesterday estimated that families will be forced to spend &#163;340&nbsp;million to rewrite their wills, even though the Government will raise only &#163;15&nbsp;million. I worked out that the Government will get more money from the VAT on the solicitors&#039; fees from the people who have found out that they do not have to change their wills, than the &#163;15&nbsp;million that they will get from those who are caught by the measure.

Gentleman&#039;s own logic, however, if there are job losses in the public sector, that means by definition that the public sector is becoming more productive because there are fewer people working in it. I therefore have no idea what exact point he was making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_260">The right hon. Gentleman accepted that private sector productivity was good&#151;I agree&#151;but then confused his argument by pointing to the very fact that makes public sector productivity more likely than not. It seemed to me that the convoluted and overtly political point that he was making damaged his argument. It was rather cheap, and it is also rather representative of the poor arguments being made by the Opposition. Returning to my original point, is this opposition for opposition&#039;s sake, or are there serious issues to be discussed here?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_261">That may become clearer in Committee, when the Bill will be looked at in detail, clause by clause. On Second Reading we are dealing with the principle. It seems to me that the principle governing this Bill, and many of the Bills that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has brought to the House, is that it reverses the unfortunate, and sometimes tragic, history of the Treasury. I am talking about what is known as the dead hand of the Treasury. Traditionally, the Treasury was the Department that simply said no&#151;&quot;No, no, no.&quot; The Chancellor has made it clear that the Government cannot allow that, and now the Treasury has been part of the engine for reform. I welcome and applaud that, and I think that this Bill is an example of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_262">I shall pick out a few clauses that show how the Treasury has ceased to be a dead hand and become an engine for change. Labour Members would certainly argue that we are in government precisely to be an engine for beneficial change. There are four areas in which the Bill makes such changes. The first three are social measures, deregulation and what I will simply call business-friendly measures, and anti-tax avoidance measures, which in an intervention I called fair taxation. It is only right that those subject to regulation by the Finance Bill should pay as the democratically elected Government say they should, rather than avoiding their

<a name="60424-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_263">Health having been my main policy interest since I entered Parliament in 1997, I think that one of the major clauses is the one dealing with tobacco duty&#151;clause 1. That might seem a routine Budget measure, but if we look at a range of Budgets, we see that it is not. Raising tobacco duty sends out the right message about tobacco consumption, as it is designed to do. It runs in parallel with a Department of Health measure, the White Paper &quot;Smoking Kills&quot;, which sets out the number of avoidable deaths from smoking-related diseases per year. When the White Paper was being drafted, that figure was about 120,000, and I am happy to say that it is beginning to decline. It declines not by accident but through the Government expressing their will and taking a lead, and through the public being willing to follow that lead.

<a name="stpa_266">Clause 2&nbsp;deals with a related but different issue&#151;evasion of the duty on tobacco products. It has two consequences, and perhaps the House agrees with that. It is an anti-avoidance measure. It raises revenue on a product that revenue should be paid on. It also seeks to cut off an area of criminality. According to Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs figures, it is estimated that currently one in six cigarettes and half of all rolled tobacco consumed in this country is illegal. That cannot be right. The practice is dangerous and wrong, and duty should be paid, as it is by law-abiding citizens.

 I offer my humble apologies for not being in the Chamber earlier to listen to a fascinating debate; I was detained elsewhere. I would like to take up the point about unjust enrichment and the tobacco companies making profits, on which no duty is paid. Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation is perverse, in that people become ill through the use of tobacco products and then use the national health service, which illegally imported tobacco deprives of funding?

Such small measures are precisely the sort of provisions set out in what has been criticised as an over-lengthy Bill&#151;but they are measures to which the Chancellor should be directing his attention. I understand that clause 17, in a small way, rests in the category of business-friendly deregulation. It defines the law governing VAT on certain land transactions, making a complex area more business-friendly and more easily understood.

<a name="stpa_273">Clause 28&nbsp;is also a business-friendly tax measure. It is designed to reduce tax on research and development costs.

It is not something that he thought up after the manifesto for the 2005&nbsp;election was written, only to reject it because he thought he had to appeal to a different audience. In contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, he embraced such policies at the beginning of the century by introducing a measure that, year on year, has helped us to meet the Kyoto targets. If the Opposition abolished the climate change levy I do not know how they would make good the deficiency. They criticise us for not making progress on climate change, but I have yet to hear how they would do so. The levy is an extremely effective measure that is responsible for removing 28&nbsp;tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions a year, so I am delighted that it is uprated in the Bill.

Globalisation is of massive benefit worldwide, and allows low-wage economies to manufacture, produce and distribute goods cheaply, so that they and their markets benefit. Transport improvements and low agricultural costs provide worldwide easy access to food markets, so that good, cheap food can be readily distributed. The availability of tourism leads to the sharing of benefits and access to capital markets means that London has benefited enormously as the leading market in many financial operations, including foreign exchange. It is therefore not surprising that the International Monetary Fund global growth forecast has just been upgraded from 4.3&nbsp;per cent to 4.9&nbsp;per cent. next year. This year, growth is 4.8&nbsp;per cent., and last year it was 5.3&nbsp;per cent. Internationally, the signs are extremely good.

I believe in fair trade and the growth of trade, and I urge that more effort be devoted to ensuring that the benefits are shared well among the populations in less-developed countries.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_286">Has the Chancellor done everything wrong? Of course not. He has done four things right. First, he set up the Monetary Policy Committee to set interest rates, and it has been very successful in holding down interest rates in this country. Secondly, he has not joined the euro. Increasingly, the inflexibility of the euro has been unhelpful to its members. For example, Italy&#039;s unit labour costs have risen by 20&nbsp;per cent. relative to those of Germany, while its exporters are more vulnerable to low-cost producers. Last week, the Lex column of the <i>Financial Times</i> said:

<a name="stpa_288">The third thing that the Chancellor has got right is following for his first few years the public spending plans of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Fourthly, the Chancellor promised independence for the Office for National Statistics, which I think would be very beneficial. I have myself seen from within the Treasury the way in which statistics can be used selectively by many people, including the Treasury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_289">What has the Chancellor got wrong? Here, there is a much longer list. The first thing that he has got seriously wrong is a high level of taxation. If we look at the European model of taxation and its lack of growth, and at the social costs of employment in much of Europe, we can see that that economy has failed to grow because it has not had the flexibility and freedom of much of the rest of the world. Taxes and red tape are the things for which this Chancellor of the Exchequer will be remembered. The tax to GDP ratio is forecast to stabilise at about 38.7&nbsp;per cent. from 2007&nbsp;onwards. That is quite high. The Treasury Committee was told in evidence that in 1997 the UK would have been about

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_291">That is unhelpful, but perhaps even more damaging than over-taxation is insidious Government intrusion through micro-management and means-testing. A very great deal of the Bill is micro-management and the piling of detail upon detail. No wonder there is incompetence in the national health service, for example, when 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 433</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reorganisation follows reorganisation. Scarcely is one structure in place before it is reorganised again. I maintain that Government intrusion is, if anything, even more damaging than high levels of taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_292">That follows when a Government have very little&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience or understanding of business or management. I drove the Financial Secretary to distraction during the Budget debate, when he screamed at me that I was criticising charity workers. I am not criticising any part of our community&#151;teachers, charity workers, people who care for the elderly, Members of Parliament or members of the armed forces&#151;when I say that the fact is that they do not add to national growth. What the Government should do, but do not do, is recognise the unique contribution made by those who contribute to national growth.

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_293">The third major blunder made by the Chancellor&#151;he was told at the time, but ignored it and carried on&#151;was to sell gold. He sold 395&nbsp;metric tonnes to raise $3.5&nbsp;billion, and the current value of the gold that was sold is $7.9&nbsp;billion&#151;a loss of $4.4&nbsp;billion. He was told at the time that it was a bad mistake by many people, including me, but he did it anyway.

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_294">The fourth blunder is in pensions. Some people lay all the responsibility with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I do not think that that is fair. The main fault in pensions is longevity, on which the actuarial profession was asleep on watch and failed to realise that it was using outdated models and that pension funds would not match their requirements. The second reason for failure in pensions is stock exchange weakness. Thirdly, there were changes in pension funding and accountancy requirements, and in long-term bond interest rates. Fourthly, it was of course the Chancellor of the Exchequer who, instead of seeing that the pensions industry was facing a major problem, came blundering in with the &#163;3&nbsp;billion a year net impost on pension funds from 1997&nbsp;onwards. He has caused what must be described as a pension crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_295">The fifth area in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has got it wrong and there is a mistake in the Bill is environmental taxes, which have fallen as a proportion of overall tax in every year since 1999&nbsp;except 2002. In 1999, environmental taxes amounted to 9.8&nbsp;per cent., while in 2004&nbsp;they amounted to 8.3&nbsp;per cent. Tax receipts from air passenger duty have fallen from &#163;931&nbsp;million to &#163;856&nbsp;million, while chargeable passenger miles have increased by 35&nbsp;per cent., at a time when greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 10&nbsp;per cent. That is another mistake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_296">My final point is about trusts. What on earth has the Chancellor been playing at? There was a brief reference in the Budget, but when we get to the Finance Bill, we see clause 157, as implemented by schedule 20, which is 18&nbsp;pages long. The Chancellor says that he is seeking to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent tax avoidance in accumulation and maintenance trusts, and in interest in possession trusts. He said that that is a tiny proportion of the top 1&nbsp;per cent. and that it is expected to raise &#163;15&nbsp;million a year. In trying to reassure people on that point, a Treasury official stated:

<a name="stpa_298">Many years ago, I was a solicitor. I am still a solicitor by qualification and still on the solicitors&#039; roll, although I would not dare to conduct a legal action because I am rusty. When I wrote wills, with the exception of the occasional kindly, elderly person who wanted to make a special gift to a home of some kind, every single one included a trust. The standard procedure is that one leaves one&#039;s money to one&#039;s wife, husband or partner, or, failing that, to one&#039;s children. If one is predeceased by one&#039;s children, then the money is distributed per stirpes, and the child who has been left an orphan shares a proportion of the benefit of the money left, which means that a trust is invented. In almost every case, the testator, on advice, wants to leave the money to the young person so that it is inherited at 25, not 18.

<a name="60424-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_299">When the Chief Secretary discussed his vision of when adulthood starts, he pointed out that people can serve their Queen when they are 18. I know, because I have been there and done that, but the fact is that there is a big difference between succeeding to funds at 18&nbsp;and succeeding to funds at 25. For instance, if one examines insurance rates for motor vehicles, the insurance rate for under-25s is much higher than other rates, because insurance companies know that younger people live a different kind of lifestyle and that, when they reach the age of 25, they tend to mature and adopt a rather more mature lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_300">The Government are wrong to say that inheritance must take place at 18, because the law will mean that the only way in which to avoid taxation is to allow beneficiaries to take control at the age of 18. I see that as a malicious attempt to prevent inheritance which will ensure that inheritance will be squandered. In my experience&#151;this point does not apply to my family, because we do not have that kind of money&#151;more young lives are damaged, sometimes irreparably, by the receipt of money at the age of 18&nbsp;than they are when money is received later in life. Far more young people go wrong because of too much money rather than not enough money.

 As the hon. Gentleman said, one can serve one&#039;s country in the armed forces at the age of 18, when one can also get married, start a business and vote. Insurance policies are but one example of what people can inherit, and many people who are younger than 25&nbsp;inherit outside a trust. Will he adduce examples and evidence on those who inherit at 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24&nbsp;or 25, which, I believe, is the age of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)?

 The argument is subjective&#151;I believe one thing and the right hon.

When I was in private practice, I used to discuss those issues. The point about insurance premiums on vehicles is important, because it is a clear and objective statement by insurance companies that they regard hazards to younger people as being much greater than those faced by others.

The other side of the argument is that the Treasury must surely recognise and understand the massive difference between a working four-wheel-drive vehicle taking animal feed up a snowy field in late spring to early lambs and a &quot;Chelsea tractor&quot; sitting outside a posh flat in Kensington. I hope that the Government will at some point accept an amendment that will force them at least to report on the Bill&#039;s impact on working vehicles, whether four-wheel drives on hill farms or Land Rovers or other four-wheel-drive vehicles used, for example, in mountain rescue.

<a name="stpa_329">Clause 26&nbsp;removes the small companies relief. Corporation tax was charged at 0&nbsp;per cent. up to &#163;10,000. At &#163;10,000, there is marginal relief at 19 400ths up to &#163;50,000&nbsp;at which the business rate of 19&nbsp;per cent. applies. The small business rate applies up to &#163;300,000, with marginal relief up to &#163;1.5&nbsp;million, calculated at 11 400ths. Clause 26&nbsp;abolishes the starting rate. The policy is described on page 190&nbsp;of the Red Book as &quot;tackling tax motivated incorporation&quot;, and will cost &#163;50&nbsp;million this year but produce revenue for the Government of &#163;390&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;and &#163;530&nbsp;million the year after. It might be a positive disincentive to incorporation&#151;the reason why the 0&nbsp;per cent. rate was introduced in the first place&#151;but I suspect that it will also feel like a disincentive to start and incorporate any business taken alongside the additional burdens of the higher business rate in Scotland and, for many small businesses, rocketing fuel costs.

<a name="stpa_330">Clause 30, however, on first-year allowances for small enterprises, appears to assist and provide an incentive for small companies. It was first announced in the pre-Budget report in 2005, and increases the rate from 40&nbsp;per cent. to 50&nbsp;per cent. for one year from April 2006. In December, the Chancellor estimated that 4.2&nbsp;million businesses would benefit. However, the Red Book shows the estimated cost to be nothing for this year and &#163;60&nbsp;million for 2007&#150;08, with a yield of &#163;15&nbsp;million in 2008&#150;9. For 2007&#150;08, if there is a cost of &#163;60&nbsp;million, and assistance to the value of &#163;60&nbsp;million, the average benefit to the 4.2&nbsp;million businesses would be &#163;14.28.

<a name="stpa_335">This Finance Bill follows the Chancellor&#039;s 10th Budget, and like others it has failed to rise to the challenges facing not just the United Kingdom economy in general but the Scottish economy specifically. I say that not least because we have experienced three full quarters of falling manufacturing growth. That recession in Scottish manufacturing&#151;the loss of 100,000&nbsp;Scottish manufacturing jobs&#151;and the loss of 1&nbsp;million manufacturing jobs in the UK have not been addressed to any significant degree in the Budget, or in the Bill.

The modest changes in research and development provision, although welcome, do nothing to reverse a fundamental imbalance. While the UK spends some 1.1&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product on R and D, the figure in Scotland is half that.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60424-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Gauke  (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 I want to discuss the Bill&#039;s reforms to group relief&#151;a subject that has not been touched on today. Even the hon. Members for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) and for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) failed to address it, which is somewhat remiss of them. I suspect that it has not been mentioned because it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 444</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>highly technical and complex. Schedule 1, which contains the amendments to group relief, consists of 14&nbsp;pages and is highly complex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_339">However, the substance of the changes to group relief are not particularly controversial, so far as one can see, and it is less important to highlight what they are than it is to highlight why we are making them. The simple explanation for the changes is the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case brought by Marks & Spencer, in which it was determined that UK group relief provisions for corporation tax purposes were in breach of European law. It is worth focusing on that case for a moment. Traditionally, UK group relief rules allow profits and losses made by UK resident subsidiaries in the same group to be offset against each other, so that the tax result mirrors the group&#039;s overall results. Until now, the rules have not allowed losses made by overseas subsidiaries to be offset against UK profits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_340">Let us continue with the M&S example. If it establishes a UK subsidiary that makes a loss, the loss can be offset against another UK subsidiary that is making a profit. However, losses incurred by a French subsidiary would not be available to offset against profits made by the UK subsidiary. M&S claimed that the UK group relief rules, by restricting the ability to offset profits and losses to UK residents alone, are contrary to the freedom of establishment principle under EU law. In other words, the UK tax system should provide tax relief for failed overseas business ventures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_341">The ECJ determined in favour of the taxpayer&#151;M&S&#151;subject to one very important proviso: that any cross-border loss relief be guaranteed to the taxpayer only where it can be proved that there was no possibility of making use of the losses in the jurisdiction in which they were incurred. I make no criticism of M&S for bringing that case. It has a duty to its shareholders to minimise its tax payment, and there is nothing wrong with going to the ECJ. However, we are implementing today a substantial change to our direct taxation as a consequence of an ECJ judgment, not of a decision taken by this House or by UK courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_342">Nor is that a unique example; there are a number of such cases dating back to 1996. Perhaps the first such case was ICI <i>v.</i> Colmer, which concerned consortium relief. More famous and significant were cases involving Hoescht and Metalgesellschaft, which determined that, for advance corporation tax purposes, groups with a UK parent company should not be treated differently from those with an EU parent company. The fact that ACT has been abolished, perhaps in part as a consequence of this judgment, does not mean that the case is meaningless. As well as being an important case in principle, the cost of repaying overpaid corporation tax in the Hoerscht and Metalgesellschaft cases, and similar cases, is likely to run to billions. Estimates of &#163;3&nbsp;billion to &#163;5&nbsp;billion are regularly quoted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_343">The ECJ judgment in the Lankhorst-Hohorst case, on Dutch and German thin capitalisation rules, has also imposed a substantial administrative burden on UK companies. The ECJ held that it was illegal to have thin capitalisation rules with regard to overseas group companies, but not group companies in the same&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdiction. Thin capitalisation rules protect corporation tax revenues from flowing out of one

<br>&nbsp;<br>country in the form of excessive interest payments being made intra-group to an overseas group company. As a consequence of the judgment, if one wishes the same rules to apply to overseas group companies as to UK group companies, one has to introduce what are effectively thin capitalisation rules for UK companies. That was done in the Finance Act 2004, which requires all transactions with group companies to be transacted on an arm&#039;s length basis or at least evidence to be produced to show that that was the case. If that cannot be done, the transactions are taxed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_344">The process has not finished. Earlier this month, the Advocate General opined on the BAT group case on franked investment income. The Treasury estimates that if the ECJ confirms the Advocate General&#039;s opinion&#151;as it usually does&#151;the decision could cost the UK &#163;7&nbsp;billion. At an earlier stage of the process is the Cadbury&#039;s case, which may result in a substantial review of the UK&#039;s controlled foreign companies rules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_345">Why are those cases important? First, they can be expensive. It is not always possible to measure accurately the precise cost of a judgment, but an analysis by Alistair Craig of Ernst and Young&#151;I recommend that hon. Members read his paper on EU law and British tax, published by the Centre for Policy Studies&#151;gives the possible cost of the various judgments that I have mentioned at somewhere between &#163;7.5&nbsp;billion and &#163;11.5&nbsp;billion. As I mentioned earlier, the franked investment income case may cost an additional &#163;7&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_346">When the Government came to power in 1997, many of the fiscal problems of this country were to be resolved by removing loopholes. Indeed, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West mentioned loopholes earlier. I think that sometimes the term &quot;loophole&quot; can be a little misleading, and one man&#039;s loophole is another man&#039;s low tax environment. However, the ECJ is creating a series of substantial loopholes in the British corporation tax system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_347">The second problem is the administrative difficulties, because the Government are inevitably required to ameliorate the effects of the judgments and that, in itself, causes difficulties for British business. For example, as I mentioned and as a consequence of the Lankhorst-Hohorst judgment, the Finance Act 2004&nbsp;introduced thin capitalisation rules requiring all UK companies to demonstrate that all transactions with fellow UK companies in the same group are on an arm&#039;s length basis. The administrative cost to UK businesses of that requirement has been considerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_348">In many cases, such as the provisions contained in schedule 1, the complexity of our tax system has been considerably increased by the changes required by ECJ judgments. Today, many Members have spoken about complexity, much of which we can put at the Chancellor&#039;s door, but in some instances it is created by the ECJ.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_349">A third concern is that we are moving towards the harmonisation of our taxation system to change it so that it complies with ECJ judgments, and the effects could be broader than the initial facts or the case being addressed. For example, if the Advocate General&#039;s opinion is upheld&#151;as it usually is&#151;in the BAT group case, it will no longer be possible to tax the dividends of overseas subsidiaries differently from UK subsidiaries. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 446</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>In most European jurisdictions, dividends from all subsidiaries are tax-exempt under what is described as the participation exemption. In the UK, we do not have a blanket exemption but we have a right to a tax deduction for interest on borrowings by a parent company in respect of a subsidiary. Those two different approaches are fundamentally incompatible&#151;trying to operate them together would be wide open to abuse&#151;so a key aspect of our corporate tax structure will have to be reformed. Presumably, we will have to use the participation exemption, but we will no longer be able to permit a deduction for interest on borrowings by a parent company in respect of a subsidiary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_350">That may be a good thing. I am not qualified to decide, but it is arguable that our tax structure, not just our tax rates, may give us a competitive advantage, which could be lost as a consequence of the ever-creeping Europeanisation of our tax structure. Certainly, the CBI tax committee has warned that the consequences of the BAT group case could blunt the appeal of the UK as a location for holding companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_351">Most important of all is the constitutional point. In clause 27&nbsp;and schedule 1, we are legislating on a matter relating to direct taxation and amending our law not as a consequence of anything determined by a UK court or because of the views of Members. That is not an uncommon experience for the House. However, one of the few areas where there is near unanimity on European matters is direct taxation. It is a line in the sand, we are told. Nobody is advocating harmonisation of direct taxation, be it of its rates or of its structure. None the less, that is precisely what is happening. Tax harmonisation has little or no support in the House.

I am trying to highlight the concern, but as a country our options for addressing it are somewhat limited. We should consider amending treaties.

We are talking about relatively small amounts of money in those cases, but large sums are being lost to the Exchequer and large administrative burdens are being placed on British industry and business as a consequence of such judgments. There is a need for a greater awareness of what the ECJ is doing to our corporate tax system. The effect is substantial and very concerning, and it is highly regrettable in my opinion that we are losing the ability to legislate for ourselves the corporate tax system that should apply in the United Kingdom.

Some of the protestations from Opposition Members were driven by envy of a Government who have succeeded in managing the economy well for the same period that the Conservative party managed to precipitate two of the most disastrous recessions that this country has ever seen. Indeed, the Chancellor recognised some of the challenges that we face in this economy&#151;certainly, those of increasing productivity and tackling poverty&#151;and measures to tackle those problems are clearly set out in the Budget.

<a name="60424-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_360">Some of the charities that will be affected by the proposals are extremely small, because the Bill proposes the lifting of the de minimus &#163;10,000&nbsp;level. The regulations are complex, so I hope that my right hon. Friend will ensure that those small organisations can deal with those difficult issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_361">Clause 56&nbsp;removes the risk that charities with trades that are only primary purpose could lose tax relief on the whole trade if the non-charitable part of the business is large. That touches on some issues that came up in the scrutiny Committee of the earlier Charities Bill. As I understand it, the provision would affect, in particular, those charities that support their charitable purpose with a business that is run purely as a business. We had the good example of a museum that also had a conference centre and used the income from the conference centre to support the museum. Will my right hon. Friend say whether that will be the impact of the clause and whether it will give the help to those innovative charities that I expect and hope it will?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_362">Clause 57&nbsp;improves the arrangements made for subsidiary companies of a charity to donate their profits to parent charities using gift aid. When a subsidiary decides to give its money to more than one charity, it will still be able to gain the tax exemption. Charities play an incredibly important role in our society and the Government have always been keen to support them. The ability of charities to operate effectively obviously depends to a great extent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on their being able to raise their funds through voluntary activity and also, of course, on having a tax regime that is supportive of them and is comprehensible and easy for them to implement. I hope that my right hon. Friend will give some reassurances on that in her winding-up speech and also provide some indication of whether the Government will look more favourably in general at the tax treatment of the charities and voluntary organisations that perform such an important role in our society.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_363">My second small point relates to clause 61&nbsp;and the home computer exemption. I am not sure whether the&nbsp;matter has already been raised. I take on board all the points about the change to the price of computers and the fact that many people have them now, but the measure has been extraordinarily popular in my constituency. The Communication Workers Union has started a petition to support the retention of the tax relief because many local people were using it to buy computers. I ask the Government to look again at the measure. They should not assume that just because computers have become cheaper and more people have them, the measure, which is small, does not still serve a useful function in our society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_364">I support the Bill in almost all its details. It is part of one of the cornerstones of the Government&#039;s success: the fine management of the economy, which has served my constituents well and allowed them to enjoy a decent quality of life and realise their aspirations for their children. I am sure that the Bill will be welcomed and sent on its way by the House tonight.

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="60424-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Philip Dunne  (Ludlow) (Con):</b> 
 I remind the House of my declaration in the Register of Members&#039; Interests. I also apologise to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for being unable to attend the entire debate, because I had Select Committee and other parliamentary duties this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_365">I welcome the Chief Secretary back to the Chamber, and would like to pick up on three of the issues on which he spoke at the start of the debate: the focus of the Bill on productivity, fairness and anti-avoidance. He will not be surprised to learn that I will take an approach somewhat different from his.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_366">Several of my hon. Friends, not least my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), spoke about productivity. I raised the issue in last month&#039;s debate on the Budget and pointed out that despite the Chancellor&#039;s claims, productivity growth in this country is clearly on a declining trend. Over the past 12&nbsp;months it has grown by a mere 0.4&nbsp;per cent., which is substantially below the trend under this Government, and even more substantially below that under the previous Government. It is not clear from my reading of the Bill how productivity will be enhanced. It will certainly not be enhanced in the oil industry, which is being clobbered by extra taxation measures, in the financial services industry, where the trust sector is being clobbered, or in the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_367">The former BBC economics correspondent Jeff Randall wrote a rather interesting article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> immediately after the Budget. He commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;With government spending, as a percentage of Britain&#039;s output, rising from 37.5&nbsp;per cent. in 2000&nbsp;to a forecast 45.7&nbsp;per cent. in 2007, there has been a tidal shift of resources into the low-productivity public sector.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 450</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_368">That is evident, and the article is a graphic description of what has gone on under this Government. It is a rather sad legacy of our Prime Minister that NHS productivity may well rise in the coming year as a result of the substantial job losses about which we read every day in the press. The Royal College of Nursing predicted a 13,000&nbsp;increase in unemployment in the NHS, which will probably have the perverse effect of increasing productivity in that segment of the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_369">Let me turn to the subject of fairness. I was struck by the Chief Secretary&#039;s use of the fairness argument to justify several of the more controversial measures in the Bill. He specifically cited fairness as a reason for introducing IT access for the elderly. He used as an example the Department for Work and Pensions&#039; measures to improve such access. I presume that he was referring to access to benefits and pensions. I ask him, or the Paymaster General in her winding-up speech, to inform the House how the Government reconcile that with the fact that in 2003&nbsp;the DWP introduced the Post Office card account, providing technology to replace the physical pension book&#151;a good thing&#151;yet now, barely three years later, it is deciding to terminate that account, which has proved so popular that more than 4.3&nbsp;million people, many of them pensioners, have one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_370">Clause 61, which has been touched on by many Members, deals with the home computing initiative. The withdrawal of this initiative, too, was described by the Chief Secretary as fair. The initiative was a very welcome and well-received Government tax relief measure&#151;no great surprise, then, that it is being scrapped by the Bill. It helped households on low incomes, it helped those who were out of work gain access to work, and it helped those in rural areas such as my constituency to gain access to jobs remote from home. The success of the initiative in my area is shown by the fact that last year Shropshire was declared the leading county in the country for home working, in part thanks to that Government initiative, which is now being scrapped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_371">Fairness was also used as an argument to justify the proposed inheritance tax changes to trusts in clause 157&nbsp;and schedule 20, but the retrospective nature of those changes is contrary to fairness. The reduction from 25&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;in the age limit for accumulation and maintenance trusts has nothing to do with fairness at all, and everything to do with the politics of envy, I regret to say. The financial literacy of 18-year-olds is not the same as that of 25-year-olds. Some commentators have described the measure as a charter for drug dealers. That may be pushing things a bit far, but removing prudent financial oversight from young people, some of whom in their maturing post-school years may fall easy prey to those who seek their wealth, does not seem to me to be an act of fairness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_372">It is also claimed that this is an anti-avoidance measure, as though the trusts concerned had been set up explicitly to avoid paying tax. In many cases&#151;the vast majority, I would argue&#151;that is not the case. As many commentators have pointed out, the Government seem to have little understanding of the extent or purpose of these trusts. The Chairman of the Treasury Committee rather helpfully pointed that out in the report published earlier today, quoting the letter that the Paymaster General, no less, was rushed into publishing in <i>The Times</i> in a panicky response to the general public outcry 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 451</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about this aspect of the Budget. Paragraph 106&nbsp;of the report refers to the Paymaster General arguing that the new rules would affect only a small number of trusts, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;We estimate that there are about 100,000&nbsp;discretionary trusts and only a small minority of those are accumulation and maintenance trusts of the kind that are caught by this Budget measure. Of that small minority of accumulation and maintenance trusts, only those containing assets above the inheritance tax threshold will be caught, so it is a minority of a minority.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_373">Since that letter was written, most commentators of whom I am aware have rather graphically illustrated the fact that the problems posed by the measure range much more widely than the Government seem to understand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_374">We heard earlier from my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers), who practised as a solicitor for many years, that most wills are written in trust. Husbands and wives, in both pre-nuptial and divorce situations, find their assets written in trust. Orphans have their assets written in trust. Recipients of compensation also have their assets written in trust. We have heard this evening about the life insurance sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_375">We will look forward to ascertaining in Committee precisely how the Government intend to exclude life insurance policies from the proposed legislation. All these measures could catch many people. This is an attack not on a small minority of a minority, but on the vulnerable and aspirational, and it is happening at a time when inheritance tax is being abolished in many of our competitor economies. This is not the time to seek, through some rather vindictive measures, to tighten the net under the guise of anti-avoidance while seeking to spread the net much more widely than ever before.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_376">I shall speak briefly about some of the green proposals in the Budget, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has chosen to trumpet throughout the globe. I would like to bring to the attention of the House one specific example, which illustrates the Government&#039;s incompetence in implementing some of their proposals. One of my constituents, Mr. David Luckhurst, runs his own small business, which is called Solar Dawn Renewables, of Lydbury North in my constituency. It installs heating systems with solar power generation on a domestic scale. Mr. Luckhurst was developing his business well under the Clear Skies renewable energy grants system, which the Government set in place. He hoped that it would be replaced in an orderly and efficient manner by the low-carbon buildings programmes grants, which had yet to be launched. They were announced in November 2005, allocating a further &#163;30&nbsp;million over three years, which was a welcome development, if modest.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_377">At that time, before the moneys were allocated between householders, communities and manufacturers, &#163;1.5&nbsp;million of the &#163;30&nbsp;million was taken out of the fund to make up a shortfall in the predecessor Clear Skies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programme. When the remaining Budget was allocated, &#163;10.5&nbsp;million was given to what is known as stream 1: householders&#151;domestic users&#151;and non-profit community organisations such as registered charities, community groups and schools, which received the balance of &#163;4&nbsp;million. Another &#163;18&nbsp;million was allocated to larger-scale projects known as stream 2. That included &#163;6&nbsp;million for retrofit and &#163;12&nbsp;million for new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 452</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>build and refurbishment of businesses, building developers, energy service companies and public sector entities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_378">In the Budget, in March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further &#163;50&nbsp;million for the low-carbon buildings programme,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;with the aim of encouraging manufacture at a higher scale leading to lower costs. This will help fund the installation of microgeneration technologies in a range of buildings including schools, social and local authority housing, businesses and public buildings&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_379">all very noble.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_380">There are still no details of exactly how the &#163;50&nbsp;million is to be allocated. All the indicators are that businesses will be the main beneficiaries. Yet there are small accredited firms, such as that run by my constituent, which are more or less entirely dependent on the custom of householders, and the so far patchy grants system has been making their survival in business extremely difficult, although both the Government and the Opposition have been trying to encourage such activity to improve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_381">Applications were deferred, on the basis that Clear Skies was to be replaced. Then the new programme was delayed. Now the DTI is saying that householders can register for application forms from today&#151;more than a month after the Budget announcement. It seems that none of the applications will be processed until the beginning of next month&#151;a month and a half after the Budget announcement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_382">To add to the complexity&#151;the Government do not like to do anything simple if they can complicate things&#151;there are now strings attached to grant applications. Householders are eligible for a grant only if they have previously installed other energy-efficiency measures, including loft and cavity wall insulation, low-energy light bulbs and heating controls. Those are all useful measures, but they should have been made criteria before now, so that householders knew what contract they were expected to enter into before they received the grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_383">Small businesses that produce the microgeneration technologies that everyone in the House wants to expand throughout the country rely on the grant funding for their businesses to flourish, but they have become increasingly vulnerable following a downturn in orders as a result of the Government&#039;s stop-start policy making. I hope that the Paymaster General, if she is paying attention, will be able to provide reassurance that the grants under the new low-carbon buildings programme will be processed as quickly as possible to prevent small businesses in that sector, such as the one owned by my constituent, from being pushed further into the red, as they are the very organisations that the Government should encourage if they are serious in their commitment to reduce carbon emissions.

<a name="60424-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_384">The Chief Secretary had a gentler run-out than he did in the debate on the Budget resolutions. He raised a number of issues and said that the Government offered potential. However, he did not say a great deal about the Government offering potential to pensioners&#151;I promise that I will say more about that later. Interestingly, he said, &quot;It&#039;s not a test of fairness to take two sets of figures and compare one set with another.&quot; I thought that Chief Secretaries did that all the time, not least when they attempt to discuss departmental spending limits in the run-up to a comprehensive spending review. I am delighted that the right hon. Gentleman has found a new way of doing so, and we look forward to seeing the results.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_385">My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) gave a very good, detailed speech outlining our critique of the Bill. She criticised the instability of the tax regime caused by the constant change and tinkering in which the Chancellor loves to indulge. She suggested a measure to save the home computing initiative by working co-operatively&#151;again, I shall say more about that later, and I would very much appreciate it if the Paymaster General attempted to take some of my points on board.

<a name="stpa_386">My hon. Friend filleted the Government&#039;s case on trusts and took it to pieces. We look forward to her doing so again in Committee, both on the Floor and upstairs. The right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr.&nbsp;McFall), the Chairman of the Select Committee, made a timely contribution, given the publication of today&#039;s report. He said that the Committee had concluded that it may be appropriate to review the operation of the fiscal rules. That is right and timely, not least as an economic commentator recently stated that the Chancellor had moved the goalposts on the golden rule so often that they were

<a name="60424-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_388">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) spoke on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I, too, welcome her to her new responsibilities, but may I offer her a tip? She lectured the House about posturing, but there is delightful irony in being lectured on that subject by a Liberal Democrat. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] That proposition has support from three quarters of the House. We look forward to engaging in debate with her at close quarters in Committee, and we will see how much posturing takes place there.

<a name="stpa_389">We then heard from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), for whom I have a particular affection, as he spoke just before me when I made my maiden speech in this place some five years ago. He described himself as one of the usual suspects in Finance Bill debates, which is right. He also rightly sounded an important warning about globalisation and the need to maintain competitiveness in the face of rapid economic and technological change. Given that need, it makes little sense to hinder the spread of computer literacy by abolishing the home computing initiative, as his Government currently propose, and I hope that we may yet have his support for trying to save the scheme.

The Chancellor himself first facilitated the HCI back in Budget 1999&nbsp;with the intention of promoting the spread of IT skills among our population, which was a laudable aim. The HCI scheme was subsequently endorsed by a variety of bodies, including the DTI, the CBI and the TUC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_403">The Minister of Communities and Local Government said this about the HIC scheme to his own regional press:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;As technology and IT-based business becomes an ever-bigger part of our regional economy, it is vital that the workforce develops the skills which will keep us competitive. That process should begin in the home so that everyone has the opportunity to become comfortable and competent with computers. That is why the Government is offering tax breaks which reduce the cost of computers to employees while saving money for their employers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para20">
<a name="stpa_404">The general secretary of the TUC essentially agrees with him. On 19&nbsp;January this year, which was the second anniversary of the HCI scheme, Mr. Brendan Barber issued a press release stating that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;experience has shown that when a business implements an HCI scheme, demand for learning services and training rises significantly.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para21">
<a name="stpa_405">It is difficult to mistake the meaning of that press release.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para22">
<a name="stpa_406">The DTI was also particularly keen to foster the HCI scheme. In fact, it was still promoting the scheme on its departmental website when the Treasury announced that the scheme had been scrapped. The DTI said&#151;this has since been removed from the website&#151;that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">&quot;The real beauty of HCI schemes is that they have the potential to improve performance in almost every area of the organisation. As well as traditional drivers&#151;reducing costs, increasing profitability&#151;they can also contribute to more recent imperatives such as corporate responsibility, individual learning and workplace development&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para23">
<a name="stpa_407">That is a good argument for keeping the scheme. Will the Paymaster General explain to the House in her winding-up speech the degree of consultation that took place between the Treasury and the DTI before the scheme was scrapped, because I suspect that there was not much?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para24">
<a name="stpa_408">The measure has proved popular, with some 500,000&nbsp;people taking advantage of the scheme to, in effect, hire a computer via their employer to help to improve their IT skills as part of a modern, knowledge-based economy. According to the HCI Alliance, 60&nbsp;per cent. of participants are in blue-collar industries and 75&nbsp;per cent. pay the standard rate of tax or lower. We believe that the scheme is worth while and that the Government should retain it, not abolish it, and we will table amendments to that effect. If the Government still argue that there have been abuses of the scheme that need to be addressed, we are genuinely willing to work with them, with the industry and with users to try to produce a revised framework that would allow users to continue to benefit while protecting revenue appropriately. I sincerely hope that the Government will be minded to take up that offer during the Bill&#039;s progress through the House, and we will listen very carefully to what the Paymaster General says when she winds up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para25">
<a name="stpa_409">Then there are the measures in the Bill that will increase the tax burden on small companies, including the proposal in clause 26&nbsp;to abolish the zero starting rate 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 457</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of corporation tax, which was, again, introduced by the Chancellor, this time back in 2002. The Treasury will now ask even new companies to pay 19&nbsp;per cent. straight off instead. The Government have billed that as an anti-avoidance measure, but it is still a revenue-raising initiative. The Treasury&#039;s Red Book points out that the change, which is euphemistically described as &quot;tackling tax motivated incorporation&quot;, is set to raise a net &#163;870&nbsp;million from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small companies in the years 2006&#150;07&nbsp;to 2008&#150;09&nbsp;inclusive. With measures like that, it is no wonder that the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning admitted in <i>The Sun</i> on 28&nbsp;March:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;We are probably about at the limit of what people are prepared to pay to improve public services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para26">
<a name="stpa_410">I think that he is right, and that small companies are probably at about that limit as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para27">
<a name="stpa_411">I turn to the attack on trusts contained in part 6, about which we have heard a great deal in this debate. One thing that we have learned about the Chancellor in recent years, be it in his Budget speeches or in his associated Red Book, is that one must always read the small print&#151;not least in the subsequent Finance Bill. Nowhere is that more true than in the proposals relating to trusts. This is not just an issue of retrospective legislation&#151;that is usually a matter of some controversy and, as we have heard, it will be in this case&#151;but of the very considerable uncertainty, doubt and worry that has been caused to many families by the proposed change. Graham Serjeant, the economics editor of <i>The Times</i>, said of the new regime:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">&quot;The proposals combine malice, prejudice and miscalculation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para28">
<a name="stpa_412">This not about combating tax avoidance, as the Government like to claim&#151;it smacks of the politics of envy, and it is exactly the sort of measure that middle England could expect more of were the Chancellor ever to succeed to the premiership. We will want to explore the precise detail of what the Government have in mind in relation to all this, although in fairness the shadow Chief Secretary has done that commendably already, and to seek to ameliorate its worst effects on hard-working and aspirational families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para29">
<a name="stpa_413">This Bill will increase the tax burden, including on our small businesses, and reduce, rather than enhance, our competitiveness, but it is deficient in other respects as well. Despite being a major piece of financial legislation, it does precious little in part 7&nbsp;to address the problems in our pensions industry following the Chancellor&#039;s &#163;5&nbsp;billion-a-year smash-and-grab raid. It also comes as small comfort to pensioners who took advantage of Labour&#039;s &#163;200&nbsp;council tax discount just prior to the general election, only to see it removed in the 2006&nbsp;Budget once the votes had been safely counted. When the Chancellor first brought the measure in, <i>The Sun</i> responded on the following morning with the headline, &quot;Beware the bribes of March&quot;. It was indeed a one-off bribe, and we hope that the electorate will reflect on it at the ballot box on 4&nbsp;May this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para30">
<a name="stpa_414">Britain needed a Finance Bill this year that boosted our competitiveness in an increasingly fierce global economy, rewarded enterprise, helped to stimulate growth, and provided a successful financial climate for genuine reform of our public services rather than financial chaos and 7,000&nbsp;redundancies in the NHS. However, the House has been presented instead with a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 458</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>detailed and complicated measure&#151;as ever from the Chancellor&#151;that discourages business investment, does little to boost productivity, penalises families that seek to plan for their future and that of their children and betrays pensioners while failing to do anything practical to avert the mounting financial crisis in the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-34_para31">
<a name="stpa_415">For those reasons, hon. Members should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading. I urge them to vote for our amendment instead.

 On the whole, the debate has been good and instructive, with hon. Members making positive contributions. I congratulate the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) on their first major speeches from the Front Bench. I genuinely look forward to our debates in Committee, if only because all three political parties will be led by women. Let us hope that we can convince both hon. Members of the virtues of the Bill.

<a name="stpa_416">Although the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr.&nbsp;Francois) knows it as well as I do, I must tell other hon. Members who are not veterans of Finance Bill debates that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) was only warming up this evening. How much I look forward to his contribution in Committee! Let me say to him, in the friendliest way, that brevity would help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_417">The Government believe in a modern and fair tax system that keeps pace with a changing world and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) so eloquently summarised, encourages work and savings, ensures that everybody pays their fair share and delivers world class public services. The Bill contains measures that help the Government to achieve those objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_418">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall), who chairs the Treasury Committee and introduced and highlighted parts of its report, reflected on several matters and common themes with the Government. Of course, we shall respond to the Committee in the usual way. However, like the Bill, he went on to focus on measures to support productivity, enterprise and competition, to help the environment and to ensure that the tax system is fair. He referred to targeted measures to tackle tax fraud and avoidance and market distortions, and to ensure that the tax system can respond to the challenges of globalisation&#151;a point echoed by many hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_419">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West and other hon. Members, my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire also spoke about the specific challenges to the environment. It is important to remind hon. Members that CO <sub>2</sub>  levels will be 15&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;per cent. lower in 2010&nbsp;than in 1990. Greenhouse gases will be 23&nbsp;to 25&nbsp;per cent. lower in 2010&nbsp;than the base year levels. Business sector emissions will be 33&nbsp;per cent. lower and domestic sector emissions will be 16&nbsp;per cent. lower than the base levels in 2010. As hon. Members repeatedly pointed out, we have to ensure that we make genuine progress by 2020, that we have a long-term goal of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 459</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 60&nbsp;per cent. by 2050, and that that is based on a range of measures to tackle the emissions problem.

<a name="60424-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_420">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire and several other hon. Members mentioned air passenger duty. My right hon. Friend knows that the decision on air passenger duty is influenced by environmental concerns. It must also be considered in the context of wider social and economic factors, as the Chancellor said in evidence to my right hon. Friend&#039;s Committee. The aviation industry has been badly affected by 9/11&nbsp;and by the present volatility in the oil market, and the Government believe that the most effective approach to dealing with aviation emissions is to ensure that the European emissions trading scheme is in place by 2008. In these debates it amazes me how quickly hon. Members and spokespersons for other parties rush to make commitments on which they will never have to deliver. They do not therefore have to consider the issues in the round. That said, I take on board the points that my right hon. Friend made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_421">The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet spoke about complexity, and I have listened with interest to the debate on the perceived complexity in the Bill. Its measures are designed to be as simple as possible while protecting revenue, encouraging growth and enterprise, and addressing market failures. Complexity is a notion that the Government take seriously, but the tax systems in the modern world are inherently complex, reflecting the complex economic and social realities with which we live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_422">My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) focused on deregulation. He will be aware that recent research carried out by KPMG found that the UK tax system imposes administrative burdens equivalent to about 0.4&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, which compares favourably with the rate in other countries. For example, it is lower than in either the Netherlands or Sweden. In answer to the point made by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), however, Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs has been set challenging targets to reduce that burden even further. Over the next five years it will reduce the time spent dealing with forms by 10&nbsp;per cent., and with inspections by 15&nbsp;per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West listed the deregulation measures in the Budget.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_424">Many hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet and for Gosport (Peter Viggers), my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, referred to trusts, in particular two types of trust&#151;the accumulation and maintenance trust and the interest in possession trust. There is no clear rationale for privileging those trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_425">It has been clear for some time that wealthy individuals are using trusts primarily to shelter their wealth from inheritance tax. The Government believe that it is unfair for people to gain such an advantage, and we have therefore taken action to ensure that inheritance tax exemptions apply only when trusts are set up to cater for certain prescribed circumstances. Those are, broadly, when they provide for bereaved minors, for the disabled, or for only one beneficiary. In other cases, the normal charges for trusts will apply, preventing them from being used as shelters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_426">There has been a great deal of speculation in the media that this measure will affect millions of people. Much of that speculation is groundless and has raised people&#039;s fears unnecessarily. For the avoidance of doubt, however, and in response to several issues raised this evening, I want to confirm a number of points about trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_427">Life assurance policies that were placed in trust before 22&nbsp;March 2006&nbsp;will continue to be regarded as being in pre-Budget trusts. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West asked two specific questions. First, he asked whether discretionary trusts still have a 10-year anniversary charge. The answer is that existing tax regimes for discretionary trusts remain, including the 10-year provision. His second question related to wills, for example, in relation to an individual who has Alzheimer&#039;s. Wills can still be changed up to two years after death by using a deed of variation, which still applies in that case. When someone dies without having made a will, their bereaved spouse or civil partner will continue to get the spouse relief. Spouse relief will continue to be due when an &quot;interest in possession&quot; trust is set up under a will giving a life interest to a bereaved spouse or civil partner, where someone takes the asset outright.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_428">The hon. Member for Gosport referred to the use of trusts at the age of 18&nbsp;or 25. Using trusts beyond the age of 18&nbsp;will still be possible&#151;the Government are just bringing those into the mainstream tax rules at 18. All 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the organisations quoted, including the Legal and General, say that the tax charge is not enough to stop people setting up a life insurance policy. The Government therefore reject statements that the provision might affect millions of people. We recognise how important trusts are, but we believe that the tax system should not apply artificial incentives for setting them up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_429">Many Members referred to the home computer initiative and to clause 61, which removes the tax exemption. With effect from 6&nbsp;April, a tax charge will arise on computer equipment made available by employers to their employees for private use. It will not, however, change the position for an employee who has been provided with computer equipment solely for business purposes and where private use is not significant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_430">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.&nbsp;Gauke) raised specific points relating to European Court of Justice rulings. In addition to what I have already said, I reassure him that we will continue to defend UK tax law against challenges before the ECJ. We will keep the tax regime under review. There are good grounds to defend UK tax law consistent with our objectives. We have every reason to believe that we will continue to be able to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_431">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) asked a series of questions with regard to charities. She sought an assurance with regard to specific clauses. I reassure her that the three measures to defend charitable reliefs against misuse do precisely that&#151;the rules are targeted on areas of misuse, and charities using the reliefs correctly will not be affected. To give her further reassurance, the Charity Finance Directors Group has said that it believes that it is essential that the charity brand is protected and not tainted by association with tax avoidance schemes. The Charities Tax Reform Group strongly welcomed the introduction of measures to prevent the exploitation of tax reliefs for charities by donors of large amounts, to their benefit. <i>[Interruption.]</i> [Hon.

<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60424-38_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ian Austin  (Dudley, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I would like to thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to raise the issue of the prevention of attacks on cash delivery crews. It should be an issue of the utmost importance to all hon. Members on both sides of the House because violent and terrifying attacks are happening to our constituents up and down the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_444">I am delighted that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), is on the Front Bench and look forward to his response to the debate. I am aware that one of his ministerial colleagues met a delegation from the GMB, the British Security Industry Association and Group 4&nbsp;Securicor a few months ago. I am also delighted that the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson), is in his place on the Front Bench. Although he is unable to speak in the debate, I know of his deep personal interest in the matter and how tirelessly he has campaigned behind the scenes to raise the issue and press for action. As I am sure the Minister knows well, he is not a man to be messed with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_445">My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East is not alone. There has been considerable parliamentary interest in the matter. An early-day motion on combating cash delivery crime has received cross-party support and currently has almost 100&nbsp;signatories. Several written parliamentary questions have been tabled on cash-in-transit&#151;or CIT, as it is known&#151;crime. Despite meetings with the Minister and further recent media attention aroused by high-profile raids, such as the recent attack on the Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, the problem persists and the violence continues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_446">It is worth setting out several details about the CIT industry. Its operations are vast, with an estimated &#163;500&nbsp;billion being transported around the country every year in a fleet of 4,000&nbsp;vehicles, which represents about &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion every day. The industry is also a significant employer, with more than 14,000&nbsp;people having jobs in the sector. CIT crews ensure that cash is efficiently recycled and redistributed in the economy to maintain the liquidity of the nation. Our lives would be very different and severely disrupted if crews were unable to undertake their deliveries for only a few days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_447">Members will remember the fuel protests in September 2000, when the whole nation ground to a halt. We would face a similar situation were it not for the men and women who transport the cash we all rely on every day. They make sure that we have cash in our pockets, that shops and banks are able to open in the morning and that wages can be paid. Because of the fear of copycat crime, the serious threats that couriers face as they go about their vital job are rarely reported in the media, and we need to develop a better understanding and awareness of the problem. These men and women are performing a service vital to the interests of the public and the UK economy. In fact, it shares similarities with the postal service. CIT is the only private sector service covered by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 472</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_448">CIT attacks are escalating, both in number and in severity. In 2005, there were 836&nbsp;attacks in the UK. Of these, more than 200&nbsp;involved a firearm, and 170&nbsp;couriers were injured. Worse still, these statistics represent a marked increase on recent years, with a rise of 10&nbsp;per cent. in attacks since 2004&nbsp;and an increase of a fifth on the figures for 2003. There were 26&nbsp;life-threatening or disabling injuries last year. Industry employees, many of whom are GMB members, suffered stabbings, pistol whippings, severe beatings and broken bones, not to mention the post-traumatic stress that resulted. In the most extreme cases shootings take place and members of the public can sometimes be drawn into the violence. Last year, there were six shootings, and one of the victims was a member of the public. In February 2004, a member of the public was tragically shot and killed during an attack in Birmingham. In the first quarter of this year, I am afraid to tell the House, there has been a 12.5&nbsp;per cent. rise in attacks, and the industry forecasts that there will be more than 1,000&nbsp;attacks during the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_449">In attack hotspots such as the Greater Manchester police area, the increase has been even more marked. In the first quarter of last year there were 27&nbsp;attacks; in the first quarter of this year there were 38. In the Metropolitan police area, attacks have almost doubled, rising from 37&nbsp;to 72&nbsp;in the same two quarters. The Met&#039;s detection rate in 2005&nbsp;was 14&nbsp;per cent. In Merseyside, as a result of a successful crackdown, the number of attacks has fallen, from 37&nbsp;in the first quarter of last year to 19&nbsp;in the first quarter of this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_450">Workers injured in such attacks are often unable to return to work and are forced to claim incapacity benefit. I would like to draw the attention of the House in particular to the case of Colin Baker from the black country, who worked in the industry for 16&nbsp;years until he was shot in the leg while making a delivery.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060424/debtext/60424-39.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60424-39_spnew0"><b> Lynda Waltho  (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b> 
 I was present when Mr. Colin Baker came here with a delegation from the GMB last month and described that horrific attack. He described not only the physical problems but the effect that the incident had on his confidence and, tellingly, on his family. In fact, they became victims as much as he was. That is a forgotten cost of such crimes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60424-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Austin: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Anybody who has listened to Colin Baker could not fail to be moved by his experiences and suffering. He was left permanently disabled and unable to work as a result of what happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_451">The following is typical of the more violent attacks of recent months. It is a verbatim account from a report provided by Group 4&nbsp;Securicor following an attack in Birmingham last August. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82">&quot;The courier was returning to the vehicle with an empty box when the two attackers shouted &#039;Give me the money&#039;. The attacker with the revolver attacked the courier, dragging him to the back of the van, and the driver heard his colleague say &#039;Give them the money&#039;. A retired West Midlands Police Detective Inspector came to the couriers&#039; aid. In the melee that followed four or five shots were fired by the attacker with the firearm. The courier was shot in his right foot and the retired police detective was shot in the thigh.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_452">As my hon. Friend said, the physical effects of these attacks on staff and the public are obvious, but the psychological scars of such terrifying ordeals can take 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 473</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>much longer to heal. Understandably, morale within a depot can be badly affected, and this in turn can compromise the ability to carry out cash deliveries successfully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_453">The industry has worked hard to make armoured vans as unattractive a target as possible to potential attackers, and &#163;100&nbsp;million is spent each year on security support. The industry is striving to keep its employees and the public as safe as possible using technologies such as smoke boxes, onboard CCTV, biometrics and dye.
</p>








<p><a name="st_249"><a name="60424-39_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Foster  (Worcester) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend congratulate the British Security Industry Association, based in my constituency, and the GMB union, of which I am proud to have been a member for 20&nbsp;years, on the way in which they have come together on this campaign to focus on the fact that these crimes that he so graphically describes are indeed crimes against the person, not strictly commercial crimes in which there somehow is no victim? It is that human side that my hon. Friend has described that we need to press on those in authority to do something more about.
</p>








<p><a name="st_250"><a name="60424-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Austin: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. It is encouraging to see employers represented by the industry body and the trade unions, which are working so well in partnership.
</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that whereas the trade unions and the employers are frequently portrayed as being on opposite sides of the fence, in this case their aims and aspirations, and I hope the outcome, suggest that they have a similar approach?
</p>








<p><a name="st_252"><a name="60424-39_spnew5"><b> Mr. Austin: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We have a great example of trade unions and the industry working in partnership to improve the situation for all those concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_454">The industry has established a national security intelligence unit. It will draw together police and intelligence from throughout the UK to combat CIT crime. In addition, there is security industry authority licensing to standardise security training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_455">There are deeper ramifications of a single attack that may not be immediately apparent. Money stolen in CIT attacks is a major source of funding for serious organised crime, which reaches into a much wider range of crimes. A recent industry study has shown that one attack can be connected to 15&nbsp;other offences, often of a serious nature. These can include the violent theft of motor vehicles to use in the attack, firearms and other weapon offences, money laundering and other related crimes. CIT vans are seen as an easy way for gangs to fuel their criminal networks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_456">My region, the west midlands, is considered by the industry to be one of the areas targeted by these criminals, along with Northern Ireland, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Greater London and west Yorkshire. There have already been 21&nbsp;attacks in the region during the first quarter of 2006. The GMB, the British Security Industry Association and Group 4&nbsp;have been working closely together to bring this problem to our attention, and I congratulate them on their efforts.

<a name="stpa_457">Steps have been taken to deter people from carrying guns. The Government have acted on this. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, anyone convicted of unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm will be jailed for a minimum of five years. Further action is required to ensure that this problem is tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_458">While I felt that some of the coverage of the attack on the Tonbridge depot was inappropriately light-hearted, I welcomed the media focus on the violent attacks suffered by the CIT industry and the couriers. Too often the crime is seen as a victimless one, sometimes because of the almost incomprehensible sums of money involved. First, we need the Home Office to recognise the particular nature of this sort of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_459">I believe that CIT crime needs to be classified on a consistent basis by all police forces. We currently have a situation where police forces record the crime in different ways, which is at odds with the industry&#039;s unified approach. By achieving consistency across constabularies we would be in a much better position to combat crime throughout the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_460">In addition, there is a need for further thought on classification of the crime to reflect the severe human costs of these horrifying attacks. I would argue that CIT crime is not purely commercial robbery, nor is it personal theft. This classification dichotomy needs to be resolved and I would ask the Minister to give an undertaking to take this process forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_461">Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, could look to join up policy on this issue. All too often, couriers are forced to carry out their deliveries in high-risk environments. Stories abound of them having to walk hundreds of yards between their vans and the banks because of the pedestrianisation of high streets, and of having to queue in bank queues, cash delivery case in hand, because there is no special access.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_462">Cutting out these crimes must involve changes to planning laws to engineer in safe cash handling methods in shopping centres, banks and multiple retail outlets. CIT vans must be granted special access through the increasing number of pedestrianised high streets. Why should they not, for example, be given similar access to the emergency services? Will the Minister consider meeting his colleagues within the ODPM to discuss joining up policy in this area? The CIT attack problem demands cross-departmental solutions. I look forward to his comments on how the Government will produce safer environments for the transfer of cash.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_463">High street banks and retail chains also have a role to play to ensure that when CIT crews are operating on their property, risk is minimised. I understand that talks between the CIT industry and the British Bankers Association have already taken place. I hope that further progress can be made on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_464">Industry experience suggests, unsurprisingly, that CIT attacks can be reduced significantly when they are seen as a high priority by the local police force. Before Christmas, for example, the West Midlands police force operated a system to combat CIT robberies through the shadowing of vehicles. Merseyside police has implemented a similar initiative, known as &quot;Operation Matrix&quot;, which also combats these crimes through the&nbsp;overt targeting of suspects and offenders involved in the attacks. That initiative was implemented after the review of gun crime by the chief constable, and it is part 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 475</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of a wider strategy to combat serious organised crime in the area. Following its introduction in April 2005, Merseyside police reported a 44&nbsp;per cent. reduction in CIT attacks in the first six months. Although the success of that operation is encouraging, there is often an inconsistent approach across police forces. Will the Minister agree to attend an industry stakeholder conference to share police and industry best practice on tackling the issue, as the police play a key strategic and operational role in the fight against the crime? The approach by different forces must be joined up, as is the case for relevant Government Departments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="60424-39_spnew6"><b> Ed Balls  (Normanton) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising the profile of the issue, but does he agree that as well as recognising the risk run by those workers, the Government must act to protect them? Members of the GMB, the Trade and General Workers Union and other unions deserve not only protection but recognition of the vital public service that they offer on a daily basis.
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60424-39_spnew7"><b> Mr. Austin: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that it is important that we recognise the key role played by those workers, without whom our economy could not function efficiently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_465">All parties have welcomed the principle of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which was launched at the beginning of the month. As I have said, money stolen in CIT attacks is a major source of funding for serious organised crime. SOCA clearly plays a role in combating CIT crime, but can the Minister provide further clarification? SOCA&#039;s role as a force without borders is particularly important, as gangs often operate in more than one area, especially if one force cracks down on the problem. In such cases, SOCA&#039;s expertise is much needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_466">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise those issues, and I look forward to the Government continuing to tackle the problem.

 I congratulate my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon.

As a Greater Manchester MP, I know that the issues that he has raised are extremely serious. In recent years, I have looked at them closely, and I acknowledge that he speaks with authority and conviction. I thank colleagues who have stayed to hear our debate, as the level of attendance shows the importance of the issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_468">As my hon. Friend rightly said, the recent rises in attacks on cash-in-transit deliveries are, indeed, a cause for concern, particularly given their effect on security staff and their families. That was brought into focus for a wider audience by the reports in February of the raid on the cash-handling depot in Tonbridge, Kent, and the distressing circumstances that staff and their families had to endure. My hon. Friend was right that we do not always think of staff in those sectors as front-line public servants, but they do indeed provide a valuable public service, as he said. We all expect cash machines to be full and the economy to function, and those individuals put themselves at personal risk to provide those services. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we owe it to them to work to ensure that they have adequate protection in going about their business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_469">That concern is shared by the Government, so much so that the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety recently met representatives from the security industry, the GMB union and the British Security Industry Association. It is generally agreed by those who attended the meeting that it was a very productive one that set the foundations on which we can build a very solid response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_470">I should like at this point to pick up on the helpful comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) in saying that I, too, congratulate the GMB, Group 4&nbsp;and the British Security Industry Association on bringing forward a positive partnership that we hope can deliver real, practical benefits for the people who provide this important service. The important point is that this is about partnership, and all the links in the chain doing their bit and working together to ensure that we have a system that functions well. I welcome the partnership, which I believe has a reception in the House on 27&nbsp;June. I hope that colleagues here will be present to support it, and I shall certainly make every effort to attend.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 477</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_472">The Government find any crime that involves violence or guns unacceptable, and we are sending a strong message that such crime has no place in the community or on the street, and that perpetrators can expect to receive considerable custodial sentences. In an age that is so often characterised as the age of plastic, it is remarkable that the need for cash is so high. Of course, it is that service that the workers about whom my hon. Friend has spoken so well are providing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_473">Some &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion in cash is moved daily around the country in approximately 4,500&nbsp;vehicles. As my hon. Friend rightly said, in 2005, there were 836&nbsp;attacks on couriers, and firearms were present in just over 26&nbsp;per cent. of those attacks. Those figures represent a 10&nbsp;per cent. increase on 2004&nbsp;and a 20&nbsp;per cent. increase on 2003. Perhaps that explains why we are here discussing the issue this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_474">To understand how we can respond effectively, we need to put the matter into some context. My hon. Friend has provided a comprehensive set of statistics that show how the incidence of cash-in-transit attacks has risen over the past few years, but if we look at the overall context of crime, we see that such crimes represent less than 1&nbsp;per cent. of all recorded crime. However, that does not diminish our view of the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_475">As the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety stated at her recent meeting, we appreciate and understand the predicament of the security industry, the GMB union, and staff and members alike. The key point of my hon. Friend&#039;s debate is preventing attacks on cash-in-transit deliveries. To focus on that issue, we must understand some key features of this type of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_476">As my hon. Friend said, levels of violence during such attacks have, sadly, increased in recent years. Historically, such robberies have always been described by the public as armed robberies and a level of violence has generally been used in these attacks. However, that is not a position that we will tolerate, and we are determined to address it on a number of fronts. What available research there is suggests that perpetrators of cash-in-transit attacks are professional and organised in their approach, and have a higher status among the criminal fraternity. These are not opportunistic crimes; they are generally researched, planned and seen by criminals as lucrative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_477">There is a common misconception that such crimes are carried out against companies that can &quot;afford&quot; to suffer the losses, and they are often seen as victimless crimes, but as my hon. Friend has illustrated, there is a human effect, which the criminal ignores. Let me be clear, however, that that is not a misconception that the Government hold. We recognise the human element of the crime and we expect the criminal justice system to apply the appropriate sentence available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_478">Let me respond to some of the detailed points that my hon. Friend made. The security industry and the GMB union have been calling for reclassification of cash-in-transit attacks from business crime to crimes against a person. Their belief is that such reclassification of the crime would lead to greater penalties. The Government believe that such crimes are very much crimes against people, and the sentencing framework demonstrates how seriously they are regarded. The maximum 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 478</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sentence for robbery is life imprisonment. In cases in which a member of staff is seriously injured or killed in the course of a robbery, the sentence imposed would be life, with a recommendation that the minimum period served would be 30&nbsp;years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_479">My hon. Friend asked me directly to address whether we should reclassify the crime in order to bring out more accurately its true cost and have police forces focus on it. We will examine that issue, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety will continue to give the matter extremely careful consideration in taking forward the dialogue that she is having with the groups involved in the campaign. However, I assure my hon. Friend that that matter is under active consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para13">
<a name="stpa_480">My hon. Friend raised the need to make cash-in-transit attacks a police priority. Policing priorities are made at force level in conjunction with police authorities. If targeting cash-in-transit attacks is seen by forces as being an important contributor to achieving a reduction in overall crime, local forces will make them a priority. We will be encouraging forces with higher rates of CIT crime to look at how they are tackling the problem and making them aware, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers, of the best approaches and tactics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para14">
<a name="stpa_481">As my hon. Friend has said, there are several examples of tactics to address CIT crime that can be effectively applied by police forces, and we will look at how we can make sure that that knowledge is available to all police forces and crime and disorder reduction partnerships. My hon. Friend has mentioned the example of Merseyside, and I, too, pay tribute to that approach, which has been extremely successful in reducing such attacks. I refer him to a successful operation in my police force area, Operation Hawkeye, which involved the surveillance of cash deliveries and successfully disrupted the activities of gangs that engage in such attacks. I am aware that other examples exist, and we need to build on good practice. With the move to larger, more strategic police forces, we believe that the police will have the resources to go after that kind of crime. They will be able to focus on the pattern of crime and understand the networks behind it, which will be another reason for the police force to move in that particular area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para15">
<a name="stpa_482">My hon. Friend has asked whether I am prepared to attend a stakeholder conference. It may be better for my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety to undertake that task, but I assure him that we will engage with that suggestion at a ministerial level, and I assure him that a Home Office Minister will attend the conference and give the initiative the importance that it deserves.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para16">
<a name="stpa_483">Although the level of gun crime in England and Wales is relatively low, we recognise the terrible effect that such offences have on families and communities. Gun crime remains concentrated largely in three areas, and around two thirds of firearms offences occur in the areas covered by just three metropolitan police forces&#151;the Metropolitan police area, the Greater Manchester police area and, as we have heard, the west midlands&#151;and perhaps it is no coincidence that those areas have the highest incidence of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 479</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cash-in-transit attacks. There is no room for complacency, but the measures that we have introduced to tackle gun crime have been effective. We will continue to maintain a close eye on developments to see whether we need to introduce further measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para17">
<a name="stpa_484">My hon. Friend has mentioned the need to design out crime, which relates to the role that town planning can play in minimising the scope for such attacks. Again, that illustrates the need for the widest possible partnership in that area to ensure that every link in the chain is thinking about the potential problems. Section 17&nbsp;of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998&nbsp;requires all local authorities to exercise their functions with due regard to the likely effect on crime and disorder and do all that they reasonably can to prevent crime and disorder. Designing out crime should therefore be central to the planning and delivery of new developments, which is a key message in the joint Office of the Deputy Prime Minister-Home Office publication &quot;Safer Places: The Planning System and Crime Prevention&quot;, which provides guidance on the layout of all buildings and spaces to reduce the risk of crime and urges planners, designers, crime prevention practitioners and police to work together to develop solutions from an early stage in the design process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60424-40_para18">
<a name="stpa_485">It is not just a question of big issues such as designing out crime&#151;it is also about the practical things. Are we helping the teams who deliver to our town centres the cash on which local economies depend? As my hon. Friend said, that is a civil contingency matter. Are we making it as easy as possible for them? Are we giving them access to the pedestrianised zones of our town centres? When they arrive at a location with cash, are we speeding it through the branch? Are we doing all that we can to minimise delays in the system so that we minimise the scope for attack? We can all look again at those aspects to see whether we can bear down further.

<a name="stpa_486">CCTV has a major role to play. The Government have made a major investment in CCTV. A total of &#163;170&nbsp;million of Home Office capital funding was made available to crime and disorder reduction partnerships. As a direct result of that funding, more than 680&nbsp;CCTV schemes, which are a known deterrent to cash-in-transit attacks, were installed in town centres. I am pleased to report that progress to my hon. Friend, but of course there is always more that we can do to take matters forward.

<a name="60424-40_para20">
<a name="stpa_487">My hon. Friend mentioned the Serious Organised Crime Agency. He is right to mention the link with serious and organised crime. SOCA was set up with effect from 1&nbsp;April. Its initial priorities, as set by the Home Secretary, are to tackle class A drugs trafficking and people-smuggling. However, there is clearly a link with such crimes, and I am sure that as SOCA develops its role and becomes more established, there will be efforts to bear down on the gangs and networks perpetrating them. I am sure that what my hon. Friend has said will be heard by those working in SOCA and that we will see some progress soon.
