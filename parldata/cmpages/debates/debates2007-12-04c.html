The Climate Change Bill, which is the UK&#146;s framework for delivering substantial reductions in CO2 emissions&#151;at least 60 per cent.&#151;considers domestically sourced CO2.

In some cases, routes are being segmented, resulting in increased cost and inconvenience to passengers; and in other cases, routes may be axed altogether. Clearly, this is not a safety issue, because in order to comply, it is possible to change the passengers but not the driver.

 I would certainly welcome a meeting with my hon. Friend and her constituents to explain the issue. If a community transport service is restricted to a particular group of people&#151;perhaps people with disabilities or elderly people&#151;it would not be eligible under the concessionary fares scheme.

 I am, of course, prepared to look into that. However, I re-emphasise that the changes to be introduced in April will not change the eligibility, so I am not clear why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the bus service will stop because of the new scheme. If a community transport service is open to the wider public, it can participate in the concessionary fare scheme. The Local Transport Bill will make changes that will make it easier for community transport services to operate by, for example, allowing the payment of drivers, which has been widely welcomed by the Community Transport Association because it will make it easier to run the type of services that we are talking about.</p>

We are leading the argument in Europe and internationally to try to include aviation emissions in trading schemes, so that we make sure that aviation pays the price for its contribution to damaging the environment. She mentions airlines that travel extraordinary distances to avoid paying some charges. That contributes to carbon emissions, and obviously it is not in line with what we would like.</p>

 I am able to inform the House today of the findings of the Royal Air Force board of inquiry on the crash of RAF Nimrod XV230 in Afghanistan on 2 September 2006. First, I know that the entire House will join me in paying tribute to the 14 service personnel who lost their lives in that tragic incident. Our thoughts are with their families and friends, and with the men and women of the armed forces, who I know feel the loss of their colleagues very deeply. I would also like to pay tribute to RAF Kinloss. That close community was hit hard by the Nimrod tragedy, but it has maintained magnificent support for the Nimrod crews deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o1"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07120463000147">I remind the House that the purpose of a board of inquiry is to establish the circumstances of the crash and to learn lessons. A board of inquiry is a statutory process under section 135 of the Air Force Act 1955 and is convened for any air accident. It makes recommendations to the chain of command on its findings; it does not seek to apportion blame. I am placing a copy of the board&#146;s report in the Library, redacted only to withhold personal information that we are required to protect under the Data Protection  Act 1998 and information that could prejudice the security and effectiveness of the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07120463000148">The report is a detailed technical document. I am conscious that, in the time available for an oral statement, I will not be able to do justice to all the issues that it raises, so I am making a supplementary written statement that sets out the board of inquiry&#146;s conclusions in more detail, along with a summary of its recommendations and the actions taken by the chain of command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07120463000149">The board established that on 2 September 2006, RAF Nimrod XV230 took off from its deployed operating base at 09.13 hours, Greenwich mean time, on an essential operational flight. The initial stages of the mission appear to have gone according to plan.  At 11.11 hours, approximately 90 seconds after completing air-to-air refuelling, the crew experienced almost simultaneous fire and smoke warnings. Smoke was observed in the cabin, and flames were observed from the rear of the engines on the starboard side. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft depressurised. The crew commenced emergency drills and at 11.14 hours transmitted a Mayday alert and turned to head for Kandahar airfield. At 11.17 hours, a Harrier GR7 pilot reported that the aircraft had exploded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07120463000150">A combat search and rescue team confirmed that there were no survivors. Subsequently, the site of the crash was secured for as long as it was considered safe to do so by a combined force of Canadian and British units. As quickly as possible, the board of inquiry was convened and travelled from the UK to the operational theatre to begin its investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07120463000151">The board of inquiry has conducted a thorough investigation with the material available to it. Throughout this process the board has been assisted by other independent agencies, including two air accident investigators from the air accidents investigation branch of the Department for Transport. It has been  <br>

unable to identify with absolute certainty the cause of the fire. None the less, the board has deduced the most probable area where the fire started, and the probable causes of the events and factors that led to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07120463000152">The board of inquiry concluded that the crash was not survivable. The cause was a fire that most likely resulted from escaped fuel igniting against a hot pipe in a compartment near the starboard wing-fuselage attachment&#151;the No. 7 tank dry bay, not in the bomb bay as some have previously suggested. The fuel probably gained access to the pipe through a gap between two types of insulation. The fuel most likely came from one of two sources: a pressure-relief device in the main fuel tank, which may have released fuel during air-to-air refuelling, or a leaking fuel coupling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07120463000153">It is clear that the crew of Nimrod XV230 faced a series of complex and demanding emergencies. Throughout this incident they acted in an exemplary manner, calmly performing drills initiated by their captain in an attempt to save their aircraft. All are a credit to their respective services and to their families. I am sure the whole House will join me in honouring their bravery and their professionalism.&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07120463000154">This was a tragic accident, but there were a number of contributory factors that the board has identified. Both fuel and hot air components are present together in the No. 7 tank dry bay. The underestimation of that hazard was considered by the board as a contributory factor. Further possible contributory factors that could not be discounted and which are subject to further investigation include the fuel and hot air systems maintenance policy, the age of some of the component parts, the lack of a fire detection and suppression system within the No. 7 tank dry bay, and the failure to consider the cumulative effects of a number of changes to the air-to-air refuelling capability when it was formally incorporated into the aircraft in 1989.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07120463000155">The board found no evidence that the maintenance or servicing conducted on the aircraft was a cause or contributory factor in the loss of XV230. It also concluded that, while the continued commitment to long-term operations places pressure on the Nimrod force, there was no evidence that this was a cause or factor in the loss of the aircraft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07120463000156">It is clear to me that some of the findings of the board of inquiry identify failings for which the Ministry of Defence must take responsibility. On behalf of the MOD and the Royal Air Force, I would like to say sorry for those failings to the House, but most of all to the families of those who lost their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07120463000157">At the time of the accident, the Department took action to ensure that a similar scenario could not occur again on the Nimrod aircraft. Those measures have been revised as the board&#146;s findings have emerged. The chain of command has accepted the majority of the board&#146;s recommendations and continues to pursue the outstanding recommendations made by the board to enhance the safety of our aircraft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07120463000158">The hot air system remains switched off so that there is no hot pipe against which any fuel could ignite, and we have an enhanced inspection regime to examine for any sign of fuel leakage. QinetiQ has conducted an independent investigation into the fuel system and confirmed that, in light of the measures taken since the  <br>

crash, the fuel system is safe to operate. Air-to-air refuelling has also been suspended subject to further investigation. The Chief of the Air Staff&#146;s professional judgment is that the Nimrod fleet is safe to fly. I have accepted his advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07120463000159">By its nature, the board was not in a position to go into the history of those arrangements or to assess where responsibility lies for failures. I do not underestimate the difficulties that face those responsible for assuring aircraft safety. Flying will never be risk-free. But I do believe that the families of those who died are due more of an explanation of the history than the board of inquiry could be expected to provide. I have therefore decided to put in place a review of the arrangements for assuring the airworthiness and safe operation of the Nimrod aircraft over its service life; to assess where responsibility lies for any failures; to assess more broadly the process for compiling safety cases, taking account of best practice in the civilian and military world; and to make recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07120463000160">I intend that the review should be led by a senior Queen&#146;s counsel assisted by technical experts on aviation systems, who will examine all relevant papers and interview all those in a position to assist. BAE Systems, the aircraft designer, and QinetiQ, which supported the Department in consideration of the safety case findings, have agreed that the review will have their companies&#146; full co-operation. The review will be able to recommend a full public inquiry if that is considered necessary and will keep the families of those who died informed of progress. We will publish the findings of the review, subject to considerations of operational security. I shall make a statement shortly confirming the membership and terms of reference of the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07120463000161">All the families have already received lump-sum payments through the armed forces pension scheme or the armed forces compensation scheme and, where appropriate, ongoing pensions are now in payment. However, we are also in contact with lawyers representing a number of the families over additional claims for common law compensation. I have directed that those claims be assessed and settled as quickly as possible and I have directed that substantial interim payments be made to those families where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07120463000162">I recognise that the board of inquiry report will be painful reading for many, but I hope that the families and friends will take some comfort in finding answers to many of the questions that arise after an incident such as this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07120463000165">The tragedy should bring home to the nation the very real sacrifices being made on its behalf by the men and women of our armed forces, not least in the Royal Air Force, whose fixed-wing and helicopter crews are constantly exposed to danger on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. I also thank the board of inquiry for completing an extremely thorough job in very demanding circumstances. Although it is clear that the board has been unable to establish definitively the cause of the crash, its analysis would seem to be as accurate as it is possible to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07120463000166">Two key issues arise. First, although the age of the aircraft itself may have been ruled out as an issue, the systems failures are clearly a factor of age and maintenance. With on average 40 fire-related incidents a year for the past 20 years and 52 fuel leaks in a six-month period last year, both the Royal Air Force and the manufacturer were acutely aware of the potential hazards arising from the Nimrod&#146;s ageing systems. Secondly, the aircraft should have been replaced by the MRA4 four years ago. It is nothing short of a scandal that the new aircraft will not enter service for at least another four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07120463000167">As the Secretary of State confirmed, the report is detailed. Many detailed technical questions arise, but I shall confine myself to just six. First, why was the recommendation, made by BAE Systems in 2004, to install a hot air leak warning in the location of the hot air ducting rejected following an earlier incident involving another Nimrod? Secondly, is it true that the investigation carried out last year by QinetiQ found that repair teams were using out-of-date manuals and equipment, and that there was</p>
<a name="71204-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07120463000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;considerable loss of expertise and experience as trade specialists have left the team&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07120463000168">If so, is not that an example of the dangerous run-down in Royal Air Force numbers, which are now 1,500 below strength?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07120463000169">Thirdly, since the hot air pipe running past the No. 7 fuel tank was effectively redundant because the requirement for an on-board systems cooling had reduced, why was not it removed or rendered inoperable before now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07120463000170">Fourthly, the board finds that the fuel and hot air systems maintenance policy was a contributory factor to the loss of the aircraft. Why has guidance on ageing aircraft systems, which was recommended in 2006, not been issued?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07120463000171">Fifthly, if all air-to-air refuelling involving Nimrod aircraft is suspended, does not that seriously inhibit the aircraft&#146;s ability to carry out its vital role in Afghanistan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07120463000172">Sixthly, how does the Secretary of State intend to manage with the elderly fleet for the next four years, as fuel leaks continue to increase?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07120463000173">Does this tragic incident reveal the underlying truth: our armed forces are operating at a tempo well in excess of that for which they are resourced? I hope that the Secretary of State can dismiss as wholly untrue today&#146;s press reports that the Prime Minister is looking for a further &#163;15 billion of cuts to the defence budget.</p>

<p><a name="st_o104"><a name="07120463000175"><a name="71204-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="07120463000572"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 First, may I thank the hon. Gentleman, who has an appreciation from his own service of the challenges that the Royal Air Force faces and the risks that are associated with the job that it does? His words will be welcomed by the RAF and especially by the families and communities that support it. They are appropriate words to recognise the scale and nature of the sacrifice that people are prepared to make and the challenges that they are prepared to face. I thank him for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07120463000176">The hon. Gentleman asked about the age of Nimrod, which, as he knows from the detailed briefing that he received, the board of inquiry raises and believes to be, in a limited respect, a contributory factor. The key issue, as I am sure he knows, about an aircraft is whether it is fit to fly. The board of inquiry confirmed that the Nimrod has a very good safety record overall. That is incontrovertible. As I said, the board of inquiry identified age as a contributory factor, but we need to consider that in the context of the whole report. It identified two components, whose condition may have been affected by age. Since the incident, the important thing is that we have removed the hazard by turning off the source of ignition, without which a fire is not possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para28"><a name="07120463000177">I did not recognise the circumstances that informed the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question, but that may be a failing on my part. As with several questions that he poses, I am sure that he accepts that it falls squarely in the remit of the review that I have announced today. Those questions are entitled to an answer. They cannot be answered by the BOI and should be answered by a process of independent investigation, and I have therefore set up the review. The questions will be passed on directly to the principal reviewer when he is appointed. Indeed, any other questions that Opposition Front Benchers identify as needing to be asked should be fed into the process in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para29"><a name="07120463000178">In dealing with the comprehensive questions that the hon. Gentleman posed, let me deny that there is any truth in the story in the media this morning to which he referred. There is no truth in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para30"><a name="07120463000179">On the basis of the BOI report and its conclusions, the three matters that one could have identified as contributory factors as a consequence of resources were considered and specifically said not to be contributory factors to the accident. They were: maintenance&#151;not the system or policy of maintenance, but maintenance itself; servicing the aircraft; and operational pressures, about which the hon. Gentleman made, with all due respect to him, inappropriate observations. Those matters were all considered by the BOI, in an entirely independent fashion, not to have been contributory factors in the accident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para31"><a name="07120463000180">Finally, the hon. Gentleman raises the issue of operational effectiveness in the absence of air-to-air refuelling. That will of course restrict the amount of time for which the Nimrod can fly, but it can fly for nine hours without such refuelling. As he knows, other ISTAR&#151;intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition  <br>

However, 14 months is far too long to wait, especially given that there is to be a further inquiry into this incident. That has not been fair on the families, who wanted earlier answers. Can the Secretary of State assure us that such delays will not be repeated in future?</p>

Is not that a failure of the process rather than individual judgments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="71204-0004.htm_para35"><a name="07120463000185">I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement of a review, which should help to provide some of the answers that the board of inquiry was unable to provide. Fundamentally, however, why are we still relying on an aircraft design that is almost 40 years old, is based on a failed civilian version and was originally intended for hunting Russian subs? Was the in-service date for the new MRA4 delayed because of failures by Ministers to make a decision? Are not the Government forcing the ethos of the armed forces to change from &#147;can do&#148; to &#147;make do&#148;?</p>

It is an important process as it stands in that environment, uninfluenced by Ministers. I am not in a position to give the hon. Gentleman assurances in relation to the length of time that the board of inquiry has taken&#151;about 14 months, as he said. As he will be aware, the commissioning authority reconvened the board when it had reported because there were unanswered questions that it wished to have answered. That is entirely how the process is intended to work. It is self-contained and does not report until it is complete. That is in the control of the board, and so it should remain.</p>

That has been delayed by about seven years. The principal reason for the delay has been technical challenges in the design and production of the MRA4, and we have had to extend the period of service for which we plan to keep the present MR2 fleet in use. I have to say, however, that despite the age of this aircraft, it is still considered to be the premier maritime patrol aircraft in the world.

There is nothing new in the use of ageing aircraft, or the considerable extension of the life of aircraft, but by definition, older aircraft are harder to maintain, and the propensity for accidents to occur becomes greater. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend is in a position to do anything to bring forward the in-service date for the replacement of the Nimrod.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for reinforcing a point that I have now made twice, but which bears repeating. The calendar age of an aircraft is not an indicator of its operational utility, its condition or its remaining service life. The Nimrod is maintained to strict standards and if we did not have confidence in the aircraft, we would not allow it to fly. Moreover, it is common practice in military and civil aviation for what are known as ageing aircraft audits to be carried out to ensure the structural integrity of the airframe of an aircraft. A Nimrod audit was conducted in 1993 and reviewed in 2003. That process takes place every 10 years, and as an additional safety measure, we are extending the scope of the audit to consider the age of the internal components of the aircraft, such as the fuel system, as well as its structure.</p>

 The issues that the right hon. Gentleman raises in relation to fire detection and suppression will of course be part of the review. Given the probable cause of the accident, had the risk from the hot pipe in that void of the aircraft been correctly estimated, it is almost certain that a range of options to reduce the likelihood of a fire would have been considered. The options may have included redesign, to fit a fire suppression system in the dry bay, as it is known, but it is much more likely that action to prevent the risk by removing the potential ignition source would have been taken, and that is exactly what we have done since the loss of the XV230.</p>

 Because of the nature of a board of inquiry, it would have been entirely inappropriate for the families to be engaged in the process in the way that my hon. Friend suggests they could have been. The purpose of the board of inquiry was to identify what had happened and what lessons could be learned from that, in relation to the causes of the accident. I will consider to the issue that she raised in relation to the coroner&#146;s inquest. I am conscious that coroners are independent of Government and that the process of a coroner&#146;s inquest is designed to proceed in a particular way.

I also welcome the review that he initiated in his statement. The inquiry confirmed that the crew did everything that they could in the circumstances to save the aircraft.

Only recently, another Nimrod aircraft suffered a serious fuel leak and it has proved impossible fully to understand why it happened. It is also a cause for concern that the inquiry confirmed the loss of experienced engineering personnel from RAF Kinloss.

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Part of the reason for making this announcement is that, around this terribly tragic incident and in the time it has quite properly taken the BOI to come to its conclusions, there has been a lot of speculation and partial leaks of bits of information into the public domain. I know that some of it has been extremely distressing for the families involved. I am seeking to provide an independent comprehensive process of assurance to the families and others that the questions they want answered can be answered. I believe that that process can answer those questions and I am sure that a number of people will want to contribute to it.

The three possible sources of contributory factors&#151;maintenance, servicing and operational pressures&#151;that could have been created by cost pressures have been discounted by the BOI. I have already said and will not repeat where the failings lie. In my view, those failings are best pursued in terms of investigation through the review that I will set up.

Experience shows that the life of seals varies, and that simply replacing the seals at an arbitrary point may introduce more problems and have a detrimental effect on safety. One recommendation, on the utility of parachute escape on a Nimrod aircraft, is not being pursued as it is not considered feasible. Recommendation 20, to review the design of the No.1 fuel tank, is not being pursued because it has been addressed by the limiting of the amount of fuel in the tank.

Moreover, 94 per cent. of the parts are new, compared with those of the MR2. I understand that the aircraft is now in production. Testing and commissioning processes will then be necessary.

 We know that things are getting really difficult for the Labour party when the House&#146;s ancient historian has to come to its rescue. That is ancient history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07120463000290">The Justice Secretary was the Prime Minister&#146;s campaign manager, so can he tell us what he knew about the attempted donation by Mrs. Kidd on behalf of Mr. Abrahams to the Prime Minister&#146;s leadership campaign? The Justice Secretary was not ignorant of the law; as he often tells us, he took the 1999 Bill through the House so he knows very well what the law required. Will he tell us today what he knew about the Abrahams donation proffered through Mrs. Kidd? What conversations did he have with his fellow campaign manager, Chris Leslie, who having, as he put it, &#147;torn up&#148; the cheque, helpfully passed Mrs. Kidd&#146;s details to the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), now deputy leader of the Labour party? It is to that hospital pass that I turn now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07120463000291">The longer this saga goes on, the more unanswered questions arise. The right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s husband is the treasurer of the Labour party. Her defence is that she took donations only from people her campaign knew personally or who were registered donors to the Labour party, so who at Labour headquarters did her campaign call to check Mrs. Kidd&#146;s identity? How was it that Baroness Jay, on behalf of the Environment Secretary&#146;s campaign, knew that Mrs. Kidd was not the true donor and that it was some kind of proxy donation? If both Peter Watt and Jon Mendelsohn knew&#151;as they admit&#151;that Mrs. Kidd was not a bona fide donor, anyone at Labour headquarters who was equipped to respond to such a check on Mrs. Kidd&#146;s identity must surely have known that she was not the real donor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07120463000292">I turn to the curious incident of the illegal donation&#151;we now know for sure that it was&#151;to the Scottish leadership campaign of Wendy Alexander, or, as we must now call her, the human shield. Here again, there are more and more unanswered questions. There was clearly an illegal donation. Mr. Gordon, who solicited the donation, said he thought it came from a UK company and was therefore permissible. It then emerged that the campaign knew that there was literally a question mark over the donation; it appears in a schedule of donations, with the word &#147;permissible?&#148;&#151;with a question mark&#151;attached to Mr. Green&#146;s name. We read that the schedule apparently originated from Wendy Alexander&#146;s husband&#146;s computer.</p>

Because it turned out that she had written a thank-you letter to Mr. Green, to thank him not for a donation from his company, but for his donation. If that were not enough, the letter seems to have been sent to his home address in Jersey, so it rather gives the game away. It is not for us to speculate about Wendy Alexander&#146;s position, but we note that the message has gone from Downing street for her to stand at her post lest the fallout is even closer to Labour&#146;s high command.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is struggling a bit, as I think the House can appreciate. All those arrangements are registered with the Electoral Commission, which has been through them all and has approved them. There is only one party here that has admitted breaking the law, and that is his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07120463000301">I turn to the discussions that have taken place over the last 18 months under the chairmanship of Sir Hayden Phillips. These followed discussions between Tony Blair and my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) in March and April last year, in the aftermath of the revelations about loans. We have consistently argued for comprehensive reform that would deal finally with the perception that large donors have undue influence on political parties. I have to say that Tony Blair seemed to share that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07120463000302">Dealing with that perception requires, above all, a cap on donations. Everybody now agrees that a cap of &#163;50,000 would accomplish that. But there is an important point here: the cap has to apply to all donations, from whatever source&#151;whether individuals, companies or trade unions. Sadly, it has gradually become clear that Labour simply could not agree to genuine reform. As Tony Blair&#146;s authority ebbed away and as he finally departed the scene, it became clear that Labour is so deeply in hock to the trade unions that it would not be allowed to accept even minimal reform.</p>

It is not straightforward territory and it is important that it is properly understood. Trade union affiliation fees currently funnel &#163;8 million to Labour. We are invited to agree that those fees should escape the cap on donations because, it is claimed, they are individual donations. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I see Labour Members nodding sagely and thoughtfully, but that claim is about as far from the truth as it can be.</p>

More than half vote for parties other than Labour. It beggars belief that those people are cheerfully making a voluntary contribution to a party that they do not even vote for. Indeed, it emerged during our discussions that a Liberal Democrat MP was surprised to find in the post a ballot paper for Labour&#146;s deputy leadership election. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We do not know who that hon. Member voted for. Completely unknowingly, an MP elected for a different political party had become a member of the Labour party as a result of the supposedly voluntary donation. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07120463000310">It does not end there. In most unions, if someone does succeed in opting out of the political levy, they do not even get any money back. Their union subscription remains completely unchanged. The truth is that in most cases&#151;not all&#151;the money given to Labour under the guise of affiliation fees is entirely in the hands of the trade union barons. After all, it is the trade union leaders who decide how many affiliated members they are going to declare. Let us look at the numbers. Unison is one of the unions that does put the right to opt out up front on the application form. More than half its members have exercised that right and decided to opt out. Other unions, such as the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, and the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers, declare that 100 per cent. of their members pay the levy, with no opt-outs whatever.</p>

political levy. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) for his research on the subject. Amicus shows that 109.4 per cent. of its members pay the political levy, and the CWU declares that 104.1 per cent. of its members do; I am sure that that would not have happened in the Health Secretary&#146;s time at that union. That shows what a sham the situation is. We are expected to allow what are plainly block donations by the trade unions to be treated as individual voluntary donations. It is laughable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="71204-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07120463000312">As the discussions drew on, it became increasingly clear that Labour was simply not committed to delivering, or able to deliver, on Tony Blair&#146;s promise of comprehensive reform. We went the last mile in an attempt to secure agreement. Eventually, it emerged that Labour was intransigent, even on the most basic of changes. We suggested that the right to choose whether to pay the levy should appear on the membership application form. We thought that that was completely uncontroversial and would go through on the nod. The law requires a right to opt out; and what could be more simple, straightforward and obvious than putting a little tick-box on the application form, so that one can make that choice when filling it in? We put that proposal forward&#151;uncontroversially, we thought&#151;and the answer was no. The proposal was unceremoniously rejected. There was no argument about it and no explanation of why it was turned down&#151;just a flat, straightforward no. That tawdry story need not be the end of reform. We would rejoin the discussions tomorrow if the Prime Minister showed that he was serious about real reform, but so far he has not done so.</p>

When we came to government in 1997, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, widened the terms of reference of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I point out to Conservative Members that throughout the 1990s we were seeking a full-scale inquiry into party funding in the face of the substantial scandals that were emerging among those on their Benches. A full-scale independent inquiry was consistently refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="71204-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07120463000337">As I said, when we came in, the committee&#146;s terms of reference were widened so that it could conduct a major inquiry on those matters. Under the chairmanship of Lord Neill of Bladen, it reported in October 1998. I worked closely with other parties to achieve broad agreement on its recommendations, and the legislative result was the Political Party, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The 2000 Act was the first comprehensive reform of the regulation of political parties for more than a century, and I am proud that it fell to that Administration to achieve it. On the whole, as subsequent reviews have shown, it has worked well, although not as well as we had hoped. In one key area&#151;that of local spending&#151;it has had unintended consequences.</p>

of these matters and said, &#147;You know, that was a completely innocent mistake. The rules are quite complex in some places and when you are asking, say, every Conservative association to make sure that every donation it gets has got to be properly declared to the Electoral Commission and all the rest of it, you are going to get mistakes.&#148; So there are mistakes by the Conservative party, but, apparently, much more egregious errors by us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="71204-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07120463000356">Sir Hayden published an interim report in October 2006 and a final set of proposals in March 2007, which formed the basis for intensive discussions led by him, with a view to securing detailed, all-party agreement on the way forward. In that, we were helped by an agreed, unanimous report by the Constitutional Affairs Committee in December last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="71204-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07120463000357">Sir Hayden&#146;s report dealt with four sets of issues: the Electoral Commission and the regulatory framework; spending limits; donation limits; and state funding. On the first, there is all-party agreement, backed by the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the recent report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. All agree that the Electoral Commission should have a tighter focus on the regulation of political parties and the conduct of elections, and that it should be more proactive in policing the system overall. Reforms to that end will be included in legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="71204-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07120463000358">The second issue is spending limits. When the original reforms were introduced in 1883, election campaigns were conducted over a relatively short period, and almost exclusively locally. However, huge sums were spent&#151;equivalent to well over &#163;100 million at today&#146;s prices. Those limits worked well so long as campaigning was mainly confined to local constituency campaigns, but with the development of national campaigning from the late 1950s onwards, the old regulatory system became very defective.</p>

We had reservations about the proposals all the way through the negotiations. We wanted an agreement so that that long-term, sustainable reform could be put in place, but from the outset we said that the question of union funding had to be addressed. During the course of the discussions, it transpired that the system of affiliation fees was far more backward, and far more of a racket, than we had realised. In those circumstances, the reforms needed to be more radical than was originally envisaged, although their goal&#151;that is, genuinely individual donations&#151;needed to remain the same.</p>

We asked people to go away and work on those problems: they came back with recommendations and, as a result, the proposals from Sir Hayden Phillips contain ways to deal with egregious abuses of the system.

We must have proposals to deal with transparency and linkage in respect of trade union affiliation fees. We must accept that trade union donations beyond affiliation fees come within the rules on donors. We need real caps on expenditure, which need to be both local and national and both between and during elections. We need to end the abuse that has been growing over recent years, and which I tried to address in previous legislation that the Government did not support, whereby central parties spend large amounts in certain marginal seats on material that does not specifically refer to a candidate and thus falls outside the existing expenditure limits, but which is clear abuse of the spirit of the legislation. We need to give the Electoral Commission real teeth so that it actually becomes an investigating body rather than merely a reactive one.</p>

I include the minority parties, which have an important locus in the matter.

 Yes. Of course, we are sorry. There is a degree of synthetic anger among Opposition Members, but there is not a Member on the Labour Benches who is not rightly angry and annoyed at being so badly let down during recent events. There is no doubt that puts us in a difficult position before the British electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="71204-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07120472000078">People watching in the Gallery and on television are probably dismayed by the tone of parts of the debate, which descended into mutual cat-calling&#151;I may do the same in a moment&#151;but it is worth reminding the House that none the less the public are entitled to expect that we clean up our political act and do so in a non-partisan way that is not seen to be in the interests of any one party or any grouping of parties. That is why, like others, I regret the fact that the Conservative party chose to pull out of the Hayden Phillips process at a late stage, having previously made a public commitment in the Chamber, which we thought at the time was a genuine attempt to be constructive. Sadly, that proved not to be the case because in the end the Conservatives&#146; vested interest outweighed the need to reach a proper conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="71204-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07120472000079">As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) is not a leadership candidate, it will not be to his detriment when I say that I normally have a lot of respect for him. However, I think he dissembled a little on the question of Michael Brown. He said there were two questions to be asked&#151;how and why. How did a rich donor become so rich? In the case of Mr. Brown, that question was not asked. Why was the donation made&#151;what did the donor seek to gain? That question, too, was not properly addressed by the hon. Gentleman today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="71204-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07120472000080">More important, the Liberal Democrats should be considering not simply whether they complied with the spirit of the legislation in accepting the donation&#151;I recognise that it was accepted in good faith&#151;but whether it was legitimate to hold on to it when the money obviously came from crooked sources. They must consider whether their position on the matter is consistent with the cleanness and openness they now propose.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="07120472000081"><a name="71204-0010.htm_spnew43"><a name="07120472000210"><b>Mr. Swire:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Liberal Democrat spokesman might have sounded a little less sanctimonious if his party were committed to pay back other creditors of Mr. Michael Brown from the donation it received rather than waiting for the outcome of a court case?</p>

<p><a name="st_o327"><a name="07120472000082"><a name="71204-0010.htm_spnew44"><a name="07120472000211"><b>Tony Lloyd:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. In fact, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said it would be unreasonable for the money to go back to Mr. Brown. He also said that he had not been approached by any of Mr. Brown&#146;s creditors. Should they come forward, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say that it is right and proper that those who were defrauded will be recompensed from Liberal Democrat sources.</p>

 We have to look at the spirit of the law is. The Labour party is entirely in the wrong place at present and we have no excuses, but I hope that all parties will look at the spirit of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07120472000085">I want to make two points. Today, the Conservatives were questioned about the role of Lord Ashcroft and whether he is a tax exile. They refused to answer those questions and Lord Ashcroft has made it clear that he will not answer them either. That completely contradicts the spirit of clean politics that the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) spoke about earlier. He told my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) that questions about the origins of money from the Midlands Industrial Council had already been answered. That is not true and the right hon. Gentleman either knows it or should know it, because the MIC secretary, David Wall, announced that the names of new MIC donors would not be revealed. He said:</p>
<a name="71204-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07120472000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you&#146;re asking me would we make public announcements when we have a new member then no we wouldn&#146;t.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07120472000086">That is a clear statement, so I invite the right hon. Member for Horsham to confirm that from now on, in the spirit of openness, the Conservative party will make it absolutely clear who funds the MIC and bodies such as Scottish business groups, Focus on Scotland, the Carlton club political committee, Fresh Start and  many others. We know that over the last few years, the Midlands Industrial Council has given some &#163;2.8 million either to the Conservative party directly or to Conservative support organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07120472000090">I want to put a slightly different hat on and talk about the role of the trade unions. The Conservative party would love to turn the debate on to that subject. Let me say this, without any fear of contradiction: the money coming from the trade unions into the Labour party is the most scrutinised money in British politics. The money given to my party and the one or two other parties that benefit from trade union moneys is so regulated that every pound is properly traceable. I say to Opposition Members that not only has that money not at any stage been challenged by the Electoral Commission or the certification officer, but the Neill inquiry said that it was satisfied with the way in which matters were handled. It is important that we  establish that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07120472000093">In this country, we have a democratic trade union movement&#151;one that even Opposition Members should be proud of. Our trade unions are not like the fixed trade unions in other countries. The trade unions have never run away from the idea of modernising their relationship with the Labour party. They are making it quite clear even now&#151;when the leader of my party spoke at the weekend&#151;that the relationship will be modernised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07120472000094">There will be discussions within the ambit of the labour movement on a basis that will make it absolutely clear to trade union members where their money goes. In the end, it is accountability to members, and transparency, that matter. If my party had had that level of transparency with respect to private donors, none of us would be facing the allegations and charges that we face today. In that context, I am very proud of the trade union movement. I am proud of its link with the Labour party&#151;a link that we do not intend to break. It is important that the Labour party continues to maintain links with the trade unions. That is an important part of Labour&#146;s democracy and the democracy of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07120472000095">I make the following challenge to Conservative Members. The trade union movement has always offered to work with the spirit of the times and in the national interest. Will they ask Lord Ashcroft to do the same? Will they ask him to make it clear where his money comes from and whether he is prepared not to treat the Conservative party as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashcroft enterprises&#151;one that he has completely bought? Frankly, that is the only explanation for the Conservative party&#151;under orders from its paymaster&#151;turning away from the Hayden Phillips process.</p>

<p><a name="st_o334"><a name="07120472000096"><a name="71204-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="07120472000218"><b>Mr. Maude:</b>
 Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the amount of money that Lord Ashcroft gives through his companies to the Conservative party is considerably less than that given by either Lord Sainsbury, who after all became a Minister in the Labour Government after being a major donor, or Mr. Mittal? The hon. Gentleman may recollect that there was outstanding a very substantial loan from one of Lord Ashcroft&#146;s companies to the Conservative party, which got repaid in full with interest.</p>

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="07120472000097"><a name="71204-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="07120472000219"><b>Tony Lloyd:</b>
 I would accept an awful lot more from the right hon. Gentleman if he would get Lord Ashcroft to make it quite clear where his money comes from and whether he pays tax on it in this country. That is the real challenge. Is the Tory party prepared to wean itself off the Ashcroft moneys and clean up its own house? In the end, that is the measure that the British public will judge the Conservative party on&#151;not whether we can have an agreement across the different parties on a cleaner political system, but whether that agreement will operate only between the Liberal Democrat party and the Labour party, leaving the Conservative party once again on the sidelines, facing the allegation that it does not want to clean up British politics.</p>

 The answer to the question from the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) is that we certainly will be prepared to wean ourselves off the Ashcroft money if the Labour party is prepared to engage in meaningful trade union reform. Unfortunately, we have not seen that from Labour so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07120472000100">The occasion for this debate is another massive scandal about the way in which Labour has been funding itself over the past 10 years, but the real reason we are here goes much deeper and concerns both parties. We are here because a large proportion of the electorate believes that donations to political parties buy influence, access and honours&#151;and, frankly, the public may be right. That is the canker at the heart of our otherwise largely uncorrupt system. I have never believed that the honours awarded in the 1980s were wholly unrelated to party donations, but since 1997 things have got much worse. It has not just been cash for honours. We have had Ecclestone, Mittal, PowderJect, Enron&#151;the list goes on and on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="07120472000101"><a name="71204-0011.htm_spnew11"><a name="07120472000223"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>

 The Labour party received &#163;36,000 from Enron. The Secretary of State seems to have forgotten about that. I notice that he did not challenge the reference to PowderJect and all the others, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07120472000103">There is only one solution to the problem of large donations: to impose a cap on them. That cap has to be comprehensive and binding on trade unions&#151;which wield enormous influence&#151;companies and individuals, including Michael Ashcroft. The leader of my party, to his great credit, has recognised that and has been prepared to propose bold reforms. The reason we are here today, and the reason we have not got a settlement, is that so far the Labour party has not been prepared to come with us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07120472000104">Under the current Prime Minister, we have not seen any evidence of real commitment to reform. Perhaps I should contrast that with what happened when I was initially involved in the negotiations two years ago. Then, it was quite clear that Tony Blair was prepared to undertake fundamental reform. He knew how dangerous it was for Labour to become too dependent on the unions for cash. That is probably why he got Lord Levy in at the beginning, more than a decade ago, to find some big donors to counterbalance union influence. It may have ended in tears, but it worked for Tony Blair for a time. He always knew that if he had to do without the unions, he could, and the union bosses knew that too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="71204-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07120472000105">It is so sad that we have had no substantive response to the scandal from the current Prime Minister. His statement on Saturday was completely substance-free. It was little more than an effort to deflect attention from what was going on in his party. In some ways, it was worse than that, because he distorted the truth. He alleged that Hayden Phillips had recommended local spending limits when he had done nothing of the sort. </p>

 The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that it is up to each party to decide how to allocate spending locally, within the overall envelope. He also knows that he mentioned only one of a number of proposals made by Hayden Phillips. We want to put those other proposals in the public domain, but the right hon. Gentleman has flatly refused to allow us to publish them. All he has to do is tell Hayden Phillips that he would like to see them in the public domain; then the public could have a wider debate about all the other suggestions that have been put to us by him.</p>

donations. How could they be? Some 55 per cent. of affiliated trade union members do not even vote Labour, never mind want to make a donation to the Labour party. The Labour party really has to make up its mind: either it wants affiliation fees to continue to be treated as a collective donation, in which case they will have to be subject to the &#163;50,000 cap proposed in the negotiations, or they should be treated as individual donations, in which case individuals should be allowed to choose whether they give the money, and to which party. I note that the right hon. Gentleman is not prepared to get to his feet and respond to that point.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not; I have already given way a number of times, and I want to make only one more short set of remarks on what is needed now. First, in the immediate future, it will be difficult to restart talks until Labour&#146;s position is more stable. I am still reflecting on the fact that for a year I have been sitting opposite Labour negotiators, one of whom has admitted systematically breaking the very rules that we were trying to improve in the negotiations. In our talks, that same man supported stronger investigative powers for the Electoral Commission. There are to be inquiries by Lord Whitty and the police, and we need to wait until we know where those inquiries are taking us, and with whom we will be negotiating.</p>

not even vote Labour, never mind decide to donate to it. That is morally unacceptable, and it has to stop. The current treatment of affiliation fees is a legacy from a bygone era. In the 21st century we should have gone beyond the age of corporatism and collectivism. We Conservative Members want to work with Labour to clean up that tawdry area of politics, but to do so, we need a counter-party. If Labour comes forward with serious proposals to give genuine individual choice to millions of affiliated members, the talks can resume immediately. I very much hope that after reflection, the Prime Minister will deliver what is required to get the talks going again.</p>

 We have been asked to shorten our contributions. It will not come as a surprise to anyone in the House to hear that the debate has not helped us to advance towards a solution on party funding. No one expected that it would; Opposition day motions do not normally lead to a calm atmosphere. We are in the same position that we were in previously.</p>

It is simply impossible to believe that a person who bankrolls Tory candidates in marginal constituencies does not even pay tax in the United Kingdom. They will not say so in this debate, but privately a number of Conservative Members must have at least some reservations about the role that Lord Ashcroft plays, even more so if he does not pay income tax in the United Kingdom. As for the Liberal Democrats, it would have been far better for their party&#146;s integrity if the &#163;2.5 million had been returned, somehow or other. I was not altogether impressed by the excuse that was given.</p>

It should not be forgotten that the Committee on Standards in Public Life only came about as a result of the media&#146;s exposure of what was going on in those days. Of course I accept that only a small minority of Conservative MPs was responsible, but their actions undoubtedly brought Parliament into disrepute. When the Committee was set up&#151;it was known of course as the Nolan Committee, after its first chairman&#151;John Major was clear that it would not be able to look into party funding; that was excluded. The present Government are to be congratulated on removing the bar on the Committee looking into party funding. Legislation was introduced and other reforms were carried out. Those reforms were absolutely essential, and many of us campaigned for them when we were in opposition.</p>

It is interesting that in eight of those 10 companies, every company executive or chair received some kind of reward: in the case of United Biscuits, that was one peerage and one knighthood; in the case of Hanson, two peerages; Taylor Woodrow, one peerage and one knighthood; P&amp;O&#151;we know about P&amp;O, do we not?&#151;one peerage and three knighthoods, and Glaxo, two knighthoods.

Senior members of Plaid Cymru received election ballots on the Labour party deputy leadership campaign. They never ticked the box relating to the affiliated political fund, yet they were counted as funders of the Labour party. That is because, unfortunately, it appears that a small number of individuals within trade unions abuse the system. Unless we get clarity on that, we will not have a level playing field on party funding. Let us all get behind a proper party funding Bill that will finally take out of British politics that kind of sleaze, which ultimately undermines all politics for all political parties.</p>

 The Labour party funding scandals appear to be rolling out on an almost daily basis, with varying degrees of subterfuge and criminality involved.

The motion deals with the crafty rise in state funding for political ends organised by Labour, whether through Government special advisers and communications officers in Whitehall or the communications allowance in Parliament. The attempts by some hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), the hon. Members for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), for Manchester, Central and for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), to argue that all parties are as bad as each other was pathetic in the context of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07120492000036">The Labour party&#146;s fascination with Lord Ashcroft&#146;s input as deputy chairman of the Conservative party is bizarre. As Lord Ashcroft recently noted, the candidates fund, which he chairs but does not control, mainly comes from donors other than him.

 When we talk about modernising unions, the reaction in previous debates has been that the Conservatives did that 30 years ago and that the matter does not need further consideration. That was the extent of the Government&#146;s bias.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07120492000049">Under huge pressure, last weekend the Prime Minister at last conceded the connection between the political contribution that a union member makes as an individual and that money ending up in the Labour party&#146;s coffers. For those who think that that is stating the obvious, it is not. Indeed, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham pointed out, some unions have made larger contributions than can be attributed to their political fund contributing members. If we also consider that some unions affiliate at regional and local level, and that other help, such as manpower, which the Lord Chancellor described as completely transparent, is unrecorded, existing transparency and reporting are nothing more than a joke. If the Prime Minister thinks that his paltry weekend rehash of existing proposals will be perceived as anything other than a smokescreen for his party&#146;s huge complacency and failings, he should think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07120492000050">The Prime Minister is unwilling to follow through the logic of accepting the individual position over the collective position of union members. The so-called openness of Labour and unions to changing their relationship, which the hon. Member for Manchester, Central described, is not the historic position. However, I hope that it is the position now. Yes, the Prime Minister said that the 30-year-old opt-out rights for union political contributions should now be clearly stated to members, but they have certainly not been to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07120492000051">Why, in this day and age, should an individual be assumed to want to contribute to a political party for which he probably did not vote? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham explained, we need to keep in mind the fact that most trade unionists are not Labour voters. The 2005 British election survey revealed that 54.3 per cent. of trade unionists voted for parties other than Labour. That is why there should be a specific opt-in to making political fund contributions. I opt in to paying my membership of the Conservative party, and so should someone who pays money to the Labour party. Union members who opt in to paying into the political fund should also, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds noted, have the right to decide to which political cause their money goes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07120492000052">The regulatory framework for unions, through the certification officer, is clearly in dire need of modernisation.

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07120492000053">The Lord Chancellor appeared to be desperate to move on with funding talks, but flip-flopped about including unions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester spotted. We need to change the law and set funding limits but we also need to update the modernisation of unions. That clear message comes out of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07120492000054">We still have a problem that will not go away. No matter how many laws are passed, legislation is no substitute for integrity. We currently have laws that require timely disclosure of donations, which Labour has broken. We also have laws that require people to declare their indirect donations, which Labour has again broken. We could introduce more laws, and then Labour could flout them, too. If the Liberal Democrats or anyone else think that using state funding will improve the ethics of party funding, they should think again. Nothing shows that to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07120492000055">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said, the Conservative party has a problem. We could discuss new funding proposals with Labour and the Liberal Democrats for ever and a day, but are the Government capable of abiding by whatever rules we finally agree? Can Labour be trusted to deal with us fairly on funding? The great questions here, as matters stand, are: can Labour be trusted to deal with us fairly on funding and, more important, can it be trusted by the British people?</p>

If we are to command high levels of public support, funding arrangements must be fair and transparent. We have gone a considerable way to introducing transparency. With all-party support, we sought to tackle the problem of excessive spending through the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which reflected the key recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Patrick Neill. It is worth reminding the House of what that Act did. It introduced a national limit on campaign expenditure, created the Electoral Commission, made the funding system more transparent, required all donations above &#163;5,000 nationally and &#163;1,000 locally to be made public, and outlawed foreign donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07120492000064">It is clear that we now need to move beyond the recent specific issues and consider the basis of the funding of our parties for the future. In the Queen&#146;s Speech, we said that we would bring forward proposals to reform party finance and expenditure, and we intend to develop a comprehensive package of reforms building on the principles established by Sir Hayden Phillips&#146;s inter-party review, which reported in October. That review, which was supported at the time of his March report by the official Opposition as well as by the Liberal Democrats, identifies important principles that should underpin the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07120492000065">In particular, Sir Hayden identified the key flaw in the system as the political spending arms race, whereby expenditure has spiralled upwards even as party membership has declined. I understand that the official Opposition want to deny that that arms race exists but, given that the money spent between the two main parties in the 12 months before the last general election rose to &#163;90 million, which was nearly 40 per cent. up on the &#163;65 million spent during a similar period in 2000-01, that is clearly what we have before us. Sir Hayden said that the 2000 Act</p>

 Will the hon. Lady acknowledge that Hayden Phillips produced a comprehensive paper showing conclusively that, since 1992, expenditure on general elections by the political parties has increased by less than incomes and only fractionally more than  <br>

zero in real terms? Will she now agree to do what her colleague studiously refused to do, which is to allow these documents to be put into the public domain so that we can end the position whereby we debate on the basis of speculation rather than fact?</p>

<p><a name="st_o389"><a name="07120492000067"><a name="71204-0013.htm_spnew12"><a name="07120492001145"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 I am afraid that I have to say to the hon. Gentleman, whose constituency association receives funding of some &#163;3,000 from the Churchill Luncheon Club, that his analysis of Sir Hayden&#146;s report as regards the increase in expenditure is plain wrong. In fact, Sir Hayden shows that support for the principle of continuous spending limits at a national level is crucial. The importance of effective spending limits cannot be overstated. The Constitutional Affairs Committee observed that the United States is a constructive example of the way in which we would not want this country to go if spending were left unchecked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07120492000068">We heard many comments about trade unions and donation caps. Sir Hayden acknowledged the distinction between affiliation fees paid to political parties by trade unions, which are in effect an aggregation of individual donations, and the other donations that are paid to parties from trade unions. He recommended that the process for treating political levy donations individually should be more transparent and traceable. We accept that, and we are committed to bringing greater transparency to political donations, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said only yesterday. Other donations from trade unions would be subject to any cap on donations, treating the trade unions in the same way as other major donors to political parties. Both the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Sir Hayden&#146;s review said that limiting donations to political parties from private sources would require an increase in financial support from public funds. As my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor said, we are yet to be convinced that there is public acceptance of an extension of state funding, but we will continue to consider and consult on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o390"><a name="07120492000069"><a name="71204-0013.htm_spnew13"><a name="07120492001146"><b>Mr. Simon:</b>
 The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) was so pious about party funding by the state, but will his party offer to give back the &#163;35 million of taxpayers&#146; money that it has been spending on political spending in the past decade?</p>

<p><a name="st_o391"><a name="07120492000070"><a name="71204-0013.htm_spnew14"><a name="07120492001147"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 Of course, it is not for me to answer for the official Opposition, but if my hon. Friend is referring to the fact that this Government have increased the money that is given to the Opposition parties, particularly the &#163;4.4 million that the Conservatives now get from Short money, that is worth reflecting on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07120492000074">I hope that the official Opposition will reflect on the views that were expressed by the shadow Leader of the House in March this year:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="71204-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07120492000075">I hope that the Leader of the Opposition is not going down the road advocated by the recent treasurer of the Conservative party, Lord McAlpine, who said in his autobiography, &#147;Once a Jolly Bagman&#148;:</p>

</ul><a name="07120492001097">
<p>If that is the level of debate from the Conservatives, I suspect that we will not get very far in all-party consensus, but nor will we allow them to stop us and other parties moving forward and making party political funding transparent, clear and easy to follow.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="71204-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07120499000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House deplores the performance of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; regrets that it has been responsible for huge and avoidable costs to farmers and taxpayers; notes with concern the significant cost overruns in the Department&#146;s programme and administration budgets; and believes that planned budget cuts of &#163;270 million will further undermine efforts to deliver policies which tackle climate change, promote the farming industry and enhance the natural environment.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="71204-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07120499000004">Recent weeks have witnessed a series of events that have raised fundamental questions about the competence of the present Government&#151;the handling of the Northern Rock crisis, the loss by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs of the personal details of millions of families, and now allegations of illegal fundraising. All those seem to be stark evidence that Labour has lost the plot. As anyone who has had half an eye open to issues affecting rural areas, farming and the environment will tell you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, one Government Department has for several years jostled with the Home Office for the honour of setting the pace in the incompetence stakes. The fact that others are catching up is no reason to let the present Secretary of State off the hook.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="71204-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07120499000005">Throughout its relatively short and undistinguished life, the performance of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been, frankly, abysmal. In fact, the list of DEFRA failures is so extensive that this could end up being a very long speech. However, I am aware that a large number of hon. Members wish to contribute, so I will restrain myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="71204-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07120499000006">DEFRA was cobbled together following the terrible mismanagement of the foot and mouth crisis in 2001. It was rumoured at the time that, as well as the political necessity of culling the old Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, one of the reasons for setting up the new Department was to give the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett) a job that met her aspirations. Almost immediately, it acquired two alternative nicknames&#151;&#147;Deafear&#148; and &#147;Deathrow&#148;, both of which turned out to be strangely appropriate!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="71204-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07120499000007">Since its early days, beset by a catalogue of failures, the Department has lurched from one crisis to the next. At the heart of our agricultural industry and as custodians of our landscape, farmers should feel that DEFRA is fighting their corner, not letting them down. The Department&#146;s initial response to a growing awareness that something was wrong with the Rural Payments Agency was characteristic: it denied that there was a problem at all. I say it was characteristic because this is a Department that lives in a permanent state of denial about its own inadequacies.</p>

In the aftermath of the summer floods, serious questions remain.

We could take the view, &#147;Well, let&#146;s put it off until later.&#148; Iain Anderson recommended in 2001 that we should go down this road, and it is my experience based on having dealt with these outbreaks that has turned cost and responsibility from a policy issue that was on a long list of things that I had to deal with when I arrived in this job in June to something I can now see needs to change. I think the farming industry ought to play a much bigger role in deciding what controls are put in place and how they are dealt with, as ultimately it is the farming industry that has the greatest incentive to get those decisions right. Governments of whatever party do not always know what is best, and I want to restart the conversations we have already been having about how we can design a better system for the future in which responsibility for decision making is shared, which is what the farming community wants. In the process, discussion must also take place about how the cost will be shared.</p>

There are wider policy implications to the culling of badgers. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I hope that the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) will let me answer the question.

In Malton in North Yorkshire, defences completed in 2003 prevented 300 properties from being flooded. On 9 November, we faced the biggest tidal surge to come down the east coast since the great storm of 1953, which claimed more than 300 lives in the UK and, I believe, about 2,000 lives in Holland. The flood defences, in combination with the way in which the surge and the high tides did not precisely coincide, helped to save thousands of homes, particularly in Great Yarmouth. As a result of the contingency plans that had been put in place, we ensured that people were warned in advance, that rest centres were set up and that Members of the House were kept informed. I think that the House will recognise that those who could have been affected gave genuine praise for the efficiency and effectiveness of our operation, which once again showed the benefits of the planning that we have put in place. May I also say that because of this summer&#146;s exceptional rainfall many homes did flood, and Sir Michael Pitt is looking at the lessons that we could learn?</p>

In any one year in any one region, big schemes will be in the process of being completed and there will large spending. Such schemes will come to an end, and there will inevitably be an ebb and flow in the expenditure pattern region by region. What really matters is whether the Environment Agency has more resources. It will receive an increase&#151;some of it will go to local authorities&#151;in flood defence spending from &#163;600 million to &#163;800 million in 2010-11, precisely because we have recognised the need for that greater investment. It will mean that the Environment Agency has more money to spend on flood defence and it is also why we have tightened the planning policy guidance and given the Environment Agency the right to be consulted about planning applications.</p>

 On the first point, we have just heard two contributions that offer a different view on which way the money is going. The fact is that there needs to be a system for prioritising flood defence investment. Rightly and properly we have given that responsibility to the Environment Agency. It has a system for scoring and assessing potential schemes. The best thing that we can do to assist it in that process is to ensure that it has more money to spend on flood defence, which is exactly what we have done over the past 10 years and what we will do over the next two years. Decisions about where the Environment Agency puts its head offices are a matter for the agency itself.</p>

 The answer has to be no, because the 1967 virus was not present in the country. We only put contingency plans in place to vaccinate should it prove necessary once the outbreak was confirmed.

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="71204-0016.htm_para17"><a name="071204101000005">The overall budget for flood defence is therefore critical, as it is what will prevent insurance premiums from spiralling and house prices from dropping. Indeed, it will prevent some new homes from being potentially uninsurable or even unsaleable. In Cheltenham, we already have a brand new flood defence scheme worth &#163;23 million. June and July might have been much worse without it, but the Environment Agency staff who visited several sites in Cheltenham with me freely admit that more work needs to be done. What of the existing backlog of flood defence schemes? Will the Minister say how long it will take the Environment Agency to clear it, at the current rate of progress? The rumour is that it will take 10 years, which is a very worrying prospect. How many schemes have been put back by the Government&#146;s decision last year to cut flood defence spending by &#163;14 million?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has pointed out that a lot of work remains to be done. Does he believe that all the money for flood defences must come from taxation, or should we find another source?</p>

 I believe that it would add insult to injury if all the money came from water bills, and I should be very concerned about that. I hope that the funds will come from the reprioritisation of broader Government spending. Perhaps we could save money in other sectors of government if we invaded fewer countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="71204-0016.htm_para18"><a name="071204101000008">The Association of British Insurers has been pretty clear about what needs to be done. As well as backing the Liberal Democrat policy that we should clear up the tangle of responsibilities surrounding flood prevention, it has backed our call to increase spending faster. In October, it said:</p>

It does not begin to address the major issues, including drainage, which were highlighted this summer. The Government will have to increase spending substantially, as needs are identified by the Pitt review team...the Government has completely failed to grasp the importance of improving Britain&#146;s flood defences in the wake of the devastating floods across the UK.&#148;</p>

The overspend on flooding this year, along with unexpected spending on foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and avian flu, is going to mean budget cuts elsewhere in DEFRA. The Brown doctrine on departmental funds appears to be that a Department that gets hit by an unexpected overspend cannot expect money to be transferred from elsewhere in government.</p>

Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), who characterised the approach as one of pure financial mismanagement. The Prime Minister&#146;s callous approach brought the NHS into crisis last year, and now it seems to be DEFRA&#146;s turn. Estimates of the amount likely to be cut from other programmes range up to &#163;300 million, as we have already heard. Will the Minister share with us where those cuts are likely to be  <br>

Will Natural England&#146;s vital conservation work be reduced? It is already being asked by the Government to repay the &#163;16 million spent on setting up the new agency structure, which was decided by the Government. Will the Minister at least confirm that the Environment Agency&#146;s &#163;51 million budget for new conservation work will be protected, or will the axe fall on recycling and action against waste?</p>

That alone has eliminated 300,000 tonnes of hazardous waste, prevented the use of 5 million tonnes of virgin material and saved 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. Perhaps the Minister will make it clear that their budgets are all safe.</p>

Or perhaps, and most astonishingly of all, is it animal disease control that will suffer? I find it quite breathtaking that DEFRA has requested local authorities to return funds for animal disease control&#151;even in Surrey, where councils have been hit by both avian flu and bluetongue. I was surprised that the hon. Member for East Surrey did not find time to mention that. Devon county council has said that the cuts mean five of its eight posts may have to go as a result, and that</p>

Surely our farming industry has suffered enough, not just from the disease outbreaks themselves but from DEFRA&#146;s performance in the regulation and monitoring of the Pirbright laboratory and, most of all, the fiasco of single farm payments. I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) that 25 per cent. of Welsh farmers still have not received their payments.

After all, DEFRA is bringing forward the Climate Change Bill, which will put carbon emission reductions on the statute book, following the Stern report and Friends of the Earth&#146;s very effective &#147;Big Ask&#148; campaign.

Speaking to the Royal Economic Society last Friday, Sir Nicholas said:</p>
<a name="71204-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="071204101000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For a 50 per cent. reduction in global emissions by 2050, the world average per capita must drop from 7 tonnes to 2-3 tonnes. An 80 per cent. target for rich countries would bring equality of only the flow of emissions around the 2-3 tonnes per capita level. In fact, they will have consumed the big majority of the &#145;available space in the atmosphere&#146;.&#148;</p>

 If the hon.

In the Environmental Audit Committee this morning, we heard from Friends of the Earth and WWF that the economic cost of carbon emissions&#151;the future cost of climate change&#151;being used by the Government is dramatically lower than Sir Nicholas Stern recommended. He cites a figure for the social cost of carbon in 2000 of $85 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. Using DEFRA&#146;s exchange rate, Friends of the Earth calculated that that equates to &#163;53 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, but DEFRA has introduced a new concept&#151;the shadow cost of carbon&#151;and puts the 2000 value of that at only &#163;19, which is nearly three times lower.</p>

Nicholas Stern&#146;s figure, they would have put the cost at more than &#163;13 billion. That would have stopped in its tracks the proposal for a third runway at Heathrow, but by miscalculating the future economic cost of climate change DEFRA has changed the outcome of the Heathrow runway consultation. Although carbon emissions are rising year on year&#151;and have risen since the Government came to power&#151;the Government have given the green light to one of the very projects that will stop them meeting their own targets. The cost to the environment and, as Sir Nicholas Stern pointed out, to the economy will be truly dreadful.</p>

Why else would the Chancellor, too, take a significant step away from Stern? Again I give due credit to Friends of the Earth&#146;s brilliant economist Simon Bullock for spotting that. The Chancellor&#146;s October document, entitled&#151;without a hint of irony&#151;&#147;Implementing Stern&#148; says that the basis of the carbon price is</p>

 I was disappointed by the speech of the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth). It seemed rather a bogus attack on DEFRA. Of course, the Rural Payments Agency situation needs to be highlighted, although there are good reasons for it. The Select Committee report made a fair assessment of the background.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para12"><a name="071204101000032">I am one of the few Members to have served in both the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and DEFRA&#151;in fact, I may be the only one&#151;so I can tell the hon. Gentleman that DEFRA is a huge improvement on the MAFF structure. MAFF was a 1960s Department; it suffered from low status and low morale, and made the most appalling mistakes, especially over Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) rightly said, had consequences for human lives, let alone the costs of the debacle. That situation arose partly because the then Conservative Government were far too dominated by producer interests rather than by the wider needs of society. They did not recognise that a balance was needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para13"><a name="071204101000033">The hon. Member for East Surrey criticised the handling of the 2001 outbreak, but I remember the Opposition congratulating the then Minister for Agriculture on his handling of the early stages of the outbreak. At that time nobody knew the scale of the outbreak; during the days before the disease was reported, it was being spread all over the country by the illegal and legal transport of animals. No country had ever found itself in that situation. The fact that that outbreak was contained and eradicated is a tremendous achievement for all concerned. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that, when playing political games, the hon. Gentleman should be careful not to trash the reputation of hard-working civil servants who showed the most incredible dedication when bringing that outbreak under control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para14"><a name="071204101000034">I also echo what was said about the 2005 Conservative party manifesto. I remember debating the matter on platforms with Conservative and Liberal Democrat spokespeople. The 2005 manifesto commitments to cuts in public expenditure would have devastated the then English Nature budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para15"><a name="071204101000035">I was surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on waste. He seems to have forgotten that in 1997 the recycling rate was about 6 or 7 per cent. That has now risen to about 25 per cent. The amount of waste going to landfill has dropped, which is a considerable achievement compared with where we were 10 years ago. My local authority of North Lincolnshire has a recycling rate of 40 per cent. and is confident that it can hit rates of 50 per cent. It deserves a great many congratulations on what it has done. That has been brought about only because of support and grants from DEFRA, which is dedicated to reducing waste in this country. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para16"><a name="071204101000036">I want to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). I welcomed the Green Alliance report. Like most people, I think that there were one or two areas where the Green Alliance could have been a bit more generous, particularly in relation to the Government&#146;s record on biodiversity. Nevertheless, it was a fair assessment. The hon. Member for East Surrey should note that it gave the Government a great deal of praise for the international lead that they have given on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para17"><a name="071204101000037">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State spelled out the areas in which this country has pioneered climate change policies. Not only that, but the expertise of DEFRA officials and scientists has been used in developing schemes all over the world and particularly in Europe. The software for the emissions trading registration scheme was developed in DEFRA and has been applied by, I think, the majority of European countries. I think DEFRA gets some income from that software development, and it deserves credit for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para18"><a name="071204101000038">Of course there are always areas that can be improved. However, I have experienced the limitations of MAFF, and seen how DEFRA has been given a much higher status and has attracted a wide range of new people, who have come to work there because they support the concept of DEFRA. Moving to a Department that has land use policy strategies for water, air and land was the right decision. If my memory is correct, at the time the Conservatives supported, rather than criticised, the approach of having a more powerful environment Ministry to deal with all the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para19"><a name="071204101000039">I want to make five quick points to my right and hon. Friends on the Front Bench, for whom I have great deal of respect and who have done extremely well, particularly in handling the recent outbreaks. DEFRA has received a great deal of praise for the way in which it handled the bird flu and bluetongue outbreaks, and the recent foot and mouth outbreaks. It is using updated modern contingency plans. It faced a situation in which foot and mouth was not spread all over the country by a rogue farmer and the kind of movements that took place previously. The hon. Member for East Surrey should recognise that the situations are different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para20"><a name="071204101000040">I said I would make five quick points. The first is EU funding. If we are to recognise that climate change is the biggest environmental threat that we face this century&#151;perhaps the biggest threat that we have ever faced&#151;there are important matters to consider. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been arguing for shifting agricultural spending towards the rural development regulation. That is the right thing to do, but we need to go further. We need to harness the EU to combat climate change. An awful lot of spending in the EU could be used much more productively. However, that is a matter for a wider debate; I just wanted to draw the point to my right hon. Friend&#146;s attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para21"><a name="071204101000041">Secondly, the Planning Bill will shortly go through Parliament. I know that my right hon.

No one wants a better way of dealing with renewable energy and waste infrastructure more than I do, but there are issues to do with protecting biodiversity. It is important that biodiversity  <br>

is not pushed to one side in the debate as a nuisance. My right hon. Friend&#146;s voice is important in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para22"><a name="071204101000042">Thirdly, on bovine tuberculosis, I ask my colleagues please to follow the science. We want decisions to be science-based. The arguments are incredibly complicated, and it is wrong for anybody to think that there are simple solutions to the problem. There has been a tendency to try to rubbish the Bourne report, which was carried out with great thoroughness. It is a very respectable scientific study. I ask Ministers please to make sure that we take a science-based approach, not one based on anecdotes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para23"><a name="071204101000043">My fourth point, which has already been mentioned, concerns shared responsibility. It is hard to justify any industry that expects free insurance, paid for by the taxpayer. There has to be shared responsibility. Indeed, I would go further and say that it should be linked to biosecurity and how it is applied. For example, in the recent Bernard Matthews outbreak there were clear breaches of biosecurity. There is a strong suspicion that the outbreak was spread from operations in Hungary by movements within the factory. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money was paid in compensation. There has to be a better scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para24"><a name="071204101000044">My last point is small but important. Through the Animal Welfare Bill, the Government made a huge contribution to improving conditions for animals. I know that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are looking at the welfare codes at the moment; that is a real opportunity for giving clear guidance on improving the welfare of animals in our country. There are some difficult issues, such as that of performing animals in circuses, but I ask my colleagues not to go back on the assurances that former DEFRA Ministers gave the House; that is very important. I ask my colleagues to work closely with such groups as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which have been strong supporters of what the Government have done, and which want to work with them to make the codes effective.</p>

There have been so many examples of incompetence and there has been such a waste of public money, that the only honest statement to make at the Dispatch Box is the one that a colleague of his had the courage to make at the Home Office some time ago&#151;that is, to admit that the Department is not fit for purpose.</p>

chose the most complex method of common agricultural policy reform&#151;the so-called dynamic hybrid&#151;it set itself up for a fall. Administrative errors in handing out the single farm payments have cost the taxpayer &#163;348 million, and many farmers in my constituency still do not have all the money to which they are entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para26"><a name="071204101000047">Perhaps more shocking than the destabilisation of the farming industry through the incompetent handling of the single farm payments was the revelation that DEFRA had rocked the industry further with the return of foot and mouth. The source of the outbreak was identified as the site of a Government-sponsored animal disease laboratory at Pirbright. Those errors on the part of DEFRA have swallowed its budget, cost the taxpayer enormous amounts of money, and caused undue and unnecessary harm to farmers and people living in rural communities. Additional Treasury pressures to cut expenditure will simply exacerbate DEFRA&#146;s inability to deliver its remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para27"><a name="071204101000048">The primary reason for the creation of DEFRA, we were told, was to bring interrelated areas of farming, food, environment and flood protection closer together under the one umbrella&#151;in other words, to facilitate joined-up government. Unfortunately, that is far from the reality. So dislocated appear to be the internal parts of DEFRA that disjointed and incompetent management and administration are the norm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para28"><a name="071204101000049">Let me give the House three examples from my constituency that have happened in the past few weeks. The first case is that of Mr. Frank Harris, a beef farmer from Leverington common. On 30 October, Mr. Harris rang my office to say that he had 21 suckler cows in calf on the Whittlesey washes on the Nene river. We had telephone contact the same day from other farmers who confirmed that there were a further 200 suckler cows on the same washlands. The Whittlesey washes, like the Ouse washes further south, are a vital reservoir for excess water in the wetter winter months and, as such, play an integral and crucial part in the fens flood protection apparatus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para29"><a name="071204101000050">The washes were then placed in a bluetongue control area, with every likelihood that they would soon be flooded. Knowing that the land would be flooded, Mr. Harris asked whether we could intervene on his behalf and asked for his cattle to be blood tested so that they could be moved into a protection zone on his farm about 3 miles away, but outside the zone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para30"><a name="071204101000051">The same day we wrote on Mr. Harris&#146;s behalf to Lord Rooker&#146;s office asking for an exception or relaxation to be made on the grounds of animal welfare. We left messages at Lord Rooker&#146;s office again on 6 November. A week later on 12 November, we spoke to an official who said that he would chase the matter up, but we have never, to this day, received a response or even an acknowledgement from DEFRA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="71204-0017.htm_para31"><a name="071204101000052">Mr. Harris has repeatedly tried to obtain permission from the State Veterinary Service in Bury St. Edmunds to move his cattle, but to no avail. Since our inquiries, the land has flooded and some of the cattle, we are informed, have given birth. As far as DEFRA is concerned, there are 21 drowning cattle and their newborn calves.</p>

export more than 600 chicks to Jersey, which was happy to accept imports as long as the chicks had been reared outside avian flu designated areas. Mr. Wiggington applied for his licence at the Bury St. Edmunds DEFRA office. However, it took seven days for the information from the Jersey authorities to go from the DEFRA office in Page street to the Bury St. Edmunds office via, it seems, the Lincoln office. Despite repeated calls from both Mr. Wiggington and his potential customers, nothing seemed to be moving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para1"><a name="071204101000054">My office phoned and e-mailed DEFRA in Lincoln and within an hour that office had instructed the Bury St. Edmunds office that the licence would be signed. By this time, it was only a day before the chicks were scheduled to be shipped, so Mr. Wiggington had to take the morning off to drive to Bury St. Edmunds to collect the original licence in person, because DEFRA said that a photo or faxed copy was not acceptable for an export licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para2"><a name="071204101000055">Had the paperwork not been cleared at the last minute, despite it being in the system for a week, Mr. Wiggington would have had to destroy a second batch of chicks in a month. He has also reported to me losses of more than &#163;1,000 in value as a result of DEFRA mismanagement and poor administration in the past year. This includes an incident where DEFRA put a stamp on a letter that enclosed licences, instead of franking it. That meant that the letter did not arrive, and as the birds could not be shipped, they had to be destroyed. The next week Mr. Wiggington had to go and collect the documents himself from the post office and pay for the postage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para3"><a name="071204101000056">Because of poor instructions from DEFRA, Mr. Wiggington is still waiting for &#163;2,500 worth of grant aid for going organic. He followed the instructions to the letter, only to be told subsequently that his application was unacceptable. Now he has been told that he will have to wait a minimum of six months for the payment as a result of an error that originated with DEFRA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para4"><a name="071204101000057">My final example involves Mr. Charles Horrell who farms at Pode Hole farm at Thorney near Peterborough. He runs a pedigree cattle and sheep farm. When he was placed in the bluetongue control zone around Peterborough, those pedigree cattle and sheep, which he would normally have sold for breeding for &#163;50,000 in total, would have had to go to slaughter in a poor market situation and would have been worth only about &#163;10,000. We phoned DEFRA on his behalf and asked what Mr. Horrell&#146;s options were, now that he was in the control zone. However, nobody at the DEFRA office knew, so we wrote to Lord Rooker. Finally, we got a response from him simply saying:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para5"><a name="071204101000058">So we followed that up and phoned farming organisations, including the National Farmers Union, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group and the Meat and Livestock Commission. Not one had any advice for farmers on creating contingency plans or new business strategies to counter the onset of disease. It appears that not only has DEFRA offloaded on to unions, charities and advisory groups the problems of  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para6"><a name="071204101000059">Another natural hazard that has tested DEFRA in the past year is flooding. As the effects of global warming take hold on the environment and flood risk from tidal surges, higher sea levels and greater storms grows, DEFRA has abrogated its responsibility for flood protection by offloading those problems on to the Environment Agency. The increase in the money going towards flood protection seems to be a positive step, but it coincides with the addition of the expensive burden of coastal flooding to the Environment Agency&#146;s responsibilities. Those involved in flood protection in the fens have told me that they are concerned that the agency will be tempted to divert some of the extra funds to its own priorities&#151;which, of course, include coastal flood prevention. If that is the case, the increase will not translate into extra security for people in Sheffield, Gloucester or Tewkesbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para7"><a name="071204101000060">The culture of DEFRA has changed since the old MAFF days&#151;certainly as far as agriculture is concerned. The Department&#146;s job was to support the farming industry and the rural community, but it has become one that seems to care little about rural issues and the rural economy and just wants to control and regulate that economy out of existence. Food prices are already increasing at a frightening rate. Do not look to the supermarkets to come to our aid; they are already paring farm-gate prices to the bone. It is time that the Government returned to their age-old primary responsibility of ensuring the security of our food supplies.</p>

Environmental protection bodies form a rapidly growing sector to which people are giving their time, energy and commitment.

That critical planning measure is vital to ensure that species and habitat information is collected and collated. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 was introduced to protect, conserve and enhance the country&#146;s landscapes and support rural communities.

They are only doing their master&#146;s bidding. The actual fiasco of the Rural Payments Agency was nothing to do with DEFRA officials; it went straight to the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor, who decided, contrary to the advice of the European Union, most farming unions and others in this country, to opt for a system that mixed historic and land-based elements.

 Well, for a start, as well as the system bringing in sections such as horticulture that had not been covered previously, which could have been anticipated, no one realised that all of a sudden, nearly 50,000 other so-called farmers would come on the scene who had never even registered for the integrated administration and control scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para24"><a name="071204101000087">People who had bought farmhouses when farms were broken up had five, six or 10 acres of land, and they thought, &#147;Hey, this&#146;ll be rather good. We&#146;ll claim some single farm payment for our pony paddock.&#148; They then boasted in the local pub, &#147;I received &#163;54 in subsidy payment.&#148; The system was overwhelmed, which is why serious, professional farmers suffered so much. In future negotiations, I hope that there will be a minimum size or standard to ensure that such people are not liable to receive the single farm payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para25"><a name="071204101000088">The serious result of the chaos over the Rural Payments Agency and the single farm payment was that for over two years it distracted farmers from sitting down and doing what they should have been doing. Because of the delays, farmers reached a point of desperation. They were borrowing money left, right and centre from banks and owed money to their suppliers. For the past two years, they have essentially concentrated on simply keeping their heads above water. They should have been doing what they had been advised to do: using the single farm payment to make their farming enterprises profitable, instead of relying on subsidy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para26"><a name="071204101000089">The idea was that a farming enterprise should run profitably on its activities, and that the single farm payment would be money for investment and possibly profit. Farmers have not been able to do that, and as a consequence many farms and farmers in the livestock sector are running at a loss. If they properly quantified their labour, which a lot of them do not do, they would find that their losses were quite substantial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para27"><a name="071204101000090">I got some figures recently&#151;I do not know whether the Secretary of State has seen them&#151;from the English Beef and Lamb Executive, which has been doing research into the cost of production of livestock. For example, the loss on the average England lowland suckler herd in 2005-06 was &#163;351 per beast. In 2006-07, that figure went down to just under &#163;300. Right through the beef industry, the losses are about the same. The losses in the sheep sector were equivalent&#151;a loss of nearly &#163;50 per ewe in 2005, and a &#163;34 loss per ewe in 2006-07. The Secretary of State can see that   <br>

there is a tremendous amount to do if we are to ensure that such farming enterprises are properly profitable. That is why we should encourage schemes such as the EBLEX better return scheme so that livestock farmers get a better result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para28"><a name="071204101000091">The disasters of foot and mouth and bluetongue came at the worst possible time, which is sad because 2007 was shaping up to be not a bad year for the livestock industry. That went down the pan immediately, particularly when the export of sheep stopped and there was a huge overhang on the market. However, the underlying trend is good because the quantities of beef and lamb being eaten in this country are up. It is a pity that farmers could not cash in on that by getting the better prices that they were anticipating at the start of the season. There is some reason to be optimistic, certainly in parts of the livestock sector. Cereal farmers are also not unhappy, but pig farmers, poultry farmers and game rearers are desperately unhappy about what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para29"><a name="071204101000092">What the industry needs from DEFRA are some positive decisions on a number of hugely important outstanding issues. The first, which has been mentioned, is the issue of TB, which needs to be resolved. That is a matter of considerable urgency that has been around for at least 10 years&#151;</p>

 Indeed, longer than 10 years. Unfortunately, the chief scientific adviser supported a cull. A decision must now be taken. I appreciate that the decision is difficult, but it needs to be taken quite soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para30"><a name="071204101000095">Perhaps more controversially, a proper decision must be taken on genetically modified crops. Possibly alone on this side of the Chamber, I favour the planting of GM crops in this country, because I see them as an important new development in agriculture that will go a long way towards feeding people throughout the world with better and healthier food. We have to make that decision. The threat if we do not make that decision is that the livestock industry will gradually migrate abroad, because GM feed prices will be much lower than feed prices in the UK. That will pose a threat to the viability of our livestock industry. We will increasingly import meat more cheaply across the tariff boundaries from South America and countries in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="71204-0018.htm_para31"><a name="071204101000096">Those are the big issues that DEFRA needs to address.

Chamber. In fact, many people roam through his constituency along Hadrian&#146;s wall, past my house, through the city and right on to Bowness. There is a value in people walking the countryside, and some of the rural pubs will be pleased with the Hadrian&#146;s wall path and the right to roam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para0"><a name="071204101000100">I want to come on to what is basically a constituency speech. The motion and the amendment talk about foot and mouth disease, and in 2001 my constituency was the epicentre of the disease in the north of the country. I had the first Adjournment debate about foot and mouth disease in this Chamber when it did not seem to be a major problem. However, it turned out to be one; indeed, it was horrendous. When I found out that there had been another outbreak in the south of England, I felt so sorry for the individuals involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para1"><a name="071204101000101">However, it turned out that we had learned the lessons from 2001. The outbreak then was difficult, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) said. In 2001, we did not know that foot and mouth was around. The farmer concerned from Heddon-on-the-Wall had some terrible practices, but never reported the disease and in the end was prosecuted. That was the source of the outbreak in 2001. We argue about meat coming in from foreign countries, but if everybody had done what they should have done and if the biodiversity had been there, we would not have suffered the 2001 outbreak.</p>

<p><a name="st_o464"><a name="071204101000102"><a name="71204-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="071204101000152"><b>Mr. Paice:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman says that if everybody had done what they should have done, we would not have experienced that outbreak. Does that include the DEFRA official who licensed the premises in Heddon-on-the-Wall, which should never have been licensed?</p>

<p><a name="st_o465"><a name="071204101000103"><a name="71204-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="071204101000153"><b>Mr. Martlew:</b>
 I do not know, but if that is the case, they should perhaps take the blame. The real answer, however, is that the pigswill should have been boiled, but that did not happen and that was the source, although we did not hear much criticism of the farming community or that individual from the Opposition then. However, we have learned the lessons of 2001. That is good and I am glad that the outbreak has been contained, because we do not want to go through that again. The big danger with foot and mouth is that in 10, 15 or 20 years&#146; time when we have forgotten the lessons, it might happen again. I hope that at any such time we bring in vaccinations at a very early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para2"><a name="071204101000104">Another issue is the Rural Payments Agency and the single farm payment. My constituents work in a very large RPA area office in the centre of Carlisle and when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary came up, he was candid in saying that things had gone wrong, but that there was no blame to be laid on the work force. I am sorry that the Opposition seem to be blaming DEFRA civil servants. In the Rural Payments Agency in my constituency, they work two or three shifts. These are civil servants on shift work&#151;something that I never thought I would see. They work very hard and very conscientiously, doing their best in very difficult circumstances. I hope that the Opposition spokesman who replies will acknowledge that. If we are to blame civil servants, let us blame those up near the top rather than individuals further down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para3"><a name="071204101000105">Flooding is another issue in our amendment. In 2005, my constituency suffered from the worst floods in an urban area of Britain for 50 years. It may have been worse since, but those were very serious floods. Unlike those we saw this year, they happened in the dead of winter in early January. We not only had floods; we had no electricity for many days. This was the first occasion for many years on which individuals drowned in floods in inland UK. Two old ladies drowned in their own homes in Warwick road in my constituency. It just so happens&#151;it is a coincidence&#151;that the Environment Agency announced today that the &#163;12 million flood defences built in that area are now watertight. People living there will be able to sleep comfortably this winter. Unfortunately, in the part of the city where I live, the flood defences have not yet started, so I will not be able to sleep comfortably for another two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para4"><a name="071204101000106">I would like to pay tribute at this stage to my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe. That serious flooding happened on 5 January and my right hon. Friend arrived on the morning of 6 January, when it was still raining. He gave me a commitment on that occasion&#151;in front of the cameras, which I felt was a rather brave thing to do&#151;that money would be made available for flood defences in Carlisle. The &#163;30-odd million that was needed for flood defences in the city has been made available. When they are completed, Carlisle will be the best defended city in England. I really want to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para5"><a name="071204101000107">I would also like to pay a special tribute to the Environment Agency, which has done a magnificent job on the flood defences. I pay particular tribute to the lady who led the defences work, Kim Nicholson, who was there when the going was rough and made sure that the plans were delivered on time, but who tragically died this summer. It is the greatest tribute to her that her team has continued and that the flood defences are completed on budget and before time. That will be a fitting memorial for her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71204-0019.htm_para6"><a name="071204101000108">Let me return to the point I raised earlier with the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) about the funding of this country&#146;s flood defences. I appreciate that the Government have gone along with increases from &#163;600 million to &#163;650 million and then &#163;800 million, but I can tell the Secretary of State that that will not be enough. If we reflect on what happened this summer, it is clear that we will not be able to raise enough money through general taxation to pay for all the flood defences that we will need in the future. I do not believe that it is possible. Those who live in a flood plain who pay high insurance premiums and do not sleep easy at night should perhaps be asked to pay an extra contribution in future. I am not sure what the best mechanism is for achieving that. It may be through insurance premiums, but I am sure that people would like to pay more towards flood defences and less to the insurance companies. I think it was the hon. Member for Cheltenham who spoke of the inability to obtain insurance at all for some properties, the reduction in value of properties on flood plains and sky-high premiums. I suspect that if we could provide flood defences for those communities, they would be prepared to make a small contribution. The Secretary of State should consider that point.</p>

Friend the Member for Scunthorpe, who has seen many more skips than I have, will know that once the floods have happened the skips arrive, and are themselves flooded with rubbish that goes to landfill. In Carlisle we probably contributed to eight years of landfill in a fortnight. Where was the recycling process? I can accept what happened in Carlisle because that was the first of a series of events, but I cannot accept as the years go by that all the goods that are taken out of houses and put in skips should go to landfill. It is partly to do with the way in which the insurance companies work: it is old for new. If you have an old suite, you put it in the skip. It was amazing to see how much more was recycled by those who were not insured than by those of us who were well insured.</p>

 It is not posh, actually, but that is another story, for which I do not have time. Anyway, the Porsche was taken away and crushed as well. The Government must take the lead on recycling in the event of flooding, especially if it is to happen year after year.</p>

 There are undoubtedly many challenges for DEFRA&#146;s animal health officials, who have been rightly praised today. They include the demand for successful contingency plans to bring the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease&#151;once the virus had escaped from Pirbright&#151;then bluetongue disease and now avian influenza under control. Those challenges, coupled with the increasing incidence of TB&#151;about which we have also heard today&#151;have stretched the successful work of DEFRA&#146;s animal health officials, so this would be a good time to ensure that they have all the resources that they require.</p>

DEFRA indicated that it expected any additional costs incurred to be kept within the overall Devon framework budget. Then it admitted that it had not done its sums. The cost agreed by local authorities and the regional divisional veterinary managers for animal disease control work amounted to &#163;9.7 million for 2007-08, but DEFRA had allocated &#163;8.5 million, and is seeking to claw back &#163;1.2 million in the current financial year.</p>

It was not until 2 November than DEFRA formally instructed Devon to make cuts in this year&#146;s budget. Can the Secretary of State tell us why it took his Department so long to learn that it had oversubscribed its funds, and why it left it until so late to inform local authorities of the required cost savings? What discussions has he had on this, particularly in respect of the south-west, with his colleague, the Minister for the South West?</p>

As there is merely four months to find &#163;68,000, the only option for Devon county council is to fire five out of eight animal health officials or to pay for them itself.

The Secretary of State has given commitments in respect of &#147;rural-proofing&#148; so that policies take account of rural circumstances and needs. Is he therefore satisfied with his cuts, which would lead to one official per 550,000 acres, one official per 190,000 cattle, one official per 490,000 sheep and one official per 1,700,000 chickens? I think I am right in saying that the south-west produces twice as much food as Scotland and three times as much as Wales&#151;that is a staggering set of statistics, and it leads to staggering thoughts. Given the importance of agriculture in Devon, will he enter into discussions on its funding requirements as a matter of urgency? How can the Secretary of State satisfy himself that these cuts would not impinge upon future disease prevention, containment and control? The House will remember&#151;we have heard from the hon.

However, such decisions must not be driven by any political desire to offload from DEFRA a basic responsibility of Government just because it is difficult to manage and because DEFRA is under budgetary pressure. Given that beef, sheep and pig producers have been saddled with enormous additional costs&#151;at least &#163;100 million&#151;as a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth this year, as well as steep increases in feed, energy and regulatory costs, does the Secretary of State agree that this is perhaps the worst time to increase further the burden on farmers? I am pleased that the Secretary of State will have time to consider those and other points when he goes to Bali with many of his officials shortly, but I hope that the officials he leaves behind will deal with an issue closer to home, and which relates closely to Devon: animal health and welfare.</p>

Is the Secretary of State aware of growing consumer concern about broiler chicken welfare? The supermarkets&#146; heavy discounting has squeezed farmers&#146; margins to the point where they are unable to make welfare improvements. Sadly, it is increasingly common for some producers to rear flocks of 40,000 birds, each living in an area smaller than an A4 sheet of paper.</p>

 I must tell the Secretary of State that it would be a gross underestimate of reality to describe DEFRA&#146;s reputation in my constituency as poor. I ask him to accept that that is not because of any deep-rooted prejudice or unfairness. It is because of the daily experience of thousands of my constituents who pursue rural activities such as farming, not only at the hands of DEFRA officials, but as part of a culture that seems to have been born with DEFRA but has not yet successfully been altered.</p>

 I agree with that, but I shall not be distracted from my main point.

There is a complete want of trust and a constant feeling that DEFRA is not standing by the side of those rural communities. They feel that it is standing on their shoulders and driving them down. I ask the Secretary of State to accept that it is not impossible to understand why that should be. Brave though his defence of his Department was, the fact is that it has made a pathetic litany of error and incompetence, almost since the moment that it was brought into being.</p>

place&#151;actually to call for the resignation of the then Secretary of State when dealing with a report. By then she had become Foreign Secretary, but that recommendation was not lightly made. It was made after careful and due deliberation. The Committee said&#151;I hope that the Secretary of State has read the report&#151;that there had been a clear failure of political leadership, not only in the initial decision to introduce a complex hybrid scheme, but in the subsequent follow-through. Indeed, the Minister of State said in evidence to the Committee that the Department did not follow it through. The decision was criticised on all sides as the wrong decision&#151;it was not only the fault of the civil servants, and Ministers should not hide behind the human shield of civil servants who cannot answer for themselves&#151;and it was a failure of political leadership. It was a criminal act of neglect. What should the people of the countryside think when they hear the Secretary of State say to the House today that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with his Department, even though the Select Committee&#151;with a preponderance of Labour Members&#151;told the then Secretary of State that she should consider her position and that there had been a failure of political leadership?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para1"><a name="071204104000022">Let us consider other decisions, such as the Department&#146;s decision on bovine tuberculosis. In 2005, the strategic review of bovine TB called for a partnership between the farming community and DEFRA and everybody welcomed that. In 2005, I was told in the House by one of the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessors that the time for a decision on bovine TB was very near, but nothing has been done. In 2006, the Minister of State told me that the time was nigh and that, after a three-month consultation, the decision would soon be taken. He said that it was necessary to see whether the statistics, which seemed to suggest a fall in numbers in 2006, were borne out. Since 2006-07, of course, the incidence of bovine TB has risen by 22 per cent. There have been some 2,617 herd incidents. Nothing has been done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para2"><a name="071204104000023">It is not right or credible to say to the farming community that the Government want a partnership with it while they continue to load the cost of the disease through the introduction of tabular valuations, and fail to take the brave decision that is plainly needed to use culling as an instrument of policy. It should not be the sole instrument of policy, or even the main instrument of policy, but it must be an instrument available in the hotspot areas of dense infection, where the balance of risk favours it. But no decision has been taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para3"><a name="071204104000024">The Secretary of State asks for time. He said as much to the Committee recently.

How can the country people whom I represent have confidence that this Secretary of State will listen and take a decision when the two previous Secretaries of State have failed to take that decision although they, too, said that the time was nigh?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para5"><a name="071204104000026">I ask the Secretary of State to look into this case. One animal, a prize-winning cow worth &#163;20,000, is still alive. Her half sister sold for 16,000 guineas just the other day, and she is a most superb example of this country&#146;s breeding stock. If DEFRA slaughters that animal, even though she is not even a conclusive reactor, Mr. Grigg will receive just &#163;1,400 in compensation. Farmers have been told that they must be in partnership with the Government, but how would the Secretary of State feel if he owned an animal like that and then discovered that she was to be taken from him and slaughtered? That is neither fair nor equitable, and it is no wonder that people in the countryside consider DEFRA to be a sardonic joke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para6"><a name="071204104000027">The Pirbright saga is another example, and the Secretary of State and I have already had an exchange about it. To do him credit, he did not seriously deny that it was a clear failure in the system, although I believe that it was, in part at least, a failure of his Department. The drains at the Pirbright facility were known to be dilapidated and due for replacement, but even so the foot and mouth virus escaped. No one inquired whether the drains were able to cope with having live virus flushed down them, or whether the virus would leech into the outside environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para7"><a name="071204104000028">That was an act of negligence, but the Secretary of State has come to the Dispatch Box to tell the country, and country people, that DEFRA has been acting well, even though at least part of the cost, stress and distress of the latest foot and mouth outbreak can be traced unerringly back to it. He should not feel surprised, therefore, by the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) that farmers have a grim and sardonic view of the Department.</p>

They work an 80-hour week and take home less than the minimum wage, but at the time they were watching their life&#146;s work go up in flames. They have been beaten down by those who should have been helping them but who have too often placed the hand of regulation on their shoulders.

I draw the attention of the Secretary of State to the work of rural community councils, which are organised by counties and funded in part by DEFRA. They lobby local authorities on behalf of rural communities and support community organisations in rural areas. In my area, for example, RCCs assist with parish planning&#151;a wonderful concept that has done much for local governance and widening its base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para13"><a name="071204104000036">The councils target help for disadvantaged people in rural areas. They support and promote social enterprises. In a small way, they help village halls become sustainable organisations by encouraging more involvement from local people. They ensure that there is sensible working between Government agencies, primary care trusts, fire authorities and other bodies; they act as the rural conscience of those organisations and make them work for rural as well as urban people. RCCs help with education, learning and skills training for people in rural areas. They run projects for disaffected young people, and assist in drug prevention schemes and other worthy initiatives.</p>

For a long time, they have been telling the Government that their methodology for attacking those diseases is world renowned, yet the Government will not let them operate that methodology, which is to examine the entire biology of the pathogens. It is a complicated, expensive and lengthy process and too often the Government ask the scientists to narrow their field of investigation and look only at particular elements. The scientists say that the Government are asking them for a quick-fix solution, which it is impossible for them to provide.</p>

My worry is that, although the Berkshire downs may still be beautiful, they are no longer a centre of mixed farming, as they were just a few years ago. I can count the number of pig farmers in the Berkshire downs on the fingers of one hand. When it comes to the number of stock and dairy farmers, I am one of the few that remain in that part of Berkshire. The effect of that is being felt when it comes to biodiversity and the whole rural community. That is not something that can be reversed. In the central south of England, and many other parts of the country, we are losing the infrastructure that supports stock farming. We are losing marts. I am running out of time, but I hope that the Minister will address those points when he winds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para22"><a name="071204104000046">I thought at one stage in the Secretary of State&#146;s litany of what he claimed as successes that he was going to claim credit for the non-flooding of eastern England, following the surge that did not quite happen a few weeks ago. I can just remember the 1953 floods&#151;I was a very small child living on the Suffolk coast&#151;and they were horrendous. However, we should not do anything other than thank goodness that they were not repeated.

When it comes to cutting the number of staff, the Secretary of State referred to meeting the head-count targets, but said nothing to explain why those staff were taken on in the first place if they are supernumerary to requirements. If they are required, why are we getting rid of them? Most importantly, having to make in-year cuts demonstrates the incompetence of management. Invariably, those cuts can be met only by cutting expenditure at the front line, not letting contracts that have not yet been let, and not carrying out front-line functions, because we all know that cutting staff does not save money in the year that one does it, because of all the associated costs.</p>

 I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman acknowledges that. I noticed that the hon. Member for Bridgend made some pretty subtle criticisms of funding cuts and their impact on biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para27"><a name="071204104000053">Hon. Members raised the issue of tuberculosis. We could spend a whole debate on that subject. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon said, we have had 10 years of virtually no progress. More than &#163;500 million has been spent and some 160,000 cattle have been slaughtered, yet there was no strategy. There have been lots of reviews and discussions, and a series of piecemeal measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para28"><a name="071204104000054">The right hon. Member for Scunthorpe and others said that we must be guided by science. Of course we must, but it is hard to be guided by science when the scientists cannot agree. He knows full well when he supports Professor Bourne that Professor King said something completely different. Sometimes Ministers have to grasp the nettle and make a tough decision. They have to decide what scientific evidence they accept and go with it. They need to have the courage of their convictions.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>

 No, I am sorry. I cannot give way because I do not have any overspill time, unless the Minister for the Environment plans to give it to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para29"><a name="071204104000057">The issue of the single farm payment has been widely discussed. The Secretary of State apologised, but ignored the damning report by the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The problems largely arose because the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), completely ignored the warning, given by people across the industry and in the House, that the scheme was destined for disaster. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) reminded us, the problem was partly caused by extending subsidy to many people who had not previously received it, which seems a funny way of setting about weaning people off subsidy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para30"><a name="071204104000058">Members including the Secretary of State talked about cost-sharing. The Government propose saving &#163;120 million in three years through cost-sharing. That starts next April, but the consultation on how that will work has not even taken place yet. Let us get a few things clear: Ministers have agreed with the National Farmers Union and others that the current foot and mouth outbreak and bluetongue have cost the industry more than &#163;100 million&#151;and the figure is rising. So far the industry has been given &#163;12.5 million in a Government package. According to the permanent secretary, the problems have cost the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs &#163;32 million. They have cost the industry more than twice what they have cost DEFRA, so there already is cost-sharing when it comes to disease control. Is that not true cost-sharing? How can the industry find another &#163;40 million, as the Government require?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para31"><a name="071204104000059">More importantly, the Government need to put their house in order. We have heard about Pirbright and the causes of the outbreak of foot and mouth. What about illegal meat imports to this country, which are estimated at 12,000 tonnes a year? According to the latest figures, only one in every 7,400 seizures results in prosecution. That is an open door to smugglers, and it is another reason why the industry cannot be expected to share the costs until the Government get to grips with their responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para32"><a name="071204104000060">There is also the issue of the burden of regulation. Last year, DEFRA put forward more regulations than in any year since its inception. Tonight we are being asked to congratulate it. Should we congratulate it on the ever increasing number of regulations that it produces? In the past six months, it has consulted on 37 new regulations. On 25 October, the Secretary of State said in the House, on climate change, that he was entering a &#147;genuine consultation&#148;, which prompts the question: how many of the other 37 were not genuine?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para33"><a name="071204104000061">In the countryside, as others have said, DEFRA has become a byword for incompetence. In 2005, the Government said that food security was not a policy objective. The Department has presided over an industry in collapse. It has done nothing but trot out warm words. Even the Minister of State, Lord Rooker, whose candour initially won the hearts of the farmers, has failed to achieve change. The whole Department seems to have lost sight of the need to help or encourage the industry, but instead wants to control and regulate it, as others have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="71204-0020.htm_para34"><a name="071204104000062">The Government need to understand that regulation is the enemy of enterprise. When will they understand that if the industry continues to contract, it will not be there when it is needed? If shortages continue as a result of climate change, population growth and prosperity, we will need that food. This debate, and especially the Government amendment, have highlighted the utter indifference and complacency that DEFRA shows to rural areas. However many Secretaries of State, however many future Foreign Secretaries, the chaos under them is the same. None has ever run a business; nobody seems prepared to take responsibility; nobody cares. If DEFRA were a company, it would have long since folded. It is time for a change. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

 I repeat the opening remark of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#151;I am as delighted as he was that the Opposition have given us the opportunity to put the record straight and to put to bed some of the producer-led nonsense that we have heard tonight, as if the past of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries was a proud record, and as if we had not made progress on the big questions of the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="71204-0021.htm_para1"><a name="071204112000013">I reject the central accusation in the Opposition motion this evening&#151;that the Department is cutting its expenditure. <i> [Interruption.]</i> With respect, that is what the Opposition motion says. I suggest that hon. Gentlemen read their motion. I doubt that many of them have done so. I repeat what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said. The expenditure of DEFRA is to increase from &#163;3.5 billion this year to just under &#163;4 billion by the end of the comprehensive spending review period. It is because of the macro-economic policies of the Government, opposed by the Conservatives, that we can increase expenditure in these areas, including, for example, the &#163;121 million investment in the Pirbright laboratories that have been criticised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="71204-0021.htm_para2"><a name="071204112000014">What cheered me up tonight was that the Conservatives have shown that they have not shed their oppositionalism and their mindset&#151;their attitude of mind that condemns them to permanent opposition, because they will not put forward policy ideas that accept the responsibility that all Governments have&#151;that is, to balance budgets. They describe the efforts of my right hon. Friend and his team to balance our budget as cuts. That is not an economic policy. It is the folly of opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="71204-0021.htm_para3"><a name="071204112000015">The speech from the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) was rather disappointing. I was looking forward to it, but it was short on substance and full of knee-jerk press release language. My right hon. Friend will lead the United Kingdom delegation to the United Nations framework convention on climate change this weekend as one of the most respected internationalists and environmentalists in the world, a man of incredible integrity and intelligence, with a grasp of the detail of the brief, as we have seen tonight, that leaves Opposition Members wallowing in his wake. Above all else, despite all the criticism and the pressures that he has faced since he took office, he has remained his father&#146;s son, and shows a politeness that is a commendable quality in a leading politician. Contrast that with the points made by the Opposition. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="71204-0021.htm_para4"><a name="071204112000016">Tonight&#146;s wisest comment came from my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). He reminded us that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries was a throwback to the 1960s&#151;although I would say the 1930s. Despite 18 years of government, the Conservatives never got rid of it. I have done my research, and should like to refer to the memoirs of the last Cabinet member for MAFF under the Conservative Government. The book, of course, relates to the rosy days of MAFF under the Tories. This is what Gillian Shephard wrote, &#147;It was regarded by smart political commentators as dull and by other Departments as incomprehensible. The Minister was left alone for the most part. MAFF&#146;s budget is so small that it is hardly worth fighting over.&#148; She went on, &#147;Much as I love the work of MAFF, its best friend could not claim that its policy issues were anything other than impenetrable, especially when they were being discussed in a crowded, steamed-up car on the way to Heathrow early in the morning.&#148; She gives us other insights.</p>

 No&#151;the hon. Gentleman will especially like this bit. &#147;Of course,&#148; Mrs. Shephard wrote, &#147;relations between lobby groups and professional organisations did not always run smoothly. Many Ministers bear the scars of encounters with their enraged customers. Michael Jack&#148;&#151;the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack)&#151;&#147;was my talented Minister of State. He had his fair share of upsets with the fishing community. He decided to meet the fishermen beforehand at Brixham and he arrived to find a huge and noisy demonstration. Flowers and eggs were thrown at him and he was covered with a pancake mixture. Nicholas Soames, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary at MAFF, ran into difficulties with the badger conservation lobby.&#148;</p>

On every page, there is a record of success. Recycling in 1996-97 is compared with that in 2007, and it has increased from 51 to 88 per cent. Glass recycling has increased from 47 to 80 per cent. The recycling of tins and cans has increased from 34 to 68 per cent. Let us turn over the page to consider the impact of our climate change policy. Despite the Opposition&#146;s warnings, we are one of the few countries in the world that is on target to fulfil its Kyoto objectives. That is hardly the action of a Department that is unfit for purpose, as the Opposition claim. Other pages cover the wider environment, such as coastal and marine waters, which sustain our fish. In 1996, only 5 per cent. of fishing stocks were sustainably harvested. The figure has increased sevenfold under the Department&#146;s successful policies. On every page&#151;</p>
