 Ofqual monitors standards of qualifications and assessments. It reported in July that standards are being maintained. As a result of the unacceptable problems with the delivery of last year&#146;s national curriculum tests, we set up the Sutherland inquiry, and we expect to respond shortly to Lord Sutherland&#146;s report. We have also established an expert group to advise on improvements to assessment arrangements, and we are trialling new ways of assessing key stage 2 pupils through the Making Good Progress pilots.</p>

 The procurement for this summer&#146;s key stage 2 tests has gone well, as has been reported to the House, and it has now been awarded to Edexcel. The hon. Gentleman will know that Edexcel operated the standard assessment tests contract between 2005 and 2007, delivering double the number of SATs that it will have to deliver this summer. I am confident that we have everything in place to ensure that we have a successful round this summer.</p>

 Does the Minister understand that a lot of Members of Parliament across the political spectrum have sympathy for the teachers and head teachers who think that the Ofsted regime is run by people who could never hold down a classroom and who have been promoted out of their positions? I am talking about all those people from the chief inspector downwards. They ought to be obliged to return to a teaching situation for a year, every two years, before they can make any reasonable and valid assessment of the qualities of their peers who are struggling in the profession. This needs to be looked at, because some of the assessments that are being made are grossly unfair.</p>

 Naturally, I listen carefully to the concerns of head teachers and teachers. I also listen carefully to what the Select Committee says. Ofsted is a non-ministerial department, as my hon. Friend knows, and it is accountable through the Select Committee. I have every confidence in the work of the chief inspector and, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has just whispered to me, to suggest that she should go back into the classroom every two years would be like suggesting that Alex Ferguson should go back to playing football every couple of seasons.</p>

 May I ask the Minister also to consider the means of assessment and, in particular, the use of course work for GCSEs and AS-levels?

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that they are important exams. Indeed, my son is currently doing his course work for his second year of A-levels. He is taking the work extremely seriously&#151;I hope&#151;and this is the subject of much discussion. Course work is important, and it is important that it is completed properly. It varies between different subjects, and we have reduced the amount of course work as a component of certain GCSEs. I am confident that we have now struck the right balance in each of the different subjects. For example, as someone who studied geography to degree level, I know that course work is a really important element in that subject, and it should remain so.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will realise that SATs for 11-year-olds are not conducted in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland. What is the educational rationale for conducting them in England, when we know how disruptive they are for 11-year-olds? Would an alternative not be better? Will he accept the recommendations and findings of the expert group, including those that head teachers are now putting forward?</p>

 Obviously we are looking forward to hearing what the expert group has to say to us. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question about the educational rationale, because it gives me an opportunity to say that it is about success and about what works. He will be aware that the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study&#151;TIMMS&#151;international evaluation of maths and science showed that our 14-year-olds are the best in Europe in those subjects, in part thanks to the test regime.</p>

 I would dispute the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of that particular debate. There are three examination boards, as I recall, in respect of GCSEs, and one of them had a different view from the other two. In order to carry out its function properly, Ofqual decided that it was necessary to have some consistency across the board. That was what informed its decision. It was not about dumbing down; Ofqual has been very robust about that.</p>

 Ofqual was not robust enough. As the Minister knows, it deliberately told one exam board to lower its marks. That exam board did so under protest and said that GCSEs would no longer be comparable  <br>

One hundred and eighty-seven independent schools now do not take the Government&#146;s GCSEs and they do not bother with the Government&#146;s league tables; they prefer the international GCSE, which the Government&#146;s own watchdog has acknowledged is &#147;more demanding&#148;. We now have a system that has been compared by one headmaster to that of South Africa, where richer students can take more prestigious exams and poorer students are denied the same opportunities. Will the Minister ensure that opportunity is made more equal and insist that state schools can offer the more robust IGSCEs?</p>

 I remind the hon. Gentleman that Ofqual has been clear that it is confident that standards have been maintained across the GCSEs. I also remind him that the study and taking of GCSEs in science in single subjects has doubled in recent years. I further remind him&#151;and hope he celebrates the fact&#151;that our 14-year-olds are the best in Europe at science, thanks to the education they receive in our maintained schools. As far as the IGCSE is concerned, the jury is still out. As I recall, the maths IGSCE, which is very popular among certain members of the independent sector, does not have a non-calculator paper, whereas I think it is important that we assess mental arithmetic and give people that sort of rigour, free of the calculator.</p>

 What we want to do is ensure that young people have the information, advice and guidance they need to know what options are available to them. Either of those two options is a route towards a higher-level degree. The route is either through an apprenticeship, which is occupation-specific, or through a diploma, which is wider and more sector-specific. It is important to give the right advice and guidance to young people to enable them to choose the correct route for them. Either route is acceptable to a university: we have already been told by Oxford and Cambridge this year that they will accept the advanced diploma in engineering as a qualification for their undergraduate courses.</p>

It is also still an extremely popular export from this country, and we should be proud of it.

Also, 47 per cent. of the A* grades in GCSE French went to pupils in the independent sector, which educates just 7 per cent. of pupils, and 45 per cent. of children qualifying for free school meals failed to achieve a single GCSE above grade D. Are not the lack of direction in the Government&#146;s education policy, the overloading of initiatives and the Government&#146;s failure to understand the core problems in our weaker secondary schools letting down the most disadvantaged children in our society and failing to ensure that education for these children is a ladder out of poverty?</p>

 I got a grade A. At that time, the A-level was an elite qualification, taken by a very small proportion of the population. It was taken, disproportionately, by far more people such as myself, who came from private schools rather than the maintained sector. That has radically changed as we have opened up access to education and made the system much fairer. I am proud of the improvement in A-level results that has taken place over the past 11 years. I am particularly pleased to see the increase in the number of entrants for maths, further maths and physics. We have a really good record on A-levels, and I do not want to indulge the hon.

That is why we published the work force strategy; it is why my right hon.

Any issue that impairs an adult&#146;s ability to parent their child, whether it is domestic violence, substance misuse or a mental health problem, should raise questions about child protection or development in the minds of those working with the parent that should be explored.

Today the Government start the &#163;224 million computer project, ContactPoint.

It is vital&#151;this came directly from the Victoria Climbi&#233; inquiry&#151;that when different people, such as social workers, health visitors and police officers, are working in a family, they know very quickly who else is involved so they can put their piece of the jigsaw into the whole picture.

 So far, eight schools in the east midlands have become trust schools under the Education and Inspections Act 2006. A further 27 are in a support programme and working towards trust status.</p>

 The case for trust schools still seems rather unconvincing, in that they create a further level of bureaucracy with which heads and staff have to grapple. They can potentially fragment and undermine school collaboration. Will the Secretary of State reassure the House that we are not opening doors for private individuals and organisations to exploit their curricular interests when better resourced local authorities could give the necessary advice and support to community schools to help them improve?</p>

 Of course, trust schools remain maintained schools and therefore part of the local authority family. The reality on the ground is that most of the trusts that have been set up are collaborative trusts between schools. The point is that they make it possible in a more effective way for schools to work together to raise standards and use their expertise. I would say to my hon. Friend, who is a Labour and Co-operative party MP, that we are taking forward proposals for 100 co-operative trust schools, which will take the ideals of the co-op movement with extra finance to ensure that we have more co-operative trust schools. I hope that a co-operative trust school might be something that he could support in his constituency and that might help to raise standards.</p>

 It would depend on the local authority&#146;s plans. It would also depend on the results that the school was achieving.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that answer, which is good news for children in my constituency. I only wish that such funding for youth services had been available when I was a member of Derbyshire county council between 1993 and 1997. Then, because youth services were not on a statutory footing, they were especially vulnerable to the savage cuts imposed by the Conservative Government of the day. Will my right hon. Friend give me an assurance that measures are in place to protect the funding for youth services? That funding should be on a statutory basis and so not vulnerable to the sort of behaviour that we had from the Opposition in those years long ago.</p>

 I can tell my hon. Friend that, precisely for the reasons that he has identified, this Government have placed significant new duties on local authorities to ensure that all young people can get access to a wide range of positive activities. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 requires local authorities to secure positive activities and facilities for young people in their area, to take into account young people&#146;s views on what that provision should be, to publicise it and to consider alternative third-sector providers. Failure by local authorities to fulfil those duties could result in intervention by the Secretary of State. That is a measure of our commitment to extending the opportunities for young people.</p>

 With regard to the funding of youth facilities, does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a difficulty?

 My hon. Friend is not actually correct to say that the core revenue funding is shrinking.

is largely up to local authorities how they spend the money. I know that my hon. Friend has written to me about a particular project in the north-east and I should be happy to talk to him about it. It receives substantial local authority funding, but I think that it faces some uncertainty because other funding streams outwith the local authority have been withdrawn.

The consultation deadline is 1 March, and the new admissions policy has to be in place by 15 April, so many schools are finding it difficult to hold a reasonable consultation.

 In view of the very tragic stabbing in east London last weekend, what are Ministers doing to bring down the disproportionate levels of school exclusions among young black men? There is a clear link between permanent school exclusion and gun and gang crime. We know that giving those boys and their parents the right support early on can bring down the level of exclusions, so what are the Government doing?</p>

 It is always important to listen in class, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her question. I commend to her the work of Sir Alan Steer, who has not only made proposals and recommendations on how to tackle the issue, but in his career as a head teacher was an exemplar in reducing exclusions by motivating and supporting young men, including young black men, in his school in north-east London. He did a brilliant job, so his proposals to take those initiatives forward across the country deserve support, including from my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90126-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0901264000165">I am grateful to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for his fair and accurate report and to the Committee on Standards and Privileges for its equally fair conclusions. My failure to declare to the Registrar of Members&#146; Interests, within the time required, all the donations to my campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour party was wrong. I note that the Committee fully accepts that I acted with &#147;commendable speed to rectify&#148; this once I had discovered the problem&#151;indeed, a month before any complaint was made against me&#151;and that there was &#147;no intention to deceive&#148;. I have always accepted full responsibility for this honest mistake and I apologise unreservedly to the House.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. At the weekend, I received within just a few hours more than 6,000 e-mails in relation to the debate on Heathrow. They were apparently organised or encouraged by Greenpeace and came from e-mailers right across the south-east; none were from my own constituency. Will you advise me whether the Standing Orders of the House can be amended to reflect such new developments? I think that what I have described is called e-mail bombing, which is designed to overflow e-mail inboxes and interfere with the legitimate work of MPs at what for most of us are busy times. The e-mails took many hours to deal with. I am sure that you personally find the practice reprehensible, Mr. Speaker. Are there ways in which we can prevent it from happening to other Members? Indeed, it may have already happened to them; I do not know.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90126-0004.htm_para57"><a name="0901264000228">The measures in the Bill are designed further to strengthen and to improve confidence in our justice system, building on more than a decade of record investment and substantial cultural and institutional reform. As a result, crime is down by more than a third since 1997. This is the first Administration since the war to preside over a significant and sustained reduction in crime. The chances of being a victim are now the lowest since accurate recording began more than 25 years ago. This means that there were 4 million fewer victims of crime in 2008 than there were in 1998. Over the same period, many more offences have been brought to justice&#151;nearly 1.5 million in the year to March 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90126-0004.htm_para58"><a name="0901264000229">In the past, victims and witnesses fared badly within the justice system&#151; prosecutors would barely even speak to their own witnesses, and victims and witnesses could be made to share a waiting room with the friends and family of the defendant. There was little or no help for vulnerable witnesses giving evidence. Since 1997, this Government have worked very hard to give a central voice and priority to victims and witnesses. We have increased investment threefold in support for them: for example, the amount for victim support alone has trebled. Victims have been given the legal right to minimum standards of service. There are victim personal statements in court and a victims&#146; advisory panel to inform Government policy. We have made it easier and less traumatic for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to give evidence in court.</p>

I first noticed his quality and judgment more than 10 years ago when he was speaking vocally and eloquently in favour of what was then the Human Rights Bill. It is fair to say that ever since he has been a consistent supporter of what is now the Human Rights Act 1998 and the incorporation of those measures into British law. We congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his judgment in elevating the hon. and learned Gentleman to this post. May I also put on record my thanks to his predecessor, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)? We sometimes had our disagreements, but we had a very constructive relationship and I wish him well in his new post.</p>

 No, it is not that, but I am pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman welcomes this appointment. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 made provision for a victims&#146; commissioner. There was a proper appointment process in 2005, but no suitable candidate was identified for the post, and it was decided that meanwhile the priority should be to build up and strengthen victims&#146; and witnesses&#146; services directly. I looked at the provisions in the 2003 Act and decided that they should be amended, and the Bill makes them rather lighter to ensure that less money is spent on what would amount to a bureaucracy for the commissioner. I hope that those changes commend themselves to the House and to the other place. Meanwhile, we judge that the gap should be filled by the appointment of a victims&#146; champion. As soon as the Bill becomes law, we will take steps to begin the process for a permanent appointment of a victims&#146; commissioner.</p>

We consulted widely on the draft Bill and have listened carefully to the House, and the Bill will bring about the first major reform of the coroner service in more than 100 years. It will significantly improve the service for bereaved families, not least those of service personnel, and strengthen death certification procedures following the Shipman inquiries.</p>

zeitgeist. May I give an example of a case in which the Secretary of State might have been prevailed upon to issue a certificate on the grounds of national security? In June 1994, a Chinook crashed on the Mull of Kintyre, killing four air crew and Northern Ireland intelligence experts. The families have been fighting to reverse the RAF board of inquiry&#146;s verdict of pilot error ever since. I knew Mike Tapper, the father of Flight Lieutenant Jonathan Tapper. May I urge the Secretary of State to explain fully the potential impact of private inquests on the possibility of getting to the truth about the deaths of brave servicemen and women in such cases?</p>

 I am just about to come to the Bill&#146;s provisions on the special certification procedure. I fully understand, as all of us do, the deep concern and anxieties of the bereaved families of that terrible Chinook accident in 1994, but it happened in the territory of Scotland, which is not directly covered by the Bill and where there have long been separate procedures for fatal accident inquiries.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that one aspect of military inquests about which bereaved families are deeply concerned is that the state can be represented by barristers, whereas they cannot except in exceptional circumstances and at the agreement of the Secretary of State himself? Does he agree that there should be room in the Bill for a clause allowing, or in fact requiring, families to be properly represented at inquests?</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern, but the reason why successive Governments have resisted a general provision to make representation or legal aid available in inquests is that they are civil, inquisitorial inquiries. They are not judicial proceedings, and they work very differently even from other civil proceedings. That is why successive Governments have resisted the notion that legal aid should be made available. There are exceptions to that&#151;I have been party to agreeing them&#151;and although I do not give the hon.

 The Secretary of State must be well aware of the hurt caused to families when there is an inquest on a death in police custody, for example, and they cannot be represented because they cannot get legal aid. They therefore feel that they have all the powers of the state against them when they are merely trying to achieve truth and justice for their loved ones. Will he think again about the policy of denying legal assistance to people who are going through a terrible crisis in their lives?</p>

 We are happy to think about it, but as I have said, there are some complexities. We must also consider the overall issue of cost, in the context that the legal aid budget for England and Wales is now the same amount that we spend on prisons, and legal aid per head in England and Wales is higher by a large margin than in any other country in the world, including common-law countries. That is the challenge that we face, but I understand the concern that has been well expressed by Members in all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0901264000244">I turn to the proposals in the Bill relating to coroners. There will be a new chief coroner, who will be a High Court judge and will preside over the reformed service and provide national leadership, and there will be separate independent inspection. For the first time, bereaved families and other interested parties will have access to a dedicated appeals system and will not have to rely on seeking a judicial review of an inquest. There will be far greater scope to transfer investigations from one area to another, taking into consideration the views and needs of bereaved families.</p>

 We entirely welcome the list of proposals that the Justice Secretary has just read out. However, he knows that some anxiety has been expressed about the fact that the post of deputy chief coroner will not be available to those working in the coroners system. I am surprised about that, although it is clearly right that the chief coroner should be a High Court judge, and I hope that we can consider the matter carefully during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

<p><a name="st_o117"><a name="0901264000246"><a name="90126-0005.htm_spnew11"><a name="0901264000630"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 I have thought about the matter a lot during the Bill&#146;s drafting. I fully accept that there is much to be said in favour of what is in the Bill and also of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s comments. I am open to considering amendments on the matter in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0901264000247">Let me now deal with what is plainly the most controversial issue in the Bill&#151;the proposition that, in certain limited circumstances, inquests should partly be held in private. In some circumstances, it is in the interests of justice to hold such inquests partly in private, for example, to protect highly sensitive information, such as a police source or intercept evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0901264000248">During the debate about previous proposals in the Counter-Terrorism Bill&#151;the substance of the current proposals differs markedly from those&#151;it was suggested that there was no need for special provisions and that we could rely, as the criminal courts do, on the public interest immunity certificate procedure. I want to outline a fundamental difference, which means that that argument cannot apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para6"><a name="0901264000249">In a criminal prosecution, there are many occasions on which the courts receive applications for public interest immunity certificates. As Home Secretary and as Foreign Secretary, I signed several. In most cases, because they are carefully thought through, the court grants a PII and the sensitive information is thus protected and kept from the jury. However, sometimes the PII is not granted. In that case, it is open to the prosecution to withdraw altogether&#151;that sometimes happens. The prosecution therefore has an option to proceed without the PII or withdraw in the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0901264000250">That option cannot arise in the case of an inquest. The need for an article 2 inquest arises when somebody has died in specific circumstances, not least, as the Bill spells out, when a person has died in the custody or the detention of the state. If the court was not willing to grant a PII, it would be improper for the state to abandon the inquest. That is why a proposal has been presented to introduce a special procedure to deal with the problem, which has become more significant in recent years because the courts have quite properly insisted that the inquests become article 2 compliant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para8"><a name="0901264000251">In a small number of cases, there has been significant difficulty in ensuring that coroners have access to all relevant information, including highly sensitive material, which cannot be made public. Agencies have used public interest immunity to refuse to disclose such material. To make the best of a difficult&#151;and, in my view, unsatisfactory&#151;situation, I am told that some coroners have worked with the relevant intelligence and security agencies to secure as much information as possible to ensure that a viable inquest could take place. In some circumstances, coroners have been shown withheld material in private, although they have not been able to make use of it. They have also been prevented by law from seeing any material protected by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, including intercept material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para9"><a name="0901264000252">We have developed the proposals because we believe that the current state of the law and process is unsatisfactory. It has resulted in two inquests being unable to proceed because the coroners cannot comply with their article 2 obligation to conduct a broad inquiry into the circumstances of deaths resulting from an act or omission of the state. Given that coroners&#146; inquests are increasingly being used to discharge those article 2 obligations, it is likely that that will continue to pose a problem in a small number of cases in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para10"><a name="0901264000253">I do not claim to the House that the provisions in the Bill are the last word&#151;indeed, we are open to amendments. However, I ask hon. Members to acknowledge that there is a problem and that PII certificates will not tackle it. The state is not in the shoes of a prosecutor in respect of an inquest. As I have said, in the case of a criminal trial, the prosecution can be withdrawn, but in the case of an inquest, that cannot happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90126-0005.htm_para11"><a name="0901264000254">Part 1 of the Bill seeks to ensure that there is a proper legal basis for inquests to consider protected information. As I have already said, proposals relating to this first surfaced in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. However, the proposals in the Bill represent significant changes to those original provisions, and we have tried to take account of the criticisms that were made. We have narrowed the criteria for certification, and introduced a requirement that consideration must be given to every other way of preventing the material from being made public before the new measures can be used.</p>

 I appreciate that this is an area of some difficulty, but I am sure that the Secretary of State will be aware that one of the reasons for holding an inquest is to satisfy the families as to the circumstances of a death. In an article 2 case, the provision and presumption is that there should be a jury. Indeed, that follows almost automatically at present. Frankly, the Government&#146;s proposals are really no different from their convening a secret internal inquiry of their own and then saying afterwards, &#147;We are satisfied that everything is all right.&#148; The proposals, as drafted, for the secrecy clauses and for the lack of a jury completely undermine the purpose for which an inquest is convened in the first place. There must be a better way of resolving the Secretary of State&#146;s dilemma than going down that road.</p>

for some kind of secret inquiry conducted by the Secretary of State. That is a parody of what it says. Moreover, as he knows, European jurisprudence&#151;including the convention&#151;does not require there to be a jury in any circumstances. We are very unusual, in England and Wales, in using juries as frequently as we do.

 The Bill does two different things. First, it removes the jury; secondly, it provides for an inquest to be held in private. Those are entirely different steps. The Secretary of State&#146;s arguments in favour of holding an inquest in private do not justify the removal of a jury, unless one believes that juries inherently represent some kind of security risk. Are not the Government taking the attitude that members of the public are incapable of keeping confidential the information that is put before them as jurors?</p>

Friend will recall that in that case, the Metropolitan Commissioner wrote to the then Home Secretary the day after the shooting occurred and asked that there be no independent inquiry into the circumstances. He was apparently unaware that the Independent Police Complaints Commission was obliged by law to hold such an inquiry. The danger is that once one opens this little gap in the law, it will be exploited.</p>

 I ask the right hon. Gentleman to come back to the issue raised by the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). There have been instances in the past when jury trials have been held partially in camera&#151;I am thinking back to times when the Soviet Union still existed and we had spy trials&#151;and under those circumstances, of course lives were at risk. It was not always British citizens&#146; lives, as agents in the Soviet Union and so forth were sometimes involved, yet jury trials were still held. Why is it not possible to reconstitute that sort of arrangement?</p>

 There were indeed such trials, but it is also the case that in such trials, some of the evidence that was otherwise material was denied to the jury altogether by the exercise of a public interest immunity certificate. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), the starting point should be how to work round the existing system of having a jury, including having a hearing in camera as part of the proceedings, but one then gets to the point where, under criminal trials, including even those held in camera, the judge  <br>

 We all understand my right hon. Friend&#146;s problems with this issue, but I would like to return to earlier questions about the impact of these measures on service families. They are constantly told that they cannot have public inquiries, because they get answers to questions about the deaths of their loved ones through the coroner&#146;s inquest system. Now, however, they are told that they may only get a partial answer. Cannot my right hon. Friend understand the dismay felt by many service families about these issues?</p>

 First, the number of such inquests would be very limited indeed&#151;probably one or two a year, if that. I think it would be very rare for those to be held in respect of service personnel, for good reasons.

 One assumes that the exclusion of the public will extend to the family and relatives of the deceased. It is often difficult, even under normal processes, for such people to get closure when somebody has died in tragic and violent circumstances. In cases of the sort that we are talking about&#151;the most sensitive of all&#151;does my right hon. Friend really think that relatives will get closure when faced with an inquiry from which they have been excluded? Does he think that that complies with the requirements of article 2 of the European convention on human rights, particularly in the light of the case of Jordan, which said that families have to be involved in the inquest process?</p>

 The families will be involved. We are talking about exclusion from only part of the inquest in very limited and very specific circumstances, not about secret inquests. I would also say that those inquests, where held, will be conducted by an experienced High Court judge. Although I understand the concern of families that they will not get a verdict of the jury, what they will get instead, which they cannot get from a jury, is a detailed, reasoned explanation running over many pages, and a review of all the evidence, such as can be made public, as to why the learned judge has come to the view that he or she has.</p>

When I first looked at this issue in the mid-1990s, I found two things. First, for similar categories of offence and similar offenders, there were significant variations in sentence practice, unexplained by any factor other than the habits of different courts. Secondly, the guidance available to courts took the form of a digestion of decades of High Court decisions contained in dense textbooks such as David Thomas&#146;s &#147;Current Sentencing Practice&#148;, which although an impressive and distinguished work of scholarship, now runs to five volumes.</p>

That explains the significant variation in the attitude of the courts to similar offences and similar offenders. My view was that we needed a more explicit process, but one that fully respected the independence and discretion of judges and magistrates at the point of sentence. So, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established the Sentencing Advisory Panel. That was followed by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which proposed the Sentencing Guidelines Council.</p>

That is a profound change, and I must tell him that it will come as a shock to the public, because it has been an established principle for a long time that judges should pass sentences that reflect the period that a person should serve in prison.

 It is part of the same issue.

Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) that a better assessment should be made over time of the efficacy of sentences in terms of reoffending rates. The courts will be able to depart from the council&#146;s sentencing guidelines if that would be in the interests of justice.

 May I come at the problem from a slightly different angle? There are already magistrates who are not able to sentence people to community sentences when that might be appropriate because the lack of resources from the Government has made certain courses unavailable. For example, in Staffordshire, magistrates have been unable to sentence people to particular community sentences for that reason, and I am told that that problem is not peculiar to Staffordshire. The Secretary of State must understand that the resources question attaches not only to custodial sentences but to community sentences. People who should be getting community sentences are, for the wrong reasons, being sent to prison.</p>

The result is that the offender will often have completed a large part of the disqualification before he or she is released from prison. I commend the hon.

 May I counsel the hon. and learned Gentleman, and his ally on the Liberal Benches, to avoid making over-hysterical comments on the issue of data sharing? Does he accept that there is an important need to have a balance between protecting data and using them, especially to prevent crime and reduce offending?

 My experience of one or two examples of failures to share data, such as that which was highlighted in the Soham murder case, is that there was no requirement whatsoever for any legislation in the House to enable such sharing to happen. Perhaps a slightly greater understanding of what is and is not allowed is needed. However, the country has managed rather well historically by being extremely careful of allowing the Government to share data. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman will recollect that, at one time, people were so concerned about preserving individuals&#146; privacy that there were separate schedules to the tax Acts to ensure that a tax inspector could not have a complete picture of a person&#146;s finances. We have moved a very long way from there. The path that we are on raises really serious possibilities of the oppressive state, as every hon.

I do not deny that the arrival of the vast volumes of data that the state is now collating does not raise challenges. Indeed, the Information Commissioner is on record as expressing deep concern about the way in which, for example, data about a person&#146;s distant past may be raked up and used in ways that are detrimental to their well-being subsequently. I accept that there is a need for safeguards and supervision, and some of the provisions may do something in that respect, but that does not get us away from the enormity of what is proposed. As it appears in the legislation, this is in fact the moment when the doors are opened to massive and uncontrolled data sharing. We do not think that that is desirable. We certainly do not think it desirable that it should be included in a Bill of this kind.</p>

 Does the hon. and learned Gentleman share my concern at how the Government are presenting their case to the public? We saw an example this afternoon, when the Secretary of State talked about families suffering bereavement. I have also heard him give examples involving people moving house. That makes what is proposed sound like a very minor change, made just for people&#146;s own convenience. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman share my concern that, if that is what is going to be done, a change in the law is not needed; people just need to be asked to give their consent?

Violent crime has almost doubled under this Government&#151;a fact now openly  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90126-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0901264000394">There has been failure to plan for, let alone fund, adequate prison capacity, and that is one of the reasons why the proposals relating to the sentencing council take the form that they do in the Bill. At a time when people are concerned about the increase in violence, the full impact of the Government&#146;s reckless early release scheme is becoming plainly apparent, for example in the ClearSprings fiasco; the issue was on the airwaves only this morning. The long-term failure to build the prisons that we need for our criminal justice system has led the Government to rely on weak non-custodial arrangements, and to fail to rehabilitate offenders or protect the public. I just point out to the Secretary of State that since 1999, nearly 400 people have been killed by criminals on probation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90126-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0901264000395">A quarter of magistrates courts have closed under Labour; they were replaced by administrative measures that do not punish criminals properly and risk penalising the innocent. The mass expansion of penalty notices&#151;again, this is something with which we are having to grapple&#151;conditional cautions and warnings means that half of all criminal offenders avoid altogether court and proper assessment of what is required for them.</p>

Half the fines are not paid on time, in any event. One has the impression that Ministers are more interested in the taxation and revenue aspects of fining than in tackling the underlying causes, in relation to those who steal. Of course, the same approach is taken to cannabis, as the Government send out more mixed messages about that dangerous drug; they are reclassifying it on the one hand, but continue to make it the subject of fixed penalty notices on the other.</p>

The Government have repeatedly attacked the role of juries during their time in office. Each time, the Government have had to be fought off, but in the Bill there is yet another attempt to undermine the jury system, in relation to inquests. As I said, there is also the growth of the database state and creeping surveillance, despite all the evidence that the Government are more likely to lose or abuse our private information than to protect it. I am afraid that we see all the hallmarks of those serial failings in the details of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90126-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0901264000398">Just to cheer up the Secretary of State, let me say that there are some measures that we welcome, as I have already hinted and pointed out. We agree that reform of the coroners&#146; system is long overdue. The bulk of the proposals are clearly of great importance, and we will do our best to make sure that those aspects of the reform can work properly. We certainly support measures to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes, and we will work with the Government to ensure proper protection for victims and witnesses, while safeguarding fair trials. There is much that is good in that part of the Bill. There may well be some challenging issues to do with investigation anonymity orders, but the intention behind them is clearly laudable.</p>

On that issue, we accept that the Government&#146;s intentions are good, but the provisions classically illustrate the problem of trying to cherry-pick important, carefully reasoned and crafted, but admittedly controversial, proposals from the Law Commission&#146;s report. There is clearly a need to provide a better definition of partial defences to murder, whether on the grounds of provocation or diminished responsibility. Those will be much harder to rationalise if the Law Commission&#146;s idea for two categories of murder is not followed, although, as I say, I have some sympathy with the Government on why they may have decided not to go down that road.</p>

The whole history of human society, whether one is reading &#147;Othello&#148; or considering the case of Ruth Ellis, suggests that that is a matter on which people who might otherwise be behaving reasonably appear to lose all sense of proportion and reason. Without in any way saying that I have a fixed view on the matter, I very much hope that these are issues that we can properly consider, because it will be important that we get them right.</p>

The fundamental point about this reform is to ensure that sentencing is driven by Government expediency, rather than by the requirements of justice.

It has increased by 2,000 places a year and rising, and we have plans right until 2014 for its further expansion.

step in reducing prison population is to provide adequate prison facilities for rehabilitation and training. That cannot be done in an overcrowded environment, which is why more prison places are needed at present. Moreover, when the Secretary of State quoted my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) earlier, he failed to add the final sentence of the comment that my hon. Friend made at the time:</p>

I had not intended to go into this, but I am sure we would not have wasted &#163;70 million on a computer system to link prisons to the probation service, which does not work. We certainly would not have spent &#163;100 million to put the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council into a new Supreme Court, which must be one of the greatest extravagances and wastes of the Government&#146;s period in office. Furthermore, we would not be spending &#163;131 million to house the Secretary of State in his new accommodation. All that is quite apart from the &#163;5 billion that has effectively been wasted on the National Offender Management Service&#151;a subject that the Government are only too keen to gloss over. I note in passing that &#163;27 million was spent on external consultants in 2007. If the Secretary of State wanted me to, I could run on with an endless list and point out all sorts of areas in which sensible savings can be made on foolish Government expenditure. If the Government had not been so profligate and foolish in some of the projects on which they embarked, the Secretary of State&#146;s Department would not have its spending crisis, which has been afflicting it for a considerable period.</p>

for example, and particularly on legal aid, the Department ended up constantly underfunded, because of the wickedness of the present Prime Minister. That remarkable story will take some time to be fully recounted, but it appears to have had a great deal to do with the Prime Minister&#146;s personal animus against those previous incumbents. That may have given the Secretary of State an unhappy legacy when he took over the Department; indeed, I suspect that it has given him problems from which he has never been able to escape. I am afraid that I am not in a position to help &#147;holistically&#148;&#151;I think that that is the awful word, which is used in the House far too often&#151;to cure the internal dissensions in Government, which go back a long way.</p>

 I understand well enough that the Government have considerable difficulties, because prison places will rise as a result of some of the measures. Indeed, it is worth remembering that responsibility for the drivers behind the increased costs of both prisons and the court system can be, at least in part, laid at the door of the Government and their zeal in inflicting tougher and tougher criminal offences on the population. Those offences require representation when they go to court and they require more prison places. I understand that well, just as I understand that the problem with ClearSprings at the moment is that half the ClearSprings places have been created either to deal with early release prisoners or as a substitute to prison, to avoid sending on bail people who probably ought to be in a more controlled environment. The evidence is that the people involved have chaotic lifestyles that they inflict on the local communities, and without properly wardened accommodation to help them. All that is part of the Government&#146;s general failure.</p>

The Peart review talks of a &#147;lackadaisical and nonchalant approach&#148; to the granting and enforcement of bail. This proposal does not do justice to the scale of the problem, and I hope that the matter can be debated in greater detail as the Bill goes through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para0"><a name="0901264000418">Today we learn that the appointment has effectively been postponed for another whole year, and that the Government have appointed a &#147;champion&#148;. I welcome that, but I am left with the feeling that it was a fig leaf for their failure. It is another case of more talk and no action. If the Justice Secretary is really serious about victims, why does he not introduce what we have called for&#151;a proper victims fund, funded through the earnings from prisoner work schemes and the proceeds of crime?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0901264000419">The Bill will do little to strengthen criminal punishment but plenty to weaken British justice. The proposal, in the part of the Bill dealing with coroners, to remove juries and hold proceedings in secret is an even broader version of the proposal defeated in the other place during the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Bill. The House will recall that in June Ministers failed to make the case that the security case justified this draconian step. What new evidence does the Justice Secretary offer up on this point? When the proposals were withdrawn&#151;we greatly welcomed that&#151;I was under the impression that the Government might embark on considerable consultation to see whether there was an alternative way forward, given the level of disquiet, which was brought home to them very clearly, yet I see no such consultation. Instead, they have just come back to the House and regurgitated the same proposals with some very minor changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0901264000420">The challenge of reconciling sensitive evidence with the demands of transparency and due process is not new, and I do not see the specific problem that cannot adequately be addressed within the current system. The Secretary of State said that this was an inquisitorial process, so we could not have the public interest immunity approach, involving an adversarial process. I accept that that is an issue, but substituting something that has all the hallmarks of a secret investigative process will never command the public acceptance and confidence that an inquest process must do if it is to have any relevance&#151;or to be held at all. On that basis, we might as well say that there is no point in having an inquest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0901264000421">If the Government were prepared to show the necessary flexibility&#151;although I fully accept that it might in some cases mean that some evidence could never be brought before inquest juries&#151;it would be possible to put in place a system with the flexibility that would still allow the process to be open, and would ultimately still enable the Government truly to say, &#147;We have done our best to enable openness to be maintained.&#148; Without that, I fear that these proposals will simply undermine public confidence still further. We will therefore consider them very carefully, and it is most unlikely that they can command our support.</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s recognition that there is a problem, and that the parallel with criminal trials is not really accurate. Since he accepts that there may be circumstances in which evidence would have to be kept from a coroner&#146;s jury, which is at the heart of these proposals, we are ready to consider any constructive suggestions that he or other colleagues make to us.</p>

taking raises the probability that the number of secret inquests without juries will grow, and that they will then be deemed convenient. That is why we are so concerned about the proposals. I hope that there will be constructive engagement in Committee, and I know that my hon. Friends who will serve on it want that, but I would not be doing my job or expressing my own feelings if I were not to say that I find it difficult to see how the proposals could command our acceptance. Indeed, I think that there is considerable disquiet about them across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0901264000424">I spoke earlier about opposition to data-sharing powers. The Government&#146;s track record of protecting the personal data that they hold on citizens is appalling. They have demonstrated serial, serious and systematic incompetence. They have lost the details of 130,000 prisoners held on a computer memory stick, and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency information on 3 million learner drivers, not forgetting half the nation&#146;s child benefit records, which I believe were lost in the post. Members should view with deep scepticism the proposal massively to increase ministerial powers to share data across Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0901264000425">The clauses on data sharing are tucked away at the back of the Bill, but that should not conceal their dramatic impact. The Secretary of State said that I was exaggerating, but I take the view of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who said that I was rather understating the matter. As a result of the proposals, Ministers will have carte blanche to expand data sharing between officials across Whitehall, local authorities and even companies in the private sector. Privacy International warns of the</p>
<a name="90126-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="0901264000487"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;vast risks associated with governance, privacy, security,&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0901264000426">and the British Medical Association has stated that the proposals will strip patients of any rights in connection with the control of their medical records. As I tried to point out to the Secretary of State earlier, that goes to the heart of the relationship between state and citizen. The proposals would, if the public interest required it, allow a statutory instrument to be made allowing the sharing of medical records data with Departments that are not at all concerned with treating individuals, for other purposes. I believe that that is unacceptable. If there is to be change to take account of the growing amount of data, it should be made with great caution and should not be the &#147;open sesame&#148; to a vast increase in Government power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0901264000427">It is worth bearing in mind that the security case has not been made, that we do not believe that the safeguards are good enough, and that all this is being done at a time when, I gently point out to the Secretary of State, public trust in the Government&#146;s ability to protect data is at an all-time low. I recall the Prime Minister saying:</p>
<a name="90126-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="0901264000488"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we can&#146;t promise that every single item of information will always be safe&#148;.</p>

entirely applaud, and preserving legitimate public debate is delicate. I do not recall the Secretary of State, or the Home Secretary, who I believe was responsible, giving the impression that the decision to accept the Lords amendment to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill was a mere tactic for returning to the issue later. It appeared to involve an acceptance that the Lords amendment was sufficient to command acceptance.</p>

 If the hon. and learned Gentleman looks at what was said on that occasion&#151;it was me who said it&#151;he will see that I made it clear that we would return to the matter at a further opportunity as soon as possible.</p>

 I thought that the intention to revert to the matter meant coming back with some other proposal that met the concerns that had been expressed about preserving freedom of speech. No case has yet been made&#151;I wait to hear it&#151;to show why the words that were included in the other place do anything to undermine the ability to prosecute the offence that has been created. If the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) can make that case cogently, we will listen. In the meantime, I simply do not see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90126-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0901264000432">I perceive the provision as a saving clause, designed to deal with the chilling effect that always arises when restrictions are placed on freedom of speech. We debated it and commented on it previously, when we considered issues such as incitement to religious hatred. I want individuals who incite homophobic hatred to be prosecuted just as much as the Under-Secretary does, but I do not want the circumstances that I am about to outline to be repeated, and I do not believe that the Government want that either. Old age pensioners living in Blackpool wrote to their local authority, as is their right, to say that they did not approve of its giving money to a gay organisation. Instead of getting a reply saying, &#147;Terribly sorry. We were voted in, and this is what we believe in. We disagree with you,&#148; they got a visit from two police officers telling them that if they wrote such letters again, they might&#151;even under the old law&#151;be prosecuted. They recovered damages and got an apology, but only after a time. They received treatment that makes me ashamed of the system that we seem to be creating in this country. We must ensure that such things do not happen. A sensible freedom of speech clause would be helpful, to reassure those who want to continue to express views that are legal&#151;even if I disagree with them.</p>

or understand it, is often at variance with what is intended. That is why problems have arisen. There was a street preacher in my constituency who said that people should repent and turn to God, and that if they did not repent they risked going to hell. The police came along and said, &#147;You can tell them that they should repent and turn to God, but you shouldn&#146;t give them the other half of the message.&#148; <i> [Interruption.] </i>I agree with the Secretary of State that that is absurd, but the House must pay attention to the consequences of its actions in creating absurdities, which may appear amusing to us but are not amusing to those on the receiving end of individuals who take it upon themselves to interpret the law in a way that we did not intend.</p>

 Are not the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s comments proof of the point that some of us made when the matter was originally discussed? Surely the right way in which to deal with this matter is by issuing guidance to the police and the prosecution authorities, and procedural protection, rather than including a pointless but potentially dangerous blanket exemption in the Bill.</p>

 If the hon.

We have been content with such a provision in other cases where we have imposed restrictions on freedom of speech. I simply ask the House to consider the matter carefully, because I think that there is a genuine problem, which past experience has demonstrated. I hope that the Secretary of State will bear that in mind.</p>

 As my hon. and learned Friend knows, I yield to none in my admiration for his parliamentary and other talents. I have to say to him, however, that in this particular matter his memory serves him ill, and that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) is entirely correct in her recollection of the sequence of events. The Government made it clear that they intended to bring back this provision in a later measure; there was no question of their backing down or qualifying their position. The point about the Government&#146;s policy on this matter, as encapsulated in the legislation, is that it is aimed at catching words or behaviour that are not merely insulting or abusive but threatening. The fact is that the Waddington amendment is a wrecking amendment; it is a menace, and it has to be defeated.</p>

 I am afraid that I do not agree with my hon. Friend that the amendment was intended as a wrecking amendment. Indeed, reading it, as I did at the time, and re-reading it, as I have done more recently, I do not believe that it would have that effect at all. If he wishes to discuss this with me in greater detail, I would be only too happy to do so. That said, I have made it clear that that proposal might not be the only available solution, but I believe that it is important for there to be safeguards. If there are none, the law of unintended consequences will lead to people who express views that are perfectly legitimate&#151;even if they are views with which we disagree&#151;feeling as if they are being persecuted. That is not something that the House should embark on lightly.</p>

 There are indeed anomalies, and they were discussed at some length when this matter appeared previously, if rather bizarrely, in another piece of legislation. I very much hope that we will be able to look at those matters sensibly. There are no easy solutions, and I am the first to accept some of the examples that we have been given, including that of gangsta rap lyrics, which I regard as revolting. I have no difficulty at all in wishing to see them criminalised and stopped&#151;absolutely none. Nor is this the pillar of some religious viewpoint; I do not think that it should be. I want to see a right for people to express their views, including views that other people might not like. That is what a free society is about, and the House must ensure that that can still happen, even when we have ensured that expressions of rabid hatred and incitement to hatred can be curbed.

We will strive to improve it in Committee and on Report, and to remove those parts that are unnecessary or counter-productive, or that we deem to be merely offensive.

I put the Government on notice that if the Bill is not substantially amended&#151;particularly in the area of data sharing, but also in other areas&#151;we will oppose it on Third Reading, because its mischief will wholly outweigh the undoubted benefits that it could confer if the Government would listen sensibly to the views being expressed right across the House.</p>

Indeed, we were so concerned about that that a clause went into the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to say that preventing crime is a legitimate reason for sharing data. Lawyers told us that that was already the case, but, frankly, lawyers and data protection officers refused to accept that and to act on it, which is why we felt it necessary to put the provision in the legislation.</p>

On the other hand, news reports on data protection and the data loss that we have seen on a number of occasions led to the equal and opposite headline that nothing should be shared.

The important thing is that on every occasion, a balanced judgment must be made by those who have the information as to whether it is in the public interest, as well as in the interest of individuals, to share it. Nobody who is a holder of data can escape the specific responsibility to balance the pros and the cons and address the public interest. There is no escape from that responsibility.

 Does the right hon. Gentleman share my concern about not only what data are shared, but their integrity and accuracy? Research published last week shows how many errors there are in the data held by different Departments and the complete lack in any Department of a policy of checking those data for errors to ensure that they are up to date and accurate. Is there a role for Parliament in trying to ensure that the data, before they are even considered for sharing, are made accurate?</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a fair point. The problem has been not the aspirations of Ministers, but the fact that sometimes the machinery of government and of agencies of government has been poor in two respects: ensuring absolute accuracy of the data, because there is no point having them unless we can depend on their accuracy, and ensuring that there is a culture that, as I have suggested, balances protection of those data where it is not appropriate for them to be released&#151;that is partly to do with methodology, but partly to do with the culture that needs to be put in place&#151;with the need to share data where appropriate. That goes right the way across from situations where anonymised data are not being shared when they should be to inform public policy to the very local level, where specific information could assist in preventing crime. She is absolutely right: the accuracy of data must be part of that overall picture.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State places such emphasis in his proposal. It is a rather sad fact of life that judges seem to be influenced by media debate, despite the importance of the judiciary being objective and independent. That is not a politician&#146;s criticism: it is significant the number of cases in which the senior judiciary effectively make that criticism by accepting the view of the Attorney-General that sentences have been too lenient. On the other hand, we see cases in which sentences are reduced by the Court of Appeal, so let us not pretend that the judiciary are perfect in the judgments they make or the decisions they reach in sentencing.</p>

Community sentences can be extremely tough and very challenging, and they can change people, but we heard from the Lord Chief Justice in evidence that many sentencers do not have confidence in the effectiveness of community sentences or in the systems in place to apply them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para4"><a name="0901264000456">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in reassuring tones that the majority of those on the sentencing council will be sentencers, but I am not sure that I am wholly reassured by that because we want people who are challenging and objective in looking for evidence. Before I entered Parliament, I had the experience of seeing people on community service and seeing lives change. For example, one young man on community service was sent to work with a disabled swimming club. The experience of working with youngsters with severe disability totally changed his attitude to life because he realised that while he was a bit morose about some circumstances in his life, many people had a far worse time. Building relationships with those youngsters changed his attitude to offending. Many similar examples could be cited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para5"><a name="0901264000457">The problem with many offenders is that they have not created good relationships with other people. They do not see the victim as a person, and they do not see the victim&#146;s possessions as being owned by someone. They do not realise that stealing stuff or burning a house will damage people. That is why the concept of relational justice is so important. Bringing people up short by causing them to recognise that they are damaging other human beings, and turning that into a personal issue, can make a great difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para6"><a name="0901264000458">Community sentences achieve that far better than custodial sentences, although I am not arguing for or against either. What I am saying is that if our system is to achieve the necessary balance, we need to understand the effectiveness of community sentences, and make sentencers understand how they can be used to the benefit of the public by reducing crime and reoffending. That is why I asked my right hon. Friend in an intervention whether he would make it a responsibility of the sentencing council to look at what works in terms of preventing reoffending. I do not just want to see judicial statistics relating to disposals, important though they are; I want &#147;what works&#148; to drive the way in which the council produces frameworks and encourages sentencers to adopt them.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right. I look forward to discussing these issues with him in the Public Bill Committee, if his Whips do not keep him off it because of the independence of his views. The need to address issues such as literacy is something that, in many instances, neither prison sentences nor community sentences have been very good at. I know that my right hon. Friend gives high priority to the need to ensure that it is built more effectively into both prison and community sentences in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para11"><a name="0901264000467">I am well aware that my right hon. Friend also ascribes importance to making the benefit of community sentences visible. References have been made to luminous jackets enabling the public to see that people are undertaking such sentences, and I understand that wish, but I should like those undertaking community sentences to think of what they wear as a uniform in which they can take pride, and to start to show some consistency by turning up on time and so forth. The aim should be to help their rehabilitation rather than merely to shame them.</p>

 I recently visited a very good example of community sentencing at the Oriel cricket ground in Scarborough. I was told that the scheme was making relatively good progress in preventing reoffending. However, one of the magistrates present drew me up and said &#147;But, of course, the reoffending rates relate to the number of people who actually turn up to do the community service, not those who have been sentenced to it. We still have a large number of offenders who are given community sentences but do not turn up to do the time.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="st_o250"><a name="0901264000469"><a name="90126-0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="0901264000763"><b>Alun Michael:</b>
 I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, and that is why there must be swift and effective action if there are breaches. However, that action should not be too swift or else the early stages will not be passed, but it should be understood that failure to undertake a community sentence will be acted on very quickly. As with antisocial behaviour orders, the point is to say to people, &#147;If you accept that you ought to stop that sort of behaviour and that you should do what the court has asked of you in passing sentence, then the consequence will be rehabilitation and support for re-engagement in the community, but if you don&#146;t, the deal is off.&#148; That has to be a part of the deal, and it has to be seen by the public as being so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para12"><a name="0901264000470">My main point is that our focus must be on what works. My right hon.

Are there facts about the incidence of violence that mean that we can intervene to reduce that offending  <br>

and therefore reduce the likelihood of becoming victims?&#148; That approach has been a great success, and has been taken up elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para13"><a name="0901264000471">The media will always go for the frightening and the specific. We will always see on the front pages of newspapers the faces of people who have been beaten up, and there will always be incidents of that. That is a fact of life and I do not blame the media for reporting that; horrific incidents are horrific. However, what we can do is seek to reduce crime rates by adopting a clinical approach and reducing the opportunity for crime, rehabilitating people and challenging their behaviour in the community, so that it is not a question of their going away and coming back into the same environment, but a question of changing their behaviour over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para14"><a name="0901264000472">The sentencing council must be not a comfortable lawyers&#146; club, but an evidence-based body that helps sentencers do the right thing in preventing reoffending. I bear in mind the evidence we heard from Victim Support. The question was asked, &#147;In a sentence, what do victims want?&#148; The answer that was given was, &#147;Short of being able to turn the clock back and not be a victim of an offence in the first place, what victims would like to know is that it is not going to happen again.&#148; Therefore, the prevention of reoffending is not an alternative to supporting victims; it is, in fact, at the heart of supporting them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para15"><a name="0901264000473">Witness anonymity is an issue that requires great care. I appreciate the risks involved in that process, but intimidation and fear are very real factors that undermine justice. Many Members have had the experience of people coming to them and describing a series of events in their street or neighbourhood where a small number of individuals are able to get away with incidents of intimidation and cannot be brought to justice. Therefore, there is a need for the provisions on witness anonymity to be strengthened, albeit with care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para16"><a name="0901264000474">There is also a great need to address internet-related crime and nuisance, to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred at the end of his remarks. It is, I think, easy to agree on the actions that are needed to prevent child abuse, although it was not easy in the early stages to get agreement between the police and the internet industry on ways of preventing the display of what were incidences of child abuse&#151;not just pornography, but much more serious than that. There is a great need for a joined-up approach across Government Departments, where there is a great deal of duplication, in order to create a partnership right down to the local level to prevent internet-related crime and make the UK the safest place to do business online. A lot of work is going on, to which Parliament is contributing a great deal, such as through all-party groups in particular, and I commend those examples to my right hon. Friend.</p>

There is a need for adequate resources, but also for the capacity to move them to the right place at the right time. In the proposals before us, my right hon. Friend is grappling with the eternal dilemma of how to strike the balance between the national and local. It was suggested at one stage that if Nye Bevan had become Secretary of State for Education and Ellen Wilkinson had been Secretary of State for Health, we would have ended up with a local health service and   <br>

a national education service. In both those services, the tension between the national and the local always exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para18"><a name="0901264000476">That tension is inevitable in relation to coroners. There are not just the headline examples, which have been referred to in interventions, but very often there have been ordinary cases of people just wanting to know what happened and hoping that a coroner&#146;s inquiry will give them the answer. Our experience suggests that there is a need to amend the system in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para19"><a name="0901264000477">The second issue that I wish to discuss relates to health: the need to ensure the independence of medical evidence coming before the coroner&#146;s court. Again, all Members of Parliament will have had experience not only of NHS trusts that are good and open when things have gone wrong, but of NHS trusts that are defensive and that seek to avoid getting down to the facts in difficult cases. We need certainty that medical evidence will be objective and based only on medical professionalism. I hope that as this Bill goes through its processes my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will find ways to increase the assurance about that independence of medical evidence, because I am sure he is as concerned as I am, and as the Committee has been, on that point. There is perhaps a need to re-examine that part of the Bill to ensure that objectivity can be built in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para20"><a name="0901264000478">The Bill addresses some important issues. It deals not, as I first thought, with a series of small issues, but with some of the big issues in relation to improving our justice system. It does so not in terms of great symbolic gestures that change the earth, but by dealing with things such as the sharing of information and way in which sentencing is undertaken, where we do need progressively to find more objective, more evidence-based means of finding the right way forward.</p>

A red rag is a provision in a Bill that is designed to attract the attention of hot-headed Members of this House, and about which the Government do not, in reality, care very much either way, while they smuggle in, largely unnoticed and unchallenged, a lot of significant stuff that otherwise might attract severe criticism. The problem with this Bill is that it is not entirely clear which provisions are the red rags and which are the contraband. Working on the general principle that to avoid scrutiny in Committee, the usual tactic is to put the contraband at the end and the red rag at the start, my guess is that the provisions on data sharing are the contraband and those on secret inquests are the red rag.</p>

It is right to say that data sharing can be a good thing&#151;I would not deny many of the remarks made by the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90126-0010.htm_para25"><a name="09012622000006">Clause 152 would create amazingly broad exemptions to the principles of the data protection legislation. If the issue were specific exemptions from specific powers, it would be a different matter, but we are not. The Bill would allow Ministers to authorise data sharing between any person and any other person, regardless of what any other legislation&#151;apart from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000&#151;says. So that would be despite what the data protection and the human rights legislation say about privacy. Under clause 152 in proposed new section 50B(h), a data-sharing order would be allowed to &#147;modify any enactment&#148;.</p>

 That would appear to be possible, because of the power to allow any person to share any data despite what any enactment says. The Government say that the intention is to allow Departments, public bodies and other similar organisations to share data for good purposes, but that is not what the Bill says. The Bill is not confined to public bodies and would also allow the sharing of data with private organisations in any country.</p>

Under the Bill, the Government would be able to authorise sharing the data collected in the national identity database with absolutely anyone without any of the safeguards in the Act.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to cite a potential parliamentary tactic, in that those measures are at the end of the Bill.

 That is a very important point, and I hope that the Government and the usual channels are listening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09012622000033">Let us turn to subject of secret inquests without juries. My starting point is that the Bill is already somewhat defective as it fails to guarantee that there will be a jury in any case where there is reason to suspect that the death occurred in any way at the hands of the state. Provisions in the Bill move in that direction, but they do not go far enough. Deaths at the hands of the police and in custody count, but a jury should be required in any case of any death in which state power is implicated. My starting point is therefore with the jury rather than with secrecy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09012622000034">There are problems with secrecy and privacy&#151;it is important to recall the points raised by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), such as the question of how a family will get closure if it is excluded from the process&#151;but the jury is at the heart of the question. The main historic function of the inquest jury is to provide a check on the abuse of state power and on the temptations for state officials to mislead and to gloss over the facts about what has happened.</p>

In my view, the Government appear to think that juries are not to be trusted&#151;that juries are members of the general public and that we need to have as few of them taking part in the process as possible. That seems to me to be entirely the opposite of the attitude that we should be taking. Instead, we should be looking for ways in which juries can take part in even the most sensitive cases. As the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, if there is a limit to how sensitive the information might be, we can deal with that by excluding some of it from the information made available to the juries. Our initial reaction should not be that the best thing to do is to get rid of the jury.</p>

of view of maintaining faith in the system that when the Government assert in such a case that nothing really went wrong, they should be able to say, even if all the facts do not come out in public, that the matter was decided by independent members of the public who were not part of the state or of the Government apparatus and that those people back up what the Government say.</p>

Thankfully, the provisions in that measure that allow the Secretary of State to influence the selection of a special, trusty coroner have been removed from this Bill.

I suppose that one might wonder what unreal harm to the public interest might be but, even so, the conditions seem extraordinarily broad</p>

 Absolutely. It would be a far better procedure to put the whole question into the hands of the judiciary in the first place, rather than into the hands of the Secretary of State. Part of the background problem is that the Executive distrust almost everyone else. In the Counter-Terrorism Bill, they attempted to take control of the selection of judges: that proposal was got rid of, but they are still obsessed with having some control over getting rid of anyone in the process who they feel might not be on their side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09012622000041">That leads me to another point&#151;the link that the Bill makes between the use of intercept evidence and the absence of a jury. I and many other hon. Members favour greater use of intercept evidence in the criminal justice system in general, and I believe that many of the Government&#146;s objections to that are incomprehensible when compared with what happens in other countries. I welcome this small chink in the Government&#146;s previous opposition to the use of intercept evidence in court, but I do not like at all the way the use of intercept evidence is linked with getting rid of the jury. The idea that intercept evidence can be used only when members of the general public are excluded from a case would be a dangerous precedent to allow when it comes to the future development of this part of the law.</p>

Even so, if the Government are interested, I will take up their offer of trying to work towards a better solution to the problem.</p>

Some of the material&#151;such as the references to knives and criminal memoirs&#151;is plainly designed for the media grid. By the way, the provisions relating to criminal memoirs contain an amazing section that enshrines populism in statute. When deciding what to do about criminal memoirs, the court will have to take into account whether the public would be offended by the criminal making money out of them. The Bill might as well say that the court should pay attention to what the editors of the <i> Daily Mail </i>and <i> The Sun </i>think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09012622000044">I do not oppose everything in the Bill, as some of its provisions are to be welcomed, but I believe that parliamentary scrutiny of the rest of it will be largely prevented by the fact that so many different subjects have been jammed together. However, some of the material in the Bill needs more than just tidying up, because it is seriously misguided. I am referring to the attempted reforms of the law of murder, which the Secretary of State passed over very rapidly in his speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09012622000045">The impact assessment reveals that the intention of the reform is to convict more people of murder and fewer of manslaughter. It talks about 100 to 200 more murder convictions over the next eight years, at a cost of between &#163;4 million and &#163;8 million. People will no longer be convicted of manslaughter: they will be convicted of murder instead, but who will those people be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09012622000046">One group who will be convicted of murder rather than manslaughter might be mercy killers. At present, they are often&#151;but not always, as a case last year showed&#151;convicted of manslaughter, rather than of murder, by reason of diminished responsibility. That is because the present definition of manslaughter is fairly loose. It says that a person</p>
<a name="90126-0011.htm_brev5"><a name="09012622000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mind&#148;</p>

<a name="90126-0011.htm_brev6"><a name="09012622000141"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as substantially impaired his mental responsibility&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09012622000048">That is quite vague stuff, and it allows prosecutors and courts some leeway when deciding whether to go for a charge of murder or manslaughter. Under the Bill, however, the defendant will have to have suffered from a specific, recognised medical condition, and not just from some &#147;abnormality of mind&#148; or other problem. Moreover, the Bill requires the condition involved specifically to have caused the homicide, and not just reduced the defendant&#146;s responsibility for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para26"><a name="09012622000049">There are different views on mercy killing. Personally, I oppose euthanasia, but I cannot see what good it does to hand out more mandatory life sentences to mercy killers as opposed to letting the judge decide the penalty.

&#147;a dog&#146;s breakfast&#148; and &#147;a pantomime horse&#148;. One group of defendants who under the new definitions might well find themselves convicted of murder rather than manslaughter&#151;although that would be contrary to what the Government apparently intend&#151;are abused wives. The Bill retains a condition in the current law that has often thrown into doubt an abused wife&#146;s ability to use a provocation defence. That condition is that there must be a loss of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para29"><a name="09012622000053">I am not a criminal lawyer, so I have always been rather puzzled by the requirement in the law that there must be a loss of control for provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter. It seems to me that, apart from contract killings, all murders involve some sort of loss of control, but I am reliably informed that that is not the view that the law takes and that wives who kill their abusive husbands by waiting for them to go to sleep and then attacking them, for example, are usually said not to have lost control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para30"><a name="09012622000054">The Bill seeks to overcome that problem by declaring in clause 41(2) that</p>
<a name="90126-0011.htm_brev7"><a name="09012622000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it does not matter whether...the loss of control was sudden.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para31"><a name="09012622000055">That does not seem to help at all. Loss of control must happen at some point. Someone has control, and then they do not. In some cases, there might be a longer lead-in time for the loss of control&#151;it might take a longer time, rather than a shorter one, to lose control&#151;but in the end, there comes a point where control is lost. A statute can do many things, but it cannot change reality. An abused wife will have to show that she lost control at the point that she killed to qualify under the statute. If she has not lost control at that point, she will still be guilty of murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90126-0011.htm_para32"><a name="09012622000056">The Government also say that clause 42(3) means that it is enough to convert murder to manslaughter through provocation, or what replaces it, to fear serious violence from the husband, but that is not what the clause says. It says that a loss of control can be attributable to such a fear. If there is no loss of control in the first place, the fear is not relevant. So I fear that, under the Bill, the 100 to 200 extra convictions for murder will include abused wives.</p>

They are not threatened with serious violence, but neither do they have, in the words of the statute,</p>

much whether there are many cases of that sort at all, at least in England. There was one such case in Scotland not so long ago. As far as I can tell from the past 10 or 20 years, that attempted defence usually fails. These days, if sexual infidelity is relevant at all in a murder case, it is relevant in terms of diminished responsibility, rather than provocation, so I do not think that the prisons will be filled with men who previously would not have received a mandatory life sentence by reason of a crime passionnel. In fact, as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield mentioned, the existence of that clause is somewhat puzzling.

I am surprised that the Government seem to have gone that way. Disturbingly, the Bill seems to be almost designed to allow honour killings to count as manslaughter, not murder. The Human Rights Watch definition of honour killing is</p>
<a name="90126-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="09012622000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;acts of violence, usually murder, committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonour upon the family.

The Bill potentially treats such a case as one of losing control by reason of having a sense of being seriously wronged. Admittedly, the word &#147;justifiable&#148; comes into the definition, but the question is: justifiable to whom? The Bill does not say, and in any case the issue seems to be left eventually to the jury. The same point applies to other parts of the definition. In picking out sexual infidelity, but not picking out honour killing, the Bill is doing something quite disturbing. The whole attempt to deal with the law of murder seems to be arbitrary. I urge the Government to recognise that clauses 39 to 43 are a mess and should be withdrawn.</p>

think that assisting suicide is not necessarily wrong if the right sort of safeguards are in place. That, of course, is the position of my party. Admittedly, some forms of assisting suicide could amount to encouraging suicide in some circumstances, but that is precisely what the debate on safeguards is about. I should like the two issues of encouraging suicide and assisting suicide to be clearly separated, and the Bill simply does not do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09012622000065">On anonymous witnesses, I simply note that the Bill does not deal with the central problem that was raised when we discussed the temporary Bill last summer: the provision of independent or special counsel, which would overcome many of the difficulties that that Bill produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09012622000066">The provision on the anonymity of witnesses in investigations seems useful, but will it really help? There is a serious problem with witnesses not coming forward in gang-type crimes, but the Government are suggesting that it will be a crime for someone to give the name of someone about whom an order has been made to another person, where an investigation has taken place into gang crime. The question is: who will be the defendant in such a prosecution? The answer, it seems, is that it could only be a police officer, so we are making it a crime for a police officer to give out the name of a potential witness. Let us think about the reality of the situation. Will it really have a big effect on potential witnesses from estates threatened by gang violence if the police can say to them, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, we&#146;ll make an order protecting your identity, and if it is broken, the police will prosecute the police&#148;? That does not seem a very practical idea on how to increase the confidence of witnesses. Witnesses are certainly threatened; I do not deny the existence of the problem, but the measure seems more symbolic than real.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09012622000067">I urge the House to look at clause 87, which deals with the examination of the accused through intermediaries. It is about the problem of what happens when someone is suffering from a mental illness or other disability and cannot give evidence. There is already provision for ordinary witnesses to be asked questions through intermediaries; that is there to help them. The Bill extends that facility to defendants, but there is a serious question: if a defendant cannot understand the proceedings to the extent that they need that help, why are they on trial? Why are they not unfit to plead? So far, the Government have produced no explanation on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09012622000068">The Bill contains a lot of good stuff about video-recording evidence and live links, but I have a question on clause 94, in which the Government propose a subtle amendment to section 138 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It looks good, except for the fact that the provision has never been brought into force, although the Government have had six years to do so. Why are they amending something that they could not be bothered bring into force in the first place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09012622000069">I have a similar question on the bail provisions. I can find no impact assessment on what effect changing the rules on bail for those charged with murder is expected to have. At any one time, about 50 or 60 people accused of murder appear to be on bail. How many of those people do the Government expect to be remanded in custody as a result of the Bill, and what change do the Government expect that to make to a person&#146;s chances of being the victim of murder?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09012622000070">My final point is on the sentencing council. The Government are to be congratulated on not falling for the most prescriptive models for sentencing guidelines, although they have chosen a fairly restrictive model. They are also to be congratulated on the provision that the Secretary of State mentioned, under which the council should take into account the relative effectiveness of sentences in preventing reoffending. I agree strongly with what the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said about what works; that has to be built into the criminal justice system from top to bottom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09012622000071">The problem is that the Government seem to be pursuing two entirely different criminal justice policies in the same Bill. The model of the grid that they put forward seems entirely predicated on the seriousness of the offence and the harm caused. When it comes to carrying out the guidelines in practice, as opposed to talking vaguely about them, the guidelines have no room for preventing reoffending. For the success of restorative justice programmes, what matters might well be whether the offence was committed against a specific human victim&#151;the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth mentioned this point&#151;who is willing to take part in a process of restorative justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09012622000072">For treatment options, such as treatment for drug and alcohol misuse, the personal characteristics of the offender might matter more than the nature of the offence. The sentencing ranges that the Government have chosen are built entirely on the retribution view of sentencing. In practice, that view will completely squeeze out all the things that the right hon. Gentleman and I want to see in those guidelines. That matters, because although the Secretary of State is right that putting the victim at the heart of the criminal justice system is important, it is also important that we consider not only present and past victims, but future ones. The purpose of the criminal justice system must be to ensure, as far as is possible, that there are as few future victims as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09012622000073">I therefore ask the House, for the reasons set out in our amendment, not to pass the Bill today. It contains some good proposals, but also dangerous proposals on data sharing, and proposals on secret inquests that are, though a red rag, undesirable. A lot of the rest of the Bill seems ill-thought-through, rushed and muddled.</p>

everybody is far too afraid to act as a witness. He needs to be aware of that fact. As the provisions that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is trying to introduce on anonymous witnesses are meant to address that specific problem, the hon. Member for Cambridge should not be so squeamish about the means of dealing with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o269"><a name="09012622000077"><a name="90126-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="09012622000171"><b>David Howarth:</b>

 The hon. Gentleman has at least gone part of the way with me in recognising the problem, but having recognised it, he must at some stage will the means to resolve the problem.

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09012622000079">I did not intend to go off on that diversion. I intended to begin by commenting briefly on the Bill&#146;s provisions for reform of the coroner system. I come to this subject from the perspective of having a number of constituents who tragically lost loved ones in the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989. Together with several bereaved constituents, I attended one day of the coroner&#146;s mini-inquests. In total, the proceedings lasted for 90 days. In March 1991 a verdict of accidental death was returned for the 96 people who had died attending a football match.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09012622000080">The individual mini-inquests were held on the revolving door principle, with approximately eight cases being heard a day. That was a horrendous experience for the families involved. The gross insensitivity of focusing on the blood alcohol readings created the wholly false impression that that was a significant contributory factor in the disaster, when it had already been established by the Taylor inquiry that</p>
<a name="90126-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="09012622000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09012622000081">I mention this not to rake over the coals of the tragedy, but to highlight why the coroner&#146;s procedure adopted caused such distress and offence to the bereaved families. For this reason I welcome the reforms proposed in the Bill, at least in principle. However, I ask Ministers to reflect on my comments on the Hillsborough mini-inquests and see whether the Bill can be improved to ensure that that situation is never allowed to occur again. I hope there will never be another disaster on that scale, but I also hope that if there ever is, the bereaved families will not be put through the wringer as the Hillsborough families were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09012622000082">I turn to the sentencing provisions in part 4. I had the privilege of serving on the sentencing working group which, following the Carter report, was charged with examining the merits and feasibility of a structured sentencing framework and establishing a sentencing commission. The group, which was expertly chaired by Lord Justice Gage, made a number of recommendations, many of which, I am pleased to say, have found their way into the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09012622000083">Because sentencing has such an immediate and real effect, it is one of those areas where there should be a clear link between the detail of the policy, the underlying  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Jan 2009">

<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>26 Jan 2009 : Column 72</b><br>
principles and the practical consequences that follow. We have a duty to ensure that sentencing policy is fair to the victims of crime, that society as a whole has confidence in our justice system, and that offenders recognise that the sentences that they receive are proportionate to their crimes and are consistently applied. Regrettably, a lack of consistency is a significant contributory factor to the alarming decline in public confidence in the criminal justice system in recent years, and we must recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09012622000084">We should also recognise that sentencing has a direct impact on offending in three ways. First, the most direct impact, surprisingly, is the most overlooked. It is difficult for most offenders to commit further crimes while they are serving a custodial sentence. As the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) put it when he was Home Secretary, prison does work&#151;in that context, at least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09012622000085">Secondly, sentences should, wherever possible, include the potential for practical and effective rehabilitation. I use the words &#147;practical&#148; and &#147;effective&#148; advisedly. We must be honest. Not all rehabilitation, and not all community sentences, are effective. We should not believe that in every case they are a panacea. In some cases they are not. Thirdly, sentences act as a deterrent that reduces reoffending and discourages potential offending in the first place. All three impacts are too often overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09012622000086">On the practicalities of sentencing, the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) seemed to get himself in a muddle. I say that with regret. When I listen to him in the House, he is usually fluent, tolerant and logical, but in his speech he created a muddle between the idea of balancing correctional resources and the sentences that are passed. He railed, rightly, against early release schemes. I agree with him. There is nothing worse than an early release scheme for undermining the whole sentencing system. By definition, releasing anyone early without good reason undermines the sentence that the court passed on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09012622000087">However, the hon. and learned Gentleman ruled out any predictability in the need for correctional resources. He said that it was up to the courts to decide what those should be, but if we do not predict with more accuracy than in the past how many prison places are needed, or how many places are needed on community sentences, the inevitable consequence is that sometimes we will get it wrong. If we under-provide, there is only one way to deal with that&#151;by means of early release schemes. That is what has happened repeatedly in the post-war history of sentencing. At some point, there is no alternative. The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Either there is predictability in the system so that we have a reasonable idea what correctional facilities are necessary, or there is no predictability, and at some point in the cycle, early release schemes will have to be introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09012622000088">While serving on the sentencing working group, I was surprised and disappointed to discover&#151;this is another point that the hon. and learned Gentleman failed to take into account&#151;how little we know about, and how little we are able to measure, the variations in sentencing. We commissioned a limited survey of our own, which I do not claim was the last word on the subject. It revealed a number of interesting facts, the most notable of which was that almost half the sentences passed by the courts in England fell outside the guideline ranges.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>26 Jan 2009 : Column 73</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09012622000089">Courts need to have some flexibility and to exercise some judgment, but do we really think that 50 per cent. of their sentences falling outside the guideline ranges is a good thing? Does any hon. Member want to interrupt me and say, &#147;Surely we should celebrate that&#148;? If nobody is prepared to do that, there must be a general acceptance that it is not a good thing. Whether courts are over-sentencing or under-sentencing, that cannot be right. We need far more information and a clearer picture of what is going on throughout the country. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers have accepted that we need more data so that we can be clearer about how the sentencing system is working. I welcome the fact that the Bill provides for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09012622000090">Four key issues are pertinent to the Bill. The first is the challenge of balancing consistency with judicial flexibility in individual cases. The second is the challenge of ensuring that there are adequate correctional resources available to meet demand without compromising justice in individual cases. The third is the role of the Lord Chief Justice in the new sentencing council, and the fourth is the role of Parliament in setting guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09012622000091">On the challenge of balancing consistency and flexibility, the group on which I served was extremely clear that there needs to be improved consistency in sentencing, while still allowing for judicial flexibility in individual cases. We recommended, for example, that there should be definitive guidelines for all major high-volume offences, and further narrative guidance on the treatment of previous convictions and aggravating and mitigating factors. To be fair, we were less clear about how to deal with cases where the intended sentence departed from the normal range.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09012622000092">At present, the court is required to have regard to any guidelines relevant to the offender&#146;s case. Discretion to stray from those guidelines can be granted only if the court can give reasons for such a departure. There is an alternative approach, which gives the courts more flexibility and simply requires guidelines to be followed unless the court is satisfied that that would be contrary to the interests of justice. Although the majority of the sentencing working group supported that approach, my own view, as indicated in the report, is that the existing requirements should be retained because they provide more consistency while still allowing flexibility in individual cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90126-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09012622000093">Clause 103 sets specific requirements on how sentencing guidelines should be laid out by the sentencing council. In my view, the clause contains little, if anything, that is not already covered in at least some of the sentencing guidelines. However, specifying the requirements in the Bill will help to achieve the aim of greater predictability and assist attempts to collect relevant data on actual sentencing practice across the whole country. Having a greater understanding of that practice will help the planning of correctional resources to be more effective, and give us the opportunity to revisit the issue of consistency in sentencing in a more informed way in future.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090126/debtext/90126-0013.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09012622000094">That leads to my second point, which is about the challenge of ensuring that adequate correctional resources are available to meet the demands of the criminal justice system, while also ensuring that individual circumstances are taken into account. The sentencing working group recognised that it is important to match the supply of correctional services to the demand for them. We considered the practicality of giving the sentencing council a duty to design guidelines that would match capacity. However, given the lack of systematic information  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Jan 2009">

available on sentences passed, we concluded that that would be impractical. Instead, we recommended that Parliament should express its intentions with regard to correctional resources at regular intervals. Personally, I believe that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) and his Select Committee could have a role in that, although to make that case in this debate would probably stretch the point too far; perhaps it would be better to debate the issue in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09012622000095">Our view was that the effect of such an obligation on Parliament, combined with an assessment by the sentencing council of the effects of guidelines on correctional resources, would allow for more rational planning. As I outlined earlier, the ability of the correctional system to cope with demand is an essential element in achieving justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09012622000096">The third issue that I wish to cover is the role of the Lord Chief Justice in the new sentencing council. There has been some debate about that. Our working group studied the matter carefully, and we were clear that the workload of the chair of the sentencing council would be too substantial for the Lord Chief Justice to be appropriate; it would require a commensurate time commitment. However, we did recommend that the chair should be a member of the senior judiciary, appointed by both the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor. It is clear to me, however, that the Lord Chief Justice should have a transparent and formal mechanism so that he can have some input into the work of the council. Perhaps that could be achieved through an appointed representative empowered to speak on his behalf during any deliberations in the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09012622000097">My final point is about the role of Parliament in setting sentencing guidelines. The working group did not come to a unanimous view on the role of Parliament. The majority believed that it would be inappropriate for there to be a duty requiring the sentencing council to consider Parliament&#146;s intentions on resources when formulating guidelines, and that Parliament should have no role in approving any guidelines before they are implemented. The minority view of the group&#151;a view that I share&#151;supported a more active role for Parliament, perhaps including the Justice Committee, in relation to both those points. That would mean that the sentencing council would have a statutory duty to consider Parliament&#146;s intention in relation to resources, and that Parliament would be able to approve guidelines before they came into practice. The obvious rationale for that approach is that, ultimately, Parliament is the only mechanism available for public accountability in relation to sentencing and its implementation. Manifestly, an independent judiciary cannot be held accountable in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09012622000098">We need to recognise that a fair sentencing system requires the application of clear principles. In turn, a more consistent approach, flexible enough to take individual circumstances into account, will reduce unexplained variation and reoffending, and could increase public confidence. I welcome and support the Bill, but I give notice that at a later stage&#151;and subject to further consideration of the issues to which I have referred&#151;I might well table my own amendments.</p>

straining at the leash to gnaw at this amalgam of a Bill. I shall touch on just two points. First, I support my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) on clause 152, about which I am deeply concerned. Personally, I feel that it is a further step down the &#147;brave new world&#148; path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09012622000100">Last year, I put it to the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), a Minister at the Ministry of Justice, that the more the Government increase personal data and centralise them, the more valuable those data will become to those whom we would all wish not to have them. The Minister answered that there would be tough safeguards. That is utterly inadequate. First, the Government&#146;s record on losing data is spectacularly poor. Secondly, if the Pentagon computers can be hacked into, I suspect that Ministry of Justice files and many of the others can also be hacked into, perhaps more easily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09012622000101">Thirdly, and more fundamentally, there is no real safeguard against an individual with key access being paid or politically persuaded to provide illegal access. When, last year, I put that concern to the Association of Chief Police Officers representative leading on the central records, such as DNA records, of criminal&#151;and now, increasingly, non-criminal&#151;individuals, he admitted that that was his one greatest area of fear, deep fear. Many of us have watched with deepening concern the Government&#146;s increasing collection of personal data on individuals and the consequential state intrusion into our personal lives. I see this step as representing an appalling risk of further infringement. It would be nice to think that, under persuasion, Ministers would step back&#151;but somehow, I doubt whether they will. I hope that the next Government&#151;a Conservative one&#151;will draw back on that issue, and on others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09012622000102">I now turn to a more positive issue for me personally. My main interest in the Bill is about the aspects that relate to children and crimes against them. I shall pick only one of them&#151;the provisions relating to images of children. Those provisions represent a new change, one that for some years I have been trying to put on the statute book through discussions with Ministers and attempted amendments, and I welcome them. It has been well known for some time that the quality of computer-generated images is such that computer-literate paedophiles have been using software to produce pseudo-images of child abuse pornography. I am delighted that, at long last, Ministers have recognised the concerns; hence the new legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09012622000103">However, I should also like to suggest some concerns. Clause 53 outlines the penalty for the new offence. Interestingly, as I read the clause, the convicted offender will not automatically be placed on the sex offenders register. As he winds up, will the Minister say whether I am correct? If I am, could such a provision be added at the appropriate stage? Secondly, the maximum penalty for making or distributing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of child abuse is 10 years, while the maximum penalty for possession of such photographs or pseudo-photographs is five years. Clause 53 sets a maximum penalty of three years. It seems more appropriate that the maximum penalty in the clause should be similar to those that I mentioned&#151;five years for possession, and 10 for making and distributing. I anticipate that in cases involving pseudo-photographs, the defence will  <br>

The success of this clause, and others concerning similar photographs, depends on detection. One of the difficulties is the increasing use of encryption. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the maximum penalty for failure to produce, on request by the police, the key to access such data is two years. It is blindingly obvious that any individual arrested on suspicion of having encrypted data relating to sexual abuse of children, including under these clauses, will refuse to give the key and risk a penalty of two years instead of revealing the key and risking a penalty of three, five or 10 years, as appropriate. I have raised this concern many times before, and perhaps the simplest way of concluding is to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to my private Member&#146;s Bill, which he might like to pick up and adapt to this Bill at the appropriate time.</p>

 I share many of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) about how we legislate for activities on the internet. We are having to make progress in this area slowly and develop our legislation accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09012622000106">I am keen to raise several issues that stem largely from my experiences last year, when a cluster of suicides in and around my constituency reached international attention through the media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09012622000107">The purpose of the coroner is simple and well defined in the draft charter for bereaved people published alongside the Bill. A coroner&#146;s investigation is required if a death is violent, unnatural, of unknown cause or takes place while the person is detained by the state. It is the duty of the coroner service to establish whether an investigation is required and, if so, to ascertain the identity of the person who died, how, when and where they died, and&#151;for me, most importantly&#151;to assist in the prevention of future deaths and to provide public reassurance. Those requirements accord with article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which establishes the right to life. I will focus my three areas of concern on the last two requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09012622000108">I welcome the fact that the Bill provides coroners with additional powers, but there is, sadly, a case for further powers: first, to assist with the building of national, universal data collection frameworks to ensure that an increased range of information is routinely gathered; and secondly, to enable coroners to instigate, conduct and co-operate with psychological autopsies, especially where we have a cluster of deaths. Members may be aware that in England, but not in Wales, there is a national primary care suicide audit tool kit. All PCTs in England are required to show trends in suicide rates and trajectories and to provide action plans for delivery towards the national target of reducing suicide rates by 20 per cent. by 2010. However, PCTs give different priority to the suicide audits and use different methods of data collection, and therefore fail to develop a national, universal database. The suicide audit was rolled out by the Department of Health, and Members may question what relevance this has to a coroners Bill. The national  <br>

suicide prevention strategy advisory group has acknowledged the need to record more detailed information in a number of areas and is monitoring suicide rates following self-harm, among different ethnic minority groups and occupations, and in relation to inequalities in social class. Currently, available data do not give information about whether an individual has had contact with statutory services in the period prior to suicide. We know that one in four people is likely to have had contact with the health service before they die and that many more will have had contact with the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09012622000109">It is essential that such information is collected in order to identify the potential for intervention through the points of contact that those who take their lives had with available services and where lessons can be learned to help to prevent future suicides. The coroner service provides an excellent possible source for the development of these databases, and it is important that we develop its data collection provision. There has been a rise in the number of narrative verdicts being delivered by coroners, which, unlike open verdicts, are not included when suicide data are collected. Recent statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice indicate a greater use of open verdicts over a number of years by some district coroners. The coroner service is in a crucial position, and coroners&#146; verdicts provide essential information for monitoring public health. Consistent recording of causes of death is a vital component of the service, and I hope that the Bill will introduce the potential to develop it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09012622000110">The problem was exemplified by Bridgend, where no detailed research has been carried out to examine the reasons why a cluster of suicides occurred and no research-based remedial action has been recommended. Importantly, Bridgend is not alone in needing that analysis. Bridgend did not have the highest suicide rate in Wales; in fact, it was 48th worst in the UK in 1998 to 2004, and four Welsh unitary authorities ranked higher. None of the inquests into the suicides across Bridgend has provided an explanation as to why the young people died in increasing numbers. Around the world, Bridgend was labelled a suicide town, the suicide capital of the UK, even a death cult town. The media stepped into the gap left by a failure to explain why the deaths were happening and ran with the story of an internet-based death cult. That story had no basis in fact, but since there had been no in-depth investigation of why the deaths occurred, it had&#151;as I am told the expression is&#151;legs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09012622000111">The deputy children&#146;s commissioner for Wales, Maria Battle, shared my concern and wrote to the Welsh Minister for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills a year ago asking for a thorough investigation into each of the young persons&#146; deaths, to include all the agencies, and a thorough investigation into whether there were any links and, if so, what they were. She stressed that it was important that the investigations be as comprehensive as possible, in a local and a national context. As the local MP, I am not aware of any such investigation being undertaken. I am aware that, locally, people have been left anxious and confused, and that each new death brings fear and anxiety that a new cluster may be about to form.</p>

and much of that knowledge has been accrued through psychological autopsies that have taken place, notably under Professor Keith Hawton and England&#146;s mental health tsar, Professor Louis Appleby. Psychological autopsies are a method of research that reconstructs the lifestyle and personality traits of the person who committed suicide, including the collection of detailed information from a number of different sources. We need to understand the reasons why clusters occur, so that things could be done to improve services locally, nationally across the UK, and even internationally. Perhaps health or education services could be adapted to meet the needs of the more vulnerable. Under the Bill, organisations and agencies will have a duty to respond to recommendations made by the coroner and to outline actions that they will take to prevent further deaths. That extremely positive way forward would be welcomed by everyone.</p>

Information must routinely be collected by coroners, providing universal data on all suicides, open verdicts and clusters of death. A universal data pool may be able to highlight trends that were not immediately identified by the local coroner, as nationally collected data provide opportunities for comparison and further learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09012622000114">I am aware that Liberty has argued that an extension of narrative verdicts would provide better answers to the questions of the bereaved about the circumstances of a death, and prevent further fatalities. However, unless we have a national system of psychological autopsies, we will not have the in-depth analysis that parents so often desire. To achieve such a system will require additional resources, and I am keen for the Bill to be expanded to allow senior coroners to be adequately resourced and staffed to commission such autopsies. It is vital that researchers and coroners can work together effectively, so that opportunities to prevent further needless deaths are not missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09012622000115">The second issue that I wish briefly to address is the protection of young and vulnerable people online. Like other Members, I would like to thank Professor Tanya Byron for guiding me through that new world, and I congratulate the Government on taking forward a number of the recommendations in her review, &#147;Safer Children in a Digital World&#148;.

The role of the internet and new technology in suicide was a theme of the meeting. Representatives from across the industry were present, and a lively discussion took place. There was no unanimous verdict, and strong feelings were expressed both for and against the banning of pro-suicide and suicide recipe sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09012622000120">Two phenomena need attention: the possibility that the internet may induce suicide or encourage someone vulnerable to commit suicide, and the possibility that it may provide details of suicide methods to someone who wishes to die. Those two types of site are commonly grouped together, but there is a grey area between the encouragement of suicide and the active engagement of individuals in suicide and the promotion of their death, and we need to ensure that we protect people by addressing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09012622000121">Samaritans has expressed concern that the legal definition of &#147;encouraging or assisting suicide&#148; could create a difficulty for young people who use the internet, text messages and e-mail to discuss their suicidal thoughts and intentions. My reading of the Bill suggests that that will not happen, but there will be those who are anxious about attempts to bring the use of that new technology within the Bill. In contrast to the view of Samaritans, Papyrus is concerned that the word &#147;intent&#148;, used in the Bill, needs further clarification to ensure that the wording is strong enough to ensure that prosecutions are successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90126-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09012622000122">There is limited research in the area, and it is provided mainly by Professor Keith Hawton and his colleagues from the centre for suicide research. They have searched online for sites providing information on suicide methods and found that one in five were dedicated suicide sites, half of which encouraged or promoted suicide and half of which contained personal and other accounts of methods. Only 13 per cent. of the sites that they found offered support or preventive action, which I find a really frightening statistic. Google and Microsoft tell me that they use search engine optimisation to try to promote support sites, but it is still not too difficult to find more worrying sites if one delves past the first page. Those companies indicated that they were not averse to doing more, but that they were keen not to lose their conduit status. We have to address that.</p>

It will be a complex task to account for those sites and have them taken down, but if the House is worth anything, it has to be worthy of taking to task new technology and finding a way of framing legislation that will allow us to protect vulnerable people, while still allowing technology to develop and expand so that we have new ways of exploring ideas. We must take seriously our responsibility to protect the vulnerable.</p>

A lot of concern has been expressed in the debate about the holding of coroners&#146; hearings in private, but I want to represent my constituents who have come to me and described how their children have taken their own lives, and how they felt. They are angry, distressed and aggrieved that if their child had committed a crime, their privacy and anonymity would have been respected, but because they took their own life, the facts of their life were made public and spread across the media. We desperately need to consider how we can ensure that the coroner system protects the privacy of children who, because of their frailty, vulnerability and confusion, take their lives. That is a matter that I will wish to consider during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

 When my father-in-law was in the police force, one of the jobs that he dreaded was being sent to somebody&#146;s house late at night to knock on the door and inform them that their son or daughter had been killed, usually in a motor accident. We all expect to outlive our children, and it is every parent&#146;s nightmare to get that knock on the door. Sadly, as many young people learn to drive, they do not learn to use alcohol responsibly. Despite the fact that the most recent figures for deaths on our roads have fallen to a record low&#151;below 3,000 for the first time&#151;460 fatal accidents involve drink-drivers. It is important to send a clear message to those who flout the drink-driving laws that the criminal justice system will deal with them severely.</p>

Indeed, we were all contacted by Jan, who sent us an e-mail about her campaign to highlight a specific matter. I visited her and learned about the Kelly campaign. On 16 July 2006 at 3.55 in the morning, Jan&#146;s daughter Kelly was killed. She was one of four passengers in a car that was being driven back from a house-warming party. The driver, Andrew John Burrell, had passed his test only eight weeks previously and bought his car only four weeks previously, for &#163;400. The car was travelling down Marsh House avenue in Billingham and the police estimated its speed as being 53 mph in a 30 mph area. Despite braking, it was travelling at 20 mph when it hit a tree. Of the passengers, Claire Dewar suffered serious head injuries, a broken leg and a broken pelvis and Kelly Woodward, despite wearing a seat belt and despite the fact that an off-duty nurse was at the scene very soon, sadly died of her injuries. Kelly was just starting out in life&#151;she had completed a course in hairdressing in Hartlepool and was getting her feet on the ground when her life was so  <br>

tragically cut short. The driver had drunk twice the drink-driving limit and was given a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence and a three-year driving ban. There was widespread outrage in the area that the sentence was not severe enough. On appeal, the sentence was increased to four and a half years in prison with a five-year driving ban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09012622000129">What appalled Mrs. Woodward more than anything was the fact that the ban did not start on the young man&#146;s release, but from the date of the trial. If he served his full sentence, the ban would be for only six months&#151;not a strong message to send to people in such circumstances. I was fortunate to catch Mr. Speaker&#146;s eye during Prime Minister&#146;s questions on 19 March and raised the issue. The Prime Minister said that the Government would consider the matter. I was surprised to get a call just over a week ago from the Justice Secretary, who said that the Government had listened to me and the Bill would contain a provision to address the issue, so that if a judge imposes a ban and a prison sentence at the same time, a longer ban will be given. I am therefore grateful to the Government for listening&#151;I suppose that it is another example of the way in which the Conservative party these days is a bit of a think tank for the Government on some issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09012622000130">Another aspect has not been tackled, and I hope that the Government will consider it. The Bill changes cases when a sentence and a ban are issued at the same time, but does not address circumstances in which someone who is banned from driving, perhaps for causing death by dangerous driving, subsequently commits another offence and goes to jail. The ban continues to operate while the person is in prison. In some cases, the sentence may use up the entire ban, and the person can drive home from prison. I hope that we can consider methods of addressing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09012622000131">I am told that one of the problems is that data are not shared in the justice system so that there is no way of knowing whether someone who goes to prison for, for example, burglary, has a driving ban. Although the Bill provides for sharing information with almost anyone in the world, it is strange that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the courts do not seem able to learn who exactly is banned at any one time.</p>

Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon), who has been an admirable leader of her community at a time when intense international attention has focused on her constituency. I praise her for her work on suicide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09012637000002">I want to speak about the reforms of the coroners&#146; courts system. I would be happy if the Bill dealt only with such reform. That would be true to the spirit of the draft Bill that was published for consultation a little while ago. It would also emphasise the importance of the coroners&#146; courts system in this country. Although it is 700 years old, there has been no modern reform of it until now. Its significance is seen on the news almost every day in, for example, police shootings&#151;the most recent example is the de Menezes shooting, which also involved the security services; deaths in custody, especially the tragic deaths of children in custody; and the immensely important results of coroners&#146; inquests on some of our service personnel killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. If we think back to Dr. Shipman&#146;s killing of his patients, the case revealed some of the weaknesses in the current system and the pressing need for reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09012637000003">As long ago as 1 December 2004, I secured an Adjournment debate in the Chamber, which is recorded at column 749 of <i> Hansard. </i>It pointed out the weaknesses in the system and called for reform. At the time, investigation powers were weak. There was no central monitoring of trends in deaths, no proper sensitive service for the relatives of those killed suddenly and unexpectedly, no advice and guidance on preventing avoidable deaths, and we were weak in this country on investigating major disasters or single incidents that caused large loss of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09012637000004">It has taken a while, but the Bill makes welcome changes to the law and practice relating to coroners&#146; courts. I mentioned the draft Bill and I congratulate all those who were involved in publishing alongside it a plain English explanation of the legal language. That was a bit of a first at the time, and very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09012637000005">I want personally to thank Mr. Andrew Haigh, the coroner in Staffordshire, who has had several discussions with me about the reforms, which helped clarify my thinking and my attitude to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09012637000006">Let me deal with some of the important reforms. First, I want to speak about the national service&#151;or the national head with the local service. Some people would prefer a completely national service, believing that that brings the reach, clout and resources necessary to make a success of a national coroners&#146; system. Others are happy with the set-up in the Bill, with a national position of chief coroner, supported by several deputy chief coroners, but with the administration at local authority level. I am not sure which is better. Those who argue for more localism prefer the latter arrangement. If we can make a success of it, it will probably be a model, which we may want to follow in future, for services beyond coroners&#146; courts. Obviously, much depends on getting the detail right and monitoring what happens afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09012637000007">Secondly, I want to consider the new range of possible investigations under the Bill.

We have the prospect of two professionals from different specialisms&#151;the lawyer as the coroner and the medical practitioner as the medical examiner&#151;working together with the same aim of establishing the truth and recording an accurate description of the cause of a death.

wider powers&#151;for example, the ability to require non-invasive scans, such as MRI scans, as well as autopsies, and the new legal power for the coroner to enter premises, search them and seize items of evidence. The new powers all look good. The relationship between the coroner and the medical examiner will be crucial. I note that the current proposal is for primary care trusts to appoint the new medical examiners. Given the crucial relationship with the coroner, it is important to have some formal involvement of coroners in the appointments. I hope that that will happen.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman recognise the concern of quite a few people in the relevant professions that the primary care trust that employs the medical examiner might be the same primary care trust that runs the hospital in which the death that is the subject of the inquest took place?</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="09012637000009"><a name="90126-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="09012637000181"><b>Mr. Kidney:</b>
 Yes, I do recognise that point. One of my wishes for the new relationship that will evolve between coroners and medical examiners is that they should be seen as a team that is independent of any other body, and free from any vested interests, when carrying out their investigation. Perhaps that will mean using medical examiners from outside the area in which the coroner is based, or perhaps, as I have suggested, the coroner will have a greater involvement in the appointment of the medical examiner. Those decisions will be significant, as will the question of who pays for the medical examiner. I have already mentioned resources, and I shall come back to that subject in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09012637000010">My third point relates to the new charter for bereaved people. There has been very good consultation on the charter, and it was great to learn today of the appointment of Sara Payne as a victims&#146; champion. Obviously, there are many people to congratulate on that appointment&#151;not least Sara Payne herself, on her persistence on the issues that she has pursued in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09012637000011">I would like to point out that there are other interested parties at coroners&#146; inquests who are not legally represented as a matter of course, and it is important that they, too, should be looked after sensitively and properly by the coroner. The present guidance does not extend to such people, and I am not sure whether it should, or whether there should be a second guide for other people who are interested in the outcome of a coroner&#146;s investigation. The matter certainly needs further attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09012637000012">My fourth point concerns the effects of the new responsibilities of coroners&#146; courts towards bereaved people, the possible requests for reviews, and the appeals that we are implementing for the first time in the Bill. These all have the potential to add significantly to a coroner&#146;s work load, and, as the Bill passes through Parliament, I want to investigate whether that means that coroners will have a greater ability to delegate their present duties to other members of their staff, whether there will be new funding for additional staff and for the upgrading of their information technology systems to enable them to deal with the additional work load efficiently, and whether there will be sufficient resources overall for them to carry out this extra work. If not, the danger is that we will be imposing a new source of delay in the coroners&#146; system, and delay has been a worry in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09012637000013">My fifth point is on funding. A national system would have placed the responsibility for adequate funding on central Government. It is not even clear whether all local authorities currently fund their coroner&#146;s service adequately, and if there are to be new duties and functions for coroners involving extra expense, will those local authorities continue to step up to the plate and pay their fair share? The Government have the idea that, if a local coroner does not get the necessary funding from a local authority, the chief coroner will step in and support the coroner. I wonder how much weight a local authority would give to representations from such a person from outside its area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09012637000014">I also wonder whether many people appreciate how much support the police give to coroners&#146; services around the country. The briefing note for today&#146;s debate says that 90 per cent. of the funding for a coroner&#146;s local office comes from police resources, rather than from local authority resources. There is odd wording in the Bill that makes me wonder whether the police have an eye to saying that they would pull out of funding coroners&#146; services because it was the local authority&#146;s responsibility to do so. I would not like to see that happen, not least because of the value that police officers and retired police officers add to the work of the coroner&#146;s office when they become coroners&#146; officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09012637000015">I should like briefly to mention some other points. It is good that there will be a greater ability for coroners to share their work load across coroners&#146; boundaries, and that there is going to be a more formal arrangement for the training of all coroners. I am also pleased that there are to be inspections of coroners&#146; services. I am not thrilled one way or the other about retaining the treasure trove duty on coroners, but I note that the ability to share that work load across boundaries might be significant in a few cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09012637000016">Like many Members who have spoken today, I am concerned about the provisions relating to secrecy and to sharing data. There is a great deal of work still to be done on the former, for sure. Because the Government have dropped the proposal to give coroners the power to prohibit the publication of certain details, the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) raised remains and too much detail about suicides and other traumatic events in a family&#146;s life could be published to the world. I am not sure whether the Government have given up not only on the idea of giving coroners the power to control such publication, but on asking the media to exercise a bit more restraint through a change in the Press Complaints Commission&#146;s code of practice for reporting. That issue still needs to be debated by all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09012637000017">As a footnote, I should like to note that some reforms have been implemented ahead of the Bill. A good example is the rule 43 reports. When a coroner feels that a case involves something of significance to the wider world, rather than just the death being investigated, they can now send a report to an organisation and ask for a response. At the moment, there is no power to enforce such a response, but the Bill will give us an opportunity to ensure that that provision is more rigorously enforced, because it is a very welcome reform. As these are major reforms, I hope that there will be some arrangement for post-implementation scrutiny, so that we can see whether what we thought would happen actually has happened, and so that we can make changes  <br>

 I hope that the Justice Committee will carry out just the kind of post-legislative scrutiny to which the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) has referred. We did a great deal of pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill, and I want to refer to that in moment, particularly in the context of the short report on the Bill that the Committee produced for the assistance of Members on Second Reading and in Committee. It will be an aide-m&#233;moire for some of the issues that we have raised, and for the Government&#146;s response to them. I shall deal mainly with the coroners&#146; system when referring to the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para20"><a name="09012637000019">The coroners&#146; system is greatly valued in this country. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, it has been around for 700 years, and families attach a great deal of importance to it&#151;so much so that it is now used in circumstances that were previously not envisaged. For example, deaths in military service are now the subject of inquests. That was not the case at the time of the Falklands war, and still less so during the first and second world wars. Imagine&#151;the entire system would have collapsed if it had been expected to cope with the horrific number of deaths of service personnel in either of the two world wars. We have now placed that new responsibility on the service, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09012637000020">The coroners&#146; system does not operate in Scotland at all, and I have found no appetite in England or Wales to move to the Scottish pattern, in which only the most significant and unusual deaths are the subject of a fatal accident inquiry. Any other deaths that require further scrutiny are examined by the procurator fiscal, who decides whether any criminal proceedings should follow, or whether to secure a fatal accident inquiry, which is itself rare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09012637000021">Whereas there is no appetite in England and Wales to move away from coroners and inquests, there does appear to be an appetite in Scotland to hold inquests, at least in respect of military deaths. That is the subject of an ongoing consultation with the Government. If people are brought back from Afghanistan&#151;following the Nimrod crash, for example&#151;some of them might have been based in Scotland and others in England. The secondary decision of where the plane lands seems a pretty poor determinant of whether there should be an inquest or not. That is an illustration of the importance that people attach to inquests, especially when the state, in the form of our armed services, is relevant to the death.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that military inquests are so important because the coroner might well point the finger at the state, in one way or another? The Nimrod inquiry is a good example of that. If such inquests were to be held in secret, it would remove one of the most fundamental reasons for holding them&#151;namely, determining what is wrong with the state that sent the soldiers to their deaths.</p>

hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) referred to as a &#147;red rag&#148;, and I still think that they are profoundly unsatisfactory, but they have a rather more limited purpose than that and I shall return to it shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09012637000024">Of course, not all families want inquests in all circumstances. I have talked to many family members who say, &#147;I hope that there is not going to be an inquest&#148;. In some circumstances, usually when the death has occurred in some form of medical care, families do not want to extend the issue further. Our system does not require inquests to be held in all circumstances&#151;far from it&#151;and it would be bad if that idea got around. Nevertheless, the importance of inquests in cases where the reason for death is in some way uncertain cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09012637000025">The Bill brings some benefits in that field through the appointment of a chief coroner, an appeals system, inspection and a charter for the bereaved, as well as by resolving some of the issues of jurisdiction that have caused real practical problems to coroners which they have asked to be sorted out for many years. There are situations, for example, in which the coroner has to break the law to get the body of a child to a place where appropriate skills are available to carry out an autopsy. Thankfully, that sort of thing will be sorted out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para25"><a name="09012637000026">The Committee had some concerns, and I shall identify a few of them. Although we understood the decision to stick with a locally organised rather than a national service, we felt that the expectations for the reforms might well not be met by the limited amount of central involvement that the Bill produces, particularly in the light of the great diversity of funding that exists. In some areas, coroners&#146; offices are provided and paid for by the police; in other areas local authorities play that role. In some cases, coroners are serving police officers; in others they are retired police officers. It is not necessarily wrong to have a degree of diversity, because what works in a rural area is very different from what works in an urban area, but it is clear that there is little certainty that the right level of resources will be available in all areas. The Government are relying on the chief coroner and the inspection system to achieve that, and I hope that consistency of standards is achieved, but there is an awful lot to be sorted out in respect of providing the resources that coroners will need to meet the expectations generated by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90126-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09012637000027">My second area of concern&#151;I raised it in an intervention during the previous speech&#151;is the position of the medical examiner. The fact that he will be employed by the primary care trust does not provide the direct line of accountability to the coroner and the coronial system that we think is appropriate. That is worrying. PCTs run community hospitals and employ salaried dentists and physicians, alongside dealing with the general practice service and other services that they purchase from other health bodies. They are very much involved. However well the professionals carry out their duties, there will remain a concern in the public mind, which these provisions are intended to address, that the medical advice to the coroner is not independent of those who had care of the patient who died.</p>

 I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has mentioned that point. I am very concerned about the desire for full-time coroners. I notice that part-time coroners are proposed for Northumbria, Cumbria and Cornwall, and I hope that that will also be allowed on the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p><a name="st_o283"><a name="09012637000030"><a name="90126-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="09012637000186"><b>Sir Alan Beith:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is a member of the Justice Committee and he knows that we have discussed this issue quite a lot. I was talking about medical examiners, but let me come straight on to the point about part-time coroners in rural areas. The Committee is concerned that flexibility should remain. We do not want a family living 50 miles from the headquarters of the area coroner to have to travel all those miles in order to speak to the coroner or even to his staff. Present arrangements, which use locally based deputy coroners, provide a service that must not be lost when the system is changed. Part-time assistant coroners are provided for in the Bill, but they need to be available in the appropriate areas. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency has some of the problems that are experienced in even greater measure in areas such as mine in Northumberland or, indeed, in Cumbria. Those areas need to be provided for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09012637000031">I come now to the provisions that originated in the Counter-Terrorism Bill of 2008, which relate to holding some inquests without a jury, in secret and in circumstances in which even the family will not be party to some of the proceedings. In fairness to the Government, I recognise that the proposal arose when it became clear that at least two inquests were not proceeding because of the lack of some provision of this kind. I do not think that the Government started from the wrong motives, but as so often happens in these cases, once the system starts to provide an answer, it comes up with procedures that have many other faults and failings and are wide open to use far beyond what was originally envisaged. I think that the sheer breadth of the provisions worries everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09012637000032">There is also a parallel concern that engages me. I have been involved in the attempt to make intercept as evidence available in our criminal courts. It is a difficult process&#151;indeed, more difficult than people sometimes appreciate. The Government have accepted that it is desirable to allow such evidence and they have charged the same group of people, with just one change, to oversee work by civil servants to try to bring that about. I am engaged in that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09012637000033">I have to say that it is still not clear to me how Ministers can be assured that the tests set out by the Chilcot group, of which I am a member, are fully satisfied in respect of the use of intercept evidence under the procedures in coroners&#146; inquests. Some of the tests relate to the problems of retention and transcription that would arise if it were possible to use intercept material in criminal cases. The same problem can arise in the coroners&#146; courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09012637000034">The Secretary of State drew attention to one difference that does not affect the retention and transcription issue, but does affect issues about revealing certain  <br>

matters. In a criminal prosecution, the prosecution can say that if it has to produce certain material, it cannot proceed, so the case goes no further, but that does not happen in an inquest. Conversely, the coroner is not going to say, &#147;I am going to stop this inquest because the material I need cannot be made publicly available, so I will not have an inquest.&#148; That is almost the situation that we are in now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09012637000035">In trying to find a solution, the Government are somewhere between a rock and a hard place, but we have to find one that is clearly confined to areas where the production of material could very seriously undermine the ability of intelligence agencies to protect the country&#146;s security and the safety of the people who work in it, and which meets the tests that have to be applied to those procedures if we are going to get intercept into court as evidence. The two points are quite closely related. What happens in an inquest may, of course, give rise to a criminal case if it becomes clear from that inquest that criminal proceedings should follow. In that case, the same evidence will be relevant, so we cannot separate the two.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, and I listened with care to what he said. On his immediate point, there are certain circumstances in which an inquest will be followed by a criminal prosecution, but the usual practice, as he will be aware, is the other way around. That particular issue thus rarely arises in practice. On the more general issue, I am grateful to him for recognising that we have not invented the problem that we are seeking to address by the Bill. He disagrees with the solution and he is right to describe the position in which I find myself as somewhere between a rock and a hard place. It is not his business or that of the official Opposition to make my position any more comfortable, but I would ask him&#151;I know that he has a very constructive approach&#151;to respond as constructively as he and his colleagues can to the invitation I offered the House, including the Opposition, earlier. If it is recognised that there is a problem, and it cannot be resolved in the way that criminal cases can, what is a better solution&#151;there may well be one&#151;than the one in the Bill?</p>

 As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, we have taken one step forward by getting away from the idea of the Secretary of State simply appointing the coroner. That is a beneficial change. As my hon. Friend also said, we now need to separate having or not having a jury from the other issues to which this matter gives rise&#151;they are not the same. This is still a difficult matter and we will probably achieve a solution that can be used only in very few cases, but there are only very few cases in which it will be appropriate to use such a procedure. In such cases, there are families who want the inquest to be completed and want closure, which is why we must look at this matter rather carefully.</p>

The negative procedure is hopeless from that point of view and even the affirmative procedure, which is not normally open to amendment unless the statute makes that possible, will be inadequate if there is to be anything other than narrow applications of the idea of data sharing to areas where it is relevant and necessary.</p>

 On the broader point about data sharing, apart from its being considered illiberal, there is public concern about having little confidence that the data will stay exactly where they are supposed to be. Once data have been put out there, having been authorised to go to a third party, they might go to who knows where. We would have to be completely confident that those people&#146;s data sharing and data protection were watertight. That is where I would lose faith completely, because I do not think that any assurances that the Government could give us would mean that that was the case.</p>

 The hon.

A general practice in the health service is a private business. So, too, is a charity carrying out work on behalf of the Government. Therefore, there is no nice, neat line between the public and private sectors. There are even more bodies in which data can be lost.</p>

The problem there was caused not by the law, but by a mistaken assumption, even within an organisation, about what the law was. We want a system in which people can have confidence, but in which there is appropriate provision for carefully monitored data sharing in circumstances in which the public would wish it to happen.</p>

 The point in relation to Soham is that the systems were the biggest problem because they were not designed for the sharing of data. Public perception was undermined as a lack of confidence in appropriate sharing was encouraged. Getting such coherence into the public debate is important, is it not?</p>

 Yes, it is indeed, but it will not be achieved if people believe that the Bill will further open the door to their data being scattered abroad. That is why the Bill must be improved, tightened and strengthened, if it can be. Some hon. Members have suggested that if that is not done, certain clauses should be withdrawn and brought back to the House. One way or another, that improvement has to be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09012637000046">I want briefly to mention the sentencing provisions. The working group on sentencing practice was divided as to precisely what role Parliament should have in the development of sentencing. There was objection&#151;rightly, I think&#151;to the idea of sentencing being precisely determined by Parliament, because that is not our role. Our role is indeed to provide a range of sentences and to decide what the criminal offences should be. Experience to date is that we can play a useful role in contributing to the development of sentencing guidelines in a process in which the judiciary has primary involvement, but in which others who are affected and have an interest also play a part. We need to continue that and I am glad that we have received some reassurance on the point, but the Bill is not entirely clear about it. I would wish the Justice Committee to continue to play its role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09012637000047">I want to make one last point, which is personal and not a Committee point at all, or even a party one. It relates to clause 58, which removes the free speech protection that was added to the homophobic hatred provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. I simply put it this way: given that that legislation has not yet been brought into effect and we therefore have no experience of what its effect will be, we have no evidence that what was intended to be a free speech protection will in any way undermine the ability to prosecute the crime and the evil against which that part of the original legislation was directed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09012637000048">If there were such evidence, or even clear indications that the ability to prosecute would be undermined, we ought to look at the provision again and word it better, but I believe deeply in free speech and I want to ensure that people who express views that are not threats or threatening are not caught by the legislation or by mistaken assumptions about what it does. I voted for the free speech provision in the first place. Nothing has happened in the meantime to make me change my view that there were indications of inappropriate actions potentially arising from the original wording and we have no evidence on which I should change my mind in that regard. Therefore, I will not support clause 58. We should see what the experience is before trying to change legislation that Parliament has already passed.</p>

transparency and good governance since Charles I, so it must be worth going along&#151;but please do not tell the Whips!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09012637000051">I really feel that what the Front Benchers were saying was an entertaining listen. The Opposition spokesman, the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), thought he was making an election speech, and some good points were obliterated by his descent into fantasy. However, he was the victim of one of the best put-downs I have heard in this place since I came here 35 years ago. One element of his rhetoric having been undermined, one wonders what proof there was behind the rest of it, and whether, if Members of Parliament had been here in good numbers, they might have punctured it all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09012637000052">We heard some knockabout stuff, and now I feel that the Opposition have an opportunity&#151;although the Opposition spokesman who delivered that ferocious speech is not present, and has not been since he made it. A colleague of mine came into the Chamber and asked whether there would be a vote. I said, &#147;Of course. I&#146;ve just heard the most ferocious speech imaginable,&#148; only to be profoundly disappointed by the fact that, despite that speech, the Conservatives are to sit on their hands, or go home for an early night.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09012637000053">The speech by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), representing the Liberal Democrats, could not have been described as ferocious by any stretch of the imagination, and it seemed that none of the other Members who had signed the amendment was present to support it. We could have an interesting time&#151;but instead, in the limited time available to me I shall focus on a part of the Bill that I consider quite sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09012637000054">I am sure that those who examine the Bill carefully enough will find an integrated theme, although I have not quite found it yet. Certainly the legislation relating to coroners has been a long time coming. Perhaps we should approach reform of the system&#151;which has been glacially slow&#151;from the perspective of reform of the coroner service. There have been endless inquiries and reports, excellent documents have been published by Select Committees, and specific inquiries were conducted after Shipman&#146;s near-genocidal activities. It cannot be said that there has not been an enormous amount of discussion and consultation on the part of the Bill that relates to the coroner service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09012637000055">I see that the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield has returned. I welcome him back to the Chamber.</p>

The same applies to human rights legislation, and to a variety of other Government initiatives. We must not, of course, forget the enormous and sad input in relation to the activities of &#147;Dr. Death&#148;, which at least compelled people to look afresh at possible solutions to problems raised by the way in which coroners operated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09012637000057">I welcome the Bill. I am not an expert on the law relating to coroners and their work, but I chaired the Defence Committee for eight years and was a member of it for 25 years, and in that time I learnt a great deal about coroners in connection with the military.

burial practices, not just in my constituency but in 25 other local authority areas. I observed the integral role of the coroner in each of those systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09012637000058">Unfortunately, as we all know, standards vary. A coroner service that is well funded may provide a range of activities that are denied to coroners working without that excessive funding, or even a sufficiency of funding. I am sure that anyone who went along to talk to such coroners would realise what they are unable to do as a result of the paucity of funding. We know that local authorities are under enormous financial pressure, and the price of being able to ensure properly that the relatives or friends of the deceased know that the death was accidental, or a result of ageing or natural causes, is fairly high. Some local authorities are not prepared to pay that price. Perhaps they think that the dead do not vote&#151;although, having observed elections throughout the world, I can assure Members that the dead are voting in enormous numbers, including some in inner-city areas in this country of ours. However, I will not pursue that further.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has raised the issue of local authority funding. Does he agree that an issue arises when funding is spread across two local authorities? Although my constituency is in Cardiff, the coroner is funded by Vale of Glamorgan council, which has far less interest in the matter because the vast majority of inquests are carried out on Cardiff residents. That serious imbalance underlines the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

Three boroughs are bound together with a single service provided by a coroner. The coroners used to be part-time, and I have spoken to some who feel that they were better resourced then because, being lawyers, they could use the services of their own law practices. In the absence of those resources, I do not think that&#151;with the best will in the world&#151;the merged coroner service can do the job that it is obliged to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09012637000062">I have looked carefully at the part of the Bill that deals with governance, and I approve of much of it. For instance, the chief coroner will be responsible for training arrangements, maintaining a scheme for the investigation of complaints and an appeal system, and producing an annual report. A coronial advisory council will be established. Those and other measures represent a great step forward, but I see a problem that reminds me of what I observed in the United States over the Christmas period, when I examined the activities of election organisations. I was able to talk to representatives of 13 such organisations, because there are no Boxing day breaks in the United States, or even Christmas eve breaks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90126-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09012637000063">The position in the United States is almost exactly the same. Power rests more with the localities. Central Government&#151;the federal Government&#151;can pass legislation, but they are circumscribed by the tradition that things must be left to those in local government, which has a considerable downside, about which I shall say more shortly.</p>

The Committee&#146;s 2006 report criticises the lack of funding and is damning in its criticism of the system as a whole, and I can reinforce what it said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09012637000065">A couple of years ago, the father of one of my constituents died, and he had wanted to be buried back in Pakistan. I remember the difficulty that I had to endure, and the time it took me to obtain a decision, or information, from the coroner. It was not his fault, but he was not available&#151;and this was a Member of Parliament trying to elicit information from the system! That showed me more clearly than anything that the coroner system needed more funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09012637000066">At one time there was talk of named deputies in various locations, but not much has happened on that front in my area. The underlying obstacles include the lack of priority given to the service by many local authorities. They are not prepared to increase funding to enhance services, yet there is a much higher expectation of improvement in the service, not just among the general public but in central Government and in Parliament itself. What is required, in my view, is the imposition of, or heavy persuasion to adopt, more uniformity in the system. Why should someone in my area, or in Sandwell or Dudley, receive a lesser service than people living in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) or in Birmingham?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09012637000067">We should consider the number of staff who are engaged in the coroner service in Birmingham. Admittedly there are more deaths per year in Birmingham: 4,600, as opposed to 3,600 in the black country. However, Birmingham had nine officers&#151;now it has eight&#151;along with a host of administrative staff, while the black country has six officers and one administrative staff member. It is not fair that the service in the black country should have its hands tied by being so grossly understaffed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09012637000068">I am sure that local authorities will be angered by what I am saying, but I represent my constituents rather than the council leadership. I asked them to look into this more carefully. I believe that it is a question not just of paying the bills, but of paying enough to the coroner service so that it can benefit my constituents by being able to provide a more professional service than it can currently offer. It is good, but it could be much better if it got more resources. In many parts of the country, the coroner service needs to be considerably enhanced. The constraints upon the poorer ones are debilitating, making them less functional, and unable to provide a better service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09012637000069">I asked a friend of mine who is more adept at maths than me to look at the budgets of the local authorities in my area, and at what they provided for the coroner service. My friend reached the conclusion that there had been no real increase in resources in the last 25 years. This proposed legislation will impose more tasks on the coroner service, but will the money be increased? No, it certainly will not. I therefore say with absolute confidence that these inadequate resources in the black country have had a marked effect on the level of service the coroner service can provide, and we should not tolerate that for much longer. I recognise that there are considerable financial constraints upon local authorities, but I would have thought that they would put funding an adequate coroner service far higher up their list of priorities.</p>

Clearly, there are groups in our constituencies who practice different religions and have very different burial practices. Those who are Catholic or Protestant might be perfectly happy with a period of five or six days&#151;they might consider that to be ample time to say farewell to the deceased&#151;but for those who are Jewish, Hindu or Muslim, the time scale is very different. In our society, we have an obligation to ensure that the human rights of all groups are properly respected. Local authorities should provide a service that does that&#151;and many do. They can solve the problem of providing a burial service 365 days a year.</p>

There are many in the chain&#151;the local authority, the registrar, the gravediggers, the hospital, the health service, the doctors&#151;who could, if they wished, do as Leicester is doing and expedite the system by which the dead can be legitimately buried, in compliance with the law and the religion of those concerned. However, that is not the case in some authorities, including mine in Walsall, although it is under pressure&#151;partly because of my report, I would like to think&#151;to do what other authorities are doing.</p>

 Unnecessary post-mortems are a key factor in some such delays. That also affects groups who have a philosophical objection to post-mortem examination.

 I have talked at length to the Muslim burial society in my constituency, and wonderful organisations in many other parts of the country who have responded to my surveys, and I know that none of them would want to make it difficult for the coroner, if he or she has to do their work. In the circumstances described, they would have to wait, but I would hope that where there is no problem, local authorities of any size would be prepared to expedite the system. That is how we should proceed, but it might be prevented by the underfunding of the coroner service, because if there are too few people and too many bodies to deal with, it will be impossible for it to provide the necessary paperwork and examinations quickly enough for a swift burial.</p>

However, I should say that there can be difficulties, even with the best will in the world. I know the coroner in the black country is more than aware of the requirements of Muslims, but at this stage he is unable to meet those requirements because he simply does not have adequate resources. I hope, therefore, that when the Bill is considered further, we do not consider only the issues that are politically contentious. As a number of Members have pointed out, issues relating to the coroner service might not be considered as important as some feel the other areas that we have heard discussed are&#151;but everyone has an interest in our having an effective coroner service, and the Government might be able to do the necessary research to find out who the laggards are, and whose standards fall below an acceptable minimum.

 The entrusting of information by an individual to the Government is an act of trust. It imposes upon the receiver of the information a solemn obligation of confidence. For many years, Government have observed that as an essential and cardinal principle of their activities in the maintenance of that trust. The right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) argues against those who take the view that the dismantling or relegation of that principle&#151;which in my judgment this Bill is designed to do&#151;will be an important retrograde step in the public life of this country, and he accuses us of over-dramatising or of unnecessary or gratuitous histrionics. When we remove from a wall a single brick, it is easy to stand around and say, &#147;Look, the wall has not fallen.&#148; Even if we remove from that wall one of its most important cornerstones, the wall will continue to stand for quite some time, and those who stand around can mock and say, &#147;See, the wall remains standing.&#148; However, the relegation of a principle upon which the freedoms, privacy and confidentiality of individual citizens have been based for so many years is an important step even if its consequences may not be visible straight away.</p>

agree with those on both sides of the House who have expressed caution about the step that we are about to take. The accumulation and pooling together of knowledge and information about an individual by the Government, as happens in so many various ways&#151;in respect of health, for the purposes of tax and for the purposes of social security&#151;presents a mighty tool in the hands of the state. I do not believe that the Bill achieves a sensible balance or a sufficient protection for the individual in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09012637000079">I welcome many of the provisions on coroners. I, like Members on both sides of the House, have had families who have been caught up in the tragic death of a loved one&#151;a son, a daughter or another close member of the family&#151;coming to my weekly surgeries. We have heard the constant refrain that they do not feel that there has always been the kind of liaison, disclosure of information and involvement of them in the process that allows them to feel easy in their minds that the process is transparent and that it allows them sufficient involvement. So, I welcome the charter for bereaved people, which is a substantial step in the right direction. I understand that there are concerns that it might be a toothless tiger if it is not backed up by the resources and finances to provide the relevant services in all areas of the country, but it represents a significant and useful step. If it is clearly enough expressed, it will be useful for those families who have experienced the kind of grief and involvement with the inquest system that I have come across in my surgeries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09012637000080">That brings me to an area of the Bill on which I have most experience and, in connection with my professional occupation, most practical involvement: the changes that the Bill seeks to achieve in the criminal law. If the Bill could be analysed in terms of the numbers of its provisions, it would be found to amount to another criminal justice Bill. One cannot even say it is a mini criminal justice Bill, because, by the standards of previous years, its provisions would have graced a full-sized Bill all by themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09012637000081">The Bill seeks to make a number of changes to the law. It is worth observing that we have had one criminal justice Bill after another during the lifetime of this Government, and hon. Members on both sides of the House will fairly concede that those have not all been tremendous successes. Indeed, dozens if not hundreds of provisions from those Acts, as they have become, have not even been brought into force, yet we face even more changes in the criminal law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09012637000082">The worst and primary change that the Bill seeks to make is one to the law of homicide. The proposed reforms adopt the Law Commission&#146;s proposals for changes to the partial defence of provocation, but its proposals were to be part of an overall and comprehensive reform of the law of homicide. It proposed that there should be first-degree and second-degree murder, and that first-degree murder would cover the most serious cases, where there was an intention to kill, and that second-degree murder would be where a person had an intention to commit serious harm but where there may not have been an intention to kill. In dividing murder into first-degree and second-degree murder, it made sense to review the partial defences to murder, which provocation and diminished responsibility represent. It is only those changes into first-degree and second-degree  <br>

murder that made sense of and justified the re-examination of the defence of provocation and the narrowing of its scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09012637000083">The Government appear to have plucked from the Law Commission&#146;s careful, detailed and comprehensive review of the law of homicide a part of it that was only made sense by the context that the Law Commission gave it and simply introduced it in a fragmented and piecemeal way in this Bill. The objections to that approach are clear: the narrowing of the partial defence of provocation makes no sense if we retain the single offence of murder with a mandatory life sentence, which is what the Government propose. Such an approach will mean that a great number of people to whom the defence or partial defence would have been available&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) made this point well&#151;will be affected by unintentional consequences; it might mean that many more will be convicted, and that those who are may not be those whom this House would wish to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09012637000084">I wish to say a word about the exclusion of sexual infidelity as a type of conduct that can trigger the partial defence, because it makes no real sense. Why should one exclude a form of human conduct that all literature and all human experience teaches us excites the greatest feelings of injustice and hurt that human life can sometimes produce? Why is it necessary, when defining the provocation of partial defence as something of grave circumstances that brings about a sense of serious wrong, to exclude the fact that in certain circumstances, at least, sexual infidelity can produce just such a sense of grievous hurt and wrong? It can be an appalling type of betrayal, so it makes no sense for that to be excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09012637000085">It would have been a genuinely imaginative and bold step if the Government had taken on board the Law Commission&#146;s proposals on the reform of homicide law generally and introduced those proposals&#151;or something very like them&#151;together with these partial defences and their revision as part of a comprehensive reform. That is why one feels a considerable sense of unease about this Bill. In parts, it contains some positive and constructive measures, such as the charter for bereaved people and many of the changes to the coroners system. However, the provisions on the criminal law appear to have been tacked on for reasons possibly of expedience or, as the hon. Member for Cambridge suggested, to be seen to be doing something about a topical problem. That is not the way in which the criminal law should be changed. That is why my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) was right to say that the Conservative party should approach the Bill with considerable caution. I hope that in Committee&#151;I hasten to add that this is not an invitation to appoint me to it&#151;many of these issues can be considered, especially the criminal law provisions that have not been adequately thought through.</p>

The latter have shared the frustrations and distress caused by a system that is almost universally regarded as&#151;in that hackneyed phrase&#151;not fit for purpose.</p>

Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), all contribute to the view that the procedures in place to investigate shocking or controversial deaths have proved woefully inadequate.

<a name="90126-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="09012637000166"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One is to restore public confidence in the protection afforded by the death certification process. The other is to improve the response of the coroner service to families.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09012637000091">I believe that the Bill will mark a step change towards achieving those improvements. While I regret that it has not proved possible to create a national coroner service, the proposal to appoint a chief coroner to provide leadership and set standards is a critical development in the direction of constructing a thoroughly modern and professional service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09012637000092">However, the Bill is not, nor can it be, the end of the story. Measures already introduced outside the structure of the Bill signal the Government&#146;s commitment to the process of change. The amendment, in July last year, of coroners&#146; rule 43 underlines the requirement for the coroner to take steps to prevent future deaths. At the same time, the introduction of rule 57A gives guidance on the supply of information on deaths, reflecting the concern to provide additional protection for the rights of the child. Advance publication of the excellent draft charter for bereaved families speaks volumes for the focus of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09012637000093">Thorough consultation with service users, victims&#146; groups and non-governmental organisations such as Inquest has been a vital part of this process so far. I would like the Minister to confirm that she will investigate structures to formalise this involvement, especially in the further development of rules and training programmes. I would also like to learn more about measures that can be taken to address gender and race equality issues in the service so that the public face of the coroners&#146; system may reflect the diversity of the community it serves.

to give voice to the concerns of bereaved service families who feel that bullying and institutional abuse continue to go unchallenged and suspicious deaths are still not investigated effectively. Families believe that the problems at Deepcut barracks were the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09012637000095">In the matter of effective investigation, those concerned with the ill treatment of recruits in training establishments have found common cause with victims of suspicious deaths overseas. Too often, it seems, lessons could have been learned and deaths could have been prevented. Bereaved families are angry that action has not been taken despite warnings, whether the problem was heat exertion, &#147;friendly fire&#148;, lack of equipment or adequate protection of personnel. This community of victims is a critical audience to win over to create public confidence in a reformed coroners&#146; system. The Royal British Legion and the War Widows Association have listened to bereaved families and share many reservations about the proposals before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09012637000096">Let me express some of those reservations and concerns. First is the issue of secret inquests. I spoke against those proposals when they were put forward in the context of the Counter-Terrorism Bill and recognise that the Government have responded positively to criticism. Ministers have brought forward considerably modified proposals. Nevertheless, the Bill before us still gives the Secretary of State power to certify investigations to be held without the public, without the jury and without the involvement of the family of the deceased. I regret that it may not be possible to dislodge the perception that crucial evidence will be heard behind closed doors. While the grounds for certification are more carefully defined, the Bill still seems to suggest that the objection of another country and diplomatic relations will be placed above the need of a grieving family to find the truth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90126-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09012637000097">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has drawn attention to the weight placed by the European Court of Human Rights upon the role of the bereaved family in defining standards for the protection of life. One expert has said:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090126/debtext/90126-0017.htm"/>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09012637000098">The changes brought forward so far owe much to the positive input from professionals working in the service, including the Coroners&#146; Society. The Secretary of State asked for suggestions about how we can bring forward measures to deal with the difficulty that everybody acknowledges in terms of safeguarding the security of the country while meeting the need for clarity in the process. It has been argued by inquests and others that further refinements of the regulation of investigatory powers legislation might provide the necessary safeguards for witness safety and national security. We should certainly continue to search for positive solutions to difficult problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09012637000099">Secondly, let me turn to the circumstances in which an inquest must be held with a jury. Legal representations of bereaved service families argue convincingly that the investigation of a sudden death in a military establishment must be subject to the same protection as a death in prison or in a police station. Issues of isolation, vulnerability, potential abuse of authority, access to weaponry, military  <br>

codes of silence and confinement in barracks all speak of the dangers of military life and the requirement for additional protection. Again, the issue of public confidence in serving the interests of bereaved families must be paramount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09012637000100">Thirdly, on the matter of legal representations for bereaved families, no one would question the model of the inquisitorial regime in coroners&#146; courts, but an investigation that throws up an article 2 issue&#151;one that concerns the protection of life&#151;in the case of a death in an army training establishment or on military service overseas is all too often met with a response from the Ministry of Defence that is judged by families as giving that Department all the protection. Well-paid barristers represent the MOD in court, while the families cannot gain similar representation to support them in trying to obtain justice and truth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09012637000101">The father of Corporal Jason Pears, who died in barracks in Germany in 2002, spent a large part of his life savings on legal representation at an inquest that reached a verdict of unlawful killing. The family of my constituent, Lance Corporal Derek McGregor, who took his life in disputed circumstances at Catterick barracks, suffered a delay of five years before the inquest was finally concluded. The father came to me to ask for help with legal representation. Those families deserve legal representation when the MOD has barristers in court to represent it. I urge the Minister to consider what steps may be taken in future to assure bereaved service families that their voices and interests will be effectively represented and heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09012637000102">Fourthly, I want to comment on the transfer of jurisdiction. Bereaved relatives have welcomed the removal of barriers that have prevented inquests from being held somewhere accessible to their extended family and friends. I know that there are discussions with the Scottish Government about extending the role of fatal accident inquiries to investigate a military death overseas, but families are also concerned that the body of expertise built up by the Oxfordshire and Wiltshire coroners in particular should not be dissipated. The coroners in those two jurisdictions have established centres of excellence that are unmatched in Europe. Their courage has won the admiration of all who have served in their courts and inspired coronial staff to 100 per cent. commitment to the needs of the bereaved. I hope that the Minister will assure me that that expertise will be shared in the new coroner system so that families can be reassured that their needs are being addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09012637000103">I applaud the Government for their commitment to change and praise the work of all who have contributed to the Bill. I urge Ministers to listen to the voices of veterans&#146; groups and victims. Deaths of military personnel will always be devastating to the families but they should at least be reassured that each death will be investigated openly and effectively and that where lessons may be learned, they will be acted on.</p>

 As the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) mentioned earlier, this is a Second Reading debate and we would normally deal with the broad thrust of the Bill, but as the Bill has been put together from 27 different varieties of provision, it is very difficult to do that. We have to look at its individual parts. I welcome some parts of the Bill: the idea of intercept evidence being introduced; the anonymity of witnesses during investigations; the charter for the bereaved; the provisions regarding child pornography; the idea that coroners will be better trained and inspected in the future; and the coroners appeal system. Some years ago, I was a deputy coroner and I saw then that, as in every walk of life, there are good coroners and those who are not quite so good. The ones who were not so good had a devastating effect on families, because they sometimes dealt with inquests in such an insensitive way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09012637000107">Interestingly, there was a reference in the Gracious Speech to a Bill designed to improve the coroners&#146; service by introducing transparency into the system. However, clause 5 of this Bill prevents a senior coroner or an inquest jury from expressing any opinion on any matter other than the basic details of who the deceased was. I cannot square that with an attempt to introduce greater transparency. Moreover, inquests that come under article 2 of the European convention on human rights may say only what circumstances surrounded the death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09012637000108">I do not know why that proposal has been put forward. It may be the result of the outspoken and rather brave comments made by the Oxfordshire coroner, in particular about the lack of co-operation by American forces in respect of the inquest into a friendly fire incident that he dealt with last year. However, it is important that coroners are able to speak out, because they often raise matters of important public interest, such as the neglect of consumer or workplace safety by a well-known company or a public authority&#146;s failure in its duty of care. Another example might be the actions or errors that lead to a person meeting their death in custody, while serving in the armed forces or while in contact with the police. Those matters are very important and things are much improved when they are subject to the glare of publicity; they should not be shuffled into a corner, with people who would speak about them gagged. I am very concerned about that aspect of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09012637000109">The question of the so-called secret inquests has rightly engaged several contributors to the debate. The provision was brought forward first in the Bill that became the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, although it disappeared thanks to the opposition that it attracted. I regret to say that the provision&#146;s effect means that, in any case in which the state might be alleged to be responsible for a person&#146;s death&#151;for example, the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes, or the death of Baha Mousa at the hands of British soldiers in Basra&#151;the Secretary of State will feel free to appoint a coroner, who will sit in closed session and without a jury. That can happen whenever the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is in the public interest, given the sensitive nature of the material likely to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09012637000110">That is a retrograde step and there must be a way around this conundrum. I appreciate that there will be times when sensitive information will be disclosed, but surely we can devise a better system than what is being  <br>

<notus-date day="26" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>26 Jan 2009 : Column 102</b><br>
proposed. The Bill will undermine public confidence in the coroners&#146; system, because people out there will think that there must be something to hide if an inquest is held in secret. That will be the reaction when it is decided that a matter should be dealt with in private.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09012637000111">There was a discussion earlier about the use of public interest immunity certificates, which the Secretary of State said would not work. However, that approach routinely works in many criminal cases, and I do not know why it cannot be adapted so that it works properly when delicate matters are discussed in inquests. There should be no need to rule that such inquests should sit in secret. The involvement of the Lord Chief Justice in the selection of the judge does not ameliorate the unfairness that could be caused by the exclusion of a jury, members of the public and next of kin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09012637000112">I feel very deeply that that is a flawed suggestion. I believe that the Government have overestimated the extent to which the European Court of Human Rights would allow the wholesale exclusion of public and next of kin from inquest proceedings for the sake of some &#147;substantial public interest&#148; in the non-disclosure of sensitive material. In the case of Rowe and Davis <i> v. </i>the United Kingdom, the court said that, in the context of criminal proceedings, the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence was not absolute, but it never suggested that it would be appropriate to exclude the jury altogether for the sake of safeguarding the public interest in non-disclosure. So there are problems ahead; there is the question of article 2; and I have no doubt that there will be challenges to the Bill if it reaches the statute book in its current form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09012637000113">I should like to deal briefly with the anonymity of witnesses. Although I appreciate that that is sometimes necessary, especially in the investigative process, I believe that a defendant has a right to know the identity of a witness against him or her in any criminal proceedings. That is vital, as both a common law principle and a constituent part of the right to a fair trial under article 6, which provides for the minimum right of a defendant</p>
<a name="90126-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09012637000168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to examine or have examined witnesses against him&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09012637000114">in criminal cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09012637000115">The Court of Appeal has made it clear in the recent case of Mayers in relation to criminal evidence that, in its opinion:</p>
<a name="90126-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="09012637000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Notwithstanding the abolition of the common law rules, it is abundantly clear from the provisions of the Act as a whole that, save in the exceptional circumstances permitted by the Act, the ancient principle that the defendant is entitled to know the identity of witnesses who incriminate him is maintained.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09012637000116">Therefore, there is a legitimate concern, because people who give evidence sometimes do so for reasons other than honesty and public duty. That was shown in the recent Davis case, on which the Law Lords decided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09012637000117">Iain Davis was convicted of murder, following the fatal shooting of two men in east London. The sole or decisive evidence against Davis was the testimony of three witnesses who identified him as the gunman but feared for their lives if it became known that they had given evidence. Davis believed that the witnesses were part of corrupt plot to implicate him in the murder, led by his ex-girlfriend and motivated by revenge. Davis&#146;s lawyers were, however, unable to pursue that argument during the trial, because the judge allowed the witnesses to testify under pseudonyms, with all particulars of  <br>

their identity withheld from the defence. Furthermore, while cross-examining the witnesses, Davis&#146;s lawyers were not permitted to put to them any question that might enable them to be identified. They could not ask who the witnesses were, where they lived or the nature of their relationship with Davis. The House of Lords decided that, in such circumstances, the degree of anonymity rendered the trial unfair. That is a real case; that is a real concern. I hope that we will not make bad law that leads to an undermining of the whole system that the Bill is meant to attempt to improve.</p>

 One of my interests in the House is road safety. I served on the Committee that considered the Bill that became the Road Safety Act 2006, and I cannot understand why we did not deal with the driving ban issue when that Bill was passing through Parliament. However, I strongly welcome the fact that, when the Bill is enacted, anyone banned from driving who has to serve a prison sentence cannot serve that ban while sitting in prison with no access to a vehicle. It has always been my belief and that of most of the public that those people should serve the ban when it hurts them most: outside prison. That is one of the things that I welcome in the Bill.</p>

The Bill will for the first time prevent that from happening, although we are not preventing them from writing their memoirs. Indeed, I dare say that forensic psychologists would welcome some thinking from people who have committed such heinous crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09012637000121">Let me turn to the subject of suicide and assisted suicide. I have taken an interest in the issue because of a firm in my constituency called Zentek. It has three divisions; one of them is e-safe education. Having carried out detailed, forensic analysis of the way in which young people access the internet in scores of schools across north England, Zentek has found out that the filters in place are well nigh useless at preventing people from getting on to some of the most dreadful websites. Obviously, pornography constitutes most of the difficult material that students access. Even members of staff have been caught using school computers to access some pretty dreadful websites. All that a person has to do is google their way round on a public access site, scores of which are available, and within seconds they can be on any internet site in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09012637000122">Zentek has found a system that will read, through the keyboard, what the student is doing. If the student is trying to access difficult sites such as pornographic websites, a black hand will appear, and a message will say, &#147;You really shouldn&#146;t be accessing this site, and if you continue, you will have the weight of the authorities come down on you, starting with the head teacher.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09012637000123">Sadly, some of those students access sites that tell people how to commit suicide. Zentek has forensically analysed those sites, and it found that quite a number of students&#151;not an excessive number, but worrying numbers&#151;are dealing with websites that tell people how to commit suicide. That is rather sad, in a way. I went to the meeting that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) attended just last week on suicide websites. Even the Samaritans do not want suicide websites banned. Interestingly, a young woman was there from the website Bebo, which is used by many young people. When a young person tries to access a suicide website, a widget will pop up directing them to advice sites such as that of the Samaritans. That means that young people who have suicidal thoughts, or who have the curiosity to access those sites, can perhaps be pointed to safe sites such as the Samaritans&#146; site. Perhaps those who are feeling suicidal may be encouraged to ring the Samaritans and discuss their problems with them. It would be an excellent idea if, when any person&#151;not just young people&#151;tried to access one of those sites, widgets appeared directing them to the Samaritans or some other voluntary organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09012637000124">I would like to give my backing to Victim Support, which has written to us all to suggest that we encourage Ministers to allow victim support organisations to support witnesses in coroners&#146; courts in the same way that they do in the normal court system. For many people, some perhaps already traumatised by the loss of a loved one, it is intimidating enough to have to go to a coroner&#146;s court and listen to what happened to their loved one and why they died. Sometimes other witnesses can intimidate those witnesses who have been caused a loss. I plead with our Ministers to consider allowing Victim Support to extend its area of operation beyond the normal courts to coroners&#146; courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09012637000125">I welcome the provision in the Bill allowing bodies to be moved between jurisdictions, so that coroners&#146; cases can be heard in the most suitable one. I cite an example that I am dealing with at the moment: a person was transferred, with some difficulty, from my local hospital to a second and then a third hospital, where, tragically, they died. That third hospital is outside the jurisdiction of our coroner&#151;or so I believe; I have to check that fact. If it is outside our coroner&#146;s jurisdiction, it would seem sensible to allow the case to be heard in our local coroner&#146;s court. After all, most of the family live within shooting distance of that court, and all the person&#146;s medical records are kept locally, too. The provision for dealing with such cases is another beneficial aspect of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09012637000126">Lastly, I flag up the fact that I am chair of the Care Not Killing alliance, which regards clauses 46 and 48 as extremely responsible and reasonable provisions. They define more clearly the offence of assistance with suicide, and they ensure that those who seek to promote the culture of suicide via the internet must pay attention to these clauses. There are some pretty dreadful people out there putting some pretty serious things on the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09012637000127">I mentioned the suicide sites, but there are also people such as 61-year-old Australian Philip Nitschke, who almost preaches suicide to young and old alike.

He promotes suicide through the use of carbon monoxide in his plastic exit bag, and he will even provide an exit bag. The website describes his  <br>

I know they will not be banned, but some of the very extreme sites put up by the gentleman whom I mentioned, who is often called the &#147;Dr. Death&#148; of Australia, ought to be restricted. I am convinced that some people who have no suicidal tendencies in their mind when they stumble on to those sites, which is not difficult to do, may begin to think about suicide, particularly if they are already distressed.</p>

 The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) spoke a great deal of sense. I shall return to his speech in a moment, largely to agree with him, but to differ in detail with regard to suicide websites. He was right to say that the Bill is gigantic. It is a Christmas tree of a Bill, a sweepings off the factory floor of a Bill, a hotch-potch of a Bill. There are all sorts of things in it, and the notion that in a Second Reading debate one could speak in favour or against the principle of the Bill is nonsensical, because there is no such thing as a principle in the Bill as a whole. It is a mixture of good things and bad things. I strongly agree with the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) that it would have been better if we were dealing only with a Coroners Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90126-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09012637000131">For the sake of brevity I shall not address myself to some of the more controversial issues, although I agree with the remarks of a number of my right hon. and hon.

It is a fundamental undermining of our rights as citizens, and extremely worrying. I hope we will oppose it in Committee and on Report and Third Reading.</p>

Of course we all want to stop homophobic hatred. At the same time, however, I have some sympathy with Rowan Atkinson and certain Christian groups, for example, who feel that unless the Waddington amendment remains in the original Bill, they will be prevented from doing and saying perfectly legitimate and sensible things that in no sense incite people to murder or commit violence against homosexuals or others. I very much sympathise with such views and, like the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), I have seen no change since the original Act to suggest that we ought to amend it further now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09012637000133">I want to focus on two aspects of the Bill. The first&#151;the question of military inquests&#151;was expertly covered by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). I entirely agree with her that the excellent coroner for Oxford and in particular the retiring coroner for Wiltshire, David Masters, have developed huge expertise due to the geographical accident that multiple inquests, when the bodies of a number of soldiers are repatriated to the United Kingdom, are carried out by the coroner in the place where the plane happens to land. At the moment, that place happens to be RAF Lyneham in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09012637000134">The two coroners have built up extraordinary expertise about military activities of one sort or another. The Bill makes no reference to military inquests, but it seems to me that it could go two ways. On the one hand, it would be possible, I suppose, to dissipate that expertise by saying that the inquest should be carried out in the places where the soldiers originally came from. That would be a legitimate line to take, and to some degree it is happening already: when a single body is repatriated to this country, the inquest is indeed carried out by the local coroner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09012637000135">My inclination, however, is to say that we should seek to maintain the expertise built up by those two coroners over the years and, in doing that, make sure that the council tax payers in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire are not disadvantaged by it. I welcome the extra resources that the Government have pumped into the Wiltshire coroner service in the past year or so. That must be continued if operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are to continue in years to come. If that huge burden is to be placed on the coroner in Wiltshire, resources have to follow it, and some formal structure has to be put in place to make sure that that occurs. Equally, it would be wrong if civilian inquests in Wiltshire were delayed in any way because of the large number of military inquests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09012637000136">I also very much agree with the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood that on occasion it is important for there to be legal representation. In the case of the crash of Hercules XV179, it was strange that originally the only person who was to have legal representation on the state at the inquest was the Australian soldier killed in the flight; the Australian Government chose to pay for a barrister to represent him. Initially, the British Government refused to pay for such representation, although under pressure the Secretary of State made special provision and there was lead representation. If the Ministry of Defence is to have legal representation defending its position in the inquest, surely it is only right that the families of the soldiers involved should have equal representation, and that that should be paid for by legal aid. I hope that the Bill will be able to address that imbalance in respect of legal representation at military inquests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09012637000137">The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed argued that I had got the third aspect of military inquests slightly wrong. I am concerned about the possible secrecy of inquests. It appears that the provisions of the Bill are intended to make sure that grave, secret cases affecting the national interest could be heard in secret. There will, of course, be occasions when that is worth doing. However, we are concerned that when there was implicit criticism of the state&#151;as in two or three of the Oxfordshire coroner&#146;s recent inquests, for example&#151;the state would somehow or other seek to keep it quiet. It  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Jan 2009">

would not want criticism of military defence or the military in general and would seek to use the national interest as an excuse for making the inquest secret. Such inquests, and others&#151;those into prison deaths, for example&#151;involve exactly the kind of cases in which the public have a right to know what went wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09012637000138">The state should overcome its natural inclination to keep that kind of inquest secret, and ensure that it does not do so. The Secretary of State might like to think about ways of narrowing the definition of secret inquests. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed reckons that these fears are misplaced; if so, let us see a narrowing of the parameters so that the secrecy aspect of inquests can apply only to a very few. The whole question of military inquests is worthy of further development in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09012637000139">The second subject that concerns me greatly is suicide. I am pleased to serve on the all-party group on suicide prevention and to have a close relationship with the organisation Papyrus, which represents the parents of the 38 people so far who have committed suicide using the disgraceful sites on the web, which really are extraordinarily bad. This afternoon, I googled &#147;How to kill yourself&#148;, and the sort of stuff that came tumbling out was simply appalling, describing how to tie the piano wire around one&#146;s neck and how it is better to shoot or poison oneself in a river because one stands a better chance of success. Some of these sites not only describe how to do it but encourage people to do it, saying, &#147;Oh, you&#146;re a bit depressed, well here&#146;s how to end it all.&#148; They are absolutely disgraceful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09012637000140">In a civilised society such as ours we cannot allow that to continue, and there was a debate about how to set about the task in a meeting of the all-party group the other day. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East correctly said that the Samaritans, among others, have reservations, because banning anything with the word &#147;suicide&#148; in it would by definition ban the Samaritans site, which we cannot do. However, it should not be all that difficult to analyse the dozen or 20 really wicked, vicious, nasty sites and find ways of banning them and having them taken down. The excellent report recently commissioned by the Government agreed that that was a worthwhile thing to try to do. Australia and Japan have, with greater or lesser degrees of success, found ways of achieving exactly that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09012637000141">One of the problems with the clauses regarding internet-assisted suicide is that most of the sites come from overseas. It is fine to outlaw people who write these sites and threaten them with a 14-year prison sentence when they are based in the UK, but most of them are from elsewhere. The Government should consider whether extradition might be possible for some of these people. I put that forward as an idea; I am by no means recommending it. When people around the world are sending material into the UK designed to encourage our teenagers to kill themselves, surely there is an argument to say that we could enter into discussions with other nation states about possible extradition treaties so that these wicked people could be brought to justice here, even if writing such sites is not a crime in their countries. I hope that the example of the Bill may be followed by some other countries around the world, including America and in the European Union, so that this might be increasingly an international crime.</p>

The Bill makes no reference to ISPs. We should find a way of saying to them, &#147;These things are wicked; we as a nation and as a Parliament deplore them. If they were written in this country they would be outlawed and the people involved would go to prison for 14 years. We require you, as ISPs, to take them down, get them stopped, block them and finish them.&#148; I do not know how to do that because I do not know enough about computers, but they are a blot on our society and they must be dealt with.</p>

practice as well as in theory. The next of kin must be involved to the extent necessary to protect their legitimate interests, and the investigation must be prompt and proceed with reasonable expedition. My concern is that the new proposal will not achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09012637000151">A certification could be allowed in the interests of national security or of relations between the UK and another country. A new provision is that it could be allowed in the interests of preventing or detecting crime or of protecting witnesses or other persons. As a catch-all, it could be allowed for reasons otherwise in the public interest. The effect, of course, will be having no jury. I am pleased that the Government have accepted one of the amendments that I tabled to the Counter-Terrorism Bill, suggesting that the Lord Chief Justice should appoint a High Court judge as the coroner, but that is about as far as it goes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09012637000152">The problem is that the proposals will apply to exactly the sort of cases that, above all others, should have the breath of fresh air from the open window of transparency blowing through them. The most serious and contentious arise when the state or a foreign Government are implicated. We have heard about the de Menezes case and the deaths of service personnel, and the Royal British Legion has mentioned friendly fire incidents. There are cases involving soldiers in training, such as at Deepcut, which my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) mentioned, and deaths at the hands of foreign Governments&#146; torturers or security services. In the Mubarek case, when a young man died in Feltham, an inquiry was resisted tooth and nail until the Government were ordered to hold one. Exactly the sort of cases that should be held in the open run the risk of being held in secret. We do not have criminal trials without juries in terrorist, national security or espionage cases, so why do we need such inquests without them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09012637000153">I believe that the Government have misinterpreted the requirements of article 2 and its case law. They are arguing for a counsel of perfection. Article 2 does not require an absolute finding of fact using every last scrap of evidence. Inquests do not operate to the criminal standard of proof beyond all reasonable doubt. What is required is an adequate and effective inquiry that is independent, constitutes public scrutiny and involves the next of kin. The system will not give the public confidence that lessons have been learned. Equally importantly, if not more so, it will not give closure to relatives if they and their lawyers of choice are excluded. It is sometimes difficult for relatives to get closure even under the existing arrangements, and it may well be difficult under the reformed arrangements. Are relatives seriously expected to take the specially appointed coroner&#146;s word for what happened to their loved one? A jury is an essential part of the closure process.</p>

 I want to confine my comments to the provisions on coroners, and to refer to the Data Protection Act 1998. I agree with many points that the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) made about the ambit and other aspects of that measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para26"><a name="0901272000007">Clearly, there is much in the Bill that we can welcome about the reform of the coroners&#146; courts system. I believe that this is the first reform since 1285, so those who have said that it is long overdue are probably correct. We all welcome the establishment of the chief coroner, the modernisation of the coroner&#146;s powers of inquiry and investigation, and the creation of rights for interested parties, including bereaved families. Those provisions will improve the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para27"><a name="0901272000008">I hope that we will reflect on one aspect of the charter for the bereaved: most of the focus is on the coroner&#146;s service. From my experience of dealing with cases of bereaved families, who are trying to get through a difficult time, some of the issues often involve the relationship between the coroner&#146;s service and, for example, the police service. If the release of a body is requested or required from the police, getting them to respond appropriately in relation to the coroner&#146;s activities is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para28"><a name="0901272000009">I wholeheartedly endorse and welcome the charter for the bereaved, but it needs to take account of the relationship with other agencies, so that the bereaved do not have to chase the police for the release of the body&#151;as happened in a case that was recently brought to me&#151;and almost have to go through the funeral to the cremation without it. As a separate issue, the charter also needs to take into account inquests that might take place in several weeks&#146; or months&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90126-0018.htm_para29"><a name="0901272000010">There still seems to be a distinction relating to the requirements for allowing a cremation to take place. Death certification is required, but in the case of a cremation, additional requirements and certificates are needed. That matter does not appear to be touched on in the Bill, but the recommendations that came out of the Shipman and Luce inquiries suggested that those questions would be dealt with. If that has not been reflected on to date, I hope that it will now be considered and addressed.</p>

I do not want to repeat the important points that have been made by other hon. Members, except to comment on the Secretary of State&#146;s point about the availability of judicial review. He said that there would be a right to challenge a decision on whether certification could take place. I have one fundamental question on that. If such a decision had been made on the basis of information that, by its very nature, had to be kept secret, how could someone challenge it on an ex parte basis and argue before a judge that there had been a procedural irregularity or that the decision had been unreasonable or irrational? A high hurdle would have to be overcome in order to gain protection in such circumstances, particularly in the context in which that right is intended to be framed.</p>

The last time I had the opportunity to debate these issues was during our consideration of the Serious Crime Act 2007, when we actively considered the use of data sharing and data matching to combat serious crime and fraud. The rules that were put in place by that Act were carefully crafted, and recognised as being there for a specific purpose. However, this Bill effectively drives a coach and horses through certain provisions, and does not properly take account of the fact that there are rights of ownership involved when we give personal information to other agencies, or that that information is given for a specific purpose. It is all very well to say that codes of conduct will buttress the provisions in some way, but the proposals are very wide-ranging and overarching. Once they are in place, there will be no real ability to change them.</p>

They seem to be saying that in order to deliver services, they need to know almost everything. That is what is driving the creation of these databases. However, if that information is already at risk, because of the honeypot effect that makes it vulnerable to attack by cybercriminals and those who want to use it to perpetrate cybercrime&#151;one of the fastest-growing kinds of crime in the country&#151;we need robust measures to ensure that those data are properly protected.</p>

Information may have been provided to a particular agency in the knowledge that data protections would be in place in that area, but if it is then shared with other agencies, the standard of vigilance and the standard of data protection may not be as high. That alone shows how data sharing may create a further risk of cybercrime. Equally, there is the issue of insider risk in terms of the integrity of the  <br>

It also shows why it is so important that the definition of what information is used for, and to whom it is provided, is framed in primary legislation. As currently framed, it seems as if this law will enable the Government to drive a coach and horses through fundamental legislation, including the Data Protection Act itself, and the protections encompassed within it. To my mind, that simply cannot be right. If those provisions remain as they are, it is difficult to see how they can possibly be acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0901272000019">On my reading of the Bill, it seems not only to allow the transmission of information between Government Departments, but to envisage that the information could, if it were serving a certain purpose, be transferred outside the UK&#151;even though normal protections in the Data Protection Act would ring-fence it within the EU.</p>

The trust that we have put in the Government to do that has been misplaced. Until we can have confidence in how our data is stored, how it is used and how standards are maintained&#151;and, as I believe they should be, raised&#151;many people will ask, &#147;Why should we trust the Government to receive those wide-ranging powers if at this stage we cannot even trust them to keep our information secure?&#148; Until the Government can answer that question, they need to go away and think again.</p>

 I would like to speak about a very narrow area of this legislation&#151;the Bill makes the tiniest of references to it&#151;as it might have an even greater impact than the other proposals on many people. I am talking about non-invasive surgery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0901272000022">My attention was drawn to the issue of non-invasive post-mortems following the information that such surgical practices were happening in the Manchester area. I was approached by members of my local Muslim community to find out what was happening there, and whether it was possible for it to happen in Bradford. To that end, I established a steering group of local people, involving Ghulam Rasool of the Bradford council for mosques, Councillor Imran Hussain and Maulana Fazal Dad of the council for mosques, Idris Bashir, Aurangzeb Khan, a community activist, and Michael Levy, a solicitor from Manchester and legal adviser to the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0901272000023">The group considered a range of issues, which I will try to summarise. First, it considered technological advances such as the MRI scanner, which made non-invasive post-mortems possible. Secondly, it noted that for certain religious groups, such as Muslims and Jews, the integrity of the body was paramount. Thirdly, it found that Muslims and Jews, in particular, must bury the body as soon as possible, and that in some cases the  <br>

MRI scanner could make that possible. Fourthly, the group also felt that people of other faiths, and no faith, would in some cases also prefer to have non-invasive post-mortems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0901272000024">Before I continue, I want to thank the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice) for meeting me privately to discuss the issue and for agreeing to meet a delegation from the Bradford steering group. We hope that Jennifer Leeming, Her Majesty&#146;s coroner for the west Manchester district, will also attend that meeting. Her contribution has been invaluable, and I applaud her and her staff for the pioneering and groundbreaking work that they have done in the Manchester area. I hope that she will see the fruit of her labour enshrined in legislation. If any hon. Member thinks that this is an awful idea, they know who to blame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0901272000025">MRI scans of deceased persons are done out of hours, usually in the evening or early morning. They do not therefore prejudice or delay any access by live patients to the scanner, nor do live patients come into contact with the deceased or their attendants. In the Manchester jurisdiction, the option of non-invasive post-mortem by MRI scan is discussed with all who object to invasive post-mortems for whatever reason. If a request for non-invasive post-mortem by MRI scan is then made, it is discussed by Her Majesty&#146;s coroner or her staff with the consultant radiologist, who carries out the procedure to ascertain whether the medical and other history of the deceased person is such that an MRI scan is likely to reveal the cause of death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0901272000026">If a scan is undertaken but is unsuccessful in revealing a cause of death, Her Majesty&#146;s coroner will consider proceeding to an invasive post-mortem. The bereaved are advised that that is the case before the scan is agreed. Some cases are entirely unsuitable for scan. For example, a scan is not suitable if a police investigation that necessitates an invasive forensic post-mortem is taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0901272000027">The cost of a scan is borne by the family or other party requesting it. That is understood by the Bradford steering group, and would probably apply across the country. When the scan is concluded, a disc recording the result is retained. Thus a scan has, to that extent, an advantage over the invasive post-mortem, of which there is no permanent record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0901272000028">I shall now move on from scans to the out-of-hours service. If we want to speed up post-mortems and burials, which is especially important for the Jewish and Muslim communities, we need an improved out-of-hours service. I understand that the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction is the only jurisdiction in England and Wales offering a service that includes non-invasive post-mortems and invasive post-mortems out of hours. I press the Minister to look into out-of-hours service and, with regard to scans, to consider specifying radiologists as people who could be officers responsible within the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0901272000034">To prepare for the debate, I looked at the current death certificate, which is headed, &#147;Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953&#148;. I do not think that that has been changed since 1953, and it is certainly the same as the last death certificate that I signed, which was at least 13 years ago. I looked back also at Dame Janet Smith&#146;s brilliant and comprehensive third report following the Shipman inquiry. I shall remind the House of one or two things that she said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0901272000035">First, the current system depends on the honesty of the doctor. Dame Janet said:</p>
<a name="90126-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="0901272001169"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many of Shipman's patients died suddenly in circumstances in which no honest doctor could have claimed to know the cause of death. Yet Shipman, who had killed them, was able to certify the cause of death, avoid a report to the coroner and thus also avoid any official enquiry into the death.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0901272000036">She went on to stress the importance of training, observing:</p>
<a name="90126-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="0901272001170"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A further problem with the current system is that the quality of certification is poor. Doctors receive little training in death certification.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0901272000037">Certainly the training that I received was not really about the accuracy of the death certificate.

<a name="90126-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="0901272001171"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This does not mean the mode of dying, such as heart failure, asphyxia, asthenia, etc: it means the disease, injury, or complication which caused death&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para24"><a name="0901272000039">I do not think that anyone nowadays would use the terms &#147;asphyxia&#148; and &#147;asthenia&#148;. Shipman, however, used the term &#147;natural causes&#148; in two of his death certificates. Dame Janet Smith draws attention to the fact that, amazingly, the registrars in Tameside did not know that &#147;natural causes&#148; was not acceptable as a cause of death. They had to get in touch with their superiors, who felt that it was acceptable, so Shipman got away with &#147;natural causes&#148;.</p>

that an acceptable term was &#147;bronchopneumonia&#148;, and that as long as that condition was put first on the death certificate of any elderly person, whether he or she had had it or not, the registrar would accept it.

What examination can one conduct to help establish the cause of death? It is crucial that there is a system for the medical examiner who is to be appointed to conduct a proper examination at this stage, if no post-mortem has taken place.</p>

However, along with many others, I do not welcome the parts that imply secrecy, or those that ride rather roughshod over data protection measures.

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para33"><a name="0901272000049">On coroners, it is bad enough for our constituents to lose a loved one in a violent incident or accident, but all too often the resulting inquest is a thoroughly traumatic and bewildering experience. Reform is, therefore, long overdue. I noted that the Coroners&#146; Society said that:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para36"><a name="0901272000052">As I have said, the coroner service is long overdue for reform. The Shipman inquiry under Dame Janet Smith and the excellent Luce review both took place almost five years ago. They were followed by the Government&#146;s draft proposals in 2004. Reform is better late than never, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90126-0019.htm_para37"><a name="0901272000053">A great deal in part 1 of the Bill is to be welcomed. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), who made a well-researched speech, and I congratulate her on the work she has done on behalf of bereaved service families. I welcome the creation of the posts of chief coroner and deputy chief coroner. We welcome the new appeals system, too, and the powers to transfer investigations of deaths to another coroner. That is highly relevant to military inquests, and I was very impressed by what the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) had to say on that subject. I have always found it strange that inquests involving the deaths of fallen servicemen and women could not be transferred to the district of the bereaved families, although I take on board the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) that it is important to recognise the expertise that exists in certain areas&#151;he referred to Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. There needs to be more flexibility, however, and the Bill allows for that.</p>

Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) and the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), who both said that, in future, it is important for there to be far better co-ordination between the different agencies. The people putting together that charter should look carefully at the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) and at the points that he made about the use of MRI scans.</p>

Of course, there will be cost implications for the Government&#146;s proposal, and the points made and questions posed by the hon. Member for Stafford and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed need to be examined carefully. The Jean Charles de Menezes inquest alone cost more than &#163;1 million. There must be a very strong case for central Government providing funds for court  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90126-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0901272000056">We also welcome the new procedures in clause 2, which allow for the appointment of medical examiners who will oversee the independent scrutiny and confirmation of medical certificates of the causes of death. That was recommended in the Shipman inquiry report and it is long overdue. However, the Coroners&#146; Society points out that both the Shipman report and the Luce report recommended the integration of the coroner and death registration services, but that has been ignored in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will take a close look at that issue and at the points made by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), who is highly respected&#151;careful note should be taken of his expertise and insight. Obviously, the medical examiners need to be truly independent, as a number of hon. and right hon. Members have said.</p>

Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) in a moving speech containing a number of well-informed remarks about suicide victims based on the tragic constituency experience that she went through. Such a person or organisation must then give the coroner a written response. The explanatory notes state:</p>
<a name="90126-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="0901272001176"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Further provision may be made in rules enabling reports...to be published.&#148;</p>

Surely one of the key roles of the coronial service is to improve public safety by ensuring that obvious mistakes, omissions and bad practices are not repeated. We must take on board the suggestions and comments made by the hon. Members for Bridgend and for Stafford. Surely schedule 4 does not go far enough, because no mechanism is in place to ensure that the recommendations are properly recorded and implemented&#151;we should look at this carefully in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90126-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0901272000059">If one examines the part of the Bill dealing with coroners, one finds that it is about snakes and ladders; the Government have put in place some good ladders and we praise them for that, but there is a nasty snake that may come crashing down in clause 11. That clause, which many right hon. and hon. Members have discussed, provides for the Secretary of State to issue a certificate that allows inquests to be held without a jury. That provision will gravely limit transparency and increase Executive control over the inquests process. The measure was first introduced in the 2008 Counter-Terrorism Bill, but it was withdrawn, and I greatly regret its reappearance. I say that because the grounds for removing the jury are very broad indeed&#151;if anything, they are broader now than they were in that original Bill, because the Coroners and Justice Bill provides for its removal for reasons</p>

Member for Cambridge, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). He is a former deputy coroner and we should listen to him very carefully. Others to make that point included the hon. Members for Blackpool, North  <br>

and Fleetwood and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox). They all pointed out that the Bill will undermine public confidence in the inquest system. It was right, for example, that the inquest on the death of Jean Charles de Menezes was held in public, but under these proposals it would almost certainly have been held in private. I am worried that the number of inquests heard without juries would grow, and what was meant to be an occasional fall-back option could become the norm. That is why we need to strike that clause from the Bill when the time comes.</p>

That was followed by its fundamental review of murder and manslaughter in 2006. The Bill is a piecemeal, fragmented and unsatisfactory approach to the issues of murder, infanticide and suicide. I listened carefully to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon, who is an expert on criminal law. As well as putting in a strong bid to serve in Committee, he gave some good reasons why this aspect of the Bill needs to be improved. A step-by-step approach is not good enough. As my hon. and learned Friend said so eloquently, in spite of the Government&#146;s good intentions, there are always dangers in simply cherry picking important, carefully reasoned and crafted, but highly controversial Law Commission proposals. That is why we must examine those provisions carefully.</p>

Friend the Member for North Wiltshire has some excellent ideas for combating the existence of overseas suicide sites.

Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) that we need to look carefully at what really works, especially when it comes to community sentencing. We have no problems with plans for a sentencing council, but we are concerned about the guidelines that it will issue. At the moment, the courts are required to have regard to the guidelines, but in future they will have to follow the guidelines unless satisfied that to do so would be contrary to the interests of justice. That is a proposal for strict compliance and I share the concerns about that have been raised by the Bar Council, the Magistrates&#146; Association and many other organisations.</p>

I will not rehearse the arguments now, but the proposals are very worrying, because they would undermine the whole essence of the data protection legislation. That is why so many Members on the Opposition Benches have spoken against them.</p>

 As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) said, this has been a constructive and intelligent debate, not least because my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State took 26 interventions. We have been through the Bill fairly thoroughly as a result. I welcome the many positive comments that have been made about many of the provisions in the Bill, such as the establishment of the post of chief coroner, the introduction of national standards, a new appeals system and the charter for bereaved families. They will all help to ensure that the coroner system, which dates back to the reign of Richard I, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) said, will be made fit for the 21st century.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Sadly, I was not lucky enough to be called to speak in the debate or to intervene on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. However, my hon.

Will she give some thought as the Bill progresses to allowing some form of support or representation for families of the bereaved in the coroners&#146; courts, as has been suggested by Victim Support?</p>

 A number of Members have raised that issue as well as my hon. Friend. We will reflect on it and we will look to see what we can do to give bereaved families more support when they find themselves at inquests. At the moment, they have very good personal support in many areas from some of the coroners&#146; officers and so on, but I know that hon. Members want us to go further than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90126-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0901272000071">We recognise the issue that has been identified in terms of private inquests, and I am glad that other hon. Members recognise the problem that we face. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), in particular, described those difficulties in a very reasoned way. We will welcome constructive dialogue on that subject. If hon. Members have suggestions about how we can make that section of the Bill better, we will be happy to look at the provisions again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90126-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0901272000072">There are very few occasions when a coroner&#146;s investigation will involve highly sensitive information, for example, intercept evidence or the identity of a human intelligence source that simply cannot be made public. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, inquests are unlike criminal trials as one cannot decide not to proceed with an inquest. We have to go ahead with an inquest and so we have to find a way to deal with the problem posed by such information properly and sensitively. We have made significant changes to the original proposals and I hope that in reflecting on what we can do to make the provisions better, colleagues will recognise that we have moved some distance from the proposals in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. We have also made it explicit in the Bill that all other ways of enabling an inquest to be held in public have to be considered fully before the PII certificate is considered. If that is not possible, we have tied in the criteria for triggering the certification and placed a duty on the Secretary of State to notify interested parties of the certification decision so that they can lodge an application for judicial review. There are already important safeguards.</p>

We are open to discussion about how best to cover the arrangements for what most Members agree are difficult issues regarding sensitive material. Families would be excluded from the inquest only at the points when that sensitive material was being discussed. They would be present for every other part of the inquest.</p>

I hope that that answers the several Opposition Members who asked what the chief coroner&#146;s reports will contain.

 In April last year, the Government introduced a scheme that was welcomed in all parts of the House. The national bus concessionary fare scheme means that everyone over 60 and people with certain disabilities are now able to travel on local buses for free in any part of the country, not just where they live. The Government provided &#163;212 million in a special grant to pay for the scheme, money which eventually finds its way into the coffers of the bus companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0901276000343">The dispute is not so much about the objective of the scheme, which many people across the country have benefited from, including Members of this House. There are still some problems to be ironed out: for example, campaigners for deaf-blind people point out that it makes no sense to charge a disabled person nothing to travel, but to charge full fare for their helper, without whom they could not travel. However, such difficulties aside, this is a well-intentioned scheme and there is no dispute about its objectives. The dispute is about the route that the &#163;212 million goes on via local councils to the bus companies, and the serious problem that some councils are paying out to bus companies vastly more than the Government are paying to them, whereas other councils are making a handy profit out of the scheme and are diverting the money allocated to them for it to general purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0901276000344">There were already concessionary fare schemes around the country before April, and there has been controversy over their funding, because some councils say that the amounts of money allocated to them for the previous schemes were insufficient and that this underfunding has been carried over into the new scheme. It is difficult to assess those claims, because the central funding used to be wrapped up in a very obscure way in the general grant central Government pay to local government, although I suspect councils would have something to say about that. I do not, however, want to spend time tonight on that old controversy. I want to concentrate solely on the financial effects of the new scheme that came in last April. Because it has been funded by a special grant, its effects are clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0901276000345">The problem with the new system is that its starting point is that a local authority pays for the bus journeys not of its residents, but of anyone who gets on a bus within its district. That simple rule has produced two serious anomalies that are having a devastating effect on the finances of a number of district councils, including that of Cambridge, which I represent. The first anomaly, and the most obvious, is that districts that are tourist attractions end up paying for the bus journeys of visitors. If every district of the country was equally likely to attract tourists from every other district, there would be no problem.</p>

 I am pleased that Oxford and Cambridge can join forces on this issue. In Oxford, there is the serious problem of underfunding to the tune of almost &#163;500,000 and rising. Although, as the hon. Gentleman says, the intention behind the concessionary scheme is wonderful, this  <br>

must be addressed by looking at the formula afresh in the interests of Cambridge, Oxford and other such authorities. I think that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who is present, is nodding in agreement.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="0901276000347"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="0901276000722"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 I am glad to be able to agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I am surrounded by Oxford Members, and I think I heard my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) agreeing very strongly with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o327"><a name="0901276000348"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="0901276000723"><b>Dr. Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b>
 May I bring the hon. Gentleman to more humble origins and a city such as Norwich, which is also a truly attractive area that brings people in from the county of Norfolk? Norwich City council is &#163;1.5 million down as a result of this scheme, whereas the council next door is &#163;800,000 up. That is because a calculation is made on the basis of the people who come into Norwich and the council has to pay for it. I am sure there are other examples, but people are being disadvantaged in Norwich because the fact that people get off buses there means that the council has to pay&#151;it is completely unfair.</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="0901276000349"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0901276000724"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I shall get on to the details of the scheme later, but what he describes is not uncommon around the country. Paying for visitors has had enormous effects on not only Oxford, Cambridge and, to some extent, Norwich, but on Torbay and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="0901276000350"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew6"><a name="0901276000725"><b>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay) (LD):</b>
 Is it not an unfair system that penalises areas that are successful tourist resorts? Such areas do not receive any extra money to help to promote them or to pay for the additional costs of tourism.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="0901276000351"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew7"><a name="0901276000726"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right; I shall come to the formula in a moment, because it does not properly reflect the costs being imposed on councils in such areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0901276000352">The second anomaly is less obvious, although the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) mentioned it, but it is just as damaging. In urban districts that are surrounded by suburban or rural districts, the pay-where-the-journey-starts rule means that if someone comes into town for a hospital appointment or a shopping trip, the council covering where they live pays only for their outward journey&#151;the council covering the place where they go to hospital or shop pays for their journey home. Far more people travel from out of town into town for health care, for shopping and for entertainment than go from town in the opposite direction to the rural areas. The effect is that urban districts pay far more for the journeys of rural dwellers than rural districts pay for the journeys of town dwellers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0901276000353">The situation can be even worse where there are park-and-ride schemes. In Cambridge, most of the park-and-ride sites are just within the city boundary. People from outside town drive just over the city boundary and park, and the city council then pays for both their journeys on the bus. Just to illustrate how arbitrary this can be, I should point out that a park-and-ride site in Cambridge is being moved less than a mile, from inside  <br>

Cambridge to south Cambridgeshire and that move alone will transfer about &#163;30,000 a year between the two councils involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0901276000354">This second anomaly affects places where the district boundaries are drawn, as I think they largely should be, where town meets country. The result is large effects on places such as Norwich, Exeter, Chesterfield, and Cambridge.</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="0901276000355"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew8"><a name="0901276000727"><b>Mr. Andrew Smith:</b>

 And Oxford. The fact that both anomalies affect my constituency, as they do the constituency of the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), is largely why I am standing here tonight. The effect on the Cambridge City council&#146;s budget is stark. The new scheme alone is costing the council, and thus my constituents, about &#163;1 million a year. The council also thinks that a further &#163;500,000 a year is appearing on its budget because of the old scheme, but I wish to concentrate on the new scheme alone.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="0901276000357"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="0901276000729"><b>Mr. Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. No buses come to the Isle of Wight, so people get there, jump on our buses and, thus, we pay for all of them. The Isle of Wight council is spending between &#163;3 million and &#163;5 million on the Government&#146;s free travel. During a meeting with Ministers last week, Councillor Tim Hunter-Henderson pointed out that &#163;1.7 million had been received in grant income and the relevant Minister pointed out the difficulty of identifying what grant had been paid out in respect of the scheme. There might be enough money in the scheme nationally, but it is impossible to get figures at a local level.</p>

<p><a name="st_o334"><a name="0901276000358"><a name="90126-0022.htm_spnew11"><a name="0901276000730"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman might be right about the old scheme, but we have more accurate figures for the new scheme and I shall just set out the figures for Cambridge under the new scheme alone. Expenditure on concessionary fares since last April has increased by &#163;1.6 million a year&#151;177 per cent. The Government grant to Cambridge for the scheme assumed that the increase would be only 60 per cent. The Department described that grant as &#147;generous&#148;, but a better description would be &#147;wholly inadequate&#148;. The Department has got its predictions immensely wrong&#151;by a factor of three&#151;and it should put the situation right immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0901276000359">That &#163;1 million will not sound like much to the Minister, who is used to dealing in billions, but it is devastating to a small district council. It represents 15 per cent. of the money that the council raises in council tax in a year, but it cannot be recouped using council tax receipts, because it would put the council many times over the Government&#146;s capping limit. On the spending side, it represents the loss of some 30 jobs, and the situation in other places is even worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0901276000360">Cambridge City council, like all public authorities, is having financial difficulties this year, but this is by far the biggest financial problem the council faces and it is of the Government&#146;s making. In the long run, a &#163;1 million deficit has to be paid for somehow, and that means service reductions, tax increases, increases in charges or all three.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0901276000361">The Government&#146;s response has been to say five things, but they are wrong about all of them. First, the Government say that there is enough money in the  <br>

special grant overall. Some hon. Members may dispute that, but even if it is true, it is irrelevant to the question, which is about the distribution of the money between councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0901276000362">Secondly, the Government say that the grant formula already deals with the problem because it takes into account the number of overnight visitors and the amount of retail floor space in the district. But it is obvious from what has happened in practice that it has not done so enough. Nor has the formula taken into account all the relevant factors such as health care and the positioning of park-and-ride sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0901276000363">Thirdly, the Government say that councils could get a better deal with the bus companies to reduce costs, but that argument does not work because even the councils that have achieved the best deals with the bus companies&#151;for example, Exeter&#151;still face massive deficits. In any case, the reimbursement rates in a two-tier area are negotiated not by the district council, which has to pay, but by the county council, which does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0901276000364">Fourthly, the Government say that the present scheme will last only three years and that next time they might transfer responsibility for it from district councils to county councils. That might help a little in some places, because there would be fewer problems caused by journeys across boundaries, but it would not stop the unevenness caused by tourism, which is uneven across the country at a county level as well as at a district level. The Isle of Wight is an extreme example of that issue. The Local Government Association points out that it is becoming clear in several areas that even if the grant were to be pooled at county level, there would still be shortfalls. Lancashire, for example, would still be &#163;2 million short, and the deficits in the unitary authorities, such as Nottingham and Brighton, would be unchanged.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a compelling case. The financial evidence from all over England from councils run by all parties&#151;this is not a party-political issue&#151;is that the Government have simply not provided enough money for the bus fare scheme. In Chesterfield alone, the underfunding is some &#163;1.7 million, which is equal to a 40 per cent. increase in the council tax or 80 council staff who would have to be sacked by the end of February to set a budget for next year. Are my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents as furious as mine at the devastating effect that the Government&#146;s broken funding promises will have on local services? My constituents are even more furious that the Prime Minister recently found time for a publicity stunt on Chesterfield railway station, but could not find time to meet the council to talk about the appalling results of the underfunding of this Government policy.</p>

The Government caused this mess and they should sort it out.</p>

 At the outset, I want to congratulate the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) on securing the debate. I am beginning to quite enjoy my attendance at Adjournment debates, whether they are about rail fares or concessionary fares. Both are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0901276000370">I am proud of the Government&#146;s record on concessionary travel. In 2000, for the first time, older and disabled people in England were guaranteed the same minimum concession regardless of where they lived, giving them half-price bus travel within their local authority area. From April 2006, we improved that statutory minimum concession from half-price fare to free local travel for those eligible at a cost of an additional &#163;350 million, a sum provided by central Government that rises each year&#151;this year, it is at &#163;377 million&#151;and goes in through the revenue support grant provisions. It was widely recognised at the time that the total sum of &#163;350 million in 2006 was an adequate figure to cover the additional cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0901276000371">In addition, the Prime Minister announced that 11 million older and disabled people would be able to use off-peak local bus services free of charge anywhere in England from April 2008. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, we provided an additional &#163;212 million to pay for that, which was distributed using a formula that reflects areas of likely demand, whether they are shopping destinations or tourist areas such as coastal towns. I shall deal further with the formula in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="90126-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0901276000372">The funding is additional funding. I noted that the hon. Gentleman said that we had provided &#163;212 million to pay for the concessionary fares. No. Let me make it absolutely clear that there was already money in the revenue support grant mechanism and the formula grant provisions to local authorities. The &#163;212 million was to reflect the additional cost of going from local free travel in local areas to free travel nationally in England.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend will be surprised to know that my constituents are no better off than those of the hon.

The council is using the money and the surplus in the general rate fund and is forcing my constituents to choose between free rail and bus travel. It will not allow them to have both, but next door, in Merseyside, residents have that facility. The Government have given the money and the money is there, but it is being used for something else. My elderly residents are being forced to choose between bus and rail. It is not fair.</p>

<p><a name="st_o339"><a name="0901276000374"><a name="90126-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="0901276000735"><b>Paul Clark:</b>
 My hon. Friend refers to the number of variations that there are. The powers in the Transport Act 2000 that allowed local authorities to make additional provisions still exist, and they are a matter for local authorities. Equally, her point highlights the fact that in some areas the money in a given area is more than sufficient to meet the additional costs. That matter has been raised with me in a series of meetings with individual Members and their delegations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0901276000375">The &#163;212 million special grant will continue to rise, to &#163;217 million in 2009-10 and to &#163;223 million in 2010-11. That will give councils a significant increase in bus concession funding&#151;typically around 30 per cent., and far higher in many places&#151;so that pass holders can use buses anywhere in England. The change is having a real impact. The new national concession is of huge benefit to millions of eligible people, as I am sure that the House is well aware. It allows them free off-peak travel anywhere in England, and it also helps other Government goals, for example in respect of combating social exclusion, to be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0901276000376">The improved concession guarantees people access to facilities outside their local area and helps them to keep in touch with family and friends. It provides new leisure opportunities so that, when they visit other parts of England on holiday, eligible people can travel free on local buses at off-peak times. Moreover, the fact that the concession encourages people to visit popular tourist destinations brings benefits to the wider economy in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0901276000377">The latest extension to the statutory minimum concession brings the spending on concessionary travel to more than &#163;1 billion each year, and I think that hon. Members will recognise that that is not an insignificant sum. We are confident that the funding that we provide is sufficient to cover the total cost of the statutory minimum concession. The size of the new grant is based on generous assumptions about fares, bus pass take-up rates, extra journeys and additional operating costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0901276000378">We also consulted extremely widely on how best to distribute the new funding. No formula will ever be perfect, but the one that we eventually used is based on four factors&#151;eligible population, retail floor space, bus patronage and visitor numbers. All those factors correlate to the actual cost of the concession, but hon. Members need to be aware that an underlying principle of the concessionary scheme&#146;s funding is that bus operators should be no worse and no better off. Obviously, filling an empty space on a bus does not cost as much as the fare that would normally be charged in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0901276000379">I accept that the discussions and negotiations with the bus companies will be complex, but I have met people from all the areas represented by those hon. Members who have spoken in the debate. That is, I have met people from Torbay and the Isle of Wight, and I am due to meet people from Chesterfield. Moreover, I know that my officials have met representatives from all the councils and areas referred to in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0901276000380">I am aware that reimbursement rates have reached as high as 70-odd per cent. in some areas. In contrast, reimbursement rates in other authorities have been in the region of 40 to 50 per cent.</p>

 If the Minister were to do the arithmetic in his head, he would realise that many councils, including Cambridge, would still be massively out of pocket even at the higher reimbursement rate that he mentioned.</p>

 I note that, through the special grant, Cambridge has received an increase on its 2007-08 allocation worth &#163;650,000, or a 57 per cent. increase on the actual costs last year. In addition, the hon. Gentleman is claiming that it is anticipated that another &#163;400,000 will be needed. That means that Cambridge will need in excess of &#163;1 million on top of last year&#146;s provision&#151;and anyone can work out that the new amount is almost double the cost of last year&#146;s provision. The formula that was provided was based on estimates that took account of exactly those points that he raised. The formula does not work against tourist destinations, as he claimed. In fact, it allows such matters to be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0901276000383">The hon. Gentleman referred to urban districts surrounded by rural areas, but that is another factor that the formula takes into account. Obviously, the amount of retail floor space can be one of the attractions for visitors, and that is why South Cambridgeshire received an increase in its special grant allocation of only 29 per cent. on 2007-08. So the formula is working to reflect exactly some of the factors raised by the hon. Gentleman and some of the other hon. Members who have contributed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="0901276000384"><a name="90126-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="0901276000738"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 There is all the difference in the world between a formula that takes into account factors and one that takes them into account enough. It is plain from what has actually happened on the ground that the formula is inadequate in the weighting that it gives. It might have some of the right factors, but that is not the same as doing the job.</p>

<p><a name="st_o343"><a name="0901276000385"><a name="90126-0023.htm_spnew4"><a name="0901276000739"><b>Paul Clark:</b>
 Let me add in response to that intervention that, when we looked at which formula should be used, we obviously had to take into account who should pay for the travel and at which end of the journey. When introducing a nationwide travel scheme throughout England, we soon realised that, if the old way had remained and areas paid for their own residents who travelled, a lot of cross-working out would have to be done and that that would be a terribly complex system. Therefore, the decision was not just taken in Great Minster house&#151;discussions were held through the various normal channels, the travel concession authorities and the Local Government Association about the best and most appropriate way forward&#151;and the system was based on where the travelling starts, so there was a need to take that into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0901276000386">On the other comments that have been made, the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)&#151;I am due to meet him shortly with a delegation, and I obviously look forward to that&#151;claims that there is &#163;1.7 million of underfunding. In fact, the out-turn for expenditure in 2007-08 was &#163;1.44 million on bus fares. Again, it has been claimed that an increase of more than 100 per cent. has been happening, that the requirements have not been met and that all councils have been affected. May I respectfully point out that some 219 local authorities are involved as travel concession authorities and that by no means all of them are saying that they are suffering problems in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests, so the issue needs to be put into balance?</p>

figures that I have quoted are not mine; they were proposed by Labour-run Derbyshire county council and show that three of the councils in Derbyshire are grossly underfunded by the scheme. Even if we took the overfunding for six of the councils, it would still only make up 40 per cent. of the underfunding for the three that are badly hit, such as Chesterfield.</p>

 In all the discussions that I have had, invariably what is being indicated&#151;if not on the record, certainly unofficially&#151;is that people other than the Government believe that there is enough money in any given area, usually a county. Perhaps it is a question of how the formula is working in given areas. One of the reasons why we shall consult shortly is to consider how the scheme can be administered in a way that provides better distribution, or what is believed to be better distribution, across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="90126-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0901276000389">One reason why we said that if an area decides that one authority will be the funding authority and the others agree, we would follow that route, is that we can do the same thing now.
