Will the Prime Minister reiterate what his predecessor said&#151;namely, that whatever our generals need on the front line, he will supply it?</p>

 The Government are today publishing the results of work on the use of communications intercepts as evidence. Those results are contained in the report of the committee of Privy Councillors drawn from the three major parties that was chaired by the right hon. Sir John Chilcot. I am grateful to Sir John, Lord Hurd, Lord Archer, and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) for that report. It is thorough, measured, detailed, and unanimous, and it properly reflects both the seriousness and the complexity of the questions that their committee was asked to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08020693000178">Let me again pay tribute to our security agencies for all that they do, quietly and effectively, in the defence of our country. I have met and listened to those who lead our agencies, as well as many who serve in them. I praise the expertise, professionalism and courage that they show, often in the most testing and dangerous of circumstances but always in the best interests of our country. I acknowledge, as I believe that all here acknowledge, that what they do defends our freedom, protects our security and saves lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08020693000179">The use of intercept in evidence characterises a central dilemma that we face as a free society: preserving our liberties and the rule of law while at the same time keeping our nation safe and secure. In July, in the first statement that I made on security to the House, I said that I favoured the principle of using intercept material as evidence in criminal cases if, but only if, a way could be found to do so while protecting the higher interests of national security. I therefore invited the cross-party Chilcot committee to advise on</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08020693002039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;whether a regime to allow the use of intercepted material in court can be devised that facilitates bringing cases to trial while meeting the overall imperative to safeguard national security.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08020693000180">Today, I am publishing a version of the Chilcot committee&#146;s report. The committee itself has prepared this version, which omits&#151;in the interests of national security&#151;certain sensitive facts and arguments. Its main conclusions and recommendations, however, are exactly those of the full report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08020693000181">Briefly, the report examines in detail both the potential benefits of accepting intercept as evidence and the risks that might arise from such acceptance. However, it concludes that it should be possible to find a way to use some intercept material as evidence, provided&#151;and only provided&#151;that certain key conditions can be met. Those conditions relate to the most vital imperative of all: safeguarding our national security. The Government accept that recommendation, and take the accompanying conditions very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08020693000182">Intercepts are strictly controlled under the 2000 legislation. Interception is allowed only if it is necessary to obtain information that could not be acquired in another way, and any interception must be proportionate to what it seeks to achieve. The relevant decisions of Ministers are overseen by a senior judge and by the interception of communications commissioner, who reports at least annually. In addition, an investigatory powers tribunal exists to consider complaints from the public, and it has powers to order appropriate remedies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000183">The most recent figures for numbers of interception warrants are in the interception commissioner&#146;s annual report, which was published on 28 January. A total of 1,435 intercept warrants were issued in the last nine months of 2006 and that compares with 2,407 in the previous 15 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08020693000184">The Chilcot report notes that there are already limited circumstances in civil and terrorist proceedings where intercept can be used in evidence. Each of those instances includes appropriate protections, such as closed proceedings, to ensure that the use of intercept does not put our national security at risk. For any new regime, the Chilcot report sets down conditions. It starts from the proposition that</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08020693002040"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any material risk to the strategic capability of the UK&#146;s intelligence agencies would be unacceptable&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08020693000185">and that</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08020693002041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any disclosure of interception capabilities could have a profound impact on national security&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000186">That is right. The report also says that any resulting reduction in inter-agency co-operation</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08020693002042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;could have a profound impact on law enforcement agencies&#146; ability to combat serious crime and terrorism&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000187">and the Government also agree with that assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08020693000188">The report sets out nine conditions in detail. They relate to complex and important issues, and include: giving the intercepting agencies the ability to retain control over whether their material is used in prosecutions; ensuring that disclosure of material cannot be required against the wishes of the agency originating the material; protecting the current close co-operation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, which is crucial; and ensuring that agencies cannot be required to transcribe or make notes of material beyond a standard of detail that they deem necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08020693000189">The committee that reported to us acknowledges that further extensive work is needed to see whether and how those and other conditions&#151;intended to protect sensitive techniques, safeguard resources, and ensure that intercept can still be used effectively for intelligence&#151;can be met. That is a unanimous recommendation that the Government accept, so we will proceed to develop a detailed implementation plan under which material might be made available for use in criminal cases in England and Wales, strictly subject to all the Chilcot conditions being met. The report is clear that if the conditions could not be met, intercept as evidence should not be introduced, and the Government accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08020693000190">Similarly, the committee recommends that in the event of a regime being introduced that later fails to meet the Chilcot conditions or otherwise threatens our security, that regime should be removed pending the introduction of another, under which the conditions can once again be met. The Government also accept that recommendation. The report also states that the committee has seen no evidence to suggest that the need for measures such as control orders would be reduced by the introduction of intercept as evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08020693000191">Designing a regime to meet the Chilcot conditions will require, as the committee notes, a substantial programme of work, covering legal, operational and technical issues. The work must involve and engage the intelligence agencies, Government Departments, the legal system, and those responsible for communications. The  <br>

Chilcot team have made it clear to me that the necessary work should be led by an implementation team within Government, which should move ahead comprehensively and quickly. However, the Chilcot team also told me that they would not expect the work to be concluded in time to inform the Counter-Terrorism Bill currently before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08020693000192">The Government strongly believe that it is in the national interest to draw on a wide range of expert external advice. The cross-party nature of the Chilcot report has been of great value. I am therefore grateful for Opposition parties&#146; agreement that Sir John Chilcot, Lord Archer, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and another member to be nominated should advise on Privy Councillor terms during the next stage of the work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08020693000193">The Chilcot report also notes that communications technology is changing rapidly; there is a switch towards internet protocol communications, with the clear implications that that brings for our security. Accordingly, we have launched the interception modernisation programme to update our capability to ensure that, under those new circumstances, our national interests will continue to be protected. The new regime for intercept as evidence must be designed to work safely and effectively for that new capability, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08020693000194">As the Chilcot report states, the challenges ahead are complex and must not, and will not, be underestimated. The Government acknowledge and endorse the valuable work of the committee, and are grateful for the committee&#146;s support in our continuing efforts to meet the double challenge that we face as a nation. The challenge is at all times and without fail to protect our nation&#146;s security while advancing the rule of law. This we will always seek to do. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

 May I first thank the Prime Minister for his statement, and join him in paying tribute to our security services? Nothing matters more than our national security and keeping us safe from terror. Our aim should be to catch, convict and imprison more terrorists. Last year, I pressed Tony Blair to make intercept evidence available in court. When he was not prepared to take that up straight away, I suggested that a cross-party committee of Privy Councillors look at how intercept might be used in court. I am glad that that work is now complete. I join the Prime Minister in thanking all of those who took part. They have done their job, and now he must do his. Will he confirm that the implementation group that he intends to set up will not be a talking shop for further delay, but a vehicle for making the recommendations happen?

agree that the report effectively gives good answers to all four questions? Let me take them in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08020693000197">First, the report is admirably clear when it says:</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev4"><a name="08020693002043"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We therefore agree with the principle that intercept as evidence should be introduced.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08020693000198">Does the Prime Minister agree that, as this is the first Government-commissioned report by a group of people who are independent from the Government, that is an incredibly powerful recommendation? Secondly, on the real benefits of using intercept in court, does the Prime Minister agree that the report does not just cite experience from abroad, but quotes the UK&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service? Is not the CPS clear that the use of intercept will significantly influence the course of trials and&#151;it finds&#151;lead to more guilty pleas and fewer abortive trials?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08020693000199">The third issue is the importance of protecting intelligence sources and methods. Does the Prime Minister agree that the report is extremely helpful in that respect, too? In particular, does he agree with the report when it states that</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08020693002044"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Australia does appear to us to be a compelling example of how intercept as evidence can be used in a Common Law jurisdiction&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08020693000200">Is it not extremely helpful that the report states:</p>
<a name="80206-0004.htm_brev6"><a name="08020693002045"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Australian example, in particular, provides a number of interesting ideas for how the UK could attempt to derive benefit from intercept as evidence, whilst not unacceptably increasing the risk of disclosure to intelligence agencies and their sensitive capabilities and techniques&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08020693000201">Fourthly, there is the question of legal model to get the recommendations right. The issue is how we both protect intelligence sources and maintain a fair trial. Does the Prime Minister agree with the report specifically that a reinforced system of public interest immunity could enable the evidence to be used in a way that protects the intelligence services, but guarantees a fair trial?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08020693000202">Finally, let me ask about plans for implementation. The report will mean nothing unless it is implemented. I know that the Prime Minister is establishing a cross-party advisory group. Will he guarantee that he will accept our nomination of a Privy Councillor for that group? Does he understand that there will be a nagging suspicion that setting up another committee to look at the implementation of the recommendations will lead to delay? Does he accept that there will never be unanimity in Whitehall on the matter? Another committee will deliberate, reflect and no doubt have different views. That is what committees do. That is what happens in Whitehall. Does he agree that, at the end of the day, it is a political decision and has to be made by a politician&#151;and that means him?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08020693000203">It is clear what needs to be done: intercept in court so that we catch, convict and imprison more terrorists. Does the Prime Minister agree that we must not put off endlessly what needs to be done?</p>

<p><a name="st_o112"><a name="08020693000204"><a name="80206-0004.htm_spmin4"><a name="08020693002285"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>
 I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s general support for what we are doing, and I am grateful for the degree of all-party consensus that has developed. The actions that we are taking with the implementation group are a vehicle not for delay but for getting on with implementation. I agree that we want to achieve legislation as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08020693000205">If the right hon. Gentleman accepts the report&#146;s conclusion, he must also accept that the Chilcot team&#151;including representatives from his party&#151;acknowledge that a considerable amount of work remains to be done. They do not conclude that all the questions have been answered and that all that is lacking is political will. They conclude that what we need to do is look in detail at the legal and technical implications that arise from their wish to see the right balance struck between liberty and security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08020693000206">The report does not say that Australia is the model for how we should move forward. It uses Australia as an example of where it has been possible to have intercept as evidence, but it does not propose that we accept the model that is used in Australia, which is quite different from the public interest immunity proposal that the right hon. Gentleman accepts has been put forward by the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08020693000207">We have always accepted in principle the case for doing this. We have always hoped that clear benefits would be available. The Metropolitan police survey of terrorist cases shows that the rate of prosecution could rise from 88 to 92 per cent. However, the committee also shows that considerable hurdles need to be crossed. It wants the intercepting agencies to have the ability to retain control over whether the material is used in prosecutions. It wants to ensure that disclosure of material cannot be required against the wishes of the agency originating the material, and that agencies cannot be required to transcribe or make notes on material beyond the standard of detail that they deem necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80206-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08020693000208">All those issues will have to be looked at in considering the demands of courts and court cases. I believe that a considerable amount of work still needs to be done. I am glad that we have an all-party agreement to move forward. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman understands that there are technical and legal issues to be resolved.

 I, too, thank the Prime Minister for advance sight of his statement and the report. I pay tribute to Sir John and all his colleagues for having produced what is self-evidently a very thorough and rigorous report on a sensitive and delicate issue. I warmly welcome the fact that they have opened the door to allowing intercept evidence to become admissible in court, even though that door is only ajar and further work needs to be done to make the recommendation a reality. We have long argued that intercept evidence should be admissible in court, in keeping with so many other jurisdictions around the world. That is part of our wider belief that we can and should do more to strengthen our judicial system so that there are more prosecutions in anti-terror cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80206-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08020693000211">May I ask the Prime Minister three specific questions about the mechanics of what happens after the production of the Chilcot report? First, I acknowledge and understand that it is unlikely if not impossible for any further implementation recommendations to be produced during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Bill through the House. However, will he be more specific and commit that the work will at least be complete during this Parliament? Without a timetable, legitimate fears will be provoked that there will just be delay on delay in the crucial implementing phase of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80206-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08020693000212">Secondly, will the Prime Minister clarify exactly what the relationship will be between the implementation group and the advisory group? It is, of course, a good thing that the advisory group will have a cross-party composition, but if it is to have a somewhat passive, observatory role, it will not fulfil the function that many people want it to fulfil: to hold the implementation group&#146;s feet to the fire to ensure that the Chilcot report recommendations are followed up in detail in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80206-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08020693000213">Finally, although I realise that it would be inappropriate to name the individual civil servants in the implementation group, will the Prime Minister at least enumerate which Departments and agencies will be part of it, so that once it reaches conclusions there will be an endorsement, on behalf of all the Government and all the Government agencies, of the group&#146;s implementing recommendations?</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his general welcome for our proposals. At the end he raised issues about the nature of the implementation group; perhaps we can arrange talks on Privy Council terms about how that will move forward. I agree that in principle it is right to do this, and I have always thought that there is a very strong case for doing so if we can find the means. The problem is that although we can draw parallels with other jurisdictions, ours is distinctive&#151;not just because of the adversarial system and the European convention on human rights, but because of the special capabilities that we have in Britain and our co-operation with overseas services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80206-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08020693000215">I hope that the right hon. Gentleman agrees that, as the committee has told us, the position on control orders has not changed. I would like to think that we could have the same degree of consensus on the proposal about questioning and the 42 days. I still believe that the proposal put forward by Liberty which he and the Conservative party supported is a basis for moving forward. In the legislation that we put forward, we have made proposals in line with that. I hope we can have discussions on that in the future.</p>

It did not feel that it could continue with the technical and legal work on its own, and it suggested that we set up an implementation committee. The advisory committee will be there, as its name suggests, to advise as we go through the work.</p>

Does not that complexity add to the argument for greater pre-charge detention time to enable the intercept evidence to be more closely and forensically analysed to secure evidence and thus the security of the UK?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has taken a great interest in this matter. It is important to recognise&#151;it is sometimes misunderstood in debate in the House of Commons&#151;that in principle all parties have said that there is a case for going beyond 28 days&#146; detention; it is just the vehicle by which we go beyond that which is an issue. The Liberal and Conservative parties thought that they could support the proposals put forward by Liberty, which meant that there were circumstances in which we could go beyond 28 days. The issue then, having accepted in principle that it may be necessary to go beyond that limit, is the nature of the mechanism by which that can be agreed. At the moment, the Conservative and Liberal parties cannot agree with the proposal that we have put forward, but I have to tell them that in principle they have already said that they agree that it may be necessary to go beyond the 28-day period.</p>

 I welcome the consensus that has been reached on intercept evidence. I absolutely understand the safeguards that need to be put in place and the comments that the Prime Minister made to my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright). The fact remains that in the 1980s I was a practitioner of intercept in Northern Ireland; this issue has been around for a very long time. May I urge the Prime Minister, please, to make as much speed as possible with this, because the interception and prosecution of terrorists and the deterrence of terrorist crime is so important, as he knows?</p>

 Let us remember that for all these 20 years intercept has been used; it is just that it has mostly not been used in courts of law. The question now is whether we can establish a scheme that will work. We have already agreed that the British system is unique and that the scheme cannot simply be one taken off the shelf from other countries. I believe that all the parties now agree that certain tests have to be met. We are going to proceed speedily and comprehensively to answer those questions. I hope, like the hon.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08020693000254">The United Kingdom is a diverse nation. A snapshot of what it means to be British today would surely provide us with a mosaic reflecting the many cultures, ethnicities and religions that make up our population. Post-war and post-colonial migration flows have enriched our country with more than just numbers of people. Every town, city and region has benefited from Leicester to London, from Wembley to Wigan and from Sunderland to Southall. It is not only the composition of our population that has changed, but the composition of our national identity&#151;our Britishness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08020693000255">The change in our national identity must be reflected in the way we think of ourselves as a country, represent ourselves to others and, most importantly, in the composition of our Parliament. It is that change that must be reflected, and I intend to address it in my Bill. I am delighted to see the Leader of the House of Commons, who is also the Minister for Women and Equality, on the Front Bench because she has championed the cause of equality throughout her long political life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08020693000256">There are currently 15 ethnic minority Members of this House: 13 Labour Members and two Conservatives. As the House knows, the 2001 census reported a 50 per cent. increase in our ethnic population over the last 10 years. The lack of such representation in Parliament is therefore truly disappointing. If Parliament were to reflect adequately the population of ethnic minority citizens, there would be 58 ethnic minority Members of this House. At the current rate at which ethnic minority Members are taking up seats in Parliament, it would take 75 years to achieve a proportion that would reflect the ethnic minority population of our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08020693000257">Since 1987, when I was elected along with the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), Mr. Paul Boateng and the late Bernie Grant, progress has been painfully slow. There were two more ethnic minority Members in 1992, three more in 1997, two more in 2001, four in 2005, and five in by-elections over the last 21 years. It is not that there is a lack of talent, numbers or desire to come to this place, but it is clear that ethnic minorities still face proportionately more hurdles than others in getting elected to this House. This Bill seeks to address the problems of imbalance in representation through the democratic decisions of our political parties, but there is no miracle cure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08020693000258">The race issue does not have to be divisive; race can be used in a positive way to electrify the political process. Striving for the Democratic nomination in the United States, we have a candidate who embodies the multi-ethnic, multicultural and international character of its society: Barack Obama. Born to a Kenyan father and an American mother, and having spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, Senator Obama is a poster boy for the integration and amalgamation that has taken place globally&#151;the mixing of cultures and consequent reforming of identities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000259">The American system is, of course, different from ours. An individual in that country can seek and win their party&#146;s nomination at a local, state, and national level through their force of personality and their ability to secure funding. The party structure cannot stop them. In Britain, that is not possible; we have a strong party system. However, so far that system has delivered just 23 ethnic minority Members of this House in the history of British politics. Those dismal facts speak for themselves. We need to change our attitudes and the law so that a new vision can be made a reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08020693000260">I would invite Members to look at what a change in the law did for the representation of women in Parliament. A few years ago, Parliament legalised all-women shortlists in elections. The result was that for the first time in history, there were more women in the new intake than men&#151;65 per cent. were women. All women-shortlists were described at the time as a &#147;hammer to break the glass ceiling&#148;. That ceiling now needs to be broken for ethnic minorities. The changes in 2002 highlighted how shortlists allow us to take a step ahead on the road to a more equally representative Parliament. Since the election of Nancy Astor as the first female Member of Parliament, 290 women have taken up seats. That is, as I am sure the House will know, not even half of a single parliamentary intake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08020693000261">The Bill proposes to allow for the creation of shortlists on the grounds of ethnicity in the selection of parliamentary candidates. It will be a voluntary, optional means of addressing the imbalance we see today, and it will not oblige or compel parties in any way. Positive action is achieved by exempting the selection of candidates from the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976. Clause 1 will insert a new clause in the 1976 Act, exempting registered political parties from the main provisions of that Act, provided, of course, that that process is adopted for the purpose of reducing inequalities for the different ethnic groups from which individuals are elected. Clause 2 allows for the exact same provisions to be made in Northern Ireland, aside from one difference, namely that it allows for this process to apply to the Northern Ireland Assembly and to district councils, as well as to elections for the Westminster and European Parliaments. Clause 3 is a sunset clause, which provides that the Act will expire in 15 years&#146; time, unless extended by an order of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000262">Some may argue that a problem exists regarding which boundaries and terms can be used to define an &#147;ethnic minority&#148;. I can assure the House that ethnic minorities know exactly who they are, and so do the political parties; they will be well able to identify them. The creation of ethnic minority shortlists will undoubtedly see more ethnic minorities taking up seats in Parliament, which will mean a Parliament that mirrors the society it represents, a Parliament that citizens can identify with and a Parliament that better reflects their needs. It will encourage many more to engage in civic society and afford them a greater sense of belonging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80206-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000263">In the 21st century politics of our country no one must be left out. The Bill will allow parties to be more creative in the way that they choose parliamentary candidates, while remaining an optional, not compulsory, measure. The Conservative party already has a fast-track system, called the A-list, which, only two weeks&#146; ago, produced a black woman as a successor to the right   <br>

 I do not wish to detain the House unduly, but I must oppose the Bill. I am a member of a fine organisation called the Campaign against Political Correctness. In my maiden speech, I made it clear that, in my time in Parliament, one of my aims was to try to speak out as often as possible against the scourge of political correctness, which is taking over too much of our country.</p>

Since 1992, the single market has created more than 2.75 million extra jobs, led to a more than sixfold rise in foreign direct investment and increased trade by 30 per cent. By 2006, the single market had boosted GDP by an average of &#163;360 for every person in the European Union. Eliminating border bureaucracy, for example, has slashed delivery times, reduced costs and opened hundreds of new export markets to British businesses both large and small.</p>

British citizens&#151;all our constituents&#151;benefit from both a greater choice of higher quality goods and services at lower prices and stronger protections to guarantee their consumer rights throughout the European Union. Every year, EU investment helps to create and protect UK jobs and generates trade. Those who recognise the best interests of the British people have long realised that expanding the single market can be made possible only within a clear legal framework that establishes a new set of rules.</p>

she knew that none of those matters could be carried through unless we all moved together? Is it not also true that qualified majority voting gives greater power to individual nations than the veto, because everyone else knows that they could be steamrollered if they do not join a common enterprise together?</p>

 This is a strange debate, but I agree with everything that the right hon. Gentleman has just said. My regret is that his views are not more widely held on the Opposition Benches, because if they were the United Kingdom would have a better prospect of securing more of the deals in the European Union to which he has referred. It is important that we learn the lessons of history. He was involved in a lot of the debates and discussions at that time. I pay tribute to him and to the work that Lady Thatcher did to pave the way towards progress in the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80206-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000303">Since the Single European Act, which introduced qualified majority voting to the single market in 1987 and to which the right hon. Gentleman rightly referred, the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties have extended qualified majority voting into new areas, helping, not hindering, the process of economic reform in Europe. Those treaties have all adapted and strengthened both EU institutions and the policies that support enlargement and extend the single market. It is now again clear that we cannot rely on structures designed for the EU 15 to help us fully reap the economic and political benefits that we believe an enlarged Europe of 27 member states offers. That is why we must ratify the Lisbon treaty.</p>

As there is still work to be done in opening up European markets to effective competition, we should concentrate on doing just that ourselves. It is for those reasons that I absolutely reject the view of those on the Opposition Front Bench that our response should be another period of introspection and constitutional navel gazing. That is the last thing that we should be doing, but it is exactly what their policy towards the treaty of Lisbon would inevitably involve. That approach would not create jobs, growth or prosperity, just years of fog and an inability to drive Europe forward. There is no benefit there for UK businesses, workers or citizens, just more time and taxpayers&#146; money spent on debates that are already long past their sell-by date.</p>

 I do agree with that.

It is probably true that the majority of the laws established to drive forward the single market have originated from the European Union. The hon.

We have important safeguards on language issues&#151;I shall come on to them in a few moments&#151;and requirements for multiple language translations of patents, but there is no doubt that this is one important area where progress needs to be made. We will not make that progress without qualified majority voting. I am afraid that it is as simple as that.

 I am making a point about the virtue of qualified majority voting, whereas the right hon. Gentleman is talking about the regulatory burden on business&#151;a genuinely important issue. I believe that there are some cases of over-regulation in some sectors in the EU, but the right hon. Gentleman will know that we have been taking the lead in the debate in Europe about a totally different approach towards regulation, which emphasises the costs and the burdens on business in Europe. Impact assessments have now become standard practice in the EU, people have to justify a proposal for regulation and the benefits have to outweigh the costs that inevitably arise once it has been decided to regulate.</p>

There is no way of pretending otherwise, but the European Union and the Commission have targets to reduce the burden of regulation, which is a welcome first step. I think that significant progress remains to be made, but in a sense the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is not germane to my point about the benefits of qualified majority voting.

With much of the legislation required to establish the single market already in place, the new protocol ensures that proactive competition will remain the major focus and driver of single market policy in the 21st century. The protocol states and confirms, as did the treaty of Rome, that establishing an internal market is a key objective of the European Union and that ensuring free and fair competition across the continent is essential to doing so. The protocol is legally binding and an integral part of the Lisbon treaty. As the treaty itself states:</p>

Everyone in the House should therefore be clear that removing barriers to competition in the internal market will remain a fundamental part of the EU&#146;s task once the treaty of Lisbon has been ratified.</p>

 The Secretary of State has been very generous in giving way. While the provision has been placed in a protocol, where it will have such legal force as comes from being in a protocol, free and undistorted competition has been removed from the objectives of the Union and relegated to a protocol. Will he explain why that happened, and how the Government allowed it to happen?</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has studied carefully the consolidated text of the treaty, and he needs to look at article 51, in which the position is made absolutely clear: the protocol has exactly the same legal effect as any other part of the Lisbon treaty. There is absolutely no basis of fact or law in his assertion that somehow including the provision in a protocol in any way involves a relegation of the issue governed by the protocol. If he has any doubt about that, he should look again at the treaty. He will also probably want to look at the provisions of the Vienna convention, as I have done in preparation for the debate, in relation to how international treaties are to be interpreted. He will find a clear exposition of the international law of treaties and how questions of interpretation in relation to preambles, annexes and protocols are approached. The rebuttal to the Opposition motion can be found in all those sources. The Opposition have misunderstood the legal basis of the protocol. That flushes out one of the most unpleasant aspects of the debate, which is the feverish hatred of all things European that permeates those on the Opposition Benches&#151;and has come principally from those on their Front Bench&#151;with some noble exceptions, although only one of them is on the Opposition Benches today.</p>

The protocol will help us to achieve our priorities for the single market in the next decade. As Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said recently:</p>

Friends have also referred to them. They all offer the prospect of further improvements to the single market, and can therefore be seen as having a beneficial, pro-reform, pro-enterprise effect on the single market. Amendments to article 47 introduced qualified majority voting on legislation to remove barriers to self-employed professionals working in other member states of the Union. The free movement of people is one of the four key foundations on which the single market rests. That further advances that fundamental principle, and will be of particular benefit to professionally qualified people.</p>

 Preventing countries from competing unfairly by allowing their workers to be exploited is a key element in the free movement of labour. The minimum social provisions are important in that respect. Today, on the 90th anniversary of the introduction of women&#146;s suffrage, does the Secretary of State agree that any step that threatened the treaty and led possibly to opt-outs from the social chapter would be extraordinarily retrograde and would prevent attempts to provide harmony and free competition within the market?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. We have stood up consistently, along with others in the House, for a proper balance in the competitiveness agenda. A strong social dimension to Europe now and in the future is important. One of the best things that we did when we came into government was to sign the social chapter, as it demonstrated a clear commitment to developing that part of the European project.

 We certainly do not oppose the principle of equal treatment, as we have repeatedly made clear over a long period. The text of the directive was not acceptable to the United Kingdom and other countries in the Council, which is why it was not possible to reach agreement on 5 December. The UK Government remain committed to trying to find an acceptable text on which we can agree, and which addresses our concerns about flexibility, which is crucial for the UK to secure and develop. Our labour markets are widely respected as flexible and for providing proper protection for workers. I do not want to compromise on any of those issues.</p>

The Community trade mark and design schemes have already proved highly popular with UK businesses, helping them to expand and safeguard their ideas in new EU markets. New article 97a establishes a legal base for the EU to agree measures to create European intellectual property rights and to provide uniform protection of IPR throughout the EU.

The new text gives more scope for the Community to negotiate and conclude wide-ranging trade and investment agreements of major benefit to member states with third countries. For example, the EU is currently engaged in trade and investment negotiations with countries such as India and Korea. Ambitious investment agreements would increase access to their markets for UK companies, creating new jobs and increasing trade.

It should be possible for Members throughout the House to agree on one thing, the absolute priority of strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy. That was made clear in the European Commission&#146;s fundamental review of the single market, published last year. The review reflected many of the policies and reforms for which we have been negotiating, including a new, flexible approach to single market policy to promote competition fully, reduce the burden of regulation, and encourage innovation. It focused on key priorities from which businesses and citizens can benefit together, such as further liberalisation of the energy and telecoms markets, the use of competition policy tools to reduce barriers for businesses, and allowing consumers to benefit from more choice and lower prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80206-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08020693000367">The Commission has already introduced a system to monitor the market and ensure its competitiveness, enabling the EU to crack down on markets where there are still significant barriers to competition. Full liberalisation of European network industries in particular, such as energy, telecoms, post and transport, could bring an extra &#163;52 billion to &#163;66 billion to the EU economy, create between 140,000 and 360,000 jobs, and reduce  <br>

prices significantly. Progressive liberalisation in the telecoms sector throughout the 1990s has already led to cheaper prices and more choice for EU consumers. Prices for national and international calls in the EU fell by an average of more than 40 per cent. between 2000 and 2006. I believe that it is time to build on that success, and to deliver even greater price savings and choice to business and consumers.</p>

Services account for 70 per cent. of EU gross domestic product, but for only 20 per cent. of intra-EU cross-border trade. The agreement of a wide-ranging EU services directive was a major step forward in tackling that covert form of protectionism. Full implementation of the directive will make it easier for service providers to set up and deliver services in other member states, increasing access to new markets and consumer choice. It could be worth between &#163;4 billion and &#163;6 billion per year, and could bring about 80,000 new jobs to the UK economy.</p>

The choice Opposition Members face is either to do what is in the long-term interests of the British people and economy&#151;actively to engage in Europe to open up new markets and opportunities&#151;or to let their dogmatic dislike of all things European marginalise Britain in Europe, putting at direct risk the benefits of the single market and our economic future.</p>

Britain&#146;s vital interest lay. As with the budget negotiation, however, faced with defeat at the negotiating table, instead of digging in and using the veto&#151;which is there precisely to defend our national interest&#151;they rolled over. So now Government policy is to argue that black is white&#151;that the changes they sought to make in the constitutional convention are unnecessary and that the dangers they warned of are non-existent.

 On the contrary, the right hon. Lady is simply wrong. Yes, the protocol has the same legal status as the body of the treaty&#151;I accept that without dispute&#151;but I shall show in a few moments how the European Court of Justice interprets European treaties when it makes decisions, and the trap that we are walking into by relegating this measure from the body of the treaty to the protocol. I shall quote to her what those who have pressed for this change have said. They have not pressed for the removal of these provisions from the body of the treaty to a protocol as a cosmetic change; they have pressed for their removal as a substantive change to the body of European Union law.</p>

First, they resolved to deny the referendum that they had promised the British people, because it would have exposed the gap between the rulers and the ruled. They then created a smokescreen of red lines and emergency brakes, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) has brilliantly demonstrated is a meaningless charade of flannel and smoke that offers no durable protection. We have heard yet more flannel and smoke from the Secretary of State today. I suppose we should be grateful that he remembered to bring his flannel and smoke with him to the Chamber this week; we should be grateful for something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80206-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08020693000407">Depending on which authority we follow, we know that the treaties are between 90 and 98 per cent. identical to the aborted constitution. It is ironic that one of the few changes made between the draft constitution and these treaties is the relegation of the concept of unfettered competition in the single market from the heart of the structure to the periphery. Instead of making a stand for the principles of economic liberalism, which he repeatedly claims to espouse, the Prime Minister slunk off to Lisbon, almost literally in the dead of night, and looking every inch like a man engaged in a furtive and shameful little mission, to sign the treaty and sell out the interests not only of Britain, but of millions of Europeans whose prosperity will now be put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80206-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08020693000408">Let me explain why people&#146;s prosperity will be put at risk. In 1957 a genuine single European market, on its own, would have ensured Europe&#146;s prosperity&#151;but this is 2008, not 1957. At the beginning of the 21st century the single market, which after 50 years of progress remains far from complete, can only be part of a much larger global picture. We now have to look outwards and further afield. Our need is for a single, open, free, lightly-regulated and competitive market in Europe, not only for its own sake but to act as a base from which European businesses can compete effectively as part of an open world trading system. If we are to prosper, not only in our home market but in the wider world market, the EU single market must be open by virtue of the absence of barriers to competition, not by virtue of a heavy-handed structure of managed and regulated competition. Conservative Members are not prepared to see Britain&#146;s prosperity being dragged down into the quicksand of over-regulation and economic nationalism. Our future lies in engaging with, not resiling from, globalisation.</p>

The change of direction represented by the symbolic relegation of the endorsement of undistorted competition from the opening articles of the treaty to a protocol at the back does matter, and those who fought for it know that. It matters because if Europe is to prosper, much work remains to be done on the completion of a single, open and competitive market; it matters because of the political signal sent and received about the future direction of EU economic policy and its subordination to social policy; and it matters because of the legal significance of the treaties in the EU&#146;s system of jurisprudence and, in turn, the impact on how our own courts interpret the law.</p>

Never was the need for the concept of competitive markets to be at the heart of the European Union greater than it is now, when it is being relegated to the margins. What the EU needs right now is a strengthening, not a weakening, of its focus on competition at the heart of everything it does.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he is strongly in favour of a high degree of competition. The Secretary of State explained to him that the treaty brings the development of the single market, the furthering of competition and the effective working of the single market into the treaty. The hon. Gentleman remains committed to abrogating that treaty in all circumstances. How does he then propose to develop that market in practice, rather than in purely rhetorical terms?</p>

 We have heard from the hon. Gentleman and from the Secretary of State what the Government think. They can argue until they are blue in the face that all of this is of no great significance, but that view is not widely shared, especially by those who have fought long and hard to downgrade the competition provisions. They believe that they have won a great political victory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80206-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08020693000439">For example, President Sarkozy, magnanimous as ever in victory, has said:</p>
<a name="80206-0010.htm_brev7"><a name="08020693002071"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;competition is now just a means, not an end in itself. This opens the way to a different jurisprudence, one that favours European champions and brings a true industrial policy&#148;.</p>

The internal market becomes a shared competence, which under a new definition means that member states will not be able to legislate at all in a space where the EU has legislated. They will be unable to legislate in a way that conflicts with the EU, and that would include legislation to address matters of temporary national interest, or to supplement EU law. Britain&#146;s veto over regulations on the establishment of self-employed professionals is scrapped. The European Parliament gains vetoes over liberalisation of services and capital movements. International trade becomes an exclusive competence of the EU as far as it is defined by treaty provisions. In all those areas the UK Government fought to hold the line or secure exceptions. In every area they lost the battle, and now they seek to argue that nothing has changed.</p>

It is possibly the understatement of the decade to say that it is by no means obvious that they will use them to promote free competition. I, for one, suspect that President Sarkozy&#146;s vision of an industrial policy of &#147;picking champions&#148; will have an irresistible appeal in Brussels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80206-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08020693000443">What is clear is that at the end of the process a strong political signal has been delivered and the EU&#146;s approach to the development of the single market will change. It will be more interventionist, less focused on free and open competition and more focused on picking winners, imposing strategies and enforcing other EU social objectives through the regulation and manipulation of the marketplace. Only a rejection of this treaty by the British people in a referendum can now reverse that momentum.</p>

The Secretary of State said that there were none, and that nothing would change. But there are serious concerns that the changes to the treaty will undermine the political and constitutional support for anti-trust action by the EU and will inevitably have an impact on the ECJ&#146;s interpretation of EU law. It is true that the protocol has the same legal force as the treaty itself, but the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties emphasises the importance of objective and purpose as a guide to the interpretation of treaties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80206-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08020693000445">The ECJ has developed a &#147;purposive interpretation&#148; tradition to deal with conflicts. In other words, it considers the objectives and purposes of the Union in deciding which of the conflicting arguments should be given greater weight. In relation to how the Court conducts itself, it is a simple matter of fact that no mere protocol can achieve the same interpretative status as an article of principle or an objective in the treaty itself.</p>

Now one of those objectives will be removed from the opening articles of the treaty and put in a protocol on page 199.

 A protocol does have the same legal status as the rest of the treaty.

I do not believe that the Secretary of State, who I believe is a lawyer by training, finds that concept as difficult as he is making out. Time will tell. We will see how the ECJ interprets decisions in the future in the light of the changes in the treaty. I hope that the Secretary of State will have the good grace, in due course, to come back to the House and accept that there was rather more to the changes in the treaty than the cosmetic effects that he has sought to set out today. </p>

There is a concern that the ECJ may find it difficult even to maintain the current position on state aid set out in existing case law, because it is all built on article 3, paragraph 1(g), of the treaty as it stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80206-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08020693000453">That was clearly in Sarkozy&#146;s mind when he said that the final form of the treaty</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08020693000466">In a recent ECJ decision, now followed up by the European Commission, the neo-liberals who hold powerful positions on the Court and the Commission decided to open everything to do with health care up to internal market forces. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to the Watts case in 2006, which the British Government lost in the ECJ. The Court found that a patient from this country was entitled to be treated in another European country and that the NHS was obliged to pay the Bill. The patient was not in despair after a protracted wait for treatment in the UK. The patient&#146;s daughter was pushing the primary care trust to provide the European care before the GP had even referred the patient to a consultant.

That directive, as drafted&#151;before it was withdrawn&#151;would have meant that the British Government would have no say whatever in setting any limits on the provision. People would be entitled to get treatment in Europe. They would be given a voucher or, after they were treated, what they spent could be repaid. They would also be able to top up any costs with their own money.

I want to try to look after the least well off and the least well informed, but the decision of the Court and the proposal from the Commission will clearly give a leg-up to the well off and the well informed, disadvantaging everyone else. The well off will be able to afford to pay in advance and wait to be reimbursed. They will be able to afford to make a top-up payment if they need to, and to meet the cost of travel. Badly off people will not be able to do any of those things. The well off are also likely to be well informed and to know how to work the system.</p>

I should warn the House that I think that there are very powerful forces at work behind the proposition, and they are in this country now. Those forces are the US health corporations that are having such a bad time in their own country. They have made such a gratuitous mess of the health care system there that even the most right-wing Republican presidential candidates are calling for wholesale, root-and-branch changes. They want to ensure that every American is covered and to prevent costs from escalating even above the present level which, roughly speaking, is twice as much per head of population as anywhere else in the developed world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000470">However, the mess in the US is so great that the companies to which I have referred are roaming around Europe and Britain looking for markets.

I shall therefore find it very difficult to vote for the treaty&#146;s ratification unless the Government make some concession to that effect.</p>

 I had assumed that there would be quite a high degree of consensus on this part of the treaty debate. After all, as the Conservative spokesman conceded in his peroration, we are talking about the single area that almost everyone accepts represents an achievement on the part of the EU. Equally, the six provisions in the treaty relating specifically to economic matters are not especially controversial. They do not apply to the euro and, weak though they are, they are broadly helpful to the UK where they apply to intellectual property rights and self-employment. The other major provision relates to social security and is governed by veto, so the economic clauses do not contain an enormous amount to get worked up about.</p>

It is the EU&#146;s greatest success, and it underpins the rise in living standards that we all enjoy. The common market, followed by the single market, has attracted and sustained the membership of countries from southern and eastern Europe, permanently liberating the first group from fascism and the second from communism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000477">Those are major achievements, and we should underline the major contribution that the single European market makes to the UK economy. We often take it for granted, but roughly 63 or 65 per cent. of British visible exports now go to the EU, compared with 43 or 45 per cent. in the mid-1970s. The EU market represents some 40 per cent. of total world trade, so it is an enormous entity into which we are fully integrated. Britain has benefited disproportionately from the very large amount of inward investment in the single market that has taken advantage of its unified characteristics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08020693000483">It is worth recalling what the then Prime Minister said, as in no sense was she naive about the implications of the single market. In her diary, she wrote:</p>

That can often be very irritating and produce slightly absurd consequences, but it has to happen.

 The right hon. Gentleman is correct. In my earlier professional career, I tried to help establish common markets in Latin America and Africa. All of them failed because they lacked strong institutional underpinning. The European Union is the one that has succeeded. Of course, that underpinning does not have to be rigid; one of the major innovations that is not referred to in the treaty, but which has become part of Commission practice, is what is called mutual recognition&#151;recognition that we are gradually deepening the single market through mutual acceptance of other countries&#146; rules. That is why there is now mutual recognition of professional qualifications, for example. That does not have to take the form of blanket harmonisation. Those moves are progress.</p>

Of course we can all criticise what the Government are doing, and the press will do so, but the one institutional constraint on the Government&#146;s aid to the bank is the European Union. That is what is binding the Chancellor of the Exchequer; he is totally constrained by the EU. Those are some of the many practical ways in which the single market benefits us.</p>

 Or Liberal Democrat, for that matter. Yes, there almost certainly would be greater restraint, but I think that we all accept that that is not the debate that we are having now.

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08020693000500">Of course there are concerns about the single market. First, many UK businesses worry that their liberalisation is not reciprocated. A few days ago I was at Royal Mail&#146;s south-west London sorting office&#151;a very efficient installation. When I looked out of the window, I saw the headquarters of TNT, a Dutch competitor. The general manager said, &#147;I&#146;m all for liberalising the Royal Mail market, but why can&#146;t the Germans, the Dutch and the French do the same?&#148; and he is quite right. The logic is that prising open the other European markets will require stronger, not weaker, intervention by the Commission and the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80206-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08020693000501">Precisely the same point can be made about areas in which there is frustration about the slowness of the single market&#146;s progress&#151;a point to which the Conservative spokesman referred. The obvious example is services. It has taken years to get any kind of agreement on services in Europe. The agreement that we reached in 2006 is fairly weak; it does not respect the underlying principle of the origin of the country concerned, which is what would really open up a services market, which does exist. Clearly, for services liberalisation to progress faster, there would have to be more qualified majority voting and more European Union decision making on the matter.</p>

The Secretary of State was right to point out that there is now a process&#151;the Lamfalussy process&#151;for making the system much more efficient. The question that I would pose to the right hon.

As I understand it, the measures will make it easier to have common European Union rules on copyright, trademarks and patents, which will make it easier to do business that involves them, and that will be good for British intellectual property right holders. However, as the Secretary of State conceded, when it comes to patents, the tricky issue of language has not been resolved. We will still not have unanimity, and that is a source of frustration. As the author of the Cable Bill&#151;that famous copyright protection legislation&#151;I look forward to seeing copyright protected across the whole of Europe, in a way that accords with the sanctions that I introduced in the House.

He was right to say that the Liberal Democrats were sympathetic to the Watts ruling. The question that we would ask is this: if it is right for people to buy a house, travel or exchange goods in Europe, what is wrong with their trying to pursue a higher life expectancy in countries that have better cancer treatment? Surely common sense would say that that is a reasonable expectation in an integrated market. People will do that, and as long as the basic frameworks of the NHS remain intact, I do not see anything fundamentally wrong with enlarging the concept of a single market to include health.</p>

We should not be too pious on the matter, but the hon. Gentleman is right that there was a retreat from a commitment in the treaty to an undistorted internal market.</p>

Neelie Kroes, the Dutch Liberal who presides over competition policy, has spelled out clearly where we currently stand. The protocol on the internal market and competition which was agreed at the European Council clearly repeats that competition policy is fundamental to the internal market. It retains the competition rules that have served us for 50 years, and reaffirms the European Commission&#146;s duties as the independent Commission enforcement authority for Europe.

We are not uncritical. There are areas where we have fundamental disagreements. We have been critical of agricultural policy, particularly its protectionist features. We have been critical of the European budget and voted against it a few weeks ago. We believe that there should be more subsidiarity, including in areas of social policy, which should not be prescriptively applied at a European level. None the less, the fundamentals of the European project are sound, they are reflected in the treaty, and that is why we support it.</p>

 The single market is central to the European Union. We know that in the 1950s the forerunner of the European Union grew out of the agreements between France and Germany for the benefit of their coal and steel industries. Fast-forwarding to the early 1990s, we eagerly anticipated the advent of the single market, with its principles of the free movement of people, goods, capital and services. Inevitably, that cannot be achieved Harry Potter-style by the wave of a magic wand on a single date. It is a process of slow evolution, and the treaty that we are debating today is one further step in that process of evolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08020693000515">I remind the House how much we depend on the single market&#151;3.2 million UK jobs are dependent on exports to the rest of the EU, and some &#163;550 million-worth of goods and services are exported every day to other EU countries. Some 63 per cent. of our exported goods go to other EU countries. Without the customs union that the EU single market provides, those markets would be much more difficult to access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08020693000516">The creation of the single market has cut companies&#146; overheads and much of the red tape, especially if one compares the difficulties of exporting to non-EU markets. It also ensures that EU countries recognise one another&#146;s product standards. That means that UK manufacturers can save on the considerable costs involved in retesting and modifying products to meet specific standards required in non-EU countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000517">One would expect more services to be marketed to people in their home countries; nevertheless, some 40 per cent of services exported by the UK go to the rest of the EU. A large amount of foreign investment from other EU countries also comes into the UK. The EU provides a better deal for consumers&#151;we have lower prices and less red tape, we have full consumer rights when we go shopping in another EU country, and we have fairer competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000518">Of course things are not always right, and there will always be details that we want to work on further. For example, we know that work is being done on roaming charges for mobile phones. We know, too, about the energy market in which there has been some liberalisation but where some aspects are still not right. One domestic problem that we have is the tremendous disparity between what a poorer household pays for electricity and what a richer household pays, based on the difference between payment for electricity on a meter and payment by direct debit. There will always be problems that we need to put right, but the structures are in place to allow a pan-European approach to resolving them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08020693000519">We hear a good deal about migration. We hear about the thousands of EU migrant workers who have come to the UK and who make a valuable contribution to our economy, but we often forget about the 1.6 million Britons who are living in other parts of the EU. They go there for various reasons&#151;for work opportunities, to travel and broaden the mind, because of family ties, or simply because they enjoy the climate. The main countries that they like to go to are France and Spain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08020693000520">We may have an image of such people being rather privileged&#151;possibly top company executives&#151;but travelling back by boat from northern Spain on a stormy Christmas eve one year, I met numerous people who were working in Spain and coming home for Christmas. What were they doing out there? They were plumbers, painters, builders and all manner of small business people who were making a good living in another EU country. They were immensely helped by the single market in so many aspects of their working lives. Even though they encountered Spanish bureaucracy, which is a law unto itself, they were grateful for the many issues that they were able to sort out much more easily because of the single market. All together, we make 51 million journeys to other EU countries, and 21 million visitors come to the UK. Tourism is an immense source of income for us.</p>

Without legislation from Brussels, we would have to legislate about the same issues in this place, so it is a help to us and it can even out the differences and the competitive disadvantages between EU countries. We have the right to 20 days&#146; annual leave. Our pensioners can claim their pensions in mainland Europe. We have minimum standards of paternity and maternity leave, and equal pay and protection against discrimination in the workplace. All those important advances have been brought to us through the single market and EU structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08020693000522">Objective 1 status has been a tremendous help to us in Wales. It represents the principle of resourcing less advantaged areas that are often disadvantaged precisely because of their geographical location on the periphery of the EU, as opposed to the motor regions of France, Germany, northern Spain, northern Italy and the southern part of the UK, which are nearer the centre. Objective 1 money has provided immense benefits to Wales. For example, more than &#163;3.2 billion of investment has been made in west Wales and the valleys in all sorts of projects, such as the techniums, which attract and nurture small businesses and provide opportunities for local people to develop their own businesses or attract investment from outside. In Llanelli the extraordinary task of clearing away a huge coastal area of derelict industrial ground, cleaning and restoring it and preparing it for new state-of-the-art factories has been possible with the use of EU funds.</p>

 We have to be very careful about being curmudgeonly about the European Union. The truth is that we are all immensely better off because we are a member of it, and the single market is the key part of that. No single market works unless justiciable responsibility is accepted; there has to be a court that makes decisions. Sometimes we do not like its decisions and sometimes we do, but the court is part of what is necessary if the thing is to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08020693000528">We have to recognise that the European Union has changed other countries significantly more than it has Britain.

That means that I know about the enormous changes that have taken place in France because of its membership of the European Union and because of the single market.</p>

One of the reasons for that is, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) has said, that Governments of both parties have talked about &#147;going to Europe&#148;&#151;as if it is somewhere else and we are not in it&#151;and discuss it as if they always had to go there for a battle. The truth is that we go there to sit round a table and make decisions together. Historically, we could either not make such decisions or had to fight to make them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08020693000530">We should be much more willing to be enthusiastic about the successes of the European Union so that we can improve it. I say to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench that they would be more credible if they showed enthusiasm for the good things and then went on to say that they would like to improve the European Union. I would like to improve it a good deal. I have to say to the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) that I do not understand his argument at all. If we exclude people from making choices in the European Union about the bits of his choosing, we will only open the gates to the protectionism of, say, the French&#151;and exclude other things. The deal is for all of us, and all of us have to accept it.</p>

 The existing treaty and new treaty provide that there should not be a European Court of Justice intervention to overrule the protection for health care systems in respect of considerations of the internal market.

 I think I should go on. I say to my hon. Friends in particular that their arguments sometimes compare the European Union with perfection, as if there were a perfect alternative. I merely suggest that although the European Union is not perfect, the alternative is very much worse. A comment was made about having 27 different sets of regulations rather than one, and that was perfectly reasonable, particularly as we are largely at fault because we have gold-plated almost every EU regulation. The recent arguments about what might have happened with Northern Rock show that the very issues raised were issues gold-plated by this Government, not by the EU itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08020693000535">My experience of environmental issues suggests that the single market has benefited us considerably and that many of our most important decisions would not have been made without the pressures of the EU. If anyone really thinks that we would have had a proper water system in this country if we had not signed up to the water directive, they do not know the history. People can certainly not argue that we could have a clean air or clean water policy, within which the single market has to operate, if there were no EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08020693000536">We have to be a bit serious about the effect of the changes. I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who referred to the symbolic concession made by the British Government. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) explained what he said experts thought of the matter, but his quotation was not from experts, but from Mr. Sarkozy. That is like explaining the Iraq war by quoting Mr. Blair&#151;we are not talking about an expert, but about someone who is parti pris. I want to look at independent sources. Mr. Sarkozy was putting forward his case, as politicians do. I would much prefer to listen to the Law Society, which clearly tells me that the change does not water anything down. It is symbolic; I think it a pity that it was made and that the Government did not argue well enough, but the fact is that fundamentally there is no change and nobody should be worried about the treaty as far as a single market is concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08020693000537">We should recognise that if we want to change and improve the single market, that will mean Britain agreeing to do things together with others so that together we can create a more effective market. Instead of complaining about that, we ought to be out there explaining why it is worth while. It is better for my constituents that they can travel and know that there are the same standards of health and hygiene throughout the European Union. It is better for business men in my constituency to know that they can trade in the EU and that the standards are the same. Above all, it is because the EU is the world&#146;s largest single market that it can get the terms of trade that we need in the world, and that is so important to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80206-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08020693000538">Having been president of the Agricultural Council, I have negotiated on the international trade in agricultural products. I can tell the House that the agreements were made between Europe and the United States. The other countries made speeches, but the decisions were made between the world&#146;s two biggest trading units. Anybody who undermines Britain&#146;s membership of the EU undermines our ability to play a proper part in the international trading arrangements on which we, of all nations in the world, depend most. </p>

 The one advantage that I have over my hon. Friend is that I am in business, have been in business and continue to be in business. He says that the GDPs of member states are plummeting; I say to him that outside the EU they would reduce significantly more. Any business man will tell him that. My hon.

Let us make a so-called free arrangement, with none of the systems that enable us to make such decisions. I direct him to <i> The Wall Street Journal</i>, a newspaper that I read every morning.

No one could be a stronger supporter of competition than I, but I do not want competition that means that the Bangladeshis do not get proper payment for their work. I do not want unsafe factories to undermine British businesses. Competition must exist within a sensibly regulated market. That is what we have always believed.

He seemed to want a kind of pre-mercantile anarchic capitalism, if there is such a thing. I know that some members of the Conservative party want a customs union, and some of them might want a common market. I have to say to them, however, that none of those things is on offer. When the Conservatives talk to British business and British work people about what is on offer, there is no point in talking about pre-mercantilism, anarchic capitalism or customs unions, because they do not apply.</p>

The Conservative party&#151;although not all Conservative party members&#151;are now pretty much isolated in the whole of Europe. Apparently, it has only one ally, which is some right-wing fringe party in the Czech Republic.

 If the hon. Gentleman is accurate, it is one of the coalition parties in the Government, and it is considered to be a relatively fringe party.

 Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that intervention, may I say that although we have a time limit of eight minutes on Back-Bench speeches, an awful lot of Members are still trying to catch my eye and it would be helpful if any hon. Members feel that they can take less than their allotted time.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. This hon. Member will feel able to take less than his allotted time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08020693000557">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick). The tragedy for the Conservative party&#146;s relationship with British business is that British business knows that the party is off the rails but does not know where or how it is off the rails. The Conservative party cannot face up to the realities of modern-day participation in Europe, as British business has to. British business and the people who work for it have to face up to the realities. Would Nissan in Sunderland, or Sanofi Aventis or Nestl&#233; in my constituency in Newcastle, have any trust in a Conservative Government with such an unclear and, where it is clear, negative policy towards Europe? When there are issues that matter to them&#151;in Nestl&#233;&#146;s case, the sugar agreement negotiated by the European Union&#151;they want to know that the British Government can sit down cogently with other Governments and other parties throughout Europe to find a negotiated solution that is sensible for Europe and sensible for British interests? If companies such as those were considering investing in Britain, before doing so they would think about it very seriously were there a Conservative Government with a policy as unclear and as negative as that of the current Conservative Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000558">All those things are very damaging, not only for the Conservative party but for British industry. One thinks back to the days of Macmillan and Heath. In Heath&#146;s time, I used to attack the Conservative party for being too close to British business. It is miles away from British business now, with no comprehension of what is entailed in trying to build a product, trade within Europe and seek investment from Europe.</p>

In the long term, were I speaking on behalf of British business generally&#151;I am speaking only on behalf of businesses in my constituency&#151;I would worry that a major political party in Britain has such a low commitment to the European Union that it puts at risk all the benefits that were mentioned by the right hon.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson). I do not agree with everything he said, but he is extremely well informed about this subject. It is also a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), with whom I am in complete agreement on these matters. It has been a strange debate because, as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North illustrated and implied, we have had a general debate about the single market and its history, rather than line-by-line consideration of the changes that the Bill makes, which is what we were promised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000564">There is another reason why this debate has been strange. Perhaps we should rename it the Lady Thatcher debate, because her achievements in introducing the Single European Act and the single market have been lauded throughout the House. There is now a consensus. Thinking back, I cannot remember Lady Thatcher being decked with garlands of praise by the then Opposition. Labour and Liberal Democrat Members might be provocative in the debate, but I have quotes of what they said at the time. I will not use them because I do not want to disturb&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Go on!&#148;] A good pr&#233;cis would be that she got it all wrong and that Britain was isolated in Europe. Suffice it to say that I would rather have Mrs. Thatcher negotiating for me on the rebate when she is isolated, than certain other leaders with plenty of allies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000565">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) is right when he says that the single market has been at the heart of public perception of the European Union in the UK. As he rightly reminded us, that goes back to the referendum of 1975, when being part of the trade bloc was the first of the three main reasons that the Government of the day gave for saying yes. The other two reasons were a guarantee of secure supplies of food and getting more European Community money spent in Britain. In view of the subsequent history of the common agricultural policy&#151;about the only European matter with which the Liberal Democrats would now disagree&#151;and the tangled history of the UK contribution to the budget, perhaps it is best to draw a veil over both those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08020693000566">To the credit of the Government of 1975&#151;a Government who had some impressive and significant figures, and some very good parliamentarians&#151;they were clearly worried about the impact of the European Union on this House. A large section of the explanatory document that they issued was entitled, &#147;Will Parliament lose its power?&#148; The electorate of the day were told:</p>

 All right, very briefly.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty in glowing terms, but did not those treaties bring about the two greatest&#151;by a massive margin&#151;extensions of qualified majority voting?</p>

 It would have been better if the hon. Gentleman had waited until the end of my speech. I shall give way to him once he has heard my whole argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08020693000574">We now see a consensus on the Single European Act. That Act did indeed establish qualified majority voting to complete the market, but the problem is&#151;and it is also a problem for the hon. Gentleman&#151;that it did not stop there, as far as the European Union was concerned. We now see, particularly in this treaty, an extension of qualified majority voting into fields far beyond the single market. I asked the Secretary of State what proportion of our law came from the EU, and he did not know. I am not sure that he would know how much of our law is determined by qualified majority voting either. The ink was barely dry on the Single European Act when the process began that led to the treaty of Maastricht, to which the hon. Gentleman also alluded, and the Conservative Government of the day, very much to their credit, negotiated to put in place the safeguard of a pillar structure. The ink was barely dry on the treaty when the European institutions moved to new ground and set about collapsing the pillars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08020693000575">We moved on&#151;this is the real answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon)&#151;to the European area of justice, freedom and security, more developments in the common European foreign and security policy, and developments that we were told might lead to common European defence. We then came to the long list of policy areas that the treaty contains. The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) gave a good example. He complained that the health service would not be the sole responsibility of the House and was worried about the influence of US health corporations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08020693000576">Whatever our view of the Single European Act, we must ask whether it was the genuine aim of the European Union or simply a tool to accomplish other, different objectives. That is a live debate in Europe&#151;perhaps it should be heard more in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08020693000577">The outcome of the negotiations on the treaty provided one answer to that debate. After the French no, the Government experienced the humiliation of &#147;competition... free and undistorted&#148; being removed from the list of the objectives at the beginning and put into the protocol at the back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08020693000578">The Government are trying to get round that political humiliation with an argument based on legal technicalities about the effect of law in the protocols and law in the body of treaty. The objective was moved expressly and deliberately through the intervention of the French Government. It was at the beginning of the treaty and would have determined the shape of the EU  <br>

and the shape of things to come. Our Government&#146;s negotiations on that failed and we suffered the humiliation, which has been trumpeted in France and many other parts of the EU, that free and undistorted competition is not the EU&#146;s objective. Whatever the legal force of the Government&#146;s achievement, it is not the same as having competition as an objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08020693000579">Time and again, the Government return to the House from negotiations and try to put a brave face on their defeats. They have had to accept provisions that they opposed and subsequently performed contortions, with Ministers describing them in the House as a great step forward and good for the country while simultaneously introducing proposals to ensure that they would not apply here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08020693000580">Historians will have an interesting time investigating the background of and motivation for the UK negotiating position last June and earlier, when the rebate was lost. My hon. Friends talk of incompetence and it may be part of the historians&#146; remit to investigate that. However, such failure is partly inherent in the UK&#146;s relationship with the supranational authority of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08020693000581">It is a shame that Ministers cannot admit the truth to the House: sometimes, because of the nature of the institution, they cannot get their way in negotiations and they have not been able to secure what they and this country&#146;s electorate would have preferred. We must therefore be careful and jealous of the power of the House. We must be careful about the matters for which we permit the EU to exercise power over our electorate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08020693000582">Power is either exercised here, where we are accountable to our constituents and Governments are accountable to the people, or it is not. In the latter case, it is exercised elsewhere and the relevant authority is not so accountable. We sometimes pretend that, in the history of our relationship with the EU, there is some huge, underground storage facility beneath the House, containing unexercised and undistributed power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08020693000583">I reiterate that power is exercised either here or in Europe, by a supranational authority, over which we have limited ability to shape what takes place. Of course, we go to the limit of that ability, but it is not the same as national parliamentary accountability. That is the shame of our current proceedings, which are a travesty. We have been denied line-by-line consideration of the treaty. There could be no more compelling evidence of the way in which power has passed from the House and the House has been degraded. That is to the House&#146;s discredit.</p>

 I am grateful to follow the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), who made a sound and strong speech. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08020693000589">We have heard some great names thrown around the Chamber, such as Mr. Giscard d&#146;Estaing, President Sarkozy and Baroness Thatcher; indeed, we have even gone as far back as the rebate, which she negotiated after 1979. However, I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that it was Jim Callaghan who first raised the rebate when he was Prime Minister in 1978. It was not Lady Thatcher alone who secured it; rather, it was already a Government policy to get some rebate back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08020693000590">There is a paradox in the Conservatives&#146; policy on Europe. The one thing that they should support is the single market, because a free trade area is what they essentially believe in, yet they walk away from it. The hon. Member for Hertsmere touched on that when he talked about supranationality, but I should remind him that from 1957 the goal of the European Union, as it now is, has been ever closer union. The Union is a political space, an economic space and a geographic space&#151;it is all three, together as one. Today we are debating the economic space proposed by the Lisbon treaty and the essence of the Common Market, or the single or internal market, as it is now called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08020693000591">We have, rightly, been given quite some time to deal with the motion, to which the amendment standing in the name of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) has been moved. We have heard interventions from the hon. Members for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) and for Hertsmere and my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), as well as a speech by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). It is as well that we use this time to lay to rest the issue of the protocol&#151;that is, the idea that we moved away from having undistorted competition in the new amending treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80206-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08020693000592">It is a surprise that the Conservatives complained about the constitutional treaty&#151;they say that it is not defunct, but what we are dealing with now&#151;because the phrase &#147;free and undistorted competition&#148; was in fact contained in article 3 of the now defunct treaty. When the constitutional treaty was abandoned, so was that article. The protocol is indeed legally binding, as my right hon. Friend said last week, quoting the Law Society. The internal market, as set out in article 2 of the treaty on European Union, includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted. We can go as far back as the European Coal and Steel Community or the treaty of Rome, whose essence was the idea that the great nation states of Europe would never fight again, because trade would prevent them.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is saying that the Lisbon treaty is somewhat worse than the original constitution, on which he promised his constituents a referendum. How can he, as a man of integrity whom I greatly respect, justify not fulfilling his promise when he is now offering them something even worse?</p>

The treaties have always made it clear that competition in the internal market should not be distorted. The now defunct constitutional treaty&#146;s objectives would have included new wording about &#147;free and undistorted competition&#148;. When the treaty was set aside, that provision was lost, but we agreed on a new and legally binding protocol to be annexed to the treaties, which reaffirms the commitment to ensuring that competition is not distorted, and the other references to competition in the existing treaties will remain: for example, articles 4, 27, 34, 81 to 89, 96, 98, 105 and 157 from the European Community treaty.

Yet the hon.

We need more competition and more flexibility, leading to better jobs. We need less protection, more growth and employment, improved productivity and enhanced competitiveness, which are all linked to social provision. Economists and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might lament the slow pace of implementation of the Lisbon agenda, but they should take into account the fact that net profits of the Union&#146;s top 300 quoted companies rose 56 per cent. between 2000 and 2004. The return on equity, furthermore, was 14.8 per cent.</p>

We, as Great Britain and the United Kingdom, are here within the Union to give leadership. We need to send out the message from this House of Commons that the single market and the Lisbon agenda will give us a strong economy, leading to prosperity&#151;a prosperity that also enables social provision.</p>

As member states&#146; activities converge, enacting their own structural reforms, so the well-being of EU citizens will be advanced, strengthening the concept of interdependence and assuring the future of all our generations to come. That is the message&#151;the positive message of the Lisbon agenda and the positive message of our Government&#151;that this House should send out. That is how we will lead the debate through the amending treaty and back into the councils of Europe. </p>

 It is useful to remind ourselves of why we are discussing a European treaty plain and simple, and not a treaty on the European constitution. The reason is that the people of France and the Netherlands said no. One of the main things that they said no to was a vision of Europe in which public services were privatised and the social gains of the past 50 years were sacrificed in order to secure the economic gains from the single market, which we have heard so much about in this debate.</p>

Only last week, the third postal services directive was agreed, which will almost certainly mean the end of a publicly owned postal service in small European states such as Luxembourg, and could spell the end of the Post Office in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08020693000604">In the neo-liberal newspeak of the European Commission, privatisation is known as liberalisation, which sounds much more benevolent, and public services&#151;far too value-laden a term&#151;are known as services of general economic interest. I do not think that many people would rush to the barricades to defend SGEIs, as the technocrats call them. People did take to the streets, however, against the Commission&#146;s directive on opening public services to competition&#151;the controversial Bolkestein directive&#151;which was part of the reason why the constitution was sunk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08020693000605">In some ways, the treaty represents progress. There is recognition of public opposition to the further extension of the single market into the public realm. For the first time in the history of the EU, a specific protocol is devoted to services of general interest. My core contention, however&#151;and here I very much agree with the contribution of the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)&#151;is that the treaty&#146;s provisions are, unfortunately, insufficient to provide us with the necessary legal safeguards against further incursions by the Commission and extension of the single market model into the realm of publicly run, managed and financed services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08020693000606">The key problem with the protocol is that it does not define the distinction between services of non-economic general interest and services of general economic interest. I will not detain the House on that matter, but that is part of the problem leading to legal uncertainty. What is the legal position of public services as a result of the treaty?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000607">All the evidence is that the Commission takes an expansive line on the definition of the role of competition policy with regard to public services. Only last month, Jrgen Holmquist, the Commission&#146;s director general for the internal market and services, said at a conference that in his view, everything apart from the police, the justice system and social security could be marketised. He saw many advantages in promoting that through the Commission&#146;s policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000608">As the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, the best example is the Kyprianou directive on health care, which sought to introduce a form of health tourism. Superficially, it might seem to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) that that has some advantages for individuals in the short term. But we should think of the disadvantages. How can one plan a publicly run, publicly owned health system, and manage resources and work force requirements, if the level of operations that will need to be financed&#151;and the financial cost incurred by poorer countries&#146; health systems in making reimbursement for operations in higher-cost countries&#151;is unclear?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08020693000609">The Commission has dropped the Kyprianou directive, which was supposed to be published on 19 December. The speculation in the European Parliament is that the Commission wanted to avoid the publication of a controversial directive while member states were ratifying the treaty. This is what one socialist MEP&#151;who led the opposition to the Bolkestein directive&#151;had to say about the Commission:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08020693000610">That view has been echoed by the president of the Party of European Socialists, of which the Labour party is a member. The directive has been pulled by the Commission. It may be published after ratification, or even after the European parliamentary elections in 2009, because the Commission is worried about the public reaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08020693000611">That worry about the extension of the single market model is not confined to health care. It is happening in other areas as well. In July 2005, the Commission wrote to the Dutch Government informing them&#151;a directly elected Government&#151;that their system of social housing was not compatible with the single market, in order to compel housing associations to sell their empty properties. As a result, the highly successful Dutch housing association model, which mixes social housing with private rented accommodation, is unlikely to survive. Now the European Property Federation has complained to the Commission about municipal housing in Sweden, and it is only a matter of time before the same complaints are made here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08020693000612">As it stands, the treaty does not provide sufficient legal certainty about the special position of public services. Given past experience, it can therefore be expected that the Commission and the Court will continue to interpret the treaty in a manner that is slanted towards the opening up of more and more public services to competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80206-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08020693000615">That, combined with the victory won on the services directive in the Parliament since the constitution&#151;thanks to the work of Arlene McCarthy, a Labour MEP&#151;has changed the environment in which the provision will be interpreted. Surely the hon. Gentleman should give credit where it is due, and recognise the progress that has been made.</p>

 I said that some progress had been made, in the addition of the protocol as a result of political pressure&#151;not least from the Dutch Government&#151;following the Altmark decision in the European Court of Justice, which gave rise to the Commission&#146;s letter. Nevertheless, the Party of European Socialists group in the European Parliament is very worried about the draft Kyprianou directive.</p>

 If the hon.

 The point I am making is that the current balance is not quite right and that regulation is too heavy-handed. Ministers share that point of view, although I am unsure whether the hon. Lady does.

What that point of view fails to appreciate is that European Court of Justice interpretations of the provisions of treaties tend to place greater weight on the preamble and the early articles.

 The difficulty that Labour Members have when they make that argument is that the European Court of Justice will sometimes have to balance two conflicting objectives.

The treaty moves us away from the Anglo-Saxon model towards a more interventionist model. Its framework encourages more regulation, not less. Its objectives encourage more protectionism, not less. It is a reorientation of the EU away from the economic policies that create jobs and wealth, and towards the short-term protectionism that most people in this House oppose.</p>

Opposition&#146;s amendment to the programme motion. We thus allowed three hours for the themed debated and three hours in which to consider amendments. The format of our debate is therefore exactly as the Conservative Opposition wished.</p>

I ask the House to celebrate that. The news will doubtless cause great rejoicing throughout this Chamber and across this nation.</p>

He had his first opportunity to speak in one of the themed debates in this European treaty process. I think the House would accept that he made his case in a thoughtful and occasionally humorous way. I look forward to hearing from him again as the Bill goes through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80206-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08020693000649">We also had the opportunity to hear from several of my right hon. and hon. Friends, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) and my hon. Friends the Members for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) and for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell). If time allows, I will respond to the points that they made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80206-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08020693000650">It has been said before, and I shall say so again clearly today, that the European Union helps to make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and better off. However, as I said last night, while the single market has been a remarkable success for the European Union and the United Kingdom, there are still too many people who are not benefiting from the economic growth and prosperity that the single market has brought us. There are 15 million Europeans without the basic literacy skills that they need to compete with the rising global economies. When we conclude the process on the Lisbon treaty, we should apply our political attention and determination to the Lisbon agenda for jobs and growth.</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="08020693000651"><a name="80206-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="08020693002492"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 We have not heard one word about China or India in the course of the debate so far. How can we compete, and reverse the decline in our market share internationally, if we have a European Union that is locked into the over-regulation and increasing protectionism that will prevent us from competing and engaging in the globalised economy?</p>

<p><a name="st_o320"><a name="08020693000652"><a name="80206-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08020693002493"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not mind my saying that I agree with the basic premise of some of his comments. There is an old stereotype of China and India that claims that their role in the global market is to compete at the bottom end. That is the old economic reality and is no longer relevant. Research spending in China is set to catch up with the EU by 2010 and is growing by 20 per cent. a year. When it comes to economic growth, it has taken China 10 years to achieve what Japan took 35 years to achieve. While we agree on some of the analysis underpinning the debate, we often come to different conclusions. The conclusion of the Government is that the evidence makes the case for being more effective through the European Union, as a group of 27 sovereign nations working together where they can in the largest rules-based market in human history.</p>

 My hon. Friend mentioned that there are parts of Europe that have not benefited as much as they should from being a member of the EU. The Government introduced objective 1 funding for Wales and other areas of the UK. Why does my hon. Friend think that the Conservatives, when they were in government, failed to apply for objective 1 funding, especially given that they had a pit closure programme, they were running down steel mills, and seaside towns were left to dangle in the wind?</p>

<p><a name="st_o322"><a name="08020693000654"><a name="80206-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="08020693002495"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 My hon. Friend talks with great experience in such matters and the issue of the previous Government&#146;s record on objective 1 deserves greater focus on another occasion. In recent years, the growth in the labour market in the UK has been in areas that have previously seen endemic and generational unemployment. There is still much more to do, but the improvement has been seen in the most difficult, disadvantaged parts of the UK, many of them represented by my right hon. and hon. Friends. Many of our constituents now compete in a genuine global labour market, and this is the first generation for whom that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="08020693000655"><a name="80206-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="08020693002496"><b>Ms Katy Clark (North Ayrshire and Arran) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend will have listened to the debate and will be aware of the concerns that have been raised by some hon. Members about the impact of the single market on public services. He will have heard reference to the protocol on services of general interest that was negotiated. In my constituency, we have lifeline ferry services provided by CalMac&#151;Caledonian MacBrayne. The previous Scottish Executive spent more than &#163;17 million on a tendering exercise that resulted in CalMac keeping the tender. Will that exercise now be required, in his view, under the protocol?</p>

 I am well aware of the ferries in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency. I look forward to travelling on one to the Isle of Arran this Sunday with my family. I shall discuss that matter with the ferry crew and others this Sunday. The protocol makes it clear for the first time that the provisions of the treaty do not affect in any way the competence of member states to provide, commission and organise non-economic services of general interest. I look forward to continuing that conversation with my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80206-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08020693000657">Let me turn to the point on health made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. Maastricht introduced competence on public health, of course, and the treaty makes it clearer than ever before that member states remain solely responsible for organising, delivering, and making decisions about the allocation of resources to their health systems. I look forward to continuing the dialogue with my right hon. Friend. Article 2 says that individual states should organise and deliver the health systems that I have mentioned. The words used are new in the Lisbon treaty and helpfully clarify that the allocation of resources in public health systems is for member states to decide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80206-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08020693000658">Let me turn to the subject of competition, which exercised Conservative Members at great length.</p>

I met the Deputy Prime Minister from the ODS in the Czech Republic, Mr. Vondra, and he is strongly supportive of the Lisbon treaty.

<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1040</b><br>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="08020693001765"><a name="80206-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="08020693003569"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 Just before we voted at the end of our debate on the motion, the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen), who is not with us at the moment, made a point of order complaining about the relatively small number of Back Benchers who had managed to contribute. The Minister said that the Government had decided on a three-hour/three-hour split. I remind him that in our alternative proposal we argued for 18 days of consideration, which would have provided much more time to debate the treaty. In deference to the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead, I will attempt to keep my remarks relatively brief in the hope that the maximum number of Back Benchers can participate. I hope that the Minister will appreciate what I am trying to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80206-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08020693001766">Amendment No. 237 would prevent competition rules from becoming an exclusive competence of the European Union. That would, first, improve the treaty by removing a series of potentially damaging side-effects while allowing the UK to retain the freedom to complement the internal market where deemed necessary; and secondly, as the Minister for Europe must be getting used to hearing when we are discussing amendments, be in line with the Government&#146;s policy as laid out when debating in the European Convention. The Government&#146;s chief negotiator at the Convention, the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), argued at the time&#151;I know that the Minister enjoys these quotes, so I will read it slowly:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080206/debtext/80206-0017.htm"/>


<a name="80206-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08020693002097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Community does not have exclusive competence in relation to measures to ensure free movement in the internal market...If the Community were to have exclusive competence in these areas, the Member States would have no power to take any measures (eg, in relation to the protection of health or consumer protection) which could affect free movement, nor to establish rules to promote competition. Plainly, the Member States currently exercise powers in these areas. The Community has power to harmonise the rules in these areas, but authority to take action in these areas is effectively shared.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08020693001767">Needless to say, that amendment failed. That is not surprising because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) pointed out last Tuesday, of the 40 or so amendments in justice and home affairs that were tabled by the Government at the Convention, only two succeeded, one of which was to change the word &#147;safety&#148; to &#147;security&#148;. Unfortunately, the Government were hardly any more persuasive at the Convention in their arguments regarding competition policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08020693001768">What are the effects of the treaty on UK competition policy of which the Government originally disapproved? For the first time, the treaty characterises</p>
<a name="80206-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="08020693002098"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08020693001769">as an exclusive competence of the EU. Where there is an exclusive competence, the treaty explains that</p>
<a name="80206-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="08020693002099"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts, the Member States being able to do so themselves only if so empowered by the Union or for the implementation of Union acts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08020693001770">Therefore, unlike under current treaties, the UK will not be able to legislate on its own initiative to complement Union competition rules. It would not even be able to vary rules temporarily or permanently to protect the health or safety of UK subjects. The effects of the changes are wide reaching, so it is no wonder that the right hon. Member for Neath tried and failed, not once, but twice, to carry what we agree was a measured and sensible amendment.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 Feb 2008">

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08020693001771">In practice, the treaty will mean that UK authorities will no longer be able to supplement EU competition rules if they believe that EU competition law does not go far enough. That could lead to cases where distortions in UK markets go untreated while the UK waits as it tries to push through new competition regulations in Brussels. An example of that sort of situation may be found in the UK financial services industry, which is particularly pertinent to many of my constituents who commute into the City. If the UK decided that aspects of the industry required further competition laws or regulations, it could not legislate in that area on its own because the matter would be an exclusive competence of the Union. Likewise, if our Government found that they did not have sufficient rules to encourage competition policy in, for example, the UK&#146;s airports, they would have to argue for rules at an EU level, having given up the ability to legislate in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08020693001772">A second problem was identified by the right hon. Member for Neath&#151;he was prescient. Once competition becomes the exclusive preserve of the EU, the ability of the Government to legislate to protect health and to engage in consumer protection will be compromised. A persuasive example given by the Government in 2004 concerned a case brought against them at the European Court of Justice by tobacco companies, which was initiated in December 2002. The case highlighted the conflict between the implementation of health standards, such as maximum tar and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes, and the EU&#146;s competition policy. In 2004, the Government argued that had competition policy been an exclusive competence rather than a shared one, they would not have been able to influence that important area of health policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08020693001773">Given all of those factors, I have three questions for the Minister. First, the wording of the competition laws regarding the abuse of dominant positions states that it will apply in any case that</p>
<a name="80206-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="08020693001774"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;may affect trade between member states&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08020693001775">Given that the legal interpretation of the word &#147;may&#148; is extremely wide, will the Minister explain what that wording will encompass if the treaty goes through? Secondly, what discussions have the Government undertaken with the UK Competition Commission with regard to the treaty&#146;s provisions? Thirdly, with regard to the danger highlighted by the right hon. Member for Neath concerning the inability of the UK to safeguard health and consumer protection, has the Minister received any further reassurance during his negotiations with EU partners?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08020693001776">Turning to amendment No. 239 on customs co-operation, under the treaty, EU laws could lay down conditions under which UK Customs could check to ensure compliance with national criminal law regarding items entering the UK. That could oblige Customs to report its compliance with such matters to the Commission. Such laws could import all of the EU&#146;s human rights general principles, such as the charter of fundamental rights, into the applications of our Customs procedures, with unknown effects. We tabled amendment No. 239 to prevent that situation from arising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80206-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08020693001777">I said to the House that I would be brief, so I shall conclude speaking on our amendments as follows. Amendment No. 237 would do only what the Government  <br>

wanted to achieve but failed to secure when they negotiated the European Convention. It would allow the UK to complement EU competition policy when that is necessary and protect the UK from regulation when it is not. It would strike out elements that are full of unknown consequences. It would also preserve the House&#146;s ability to promote health and consumer protection, as the Government wished to do.</p>

I am not as worried as the Conservative spokesman about the inclusion of the word &#147;exclusive&#148; in the treaty. Indeed, our interpretation is that, if we do not try to enforce a single market and we allow people to pick and choose an opt-out when it pleases them, that may be detrimental to the United Kingdom, which tends to be an enthusiast for enforcing the free market principles of the EU with some rigour. We support powers that will enable the single market in the EU to function as effectively as possible. It does not take a huge leap of imagination to envisage some of our partner nations in the EU dragging their feet to the detriment of people in Britain. We cannot prevent them from doing that unless we give the EU some powers. It still means that the UK can have, for example, an Office of Fair Trading. &#147;Exclusive&#148; does not mean that the British Government can no longer make policies and apply them to the UK. However, that does not detract from the value of rigorous rules that are enforceable throughout the EU.</p>

 Does the hon.

 I am grateful for that intervention because I agree with it. It is worth emphasising the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. It is fair to say that different views exist in the EU about the way in which western advanced capitalist economies should go. That is a slight simplification but it helps explain matters. I believe that most members of all three main parties have much sympathy for what is regarded as the Anglo-Saxon model of rigorous competition. That view is not universally held but our Government and Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers subscribe to it. Competition and free trade create wealth and jobs and it is in our interests to promote such values throughout the European Union.</p>

France is commonly cited as an example of a country that has a political and cultural attachment to a social model, but many people in Britain would feel that that model restricted business.

Indeed, one of the reasons I am a Liberal Democrat is that I am an economic liberal. Economic liberalism has much to teach everyone across all three major parties in the House. At the risk of being pulled up short, I think that the great ideological debates of the 20th century about whether competition and free market economics are successful or whether there is a preferable alternative model was resolved fairly decisively in about 1989.</p>

Does my party believe that it is in the interests of British business to have a properly and consistently enforced free market, where we can trade in goods and services, and does that add to the likelihood of British companies generating both wealth for their shareholders and extra employment? Yes it does, in my view and that of my party. Do we therefore need rules and regulations to ensure that we and other countries comply with those basic criteria? Yes, in my view, we do. Is it therefore unwise for the Conservative party to try to act to the detriment of British business, by making it possible for other European Union countries to restrict the operation of the free market? In my view it is. The Conservative party&#146;s pro-business credentials have been taken over by their Eurosceptic credentials. That is a mistake.</p>

 I have some sympathy with the position set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), but I do not see that as necessarily contradictory. However, I should be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views on this. Through the rules governing the internal market, one can have levelling up, but it is too often assumed that there will instead be a levelling down, which is not what I want. I want levelling up, so that we can have free and open competition, but within a framework, so that we do not have, literally and metaphorically, &#147;beggar thy neighbour&#148; downwards competition, but instead move up together.

It does not make a material difference. In our view, we have taken a step forward and a step back to where we were. But does it send out a slightly unwelcome signal about protectionism, which we want to see less of, and about free trade and competition in the EU, which we support?

They welcome the sense of partnership conferred not just by the internal market but by the benefits that it brings to the work force, and they are discomfited by proposals such as these from the official Opposition. They are made uncomfortable by the possibility of changes in the way in which they do business, gaining access to nearly 500 million consumers. We can feel confident that those consumers are being treated decently, and can reap the benefits of the good working conditions for which trade unionists in this country worked for many years. The European Union is now improving those conditions further, and the treaty is updating them.</p>

The Minister referred to attempts&#151;of which we have had plenty&#151;to turn back the tide and launch deregulatory initiatives in the EU. We have heard it all before; it never works or it never happens. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee. We are still on the receiving end of a blizzard of new proposals, directives and regulations. We were told that with enlargement everything would seize up if we did not get more majority voting in the constitution. That was another lie, of course. We did not need the constitution in order to enlarge, and we now have 12 new member states and even more laws are coming out of Brussels even without the extensions in majority voting in the treaty. So we are on the receiving end of a torrent of over-regulation, which far exceeds the rule of law necessary to regulate any free market sensibly.</p>

 One of the problems is that although many of us agreed with the initial concept of the single market&#151;to remove tariff barriers and to have mutual recognition of goods and services&#151;the welter of regulation introduced to bring about total harmonisation throughout the EU has been used as an anti-competitive device within the EU. As a former Minister who had to deal with the food and drinks industry, I know that every time a small British company such as a soya milk or mineral water manufacturer started to gain market share, their competitors within the EU used the single market to see them off.</p>

 My hon. Friend knows that well, and she is absolutely right. It is striking that no other trade bloc has gone down this route of handing over its powers to a central organisation that over-regulates. The rest of the world is steaming ahead of us.

 The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. I know a little about Mercosur because I was once a junior Minister in the Foreign Office and responsible for Latin America. I recall visiting Brazil, which is of course part of Mercosur and saying that one piece of advice that I wanted to give was not to set up anything remotely resembling the European Commission. The Brazilians said that they had learned that lesson. They said, &#147;We know the damage caused by unaccountable bureaucrats sitting in private and dreaming up new schemes for everyone else. We do not want those proto-regulators with awesome powers, accountable to no one. We are not going down that route.&#148; The hon.

If a country is a member of NAFTA, it can do side agreements and bilateral deals with poorer countries to take their goods tariff-free. As we are in a customs union, we cannot do that. We are the fifth biggest economy in the world, but we have handed over our powers on trade to the European Commission. We are prevented by treaty law from making trade-expanding agreements with the poorest countries in the world. That is shameful, but it is the result of having a customs union and not being a member of a free trade area.</p>

that can exert its comparative advantage of lower costs and perhaps greater efficiency. But they are doing that on subsidies given to them in the European Union budget. The workers in my constituency, through the taxes they pay on their wages, are contributing to the budget and paying to have their jobs relocated. They are contributing to the undermining of their own security. Of course, the situation is getting worse. Under the European Communities (Finance) Bill, which we debated and passed last month, our net contributions will go up to &#163;6 billion a year.

That is why my hon. Friends and I have tabled a number of amendments to cut and define better those powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80206-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08020693001855">I am thinking particularly of articles 94 and 95 of the existing treaty. They are increasingly being used not to establish a single market but to legislate in areas that are quite disconnected with it, because they use qualified majority voting. In a sense, everything can be traded or can cross borders. That is confirmed by a paper I was helpfully given by the Foreign Office during the Convention on the Future of Europe, which listed all the items of legislation that have been passed under the single market powers given by articles 94 and 95, of which 104 go far wider than the establishment of a single market. They deal with things such as money laundering, the art market, transnational organised crime, summer time arrangements, noise emissions, units of measurements, member states&#146; balance of payments, combating terrorism, anti-personnel landmines, counterfeiting, civil protection, budgetary discipline and social security relating to employed persons.</p>

because health can be traded and because health care can be experienced across borders. Using the single market, the EU has expanded its powers into the new areas. That so worried the working group that I was on during the Convention that it recommended amendments to the treaties to redefine the market powers and to ensure that they are used only to bring down barriers and to enact measures that are genuinely and intimately connected with the establishment of a single market, rather than to expand EU powers into new areas by qualified majority voting in the way that I have described.</p>

To me and others, that showed that the exercise was a sham and that there was never any intention to relinquish any powers. Even though a majority in the working group supported some amendments to restrict those powers, they were overturned and ignored. No such change ever found its way into the final document or the constitution, and so nothing to that effect is in the Lisbon treaty.</p>

The distinction is very important, as the Government recognised at that time. If competition is an area of exclusive competence, member states are forbidden to legislate in respect of it, even if the aim is to promote it.

 My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The reason why companies such as Wockhardt of India, Sharp of Japan, and Ipsen Biopharm of France have moved into Wrexham is that it is in the European Union and has access to a market of 500 million people, and they wish to export.

 I start by picking up seamlessly from where the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) finished. It is worth noting briefly&#151;I shall not labour the point&#151;that one of the benefits that Welsh companies have had is some of the objective 1 funding, which has done nothing more than move some of the jobs from constituencies like mine, in England but on the border with Wales, a few miles down the M4. It has not been job creation so much as job moving.</p>

 I was not referring specifically to the hon. Gentleman. I was referring to the point about Wales generally, which the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) made. I know for a fact that many companies in Wales have had some of that funding. Instead of locating in constituencies like mine, they have moved to constituencies in Wales. There has not been a net benefit to the UK at all. The funding has simply moved the jobs around.</p>

Members said, Europe currently accounts for a significant chunk of the world economy and a significant chunk of world trade, but those of my generation are looking at what will happen over the next 10, 20 or 30 years.

We are focusing on the European market to the exclusion of the world outside. My right hon.

 I want to make a serious business point, not a party political one. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there will be temptations in a global world and global market for a company such as Airbus to source from areas with a cheap labour supply, provided that everything else is in order, and that it would be difficult to counteract that? Airbus, however, is in no way constrained by basic regulation in the EU; it can still compete internationally with Boeing. If there are constraints, they are to do with labour costs, not over-regulation.</p>

 I do not think that the industry and companies chosen by the hon. Gentleman are a terribly good example. They are very important to our economy and that of the US, but that industry and both those companies are heavily subsidised, either directly by the taxpayer or, in the case of Boeing, indirectly&#151;it is alleged&#151;through defence contracts and so forth. Governments are already heavily involved in those companies because of direct or indirect subsidies, so they are not a terribly good example of competitive businesses.</p>

 May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he and I would draw completely opposite conclusions from the research to which he has referred? My conclusion is that the current European Union framework relating to competition and the knowledge-based economy mentioned at the Lisbon 2000 Council has not worked, so we need to change things. The difference between us is that he would change them by what I would regard as the somewhat protectionist domestication of this stuff, whereas I would do it through the EU reform treaty. We agree that we need change; it is simply a question of what change we need.  <br>

 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can have been paying attention. I was not talking about a British Government legislating domestically in a protectionist direction; I was talking about moving in a pro-competitive direction and setting the bar higher, so as to set a powerful example for other European countries to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08020693001906">I want to touch briefly on trade matters, and to remind Members that we do not have a trade policy any more, because such policy is now effectively governed by the European Union. We rely on influencing the single Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, to make good agreements on our behalf. Using that model, however, the evidence is that some of the recent agreements have not been particularly successful. We all remember the agreements of a few years ago on textiles and shoes. They were protectionist in nature, so as to protect some of the southern European countries, and they damaged poorer countries in the third world. We should be giving those countries a leg up by trading with them, yet our agreements actually put poorer workers there out of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08020693001907">Those were very protectionist measures, and I do not want to see that kind of thing in the competitive field. I want the British Government to be pro-competitive, and I would like to see a bit more of that ability on the trade side. I want us to set a good example. That is why I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends, and why I do not support the Government&#146;s approach.</p>

 As ever, Mrs. Heal, I hang on your every word. You have told us to be precise and to the point, so I shall try to do that. I know that many other Members wish to speak.</p>

It might appear to be a technical amendment, but I would argue that it goes to the very heart of the debate that many of us have wanted to have during the passage of the Bill. We are essentially arguing for a social Europe, rather than a neo-liberal Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08020693001910">The amendment deals with a provision in article 2, paragraph 158 of the Lisbon treaty, which replaces the old article 133 establishing the common commercial policy. That part of the treaty forms the underpinning for the single market. The new article 188 includes the existing provision for a special committee appointed by the Council to advise the Commission when negotiating trade agreements. No doubt hon. Members are thinking that this sounds a bit boring and bureaucratic, but it is a tremendously exciting subject&#151;they should not be put off by the anaesthetising language that usually emanates from Europe.

has this afternoon issued a new statement on the treaty outlining its broad concerns about the trade sections of the Bill, in particular its objection to the operation of the article 133 committee. It is fair to say that the Trade Justice Movement supports the thrust of my amendment, and I hope that the Minister will take it as seriously now as the Foreign Secretary did when he mentioned it in support of his arguments on Second Reading. Its concern is that the European Union&#146;s role in international trade is perhaps the biggest single force behind global neo-liberalism. At the same time, international trade is also perhaps the biggest single role of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08020693001912">However, that transfer of power to the EU has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in transparency, democracy or accountability, especially not to this Parliament. Indeed, Commissioner Mandelson&#151;I nearly called him Comrade Mandelson&#151;is now one of the world&#146;s most powerful bureaucrats, and he will be even more so once this treaty is passed with the provisions for exclusive competence on trade. At this stage, I will resist a launch into a critique of neo-liberalism and move swiftly on. One influence that member states do still have over Commissioner Mandelson is through our representation on the article 133 committee, yet that committee is even less democratically accountable to us than even other EU institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08020693001913">Most Members will be aware of the role of the article 133 committee, but in case one or two do not, I will summarise it. It scrutinises, amends and approves Commission proposals for EU negotiating mandates on trade arrangements. Its members attend the international negotiations as part of the EU delegation, and they are usually the largest single delegation at World Trade Organisation talks. Indeed, I believe that 800 EU representatives attended the last WTO talks, which demonstrates the EU&#146;s sheer power in the WTO. The committee agrees EU position papers in principle which are, as I understand it&#151;the Minister will put me right if I am not correct&#151;passed for formal approval, first, by the Committee of Permanent Representatives, which again comprises unelected bureaucrats, and then by the Council, where they finally reach elected Ministers representing our national Governments. However, approval usually comes at what is called in Euro-jargon an A point, which means that the policies are endorsed without discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08020693001914">Over the years, more and more issues have become settled by the article 133 committee, and Ministers rarely debate EU negotiating mandates at the political level. Nor do we have any power in this Parliament to mandate the Minister, let alone officials. We cannot even find out how people voted, because the committee does not seem to take formal votes. It seems very hard to get information about the committee. I understand that we are represented on it, but we still cannot find out the necessary information. It deliberates in secret and publishes neither agenda nor minutes, and records of how decisions are taken are not made available to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08020693001915">It is true that copies of outcomes of meetings can be requested by members of the public, but they take several weeks to arrive and are so heavily censored as to be meaningless. For example, about two thirds of the text is often deleted, and all references to the positions taken by participants are simply blacked out. It is therefore impossible to hold our Government to account for the positions that they take in our name.</p>

 Today is Ash Wednesday, which is the day on which we ought to repent. I went to a service this morning in Westminster cathedral. I am going to repent the mistake that I made in 1986 of voting for the Single European Act. It was then called the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which is not unlike the name of the Bill we are debating, except we are talking not about European Communities but about the European Union. I want to put that on the record because my hon.

It was Mr. Enoch Powell, and he said to me, &#147;I have put my name to your amendment.&#148; And those two names stood there on the Order Paper, completely alone on the sovereignty of this Parliament with regard to the 1986 legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08020693001928">On 23 April 1986, I made several points about the internal market. I said that I had</p>

framework of the current proposals. We are dealing with an internal market but also with protectionism within it. There have been several exchanges about Mr. Sarkozy&#146;s comments. Our main objectives should be to look outwards, as my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean said, to a globalised economy, as I attempted to predict&#151;I believe correctly&#151;some 20 years ago in 1986. I believed that the single market was intended to operate in that way. It has not worked in that way. Indeed, it has internalised, not externalised and it has therefore failed. That is why the Lisbon agenda has failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08020693001939">The Minister for Europe is not personally responsible for the documents that relate to the Lisbon agenda, which were submitted to the European Scrutiny Committee in January. However, he is representing the Government and I simply want to repeat the European Scrutiny Committee&#146;s comments about those documents. We were given an analysis and I am sorry to say that we had to be critical of the Government&#146;s response to them. In a nutshell, we said that the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury could not justify the report that she gave. That related to the entire Lisbon agenda and every single matter dealing with competition policy and the re-launching of all the initiatives that had failed since 2000, in respect of which Will Hutton, the rapporteur and an extremely distinguished economist, made some critical comments to the European Reform Forum, which I helped to initiate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08020693001940">We in the Committee said that the degree of explanation in the</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80206-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08020693001941">The Committee asked the Exchequer Secretary to ensure that the documents would explain things properly in the future, and so on. I mention that because it is made clear in the documents that those who run the European Community are aware of a thing called reform fatigue. There is a reluctance to tackle issues that require reform, and we are not getting the reform required.</p>

The article in question&#151;article 2B&#151;concerns the enhanced approach through which the Union will grab and maintain new areas of exclusive competence. In particular, it will dictate competition rules. We heard an interesting speech from the erstwhile temporary leader of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), but as I pointed out to him, he missed the main point. Although he explained the layer upon layer of development of the internal market, the reality is that we have reached an apex and have to retrieve the situation in order to prevent the over-regulation that is literally destroying British business and European business, too.</p>

As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) correctly pointed out, if we evaluate the cost-benefit of the European Union&#151;that is, assess the amount claimed as benefits of the Union against the actual costs described by Mr. Verheugen&#151;the answer is that the European Union is not functioning as it was claimed when I voted for the Single European Act in 1986. However, I am delighted to give way to my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), because I know that he will attempt to disagree with me.</p>

 I was present at exactly the same service as my hon. Friend this morning, but I am not saying that I was guilty of voting in the way that I did, either at that time or since. Indeed, I have been consistent. However, as a business man working over the whole of Europe and advising large numbers of international companies working in Europe, I have to tell him that the picture of the European Union that he has given is totally foreign to anyone who does the job. It is about time that people talking about business in the House showed that they knew about it and did it, rather than making the sort of comment that one can make only if one has no knowledge of how business actually works.</p>

 I am delighted that my right hon. Friend has said that. As it happens, for 20 years before I became a Member of this House I was advising many, if not most, of the biggest companies in the UK on the whole question of the impact of legislation. I have also written many articles on the manner in which business, as I mentioned in a speech in 1986, has failed to concentrate on getting the European regulatory system right. That is why I was so cross&#151;as was my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells&#151;when Lord Jones as he now is came as Digby Jones to the European Scrutiny Committee and had the brass neck to say that we were not doing our job properly, when the CBI under his director-generalship had actually made no representations to us at all.

Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal, the Union will grab and maintain new areas of exclusive competence. In particular, the Union will dictate competition rules, misleadingly justified under the functioning of the internal market as an exclusive competence. Currently, article 5 of the treaty on the European Union stresses that in areas that do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity</p>
<a name="80206-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="08020693002116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80206-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08020693001952">That represents a big problem, because it makes certain assumptions. First, it assumes that subsidiarity can be applied, but as I have said in previous debates, I simply do not believe that it ever has been. Secondly, there is the problem that somebody has to judge what is being &#147;better achieved&#148;. Indeed, it has not been determined in which areas the Community has exclusive competence, which has inevitably led to legal disputes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80206-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08020693001953">The European Court of Justice has been recognising the exclusive power of the Community within certain areas where it had not previously had competence. Now it has those competences and the new article is a reflection of ECJ practices and existing case law. The European Community common policy approach will take greater precedence than British obligations to third countries and Commonwealth countries, for example. That matter relates to what the hon. Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) said a few moments ago about third countries and Commonwealth countries and the representations of non-governmental organisations. I take a great interest in matters pertaining to aid, as does my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal and my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), who chairs one of our policy groups on international aid. We should take very careful note of the way in which economic partnership agreements are working and of the damage that that is doing. As I was saying, European Community common policy will take greater precedence than British obligations to third countries and Commonwealth countries, and the European Court of Justice has said that we would</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80206-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08020693001955">That is the seriousness of the situation. The European Court has said, in relation to our obligations to third countries and Commonwealth countries, at the very time when we should expand our interest in the globalised economy&#151;particularly in relation to India and its new-found opportunities, Malaysia, the all-party group on which I chair, and all the other Commonwealth countries with which we have a common heritage&#151;that we will no longer have the right to maintain our existing relations. Control over the customs union, establishing the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market, monetary policy, common commercial policy, the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy&#151;all are locked into the Union.

<a name="80206-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="08020693002118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;its conclusion is provided for in a legislative act of the Union or is necessary to enable the Union to exercise its internal competence, or insofar as its conclusion may affect common rules or alter their scope.&#148;</p>

In relation to the realities of competition, it involves the whole question of the extent to which we are able to succeed as a country. As I said in an intervention on my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal, I simply do not agree that the whole of the European Union has been a success. As many statistics and figures demonstrate, regrettably, the European Union is dropping down the league. The predictions are that, largely because of over-regulation, the failure of initiatives such as the Lisbon agenda, and the failure of the integration process, by 2020 the EU&#146;S actual GDP will take us even further down the league table. That will affect our constituents. We must therefore spring the trap and start renegotiating the treaties, and get ourselves into a relationship of an association of nation states.</p>

He has written about the failure of the European Union integration process. He gives examples of how the European Union has failed in relation to trade and other matters, and effectively argues that that failure has demonstrated that the Eurosceptic arguments, which have been developed over the past 20 years, have been proved right.</p>

In 1945, people probably would have thought that the European Coal and Steel Community and all the rest of it was the right thing to do.

The article lists as areas of shared competence the internal market; social policy; economic, social and territorial cohesion; agriculture and fisheries; environment; consumer protection; transport; trans-European networks; energy; the area of freedom; security and justice; common safety concerns in public health matters; research; technology development and space; development co-operation; and humanitarian aid.

I believe that the rules establishing the internal market will remain the same and that an uncompetitive Europe will continue, with very serious consequences of the kind illustrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean. The internal-market question is being internalised, and it is not being understood that we live in a global economy in which India, China, Malaysia and other countries are developing just as we developed in the 18th century. We want to work with them in a peaceable fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80206-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08020693001963">Free trade is the essence of peace and prosperity, as Cobden and Bright demonstrated in the mid-19th century. This is the key: we should understand that the rules that are being developed&#151;involving the concentration of power, the apex of decision making being taken away from the free markets and the decisions becoming the arid, dry, desiccated decisions of the European Court of Justice&#151;are not the way to go. They will not allow us to secure the flexibility in trade that I know is desired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron).

The politics of choice in politics must, however, be paralleled by the politics of choice in economics.

I remember the damage done by competitive tendering, when there was an unbelievable imbalance fuelled by the fact that local authorities could not compete for services that other local authorities were providing, but only the private sector could compete to take services away from the public sector. It is a good aspect of the treaty that, along with the protocol which I shall mention later, the Commission are given a duty to secure a balance between competitiveness and the destruction of services by unfair competition.</p>

This is not the constitution; this is the Lisbon treaty, because many things have moved on in Europe since then. The great debate on the services directive was fought and won to exclude the destruction of public services, particularly the health service, from that directive. The protocol that has been added to the treaty was not in the constitution; those protections were not there. The debate that my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) had in the past reflected a fear of unbridled competition with no protection. It is important that we focus on what we have now, rather than praying in aid past debates and negotiations, because we are in Europe, now and in the future. Unfortunately, Opposition Front-Bench Members often fail to recognise that. I have great respect and affection for the hon.

When I asked his opinion about the protocol that has been added on services of general interest, which protects the services that would be damaged by undistorted competition, he could not tell me whether the Liberal Democrats supported it or not. His own opinion would appear to be that he does not. It would appear that he wanted what was contained in the unbridled, and I believe destructive, competition policies contained in the four great freedoms in the past. One of those freedoms must be constrained or people are damaged because they are the users of the services that are destroyed.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman laboured the point about regulation. I shall give him a book that I have read called &#147;The Mad Officials&#148;.

It was written in the 1990s by a former senior UK civil servant who pointed out that the regulation madness was actually driven by the UK civil service, because it gold-plated everything that came from Europe.

We introduced liberalisation of domestic energy, but that means that the power needed to switch the lights on in this august place, in No. 10 and in the rest of the Seeboard Energy area comes from EDF. But the French had to be threatened with infraction by the Commission before they would liberalise their markets, and that was after the last day of the last month in the directive to which they had signed up. That is why the Commission needs the power. We should not let countries have shared competence, because they will use economic patriotism and obstruction to block the free market that we argue about every time I go to COSAC.</p>

Our Government will not try to block it very often, but all over Europe other countries will form alliances to try to block the very liberalisation and free market that Conservative Front Benchers say that they want.

There has been much talk about how the EU has slowed up the benefits for other countries, but the World Trade Organisation is driving the liberalised market internationally. It is the WTO that has been threatening other countries&#146; ability to benefit, but the EU has, for example, been defending the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries by giving them time to move out of their lock-in on certain products. Even at a later stage, they need only be 80 per cent. of the way to a completely liberal market, and that will give them some leeway.

I have regularly attended meetings, often with officials, to see how matters are developing. For all that other Members say that they wish to challenge what happens or how they are interested in the strategy, I am often alone in attending those conferences. There are no other volunteers from this Parliament to go. I know that the one I am going to in a few days is during the recess, and people will be off having a holiday somewhere. It may demonstrate that I am sad, but people do not even want to go when Parliament is sitting.

The European Commission&#146;s Cecchini report forecast that the single market alone would add a minimum of 4 per cent. and a maximum of 7 per cent. to Europe&#146;s gross domestic product. I looked on the internet for reviews of how the Cecchini report had worked in practice. Reviews showed that there was no sign of any impact on the growth rate across Europe, and certainly no sign of growth of the magnitude forecast in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para14"><a name="08020693002005">I do not say that the single market has been a failure. It has not been as successful as we hoped, but it has made a contribution. However, we must ask why it did not make as much of a contribution as the European Community, the European Commission and optimists such as I hoped it would. That bears heavily on the amendments before us. There are a number of answers to the question. First, the single market was over-hyped. That is fair enough; people always over-hype things, and I think that we can forgive that, in retrospect. Secondly, sadly, we did not foresee the over-regulation of the single market. Far from being a purely deregulatory removal of barriers and borders between countries, it became a mechanism through which the European Commission could regulate, harmonise and introduce new burdens on business. That has offset many of the gains that we hoped would result from the removal of barriers to business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para15"><a name="08020693002006">Thirdly, we overstated the size and scale of barriers to business between countries. The barriers had already been removed through the general agreement on tariffs and trade and successive trade reforms, so there was not much gain to be made. I can demonstrate that by referring to a speech that I did not give. When I was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, I planned to give a speech emphasising the benefits that British companies had gained from the introduction of the single market. I asked my officials for specific examples of what British companies were doing as a result of the introduction of the single market that they had not been able to do previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para16"><a name="08020693002007">My officials came up with lots of examples of things that British companies were doing that they had not done previously, but on inspection it was found that the companies could have done them earlier. It was not the single market programme that had opened up the possibility of doing those things. I said, &#147;Well, let&#146;s get lots of businesses in and ask them, so that I&#146;ll have examples to put in this speech.&#148; We asked businesses from the service industries, where we hoped the greatest gains would be made, the privatised utilities and other sectors. I am afraid that none of them was able to give a single example of anything that they were doing that they had not been able to do before. However, lots of them were doing things that they had not done before, so the psychological impact of the single market was wholly beneficial. It gave British companies the aspiration and the vision to see that there were opportunities on the continent that they could take, but the actual measures were not as beneficial as we hoped.</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Stone said, one of the sad things about today&#146;s debate is how few, if any, references there have been&#151;apart from those made by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)&#151;to India and China, the really big markets on which our industries ought to focus, as they are fast-growing and offer enormous opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para18"><a name="08020693002009">It has been suggested that if the amendment is made, it will have no effect. It is claimed that if we persist with it until the bitter end, it will lead to us not ratifying the Lisbon treaty; the treaty will therefore fall, and we will gain nothing. However, the impact of making and persisting with the amendment, thereby not ratifying the Lisbon treaty, would be much the same as the impact made by the French and Dutch people&#146;s rejection of the constitution. They won major changes. I know that they are major, because the Government say that there are major differences between the constitution and the treaty. Funnily enough, they have resulted in major improvements for Britain, although the Dutch and the French wanted to make changes that take us in the opposite direction to that which we tend to want to take. Or are the Government saying that negligible gains resulted from the rejection of the constitution, and that we would therefore get negligible gains and improvements if we sent our negotiators back to gain improvements?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para19"><a name="08020693002010">The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that when the Dutch and the French were given a referendum and rejected the original constitution they secured major improvements, but that if we, through the House passing amendments to the Bill, were to cause the Lisbon treaty not to be ratified, we would not in the subsequent renegotiations be able to get significant improvements to the single market and other aspects of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para20"><a name="08020693002011">I hope the House will take seriously the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), and that it will have no compunction about passing them, amending the Bill and amending the treaty. That can only lead to an improvement in what is still the European constitution implemented by other means, and it would be our duty and, above all, the duty of Government Members, who promised a referendum. If there is to be no referendum, the very least they can do is amend and send the treaty back for renegotiation.</p>

the Union, including the United Kingdom, thereby allowing citizens to cross boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para22"><a name="08020693002014">Following the Watt decision in the European Court of Justice, the directive envisages that citizens of one country travelling in the jurisdiction of another may seek health care and bill back to their home country the cost of that care, whether or not their GP considered such health care urgent and necessary. The dangers of such a policy are immediately clear and I do not need to spell them out. The draft directive causes great concern. I tabled the amendment to probe the Government&#146;s position, not necessarily to press the amendment to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para23"><a name="08020693002015">There seem to be two competing principles at stake. I accept that the Lisbon treaty makes it clear, as have previous legal provisions, that health is a matter reserved to the home country. In some ways that is clearer in the Lisbon treaty than it was previously. However, there are other references in the Lisbon treaty that appear to give a certain degree of competence to the Commission in relation to health matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para24"><a name="08020693002016">The problem is that when the European Court is making decisions, as I remarked yesterday on another matter, it is asked to balance a number of competing principles. One of those principles is the one that we have been discussing all day&#151;the internal market. Whenever goods or services are tradeable, as health now seems to be in the United Kingdom&#151;lamentably, a market in the provision of health care is being created in the United Kingdom&#151;they become subject to the principles of the internal market directorate. There are therefore two competing principles: the principle that health should be reserved to the national Government, and the principle of the internal market. Those two principles conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para25"><a name="08020693002017">Then there is the intervention of the terrible twins&#151;the European Court of Justice and the Commission. The trade commissioners include the former right hon. Member for Hartlepool, whom we know well. We have seen the process operate in a number of ways. First, as we discussed yesterday, the ECJ has applied the principle of the internal market above other principles. The beginning of a wedge is driven into the legal provision governing how the EU operates; the wedge is then driven further by the commissioners, particularly those responsible for the internal market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para26"><a name="08020693002018">In the Watt case, a UK citizen received medical treatment abroad without having consulted her GP. The treatment was delivered and paid for; the individual must have had access to resources. She sought repayment from the NHS. The ECJ looked carefully into the matter and concluded that because health has become a tradeable service, the principles of the internal market must apply to it. That is the substance of the Watt judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80206-0022.htm_para27"><a name="08020693002019">The commissioners dealing with the internal market then said that notwithstanding the fact that health is a supposedly reserved matter for each home Government, the court had indeed ruled that the principles of the internal market must apply. A draft directive, published in December last year, was quickly withdrawn when it was realised that it might be contentious and could cause problems for the ratification of the treaty in the UK Parliament and others. Nevertheless, we have had sight of the draft directive, which extends the principles of the free market and marketisation to health.</p>

 This is important. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s precise concerns about single market powers being used to interfere in health provision were spotted in the drafting of the constitution by working group 5, on which I sat. However, its recommendations to amend the single market powers to take account of those concerns were overridden and ignored in the final document. In a sense, the hon. Gentleman is too late unless he votes for the amendment to overturn that aspect of the treaty, in which case there could be a rethink along the lines proposed. Is he prepared to do that?</p>

 That intervention was slightly odd, as I have tabled precisely such an amendment; I am speaking to amendment No. 223. It says that for the avoidance of doubt&#151;to use a Government expression on another matter&#151;health will not be subject to the internal market provisions.</p>

Perhaps the Opposition parties are perfectly comfortable with such a proposal, but it cannot be right and I cannot believe that they would support the idea that such a change should be imposed on the United Kingdom&#146;s national health service through an ECJ ruling, which I think inappropriate, and its reinforcement by the Commission. If the NHS were to distribute its services differently, that would normally be the subject of a debate during a general election. The people would decide whether to vote for a party, such as the Conservative party, that proposed such a system, or for one such as ours that rebutted it. I would have thought that Members on both sides of the House agreed that to subvert the NHS&#146;s founding principles in this way was an undemocratic and inappropriate way to change health service provision.</p>

I do not have time to read out the whole text, but the Commission says that some stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential of cross-border health care to alter the overall choices of member states with regard to the mechanisms of control of access to health care. It goes on to say that, be that as it may, it may not be a bad thing if competition is introduced, because that may lead to the shortening of waiting lists, the increase of choice for patients and a shift from systems of distributions of health care such as the one  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para1"><a name="08020693002028">Co-payments were clearly rejected at the general election. They will no doubt be the subject of debate in future, but I hardly think it appropriate for the Commission&#151;an unelected body&#151;to echo the voices of the marketisers in the ECJ by saying that the UK&#146;s health care is inappropriately distributed and that the mechanisms by which it is introduced should therefore be subject to change by what I regard as the inappropriate use of internal market principles, which have a generic application, rather than by the application of the principle that the United Kingdom Parliament should decide these matters. The way in which our health services should be distributed is a reserved matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para2"><a name="08020693002029">That is the burden of my case. It is important for Labour voices to speak up for our national health service, and to say that it is something that we created and that we are proud of. We will fight for the principle that the distribution of health care should be done according to the principles of the forefathers and foremothers of the health service. Beyond that, however, there are major questions to be asked about the way in which the European Union is determining policy. If all the nations have agreed that health should be a reserved matter, it cannot possibly be right to adopt a policy of driving a wedge in so that the ECJ can apply other principles to that reserved matter and gain competence in that area, or for the Commission to say, &#147;Well, the ECJ has established a principle, and we intend to build on it.&#148; Yet that is precisely what is happening.</p>

The whole construct is not about accountability in any sense that this House, this country, this electorate or this people understand. No Minister will be responsible for the consequences of all these policies, including the health policy, in front of an electorate. That is what underlies this matter.

curious way, on the single market. Twenty years ago, the great idea was that we had to have a single market. Mrs. Thatcher believed that this would open up Europe. The distinction, of course, is between a common market and a single market. I want very rapidly, in light of the time constraints and the fact that the Minister for Europe wants yet again to reprise the same arguments that we have heard for the past few days, to show wherein lies the more dynamic model. The United States, for all its sins and everything else, is a common market. The vitality of the American economy has outshone that of the European economy over the past 20 years, and it is still an enormous engine for growth. The competition between those accountable units of government enables the dynamic of capitalism, if that is what one believes in, to flourish.</p>

We have a constitutional arrangement that means that the people of this country are sovereign in terms of the activities of this House. Within the amendment tabled by my hon. Friends, and within this group of amendments, lies the opportunity to give this Government a message about the treaty that they negotiated, despite the history. Unfortunately, the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee castigated my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for remembering the past, but we should remember Cicero, who said that those who know nothing of the past will for ever remain a child. In a sense, this great parliamentary Chamber has collective amnesia as regards remembering to whom we are accountable and who should form our laws.

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para11"><a name="080206110000020">We also had an uncharacteristic contribution from the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). He is not here now, so perhaps I shall refer to it later. In passing, I shall just say that he had all the passion of a convert in paying penance for his role in almost single-handedly achieving parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty while deputy Chief Whip. If he returns to his place later, I shall respond to him in more detail, if time allows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para12"><a name="080206110000021">The first group of amendments represents a systematic attempt by those on the Conservative Benches to undermine, in specific ways, the basic foundations of the single market&#151;foundations that have been accepted by successive British Governments since the UK&#146;s accession. Amendment No. 237 is a good illustration of that point. The right hon. Member for Wells celebrated the fact that every market needs rules, which of course, it does. However, that amendment would remove the principle of exclusive EU competence over competition rules for the single market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para13"><a name="080206110000022">As the House will be aware, EU competition rules are an exclusive competence. How could they be otherwise? The Lisbon treaty defines competition rules as rules that are</p>
<a name="80206-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="080206110001019"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;necessary for the functioning of the internal market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para14"><a name="080206110000023">In other words, they are EU-wide rules. By definition, only the EU can adopt rules that apply across the EU. That is not new. Competition rules that are necessary for the functioning of the single market have always been an exclusive EU competence. It is important to note that the EU already occupies that well-established competition ground. The core competition rules are contained in articles 81 to 89 of the current treaty and their effect is carried over unchanged.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_27"><a name="80206-0023.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="080206110001031"><h5 align="left">7.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para15"><a name="080206110000024">Amendment No. 232 attacks the recognition in the Lisbon treaty of the fact that the single market is a shared competence between member states and the EU. It would remove the UK from the operation of the single market, which cannot work except as a shared competence. For the single market to operate effectively throughout all 27 EU member states, it is essential to manage some activities at EU level. Thanks to the shared competence, barriers have been removed throughout the single market, making free movement of goods a reality. That has brought billions of pounds of additional income to UK citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80206-0023.htm_para16"><a name="080206110000025">Amendment No. 195 would prevent the UK from effecting the protocol on the internal market and competition. It attacks the legally binding protocol language that the UK secured to reproduce the competition wording from the current treaty, which guarantees that the legal effect is unchanged. The legal nature of a protocol has been the subject of much conversation before today, as well as in today&#146;s proceedings. However, 17 protocols were annexed to the treaty of Maastricht. Protocol 11 was a legal guarantee that the UK was not obliged or committed to move to the third stage of economic and monetary union. That was arguably the most important item in the Maastricht treaty for the UK. Claiming that protocols matter less than treaties is therefore nonsense.</p>

 We are obliged under the protocol to which the Minister refers to comply with convergence criteria and a range of other matters, which are mentioned in the Red Book that the Chancellor produces every year, and are inimical to this country running its economy.

The Law Society has made it clear that a protocol records that the EU&#146;s internal market includes a system that ensures that competition is undistorted. It also says that that does not change the current legal position. Those views were expressed not by some foreign unaccountable entity, about which Conservative Members have spoken, but by the Law Society of England and Wales.</p>

 There is currently no proposal on the table, but we will look at the detail of any Commission proposal, and that issue will rightly be discussed in the House. I cannot be invited to veto a proposal that does not yet exist, but the text in the Lisbon treaty is very clear and strengthens the language about the autonomy and authority of member states in respect of their health services.</p>

I invite my hon. Friends to oppose the amendment.</p>

 Following your instructions, Mrs. Heal, we will not reprise the debate about the business motion, but I cannot help but observe that yet again, three groups of amendments have not been touched at all. We therefore did not get a chance to discuss social policies, intellectual property, or economic and monetary policy. Again, this is not the line-by-line scrutiny that the Prime Minister promised the House.</p>

I remind the Minister that the Institute of Directors pointed out the strong similarities between the EU constitution and the treaty of Lisbon, and that 90 per cent. of members of the Federation of Small Businesses, which was polled internally because of concerns about the business implications of the treaty, said that they wanted to have a referendum. I put that to all on the Government Benches and to the Liberal Democrats.</p>

He said that the Commission had undertaken infraction proceedings against a French utility to break up a monopoly. He is right, but the Commission is doing so under the existing treaty base, so Lisbon is not necessary for that. I need to correct the hon. Gentleman on that.</p>

amendments in the constitution negotiations. We shall continue to do that, so that the British people understand the extent of the volte-face that has been carried out. Indeed, the Government&#146;s position this evening has been to criticise us for having the temerity to table an amendment very similar to one that they attempted to press some years ago, but failed. It is rather rich of them to criticise us for trying to put right what they did wrong.</p>

 Seven or so years ago, a Home Office Minister said in a parliamentary answer on the taskforce for child protection that the</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para11"><a name="080206110000541">Last year, however, 32 per cent. of children said that they had received unwanted, nasty or sexual comments while on the web. Freedom of information and the unhampered exchange of that information are, of course, at the heart of a free world. What we do not want is Government control of the internet, such as exists in China and elsewhere. The internet is a space for creativity, communication and a fantastic tool for use in education. Too often, any discussion of internet safety leads to the internet being labelled as a bad thing. Clearly, the reverse is the case, but internet users should expect a degree of protection not least from fraud and illegal content, and, for our children, from harmful content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para12"><a name="080206110000542">I start by paying tribute to the impressive work of Dr. Tanya Byron and her Byron review, and I look forward with interest to her recommendations. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee&#151;whose Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), is present&#151;is about to start taking oral evidence on this issue, and my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has put forward a private Member&#146;s Bill to classify video content downloads, in order to help protect children, among other things. So I believe that this subject is topical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para13"><a name="080206110000543">Tonight&#146;s debate takes on increasing relevance given the recent spate of suicides in Bridgend. Today, we awoke to the tragic news that there had been a 14th victim. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) has raised this in Parliament and has secured an Adjournment debate tomorrow, which I am sure will be well attended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para14"><a name="080206110000544">The Government have the option to make content illegal, as they have with extreme pornography, race hatred and child abuse. The Government also have a role to protect children, and that is what I want to focus on this evening. Schools&#146; hard-pressed IT departments do not have the resources, nor parents the know-how, to protect our children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para15"><a name="080206110000545">Another problem is that eight Government Departments have an interest in internet content: the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Health, the Foreign Office, the Cabinet Office, the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. There is a real lack of ownership within Government of internet content regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para16"><a name="080206110000546">The Government can solve that by establishing a lead Department and developing a co-regulatory structure to regulate internet content, bringing together, for example, charities, parents, academics, relevant Government Departments, law enforcement agencies and the industry  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 Feb 2008">

itself, to decide codes of conduct in grey areas. That could work along the lines of the Advertising Standards Authority or the Press Complaints Commission, and would replace the current piecemeal and knee-jerk codes of conduct and self-regulation; let us call it the &#147;internet standards authority&#148;. Harmful content&#151;that is content where cultural, taste and decency judgments have to be made&#151;would come under the internet standards authority remit and could include glorification of violence and terrorism, pornography, cyber-bullying, suicide, internet gambling and anorexia websites, some of which Members might think are worth banning. However, the list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para17"><a name="080206110000547">The internet standards authority would build a dynamic filter and create a blacklist database which would be updated hourly. Internet service providers would then offer two choices of content, one for adults and one for children. I envisage the child content would be the default, with adult content accessed with a pin code, or some such protective device. South Korea is an example of where that ISP regulatory system has been successfully implemented, and Australia is considering it. Further filtering could continue at the personal computer level &#147;on the fly&#148; which would look for unacceptable terms and images.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para18"><a name="080206110000548">Robust internet filtering is a technological area that is fast developing, although it is not there yet, which is why I believe ISPs should take the lead in filtering at the network level. I know the British Standards Institution is developing a kitemark, which is a welcome, if belated, development. Hopefully, technological progress will solve some of the issues that we cannot control now. Webcams and peer-to-peer and encrypted content will always present challenges. I do not intend to predict future technological innovations, but filtering web 2.2 generation content when, for example, eight hours of footage per minute is uploaded on to YouTube, will present challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para19"><a name="080206110000549">An internet standards authority would be more responsive to new internet trends and lighter on its feet than Government legislation. Perversely, ISPs are being held back from implementing best efforts to protect customers and children lest they be held liable for overblocking or for harmful content being accessed. A number of ISPs do offer content-filtering for children, such as AOL&#146;s KOL Jr. pre-school, KOL ages six to 12 and RED ages 13 to 17, and I welcome that, but ISPs are as concerned as I am about the low take-up of available tools. That is why I believe my opt-out approach has merit. An internet standards authority would have the ability to promote its work and improve transparency while also educating parents and ensuring that children surf responsibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="80206-0024.htm_para20"><a name="080206110000550">Promoting a safer environment and raising awareness&#151;what I describe as soft power improvements&#151;also present challenges and will cost money. Internet playgrounds should be supervised in the same way as parks used to be supervised. We need to empower parents and teachers so they are able to supervise, advise and guide children in exploring the online world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para0"><a name="080206110000551">We need to set up a new co-regulatory structure, an internet standards authority, to fight illegal and harmful content, promote a safer environment and raise awareness. ISPs should deliver an acceptable service for children whereby they would be able safely to access the internet while adults could access all other content through a PIN or similar device. We should  <br>

ensure that internet companies that advertise carry responsibility messages, such as those we see on alcohol advertising and cigarette packages. A hotline number in the UK is operated by the excellent Internet Watch Foundation, and it should be displayed. We need to empower parents, teachers and children in respect of their responsibilities and the risks of going online. Finally, any internet-ready platform should be sold with a robust, self-updating, tamper-proof internet filter pre-installed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para1"><a name="080206110000552">Those proposals are not about censorship; they are about creating the regulatory environment to enable our children to surf safely, so that they can expand the horizons of their knowledge. Of course, I do not believe we can remove all risk to children, but we can make this country a safer place in what, at times, seems to be an increasingly dangerous world for our children.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) on securing this important debate, and thank him for the measured way in which he put some important points to the House.

We all look forward to the work that it is going to do in an incredibly important area. In many respects, as soon as one moves forward in the virtual and internet world, one almost has to move forward again. This evening&#146;s debate, albeit short, will play an important part in continuing to raise awareness of this extremely important issue. I look forward to the Committee&#146;s inquiry and to the continuing dialogue that the hon. Member for East Devon doubtless wishes to take place. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to come to the Department to talk about these matters, that would be useful&#151;I extend that invitation to all those who wish to participate in such talks.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) made the valid point that there are many Departments involved in this issue. It appears that Dr. Byron is taking the lead in setting up her review, and that is being conducted mainly under the Department for Children, Schools and Families, supported by officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, so while I am delighted to see the Minister here this evening, I am slightly puzzled about why the Home Office is responding to the debate. Perhaps he could say something about how all these different Departments will work together.</p>

 I will address that issue, but as chair of the Home Secretary&#146;s taskforce for child protection on the internet I have worked with officials from many Departments, who come to the meetings and are involved in developing good practice and discussing the various issues. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is a new Department, with a particular emphasis on  <br>

preventing harm to children and protecting families, and that is one reason why the Byron review is being conducted under that Department. However, I have also met Dr. Byron, and will do so again, to talk about the work that we are doing. I know that she is especially interested in the way that the taskforce has taken the agenda forward. It has brought not only Departments together, but industry and children&#146;s charities&#151;those who have an interest in making progress in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para3"><a name="080206110000557">Whatever system we set up&#151;and the Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford may also consider that&#151;it is important to ensure that the work of Departments is co-ordinated and that we involve industry and stakeholders in the machinery of government. We will see over the next few weeks that that collaboration and co-operation has resulted in significant progress, without any debate about possible legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para4"><a name="080206110000558">The hon. Member for East Devon mentioned the terrible events in Bridgend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) has a debate on the issue tomorrow. She has already met with various people to discuss those events. I wish to extend my sympathy to the families and all those affected. However, the issues behind the deaths are likely to be very complicated. We are very much aware of some media reports claiming that there is an internet aspect to these incidents, but other reports cast doubt on that. It would be wrong to prejudge the investigations that are already taking place, and we will wish to follow further developments closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para5"><a name="080206110000559">We also recognise that young people will discuss many difficult issues, including that of suicide, on various websites. That requires very sensitive handling and we need to be wary of preventing them from discussing their thoughts and feelings openly. We are working, through the Home Secretary&#146;s taskforce for child protection on the internet, with social networking companies to ensure that there are links to support bodies such as ChildLine and the Samaritans for those who seek support and advice on this issue.</p>

While the internet remains a fantastic environment for obtaining all sorts of information, there is no doubt that it does have a darker side. Indeed, the Prime Minister has recently shown his concern about the issue of harmful and inappropriate content by setting up the Byron review. The Byron review team has been doing a lot of work to gather views from all stakeholders, and is due to report in March. The Home Office fully supports the review, and looks forward to seeing the final report. I have met with Dr. Byron and her team, as I said, and have been impressed by the work that they are doing&#151;indeed, one member of her team attended the most recent taskforce meeting&#151;and the approach that they are taking in working with all groups to look at the problems in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para8"><a name="080206110000562">There is no doubt that most of the time the internet is a safe place, and the Government have encouraged its use in schools and in the home. It therefore rightly falls on Government to help to develop a response to help protect our children and we have been active in that area. Since 2001, the Home Secretary&#146;s taskforce has been a very successful method of bringing together Departments, industry, law enforcement and charities to develop measures to help protect children from illegal content and sexual predators in the fast-moving world of technology and the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para9"><a name="080206110000563">The taskforce is periodically reviewing its membership and is eager to include all bodies involved in protecting children online. Indeed, cyber-bullying is a relatively new phenomenon and we are looking to widen the range of partners involved in the taskforce in order to look at the issue more closely. I look forward to meeting the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan), to discuss the matter in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para10"><a name="080206110000564">I would welcome further information from the hon. Member for East Devon on the South Korean model that he mentioned. That could be a good focus for the meeting that I suggested. If the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford wants to come to that meeting, I would be happy to hear in more detail about the points that he has made. I am not averse to learning from other countries. If they have something that might benefit us, we ought to try to learn from that. I will be happy to meet both hon. Gentlemen and to talk to them about that model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para11"><a name="080206110000565">I welcome the support that industry has given to the process, which I believe is an exceptionally useful method for tackling issues effectively and in a collaborative way through self-regulation and without the need for legislation. One of the major pieces of work that the taskforce has recently completed is the definition of a British Standards Institution specification for filtering tools for home users of the internet. Although filtering tools have been around for many years now, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness and their usability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para12"><a name="080206110000566">The new specification will allow the developers of filtering products to test them against the standard designed to protect children and other users from illegal or unsuitable content. That specification has been developed with the BSI, Ofcom and industry and will be launched in the near future. Companies whose products pass the tests will be able to display the child safety online kitemark on their products, allowing members of the public to identify them as having reached that standard. I want to encourage as many companies as possible that offer filtering products to the market to apply for the kitemark once it is launched. I am sure that we all hope that that will happen.</p>

agree that everything that can be done should be done to prevent the distribution of these images and to protect children from unwanted contact from predatory adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para14"><a name="080206110000568">The Internet Watch Foundation was funded and formed by the industry in 1996 following agreement between the Government, police and the internet industry that a partnership approach was needed to tackle the distribution of child sexual abuse images on the internet. The IWF operates the only authorised hotline in the UK for the public to report their inadvertent exposure to illegal content on the internet, providing a notice and take-down service to internet service providers in the UK so they can remove potentially illegal content from their servers. The IWF works closely with law enforcement agencies at home and abroad to help them trace offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para15"><a name="080206110000569">The IWF estimates that since 2003, less than 1 per cent. of child abuse image websites are hosted in the UK compared to 18 per cent. in 1996. We would all like that figure to be 0 per cent., but that shows considerable progress. In addition, the IWF has developed a service to provide a list of URLs where illegal images are hosted. That list, which has been made available to the industry, enables the sites containing child abuse images to be blocked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para16"><a name="080206110000570">Since 2004, blocking of these sites on consumer broadband in the UK has gone from nothing to 95 per cent., thanks to the work carried out by the industry. The Home Office is working with a number of smaller ISPs to identify ways that they can implement blocking economically. Once that has been done, the number of connections covered by blocking will rise further.</p>

<p><a name="st_o458"><a name="080206110000571"><a name="80206-0025.htm_spnew2"><a name="080206110001534"><b>Mr. Whittingdale:</b>
 The Minister is right that the IWF has done a great deal to tackle the problem of child pornography on the internet, but the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme a few weeks ago exposed the problem of paedophiles posing as young girls to access social networking sites. That enables them to find out information that they are then able post for almost anybody to see. What progress has been made in dealing with that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o459"><a name="080206110000572"><a name="80206-0025.htm_spnew3"><a name="080206110001535"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 One problem is that paedophiles will always try to find a way around our attempts to keep them out. The guidance on social networking that we will publish soon will look at what is good practice for ISPs in tackling that problem, but CEOP&#151;the child exploitation and online protection centre&#151;and other organisations are also taking the law enforcement approach. If the hon. Gentleman has not visited Jim Gamble and CEOP already, he should consider doing so, as that would enable him to see all the different types of work being undertaken. The people involved&#151;police officers, technical experts and others&#151;are very dedicated in their attempts to trap the paedophiles who use the internet in such a horrific way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para17"><a name="080206110000573">The work is hi-tech, because paedophiles who suspect that they have been traced tend to move on. Moreover, they have astonishing technical expertise in using the internet, and that can be countered only by people with matching ability. I am sure that anyone who sees what is being done by CEOP will be as impressed as I have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para18"><a name="080206110000574">Blocking is not an issue for personal computers only: with more and more children using mobile phones, and  <br>

with mobile phone technology growing exponentially, it is imperative that we engage with that part of the industry. All UK mobile phone providers are members of the Home Secretary&#146;s taskforce and have actively supported the development of good practice models. They are also members of the IWF and have agreed to block customer access to sites that the IWF has listed as containing illegal images of child abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para19"><a name="080206110000575">Mobile telephone operators in the UK have been pioneers in the protection of their child customers. They have shown that they take protecting children from inappropriate content very seriously, and they were the first in the world to publish a self-regulatory content code for mobiles. That requires customers to prove that they are at least 18 years of age before they can get access to adult commercial content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para20"><a name="080206110000576">As chair of the taskforce for child protection on the internet, I know how important it is to ensure that we remain ahead of the game when it comes to protecting children. I am proud of the taskforce&#146;s work: it has attracted interest from around the world, with many people asking how it operates. Since its inception, the taskforce has developed good practice guidance for web services, the internet, relay chat, safe searching and moderation services, but we all know that the internet keeps evolving. For example, very few of us had heard of social networking sites 18 months ago, but many millions of people now have profiles or web pages on such sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para21"><a name="080206110000577">A multi-stakeholder project group from the taskforce has been working on developing good practice guidance for social networking and user interactive services. Leading players in the industry&#151;and especially those involved in providing social networking services&#151;along with CEOP, the child protection charities and others have been involved in, and contributed to, the production of the good practice guidance. I am pleased to say that the document will be launched in the near future, and I should like to ask the hon. Members for East Devon and for Maldon and East Chelmsford to attend that event. I hope that they will be able to accept that invitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o529"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para22"><a name="080206110000578">As most hon. Members will be aware, CEOP was established in April 2006 to tackle the abuse and exploitation of children and young people, particularly from sexual predators who use the internet to distribute illegal images of children and young people, and to gain access to them so that they can be groomed for abuse. Staffed by the police, as well as child protection, education and industry specialists, the centre provides a single online 24-hour-a-day mechanism for reporting those who seek to use the internet to abuse children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para23"><a name="080206110000579">On a point that the hon. Member for East Devon raised, CEOP launched and ran an education programme, which last year reached 1.1 million children and their parents. He made the important point that we must educate not only children, but parents, so that they understand what their children can do on the internet. I am sure he, like me, finds that when he talks to parents, they sometimes have a much more limited understanding of the virtual world than their children do. We all have a big role to play in trying to help parents understand what is possible on the internet, so that they can work with their children to try to protect them, although the state must do its bit, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para24"><a name="080206110000580">As I say, CEOP works with parents, and it plans to ensure that a further 3.5 million children are reached over the next two years, and that every primary school is provided with free resources. It also runs the thinkuknow website for children, parents and teachers. Since CEOP began operating in April 2006, some 240 offenders have been arrested, three paedophile rings have been smashed, and 138 children have been rescued from harm. That is a major achievement for UK law enforcement, and the creation of CEOP makes it clear that we are determined to protect children in the digital environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para25"><a name="080206110000581">Today&#146;s children are sophisticated users of the internet, and their knowledge of it is ever-evolving, but we should never forget that they are children. Protecting them must therefore continue to be one of our priorities. The fact that the work is about protecting children in our communities can often get lost in all the technology issues. A collaborative approach to tackling the issue is essential if we are to prevent the exploitation of children on the internet. By working together with industry, Government, law enforcement agencies, children&#146;s charities and other interested parties, the taskforce has made progress in protecting children online. However, I recognise that there is always more to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="80206-0025.htm_para26"><a name="080206110000582">I welcome the Byron review, and I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s debate. I look forward to meeting him, and perhaps the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, to discuss the subject, and in particular the Korean model that the hon. Member for East Devon presented to us. We can discuss that and many other matters, while we all pursue our common goal of doing all that we can to protect our children on the internet.</p>
