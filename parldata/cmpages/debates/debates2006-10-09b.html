Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Mr. Shaun Woodward):</b> Officials from the Home
Office, the Department of Trade and Industry and my Department met
representatives of the publishers, wholesalers and retailers of
magazines and newspapers earlier this year to discuss this issue. As a
result, the trade associations issued guidelines reminding members of
the need to exercise common sense in deciding how to display material
intended for
adults.</p><p><a name="06100913000044"><b><a name="_spnew2"><a name="06100913001061">Mrs.
Curtis-Thomas:</b> My hon. Friend will be aware that earlier
this year I introduced a ten-minute Bill that called for a ban on the
sale of sexually explicit material to children. Despite huge public
support for that request, the response from WH Smith was to issue a
notice that such material may still be displayed at1.2 m,
which is the height of the average seven-year-old. Given that the
industry appears incapable of regulating itself, will my hon. Friend
consider meeting me and child-centred agencies to talk about what we
can do to prohibit the sale of such material to
children?</p><p><a name="06100913000045"><b><a name="_spnew3"><a name="06100913001062">Mr.
Woodward:</b> First, may I congratulate my hon. Friend on
bringing this important issue to the attention of the House? Both sides
will agree that self-regulation is always preferable to Government
regulation. We saw a good example of that with the video games industry
two or three years ago. A problem was drawn to its attention and it
responded by changing methodsof classification and dealing
with retailers. My Department is consulting on the issue that my hon.
Friend rightly raises, and I hope that she and other hon. Members who
wish to lobby on the issue will provide more evidence. It is
appropriate to encourage the industry to self-regulate. I have now seen
some of the content in question and it is clearly preposterous to
suggest that placing the material at a height of 1.2 m is an adequate
safeguard.</p><p><a name="06100913000046"><b><a name="_spnew4"><a name="06100913001063">Angela

newsagents would happily consign it to the top

best, on the top shelf and probably not in any newsagent. It is
important that the House takes the matter seriously and that we consult

gamblers. That is a low proportion and we intend to keep it that way.
The Gambling Commission&#146;s next prevalence study is under way and
will report in September 2007, to coincide with the introduction of the
Gambling Commission. The figure for problem gambling in that report
will provide the benchmark against which further judgments will be
made. We intend that the Gambling Act 2005 will introduce the most
protective regime in the world, with the key aim of protecting the
vulnerable and children from the risks of gambling. It is worth
underlining the extent to which the Gambling Commission and I, as
Secretary of State, will have unprecedented powers to intervene in how
gambling is run to minimise harm, protect children and keep the levels
of problem gambling

charity for gambling-related counselling has increased by 41.3 per

0.6 per cent. in her answer. Does that mean that 250,000 to 350,000
people have gambling problems? Therefore, has she not presided, perhaps
irresponsibly, over an enormous explosion in problem
gambling?</p><p><a name="06100913000055"><b><a name="06100913001071">Tessa
Jowell:</b> Not at all. The figure that I quoted of 0.6 per

from the 2000 prevalence study. It is time to update the figure,
because new technologies mean that more people are gambling. It is

have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world, and we
intend to keep it that way? That is not in any way to diminish the
suffering of those people and families for whom gambling becomes a
problem. However, the list of measures includes, from September next
year, the removal of 6,000 machines from unregulated premises such as
minicab offices and fish-and-chip shops, to protect children from the
risks of addiction to fruit machines. The Gambling Commission will have
powers to oversee and to control the rate and frequency of play,
stakes, and access to gaming machines which, as we know, can be a
source of addiction. In particular,&#163;3 million a year
will be levied from the industry to support services for people who
become addicted. Such work will be undertaken through the good offices
of GamCare and the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, which is chaired
by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). In addition,
at the end of the month, we will host an international summit that will
look at the exponential increase in online gambling. I therefore hope
that the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) will
take comfort from the measures that the Government have put in place to

increased gambling opportunities online.</p><br>

have a problem are properly protected and that there is no scope for
exploitation, fraud or any of the other detriment that will harm people
and undermine the objectives of our policy. We certainly ban internet

position is a judgment for the Treasury. It may be that in other

convenience stores that have alcohol licences and which are found
guilty of selling alcohol to people under the age of 16? There is
growing concern about the matter in my constituency. The minimum fine
is too low. If it were raised to &#163;2,000, so that a store could
opt to go to a magistrates court and risk a higher fine, the measure
would become more self-policing and we would be more effective in
stopping young people gaining access to

not. I am absolutely confident that the Gambling Commission and the

by which the pilot scheme will be judged a success or failure. Is not
the reason that the Minister and his Department have already decided
that they want more super-casinos, and will use any excuse to increase
the number? The Minister said in an earlier answer that this matter
would be brought before Parliament by the casino advisory panel, but he
should be aware that, under clause 175 of the 2005 Act, the Secretary
of State has the right to increase the number. Will the Minister take

a success, he needs to keep on going. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the
Government proposed eight regional casinos and the proposal was in
wash-up before the last general election. The Conservatives decided to
come back with the proposal of one regional casino, which we accepted
because we wanted to get the Bill on to the statute book in order to
protect the vulnerable in our society. That is where it now

a satisfactory form. My hon. Friend makes a fair point, as a
considerable number of accounting units have not reported on time.
However, the Electoral Commission takes the view that it is appropriate
to have a sense of proportion about this, and that the criminal
penalties available in legislation are disproportionate. The commission
has the option either of reprimanding the accounting unit or of seeking
to impose a criminal sanction against the treasurer, who will often be
an untrained amateur. The commission has therefore made recommendations
for a more enforceable scheme, and its review is expected to report in

In the second by-election, the number of polling stations was halved

applied in the Wellingborough district council area. Portakabins were
initially used and subsequently found to be inappropriate as regards
access for the disabled, and the presence of a contractor outside one
of the polling stations required using only one door instead of two.
That may have had some special influence. I can assure my hon. Friend
that the Electoral Administration Act 2006 requires local authorities

Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Alan
Johnson):</b> With permission, Mr. Speaker, I
should like to make a statement on the children in care Green Paper,
which I have published today. Copies have been placed in the House of
Commons Library. At the heart of the Green Paper lies one simple
presumption: that the aspirations of the state for children in care
should match those that each parent has for their own children. Right
hon. and hon. Members recognise that moral imperative, and I should
like to pay tribute to the associate parliamentary group on children in
and leaving care, and in particular to my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford (Mr. Kidney), for highlighting many of the issues
that the Green Paper seeks to resolve. They have vociferously pointed
out that this area has received too little attention for too
long.</p><p><a name="06100913000168">We
know the depressing statistics. Children in care are five times less
likely to achieve five good GCSEs, and nine times more likely to be
expelled from school. One quarter of people in prison today have spent
some time in our care system. This Government have introduced a number
of measures to try to address the complex problems of children in care.
Since 1997, we have invested almost &#163;1 billion in the quality
protects initiative to improve outcomes for children in care. We have
taken steps to encourage adoption instead of care, and we have placed a
duty on local authorities to improve educational outcomes for this
specific group of children. However, this has clearly not been enough.
</p><p><a name="06100913000169">Today&#146;s Green
Paper builds on those efforts and the implementation of &#147;Every
Child Matters&#148;, which for the first time provides the
infrastructure to deal with this issue in a co-ordinated way. The first
priority must be to prevent children from slipping into care when there
are family alternatives. We must take effective pre-emptive and
preventive action, so that no child can be sucked into the system by
default. If there is a chance that a child can be safely restored to a
healing family environment, we must take it. We will trial a new kind
of intensive family therapy to address parents&#146; problems while
ensuring that children are more than just helpless bystanders. We will
seek to get to the heart of the domestic problems, tackling the most
difficult situations of abuse, neglect or violence with a mix of
conciliation and targeted care. To raise our knowledge of what works in
this new area, we will create a national centre of excellence to share
experience and knowledge.</p><p><a name="06100913000170">Secondly, the care system must
act more likea traditional loving family, with all the extra
responsibility that that implies. The fact that a child is in care does
not mean that he or she should be deprived of the emotional support and
development that most children, thankfully, can rely on. The state must
ensure that children are always in the best hands, constantly supported
by continuous guidance and motivation, investing in their futures and
shaping their decisions.</p><p><a name="06100913000171">The care profession already
comprises many dedicated, experienced professionals. However, we need
to ensure that all carers reach the standard of the best. We will begin
a round of specially tailored recruitment campaigns. We will also take
steps to match foster

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 22</b><br>carers with children more intelligently, fitting the complex needs of
the child with the specialised skills of the carer. A new, tiered
framework of qualifications, payments and standards will be used to
steer these difficult decisions. By taking more trouble to get it right
first time, we will avoid children being bounced from placement to
placement, which is so damaging to them personally and disruptive to
their
studies.</p><p><a name="06100913000172">Thirdly,
we must ensure that children in care receive an excellent education.
Results have steadily improved for children in care, but still nine out
of 10 do not achieve five good GCSEs. To ensure that they benefit from
access to sport, music and drama, which instil cultural values and
equip them with social capital, we will encourage local authorities to
open their sports centres and leisure clubs to children in care free of
charge.</p><p><a name="06100913000173">Social workers
will receive budgets to spend on the personal needs of each child,
allowing them the flexibility to find money quickly when a child needs
extra support such as speech or language
therapy.</p><p><a name="06100913000174">We
will appoint a new&#151;a dreadful phrase, I know, Mr.
Speaker&#151;virtual head teacher, who will, I reassure Members, be a
real person, in every area, with overarching responsibility for driving
up results among local children in care. We will guarantee catch-up
lessons. With the passage of the Education and Inspections Bill, we
will also require schools to take in children in care, even if the
school is full, so children are elevated to the best schools rather
than dumped in the
worst.</p><p><a name="06100913000175">We will do more
to prevent children in care from being excluded. Nothing is more
damaging to a child&#146;s chances of success than moving school
after theyhave made their GCSE choices. Children who change
school after year 10 drop around one and a half grades per subject, so
eight C grades become four D and four E grades. We will therefore
create a presumption that children in care will not move schools in
years 10and
11.</p><p><a name="06100913000176">When children have
to move home, we will do all that we can to avoid them moving school as
well. We have proposed that, in such circumstances, and where
practicable, children in care will get free transport to their existing
school rather than move to a new
one.</p><p><a name="06100913000177">Fourthly, we need
to ensure that children leave care in a measured way. Too often,
children in care feel that the system spits them out on their 16th
birthday. Only6 per cent. make it to university, compared with
38 per cent. of their peer group. We must ensure that children get a
soft landing when they leave the system, particularly during those
crucial years when decisions are made about their
future.</p><p><a name="06100913000178">We will give
every child in care a right to decide when they leave the system and
the chance to stay with their foster families up to the age of 21, or
longer if they are continuing in education. We will establish a new
&#163;2,000 bursary to encourage them to attend university, and we
will also put an extra &#163;100 into their child trust fund for
every year they spend in
care.</p><p><a name="06100913000179">Parenting is a
weighty responsibility and institutions need to be held accountable,
just as individuals would be. Every local authority will be subject to
regular children in care inspections by Ofsted. My Department will make
it a specific priority to improve the academic performance of children
in care, and Ministers will hold an annual stock-take to review
progress.</p><br>

from Members on both sides of the House, but particularly from those
who have been in care and the dedicated professionals who work in this
area, day in and day out. They are not to blame for the collective
failure that this report highlights: we
are.</p><p><a name="06100913000182">We need to
provide a more co-ordinated approach to these entrenched issues,
ensuring that our care system is focused less on systems and more on
care. These children are our responsibility. We cannot continue to fail
them.</p><p><a name="06100913000183"><b><a name="_spnew60"><a name="06100913001176">Mr.
David Willetts (Havant) (Con):</b> We welcome the statement,
as the evidence on the plight of our cared-for children is deeply
shocking. Fifty-four per cent. of them fail to get a single
qualification from school. Twenty-five per cent. of people in prison
were children in care. The system is letting down the nation&#146;s
children in the greatest need.</p><p><a name="06100913000184">The Secretary
of State paid tribute to the all-party group. We should also pay
tribute to the work of organisations such as Barnardo&#146;s, the NCH
and <i> The Times Educational Supplement</i> in helping to keep up the
pressure to tackle this problem. Over the past 10 years, various
attempts have been made to tackle it: initiatives such as
&#147;quality protects&#148;, public spending up
to&#163;1.9 billion, and targets. I remind the Secretary of
State of the target set in 2002:</p><a name="brev_2"><a name="06100913001032"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to substantially narrow the gap
between the educational attainment and participation of children in
care and that of their peers by
2006.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000185">That was supposed
to mean that no more than 10 per cent. should reach school-leaving age
without having sat a GCSE. In 2005, however, 36 per cent. of children
in care left school without having sat a single GCSE. Sadly, the
Government&#146;s targets have not been met, and, despite the
increases in public expenditure, the problem persists, as the Secretary
of State openly acknowledged.</p><p><a name="06100913000186">We therefore
welcome many of the Secretary of State&#146;s further proposals
today. Is he confident, however, that there is the capacity to deliver
the initiatives? Initiatives are endlessly brought to the House, but
all too often there is not the organisation and resource to make them
happen. Is he confident that local authorities, which, in reality, will
bear the brunt of many of his proposed initiatives, have the capacity
to deliver them? Is he aware of what is nothing less than a crisis in
the recruitment of social workers, with a 10 per cent. shortage in
London and the south-east? It is all too easy to kick social workers,
and blame them, but the initiatives he describes will work only if we
have more social workers. We should not be kicking and blaming social
workers; we need to recruit more. We also have a shortage of 10,000

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 24</b><br>foster carers. With such a shortage, how can we deliver his initiatives?
We need that capacity, and we heard nothing from him today about how
that will be achieved.</p><p><a name="06100913000187">I am sure that the Secretary of
State is right about the need to enable children to stay on longer in
care if possible. Will he admit that another example of
well-intentioned initiatives going wrong is the Government&#146;s
Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000? It has become part of the problem,
creating a perverse incentive for local authorities to get children out
of care early, so that they do not have to write cumbersome pathway
plans. That is the regrettable and unpredicted effect of his
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100913000188">I must
admit to the Secretary of State that I am not quite sure&#151;and I
do not know if he knows&#151;what a virtual head teacher is. I very
much look forward to him telling us. I think of it in a simple and
practical way. Who will take responsibility for turning up at
parents&#146; evening to ask how a child in care is doing? Will it be
the social worker or the new virtual head teacher? If, as a result of
his proposals, there is even more confusion about that, we will have
gone backwards rather than forwards.</p><p><a name="06100913000189">There are also some wider
issues. Many children in care have troubled and chaotic lives, and many
of them have come from families with troubled and chaotic lives. All
too often, Government schemes, instead of providing some stability and
security, have mirrored the chaos and confusion from which many of
those children have suffered. It is so important that they have more
stability.</p><p><a name="06100913000190">If
the Secretary of State&#146;s proposals do indeed mean fewer school
moves and fewer different placements for a child in care, we will
certainly support them. However, I should be grateful if he explained
how he will ensure greater continuity of education when we know that
the average move to a new placement involves a journey of 20 miles. If
he is to provide more specialist placements, how can he be confident
that they will be nearby, and how can we be confident that a child will
retain contacts with neighbourhood and
family?</p><p><a name="06100913000191">The Secretary
of State will of course recognise that even when a child is moved out
of its immediate family, there might be members of the extended family
who can take some responsibility for it. As we know from his
extraordinary personal experience, the Secretary of State was not in
care because members of his family were willing to help him. Is he
aware that extended family members sometimes feel that social workers
are excluding them from decisions about the child&#146;s future? I
have heard from grandparents, for example, who wished to be involved in
fostering or even adopting a child, and who feel that social workers
have ignored the opportunity that they could have provided. Will more
be done in that
regard?</p><p><a name="06100913000192">The statement
is welcome. If the state is to take on the enormous responsibility of
caring for children, it must try its best to match the commitment,
stability and emotional support that a family can provide. If the
proposals that the Secretary of State has announced will achieve those
objectives, we will support
them.</p><p><a name="06100913000193"><b><a name="06100913001177">Alan

that the evidence is shocking, and absolutely right to say that the
problem persists. I have

this is our responsibility, we are in government, I am the Secretary of
State, and the buck stops
here.</p><p><a name="06100913000194">We must measure
what is happening to children in care, and until the late 1990s there
was very little such measurement. The quality protects initiative,
which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, invested some &#163;1 billion in
additional funds, and some of the statistics have improved; but an
increase from 7 per cent. to 11 per cent. in the number of children
gaining five GCSEs is not good enough. There is no need for any
party-political points to be made. I should like to think that Members
in all parts of the House, and certainly the hon. Member for Havant
(Mr. Willetts), are determined to tackle the
problem.</p><p><a name="06100913000195">That brings
me to the issue of capacity. The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned
social workers. We are already involved in a project called
&#147;options for excellence&#148;, which aims to give social
workers the right professional status, reduce wastage rates and ensure
that social workers continue to work with children. It is rather like
some of what we tried to do for teachers in the 1990s. An interim
report has already been published, and the final report should be
published shortly. We certainly do not want to stigmatise social
workers, which is why I have gone out of my way to say that the
problems we face in relation to children in care are not the fault of
the dedicated professionals who work with them day in, day
out.</p><p><a name="06100913000196">We need to
consider whether we should give foster carers a salary. That is a
specific proposal in the Green Paper. Another is the proposal for three
tiers of social workers: one to deal with the least difficult cases,
then another, and a top tier dealing with the most difficult problems
and receiving the support, training and salary that will enable them to
do that.</p><p><a name="06100913000197">I do not
agree that the Children (Leaving Care)Act 2000 has made no
difference. The statistics show that there are still too many children
in care who are not in employment, education or training, but the
figure of 46 per cent. before the Act was introduced now stands at 59
per cent., so there has been an improvement of 13 percentage
points.</p><p><a name="06100913000198">The hon.
Gentleman challenged me to define a virtual head teacher. I will have a
go. The idea is for a local education authority to employ
someone&#151;most likely a retired head teacher or a head teacher who
has moved on to other employment&#151;who will do the job for the
whole authority. That person will cross school boundaries to ensure
that children in care are being properly looked after and dealt with in
the school system.</p><p><a name="06100913000199">The point about parents&#146;
evenings&#151;a poignant point that I believe features in the Green
Paper&#151;was made by a child in care, who said, &#147;Nobody
turns up on my parents&#146; evening; there is nobody there.&#148;
We want to ensure that someone is there. If the child in care has a
foster carer, the foster parent should be there&#151;and most foster
parents would agree that that is part of being a foster parent. If the
child is based in an institution, his or her social worker should be
present. That is all very much part of the plans that we have set
out.</p><br>

idea&#151;I believe that it emerged some years ago under the previous
Government&#151;can be made to work more effectively and it also
connects with our ideas about advocacy. The problem with children in
care not having a lead professional to look after them can be tackled
in a number of ways.</p><p><a name="06100913000201">The penultimate point is about
stability, and I agree with the hon. Member for Havant that it is the
key word. If there is a mantra that runs through it all, it is
stability. We have to get the placements right in the first place,
which is part of the tiered approach. Part of the reason why children
move around so much is the fact that the original placement could have
been handled better and dealt with more
intelligently.</p><p><a name="06100913000202">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s final point was about members of the family and
social workers. It is right to look carefully into that. Social workers
should not be in a position whereby the extended family cannot convince
them about the care that they could provide. Children themselves are
sometimes old enough and able to articulate their views and legislation
already contains the presumption that the child&#146;s views should
not only be heard, but taken into account, yet that does not seem to be
happening. All those points need to be addressed. I accept that, as
with other Green Papers, many other ideas will emerge as the
consultation proceeds.</p><p><a name="06100913000203"><b><a name="_spnew61"><a name="06100913001178">Ann
Coffey (Stockport) (Lab):</b> As my right hon. Friend says,
early intervention in children&#146;s lives is crucial to prevent
them from coming into care in the first place. What can make a
difference is good quality child care from birth, which some parents
cannot provide on their own. Does the Secretary of State agree that, in
implementing the Childcare Act 2006, it is important for families where
children are at risk that free and good-quality child care is available
in children&#146;s centres to support non-working parents and to
improve children&#146;s early-life
care?</p><p><a name="06100913000204"><b><a name="06100913001179">Alan
Johnson:</b> My hon. Friend&#151;my young hon.
Friend&#151;is absolutely right. One of the problems identified in
the Green Paper is the availability of child care, but it is also
important to ensure that foster carers are aware of Sure Start and
children&#146;s centres. We are having some problems ensuring that
Sure Start gets through to the most difficult-to-reach groups, which is
an important element of the question.</p><p><a name="06100913000205"><b><a name="_spnew62"><a name="06100913001180">Sarah
Teather (Brent, East) (LD):</b> May I begin by welcoming the
Green Paper and thanking the Secretary of State for the tone of his
statement? It deals with an area where Government policy has failed in
the past, but I want to pay tribute to the Secretary of State&#146;s
personal commitment to tackling the issue. There is much good news in
the Green Paper and I want to acknowledge it before questioning the
Secretary of State
further.</p><p><a name="06100913000206">I
wholeheartedly welcome the announcement in the Green Paper that the
designated teacher is to be put on a statutory footing&#151;a matter
that he did not mention in his statement but which appears in the Green

announcement that young people will be able to remain with their foster
family until they are 21. Many young people in care have had a

complete their studies. The extension of fostering recognises that and
the fact that care in a family setting does not normally end at 16.
Similarly, I want to welcome the increased emphasis on academic
achievement of young people in care, through priority in admissions and
bursaries for
university.</p><p><a name="06100913000207">Surely,
however, one way to encourage schools to take young people who may
struggle is to target money on the pupil. Why have the Government not
adopted a pupil premium to ensure that schools can provide the extra
help that vulnerable young people need? Will the Secretary of State
confirm that the new requirement on schools to prioritise admissions of
looked-after children will apply throughout the school year and not
just at the
beginning?</p><p><a name="06100913000208">I welcome
the proposals for training and salaries for foster
carers&#151;something that we have called for some time. I also
welcome the acknowledgment that too often potential carers from within
the family are overlooked. Are the Government looking at better
allowances for kinship care? When placements change, the only stable
figure is often the social worker. What are the Government doing to
ensure that there is less churn of appointed social workers for
individual
children?</p><p><a name="06100913000209">The Green
Paper announces that the Government will encourage councils to provide
free leisure activities for young people. Will the extra money be
provided to councils to ensure that that is possible, even where
services have been outsourced to another provider? Will the Secretary
of State confirm that the extended schools programme will be available
free of charge to looked-after children? Do the Government have any
plans to reintroduce the programme that provided foster homes with a
home
computer?</p><p><a name="06100913000210">Finally, one
of the greatest tragedies of looked-after children is, as the Secretary
of State acknowledged, the fact that so many, so early in their lives,
find themselves on the wrong side of the law. It is perhaps ironic that
immediately after this statement there will be another one on
overcrowding in prisons. Let us hope that this Green Paper marks a new
chapter for some of the most vulnerable in our
society.</p><p><a name="06100913000211"><b><a name="06100913001181">Alan

her welcome for many parts of the report. I shall pick out the issues
that she raised when she went beyond praise, and important issues they
are. The first was the issue of targeting money on individuals. The
whole problem of children in care is that there are so few of them that
they do not register on the system. Part of the idea behind the virtual
head teacher and Ofsted inspecting every school in the local area every
three years is to ensure that children in care do register. I do not
think that this is an issue about finances. Martin Narey, the chairman
of Barnardo&#146;s, made it clear this morning that, unlike most
political issues with which he has dealt, this is an issue about
systems rather than finance. That is at the core of the problem in
terms of the help that we give to children in schools.</p><br>

the idea that if there is an opportunity to use a family member to

the current work on social workers&#146; pay and conditions. We must
look at how social workers can bid for work, with the local authority

dedicated to looking after children but too often are diverted on to
paperwork and bureaucracy. If social workers can continue to do what
they want it will help with churn.</p><p><a name="06100913000214">The issues of home computers

I will raise it, just as we have raised the issue about foster carers

adverse effect on any benefits to which they are entitled. This issue
needs to be discussed across Government, which is why the Green Paper

Ann Widdecombe (Maidstone and The Weald) (Con):</b> I welcome
many of the changes that the Secretary of State has announced, but it
is one thing to enable and another to motivate. I talked recently to a
foster mother who has fostered several children and who told me that
when they reach 16 she advises them to stay on for sixth form and to be
aspirational. However, along comes a social worker who tells them that
now they are 16 they are entitled to independent accommodation and
various benefits. It is not realistic to expect the degree of maturity
required to choose education and pocket money over what looks like
immediate independence. Can the Secretary of State assure me that the
presumption will be that children will stay on, instead of the false
motivation to leave education at
16?</p><p><a name="06100913000220"><b><a name="06100913001187">Alan

foster carers past 18. It is no good talking about the importance of
listening to the child if they are insistent on moving away, but if we
can get the motivational aspects right, we can create the climate in
which the child can make a more mature decision, assisted by a social
worker whom they have grown to trust because they have not been chopped
and changed every five minutes. If we can achieve that, it will lead to
different decisions being made by the
child.</p><p><a name="06100913000221"><b><a name="_spnew66"><a name="06100913001188">Mr.

ensure that alongside the theme of stability that runs through the

everybody who deals with the children and young people in that
vulnerable group, and of listening to them? In the associate

need to listen to the child and what they think that the state and
local authorities should do, because that is crucial to the whole
exercise. The Green Paper will involve our talking to children in care
now, and going into prisons&#151;I say that in front of my right hon.

on a very small scale because of the size of the centre&#146;s

look after those children is a delicate, important task. They need
specialist training and appropriate reimbursement, but they also need a

would be a particular part of that. There is the entitlement to a level

has a sum of money that they can use rather than having to go through a

those from the music profession for providing children in care with
free music lessons. Proportionately, only very few children are in
care&#151;about 0.5 per cent. of the child population&#151;so those

Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid):</b>
With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a
statement updating the House on developments in the prison population
over the summer recess, and setting out the steps that I am taking to
ensure the necessary prison capacity now and in the
future.</p><p><a name="06100913000235">The Government
have kept and will continue tokeep our commitment to tackling
crime&#151;reducing it by 35 per cent. in nine years&#151;and
tackling the causes of crime. We have 2.5 million more jobs, the lowest
level of unemployment for decades, 1,000 Sure Start centres and a
significant reduction in social deprivation&#151;attention to the
early years of life, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Education and Skills has just outlined. We shall continue that
commitment to tackling both crime and the causes of
crime.</p><p><a name="06100913000236">Public
protection has always been our first priority. We have consistently
supported tougher sentences in the course of protecting the public.
Even today, in another place, we are tabling an amendment to the
Violent Crime Reduction Bill to increase sentencesfor those
caught in possession of blades or sharp instruments. That has been a
constant message over the past decade and has been reflected in the
growth in the proportion of people sent to prison and in the increase
in the length of time for which they have been imprisoned&#151;in
short, making the sentence and the punishment fit the crime more
appropriately.</p><p><a name="06100913000237">To
match that growth we have already built more than 16,000 prison places
in nine years&#151;approximately the same amount as the previous
Conservative Government built in 18 years. Labour has built at twice
the rate of the Conservatives. However, I have never hidden from the
House our continuing need for more prison places to keep pace with the
requirement.</p><p><a name="06100913000238">In July,
I published the document &#147;Rebalancing the criminal justice
system in favour of the law-abiding majority&#148;, in which I said
that</p><a name="brev_3"><a name="06100913001033"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we will now build
an additional 8,000 places and will keep under close review whether
more are needed&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000239">That
was set out in terms in the document. I said,
too:</p><a name="brev_4"><a name="06100913001034"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
already have an additional 900 places under construction which are due
to come onstream in Autumn
2007.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000240">I also
said:</p><a name="brev_5"><a name="06100913001035"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
continue to imprison too many non-dangerous people with mental health
problems who should be more effectively diverted into appropriate
treatments at an early
stage.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000241">I
said:</p><a name="brev_6"><a name="06100913001036"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will
focus prison places for remand prisoners on those with the highest risk
of re-offending. And we will work with the Lord Chief Justice and
sentencers to ensure probation resources are targeted on those who most
need them.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000242">Of course,
hon. Members will have studied carefully and remembered those words. I
remind the House of them in view of the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s
remarks at the weekend. That remains my framework for addressing these
issues in the medium term. However, it is the case that in the short
term the prison population has risen sharply over the summer period and
today stands 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 33</b><br>at 79,819. I want to highlight two factors among others that
specifically contributed to that increase over the summer and during
the year.</p><p><a name="06100913000243">First, the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 is beginning to have a real effect. The House
will know that the Act introduced tough new
sentences&#151;indeterminate sentences&#151;to answer the public
demand that life, where appropriate, should truly mean life for those
judged to be a danger to the public. It also introduced more flexible
community orders which would be a more effective alternative to prison
for lower level offenders. The evidence so far is that our courts are
making good use of indeterminate sentences so that dangerous people are
staying in prison for longer, but they are not yet using community
orders as fully as they might. That was the point emphasised this
weekend by the Lord Chief Justice. That leads to increased pressure on
prison places above that anticipated in the short
term.</p><p><a name="06100913000244">Secondly, I made
a commitment to the House to consider, find and detain as many of the
previously unconsidered 1,013 foreign national prisoners as we could.
In addition, I made a further commitment: I said that we would not
release those foreign national prisoners who ought to be considered for
deportation before such consideration had been completed andwe
would continue to detain them until that wasdone. Working
through that process of dealing withthe backlog while
maintaining the deportation consideration for everyone who is released
from prison will obviously contribute towards a higher prison
population until the position is fully resolved. I shall return to
details of that later in my
statement.</p><p><a name="06100913000245">I want now
to set out some of the actions that have been recommended to me since
July to alleviate the pressure and my response. It has been proposed to
me that I should agree to the early release of prisoners into the
community. I have considered that carefully, but I do not believe that
it is appropriate at this time and I have rejected it. My view is that
it should be used only in the last resort. I have, however, accepted
the recommendations of the prison authorities in a number of other
ways: first, in the re-roling of two women&#146;s prisons to take
male prisoners, which is a sensibleuse of resources; secondly,
in providing maximum flexibility within the prison estate to allow
transfers to the open estate under severe restrictions in addition to
those transferred as a matter of course. That measure was focused on
lower risk offenders serving short sentences for non-sexual or
non-violent offences. Prisoners have been transferred only after
careful risk
assessment.</p><p><a name="06100913000246">Thirdly,
we will improve processes for dealing with foreign national prisoners.
I hope that by the spring of 2007 we will reach the position where the
consideration of deportation for all foreign nationals will begin six
months before the end of their sentences. We are making steady progress
towards that as we deal with the backlog. That would ensure a reduced
requirement for detention after the normal release date and therefore a
reduced pressure on the prison
population.</p><p><a name="06100913000247">Fourthly,
I have today accepted the recommendation to implement the formal use of
police cells, known as Operation Safeguard. Implementation will be on
Thursday 12 October. The use of Safeguard is not ideal, but it is tried
and it is tested. I am extremely grateful for the 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 34</b><br>support that we have received from the Association of Chief Police
Officers and from individual chief constables, as well from the
Metropolitan police. Those measures should help to alleviate the
position in the short term.</p><p><a name="06100913000248">In addition to that, I can
today tell the House that on top of the medium and long-term proposals
that I set out in our July plans and to which I referred earlier, I am
also developing further measures. Specifically, we are in negotiations
and consultation to convert a former Army barracks into prisoner
accommodation. Similarly, we are in negotiations to utilise a former
secure hospital in Ashworth East near Liverpool. We are expanding our
immigration estate by 300 places by March 2007 and by a further 400
places by 2008, and we are exploring further innovative ways of
extending immigration detention capacity for those who are detained as
a result of immigration considerations, thus releasing pressure on the
prison estate. We will, of course, continue to work closely with the
private sector to get the best of what it can offer us, and we are
continuing to encourage the courts to make effective use of bail,
taking advantage of electronic tagging and alternative
accommodation.</p><p><a name="06100913000249">I have
also agreed an additional package of measures to improve the processing
of foreign national prisoners. The immigration and nationality
directorate has been taking
a</p><p><a name="06100913000250">robust approach to the
deportation of European economic area nationals, which has been
defeated consistently in the courts. We will be changing the law to
strengthen the link between criminality and deportation, but in the
meantime we are no longer taking unproductive cases to the courts at
the taxpayers&#146; expense, with negative results. We are
introducing an incentive scheme to persuade prisoners to return
voluntarily to their own country. As we have always treated Irish
citizens in a way which reflected the close historical, community and
political ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the
existence of the common travel area, we are considering treating those
citizens as a special case. In addition, the director general of the
immigration and nationality directorate, Lin Homer, is writing to the
Home Affairs Committee today to provide a further breakdown of the
progress made on the 1,013 prisoners released without consideration of
deportation, and I will arrange for a copy of that to go into the
Library of the
House.</p><p><a name="06100913000251">Finally, in the
longer term, we have already outlined plans for a prisons building
programme for 8,000 places by 2012, and what is required beyond that
will be given further consideration. We have also outlined plans for
the greater use of community sentences, a scheme for payback to the
community, and the rehabilitation of prisoners. I hope the measures
that I have taken will alleviate the pressure in the short term and
will complement the measures that I outlined to the House in my
statement in July. I commend the measures to the
House.</p><p><a name="06100913000252"><b><a name="_spnew73"><a name="06100913001201">David

I cannot say the same of the Government&#146;s sorry handling of the
crisis in our prison system. There is no excuse for the catastrophe
facing the country.</p><p><a name="06100913000256">In the past
five years, the Government have received warning after warning that
they were going to run out of cells&#151;warnings from the
Opposition, from the Prison Reform Trust, from their own advisers, and
even from the chief inspector of prisons. In 2002, the lowest Home
Office projection for the prison population by this year was 87,000,
which is significantly higher than the capacity that it now has. When
the Home Office could have acted to provide the necessary extra prison
places, it failed to do so. Last year, long after it knew that it had a
looming crisis, it even sold off a prison ship, cutting prison places
by another 400.</p><p><a name="06100913000257">Even
on the current Home Secretary&#146;s watch, the Department has been
lackadaisical and slow to act. On 24 May this year, he was quoted in
the press as
saying:</p><a name="brev_7"><a name="06100913001037"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Protecting
the public is my absolute
priority.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06100913000258">That is quite
proper for a Home Secretary, yet I have a memorandum written by his
private secretary only the day after, detailing a discussion of this
crisis and considering the option of administrative release&#151;the
early release of prisoners to free cells. We know that that proposal
was quashed by No. 10, but why were not all the proposals that the Home
Secretary has put before us today initiated then, in May, before we had
a crisis? Why do we have to have a crisis to get action out of this
Government?</p><p><a name="06100913000259">The Home
Secretary&#146;s predecessors attempted to head off this problem by
way of a combination of early release and community sentencing. To
justify that, they pretended that community sentences were equally as
tough as punishments, deterrents and methods of rehabilitation. None of
that is true. Nine out of 10 of those who go through Labour&#146;s
flagship programme&#151;the intensive supervision and surveillance
programme or ISSP&#151;reoffend within two years. The Home Secretary
talked about more tagging: 75 per cent. of young criminals on tags
reoffend within one year.</p><p><a name="06100913000260">The Government&#146;s
strategy for rehabilitation is not only failing outside prison; it is
also being destroyed inside prison. Owing to prison overcrowding, in
order to create places in individual prisons, vast numbers of transfers
occur. Last year, there were 98,000 transfers between prisons among a
population of 80,000. That means that prisoners are frequently uprooted
before they complete courses designed to rehabilitate them and to equip
them for an honest life in the outside world. As a result, under this
Government reoffending rates for prison have gone up from 56 to 67 per
cent. Does the Home Secretary accept that that increase in 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 36</b><br>reoffending rates&#151;the greatest in the history of our prison
system&#151;is a direct result of the Government&#146;s neglect of
this area?</p><p><a name="06100913000261">The various
proposals that the Home Secretary has detailed might now be
unavoidable, but only two&#151;the action to remove or swap out
foreign prisoners, and the re-roling of women&#146;s
prisons&#151;are relatively low risk and low cost. Both of them
should have been done months or even years
ago.</p><p><a name="06100913000262">Using police
cells will be costly and will probably also be counter-productive. The
last time this Government implemented Operation Safeguard, it cost more
than &#163;10 million, tied down policemen who should have been
catching criminals rather than acting as part-time prison warders, and
clogged up the police cells so that there was nowhere to put criminals
who were caught. Does the Home Secretary accept that that will happen
again this time, and if not why
not?</p><p><a name="06100913000263">Does the Home
Secretary recognise that by accepting the transfer of category C
prisoners to open prisons he is sanctioning an increase in risk to
public safety? He might talk about risk assessment, but he must know,
even now, that this is a very imprecise technique. Otherwise, how does
he explain the rash of murders committed by prisoners on probation and
parole? Does he recognise that each of his proposals will buy him only
a matter of weeks or perhaps months? Even his conversion of an Army
barracks will buy him only just over one more month.</p><p><a name="06100913000264">The programme that the Home
Secretary has laid before us today might get him to just past
Christmas, but what will happen then? Will there be even more
inappropriately given, non-custodial sentences or even earlier
releases? Does he accept that the prison capacity failure has harmed
every stage of the criminal justice system? It will handicap policemen
from catching criminals. It has meant that criminals who should be in
prison are either not sent to prison or released too early, and even
when some criminals go to prison, the process has been rendered so
chaotic that reoffending rates are climbing to record levels.</p><p><a name="06100913000265">The Home Secretary must
recognise that he cannot blame this on the civil servants, prison
officers or judges. This crisis&#151;this catastrophe&#151;has
arisen because this Government, by the policy that they have chosen to
follow, have been derelict in their duty to protect the
public.</p><p><a name="06100913000266"><b><a name="06100913001204">John

it can be to judge the trend. He said that the lowest estimate for

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 37</b><br>this year was that 87,000 prison places were needed, but in fact, that
is some 7,000 places above the capacity and the requirement at which we
are operating. So it is not an exact science, but I have, I think, been
quite straight with the House in three areas. First, I accept
responsibility, because I am the Secretary of State for home affairs.
Secondly, I have not hidden from the House that there is pressure on
prison places, which is why I have not only discussed this issue in
detail here, but within six weeks of coming in, discussed it with our
colleagues at the Treasury and got agreement for another 8,000 prison
places. Thirdly, and as I have said today, I have been considering
further measures to deal with this issue. It is not true to paint this
as a crisis; we did not discover it over the weekend. I have known
since we went in about the pressure on places, and I have tried to
manage the short, medium and longer term, and to outline these issues
before the House with as much honesty as I
can.</p><p><a name="06100913000268">Let me then ask for a little
honesty on a couple of subjects that the right hon. Gentleman raised.
He was very selective in his discussion of reoffending rates. He chose
to discuss the intensive supervision and surveillance programme because
he knows that the hardest category of people to prevent from
reoffending is young people, and that the hardest category among young
people to prevent from reoffending is the worst offenders among young
people. That is precisely why he chose to discuss that
category.</p><p><a name="06100913000269">Let us deal
with some other reoffending categories, such as home detention curfew.
The right hon. Gentleman is prepared continually to run down anything
that happens outside custodial sentences, but the reoffending rate for
home detention curfew, while tagged, since it began in January 1999, is
only 4 per cent., which is an unparalleled low level of reoffending.
More than 130,000 people have been released on home detention curfew,
and given the low reoffending rate of 5 per cent., I should have
expected that extraordinary statistic to fall from the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s lips while he was at the Dispatch
Box.</p><p><a name="06100913000270">The House will
also be interested to know that for adults&#151;not
youngsters&#151;the overall community sentence reoffending rate is
too high, at 53 per cent. over two years, but that is 14 per cent.
lower than the figure for those who serve prison custodial sentences.
So probation is not obviously and self-apparently worse in all
circumstances, and the right hon. Gentleman would do better to give a
balanced view. Moreover, the overall reoffending rate is not 90-odd per
cent. for juveniles; it is some 41 per cent. over one year. So it is
wrong to take one specific area and to suggest that everything is the
same.</p><p><a name="06100913000271">Let me deal
finally with prison building. It is absolutely true that we are under
pressure, which is the reason why I am bringing in these measures. I
hope that the situation has been managed over the past five or six
months in a way that copes with the present pressures on prisons, as
well as with the foreign national prisoner crisis. I hope that the hon.
Gentlemen on the Opposition Benches&#151;and they are all
gentlemen<i> &#151;</i>[Hon. Members:
&#147;No!&#148;] I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker. The
hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), who is very obviously a

apologies, Mr. Speaker. Re-roleing prisons is one thing;
re-roleing ladies on the Front Bench is quite another, more offensive,
thing.</p><br>

the early lead time that is necessary in order to ensure that we can

release, there will be pressure on prison places. I would have hoped

country of origin to look after these prisoners so that they serve
their sentence there, not in this country; and is not a real test of
whether people should be in this country whether they have committed
crimes?</p><p><a name="06100913000274"><b><a name="06100913001206">John
Reid:</b> To start with the second part of my right hon.
Friend&#146;s question, my view on that is known. Foreign nationals
who come to this country, take its privileges and demand the rights and
hospitality that it bestows upon them, should match that by showing
responsibility, and failure to do so is clearly signified in the breach
if they commit a serious crime. That is why anyone who is in that
position should be automatically presumed to face
deportation.</p><p><a name="06100913000275">With
regard to the first part of my right hon. Friend&#146;s question,
yes, I agree. At the moment there is a series of obstacles to asking
foreign prisoners to go back to their country of origin. We are
examining all of those obstacles in detail to see how, either by
persuasion or by the obligation of law, we can overcome them. As part
of that I have been discussing with my European colleagues, as late as
Thursday of last week, this very issue. That would be an additional
weapon in our armoury to ensure that we keep in prison in this country
those who ought to be there for as long as they ought to be there, but
remove from prison those who ought not to be there, either because they
need treatment or because they should be back in their country of
origin.</p><p><a name="06100913000276"><b><a name="_spnew76"><a name="06100913001207">Mr.

the hop by unexpected events. It is in the nature of things that
disasters creep up on Ministers with little warning. It is also in the
nature of things that that happens to Opposition parties too. Any
reasonable observer will forgive a little Government panic when
unpredictable events take over, but what possible excuse is there for a
Government to fail to heed not one, not several, but continuous and
repeated warnings of crisis in our prisons stretching back several
years? Listening to the complacency of Ministers, the public would be
forgiven for thinking that it is just a matter of a little temporary
discomfort for prisoners themselves. The truth, of course, is
altogether more serious. Overcrowded prisons prevent prisoners from
being rehabilitated and so have a direct effect on increased levels of
crime in our villages, towns and cities, inflicted by ex-prisoners who
now reoffend at an historically unprecedented rated. No one should be
under any illusions: public safety is yet again at stake because of
Government incompetence. The Home Secretary has come to the House today
in an attempt to camouflage a series of stop-gap, emergency measures as
a carefully considered package, yet his proposals have raised more
questions than long-term answers.</p><p><a name="06100913000278">First, the Home
Secretary&#146;s statement does not explain why it is estimated that
more than 500 foreign prisoners who should have been deported at the
end of their sentences are still languishing in prison. The Home
Secretary has said that he has set a target of spring next year to sort
out the matter, but why take so long? Just a few days ago, a prison
governor told me about a foreign prisoner who is desperate to be
deported back to Asia and who has no idea why she is still in prison in
this country a full nine months after her sentence finished. What
possible explanation can the Home Secretary give for such woeful
bureaucratic foot dragging?</p><p><a name="06100913000279">Secondly, when will the Home
Secretary not only, as he has done today, pay lip service to, but
confront in practice, the fact that far too many individuals in prison
have acute mental health problems&#151;as many as one in 10 are
estimated to be functionally psychotic? Rather than spending millions
of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money in a frantic effort to build
prison cells as quickly as they are filled, does it not make more sense
to invest that money in building more secure mental health treatment
capacity?</p><p><a name="06100913000280">Finally, is
it not time for the Home Secretary to pluck up the courage to make the
public case, beyond the few fleeting mentions here today, for
non-custodial sentences as an effective alternative to prison for those
who have committed lesser offences? I welcome his approach, but will he
commit himself to do it again, to do it more and to do it in public?
There is nothing tough in failing to take the political lead in
advocating new ways to punish and rehabilitate offenders outside
prison. Contrary to the assertion by the right hon. Member for
Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), there is plenty of good practice
to build on. In Chard, the community justice panel pilot project has
achieved reoffending rates as low as 5 per cent. In Scotland,

balanced contribution.</p><p><a name="06100913000284">Those who should stay in prison
longer for the protection of the public ought to be retained in
sufficient prison places, while others ought not to be in prison. The
Liberals constantly demand more prison places and fewer people to fill
them. I notice that the hon. Gentleman did not make a commitment on how
many extra prison places the Liberals would build. I have already said
8,000 extra prison places, and I will continue to review the matter,
but does he have a figure in mind? He would provide an unspecified
number of extra prison places for fewer prisoners, although that is
unspecified, too. That is a typical concoction from the Liberals, and
&#147;vacuous&#148; is too substantial a word to describe it.

If there is a specific number, I am waiting to hear

honest with the House in saying that there is pressure on prison places
and explaining how we are going to manage that in the short term and
the longer term. This is not a case of being caught on the hop by an
unexpected event. The only unexpected event that caught me on the hop
was being appointed to the Home Office, and I have already accepted
that. Since I have been there, I have tried to ensure that we have a
planned, progressive attempt to make sure that the sentence fits the
crime and that the prison places available fit sentence lengths and
numbers. That is what we will continue to do.</p><p><a name="06100913000287">On foreign national prisoners,

consideration&#151;namely, the serious job losses in York over the
summer at British Sugar, Norwich Union and Nestl&#233;
Rowntree.</p><p><a name="06100913000320">In July,
British Sugar said that it would close the York sugar factory after
this winter&#146;s beet processing campaign, with the loss of more
than 100 permanent jobs. Seasonal workers and the factory&#146;s
suppliers&#151;farmers and road hauliers&#151;will lose their jobs
too. Then, in September, Norwich Union announced the loss of 450 jobs
in York from its life assurance business, and the following week
Nestl&#233; Rowntree announced plans for 645 redundancies at its York
factory.</p><p><a name="06100913000321">Those job
losses are a body blow for the workers and their families, who will
lose their livelihoods. Many of them will find it hard to get
alternative jobs with similar pay because their industrial skills,
which used to be so highly valued, are no longer in
demand.</p><p><a name="06100913000322">The job losses
are a shock to the York economy, which has been performing well in
recent years. Unemployment in my constituency dropped from a high of
6,500 under the Conservatives to 1,300 in 2004, but since then, with
the closure of York&#146;s other chocolate factory, Terry&#146;s,
and other retrenchment, it has climbed back to 1,700, and sadly will
rise higher as those latest job losses feed through into the
unemployment
figures.</p><p><a name="06100913000323">Average wages
in York have risen sharply since 1997, but over the last two years
average male earnings have fallen back. Those job losses have been a
wake-up call for York. Following my suggestion, the council has
commissioned an independent review of the city&#146;s

tourism, manufacturing and
services.</p><p><a name="06100913000324">York&#146;s
experience should be a wake-up call to national Government too. The
Government need to re-examine their manufacturing and competition
policies. The Bank of England is warning that the overvalued pound is
costing manufacturing jobs, and it is putting pressure on service
industries, too, as Norwich Union&#146;s decision to transfer some
back-office functions to low-wage economies shows. It is all very well
to enjoy cheap summer holidays abroad, on the back of a strong pound,
but the memories fade pretty fast when people come home to find that
their job has gone. The strong pound is hitting incoming tourism, too,
which also matters to York.</p><p><a name="06100913000325">My city needs support from the
Government and from Yorkshire Forward to help redundant workers find
new jobs and to encourage inward investment to York. We also need the
Government to re-examine their regional economic strategy and to work
with York&#146;s employment review to bolster York&#146;s regional
role as a science city, for example, and as a centre for financial
services and civil service jobs. Given the pressure on food
manufacturing jobs in particular, the Government need to make sure that
the Competition Commission uses its investigation of the groceries
trade to see whether the big supermarkets are putting too much pressure
on their suppliers, to the point that the suppliers are cutting
jobs.</p><p><a name="06100913000326">Those are the
urgent matters that I want the House to discuss, Mr. Deputy
Speaker, either this afternoon, if you see fit to adjourn the House, or
at some other time in the near future.</p><p><a name="06100913000327"><b><a name="06100913001241">Mr.
Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b> I have listened
carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has said, and I must give my
decision without stating any reasons. I am afraid that I do not
consider that the matter that he has raised is appropriate for

the application to the

point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure that you and
all Members of the House realise that the situation in North Korea,
with today&#146;s news of nuclear weapons tests there, is a matter of
growing international concern. Earlier this afternoon, a Foreign Office
Minister made a statement and answered questions on this matter in
another place. Less than an hour ago, the Foreign Secretary made a
statement on this matter to the members of the press. However, no
Foreign Office Minister has come to the House to make a statement and
to answer questions from hon. Members. Given all that the Speaker, you
and other Deputy Speakers have said previously about the importance of
Ministers making statements to the House, I seek your guidance as to
how we can ensure that, in future, on such matters of grave concern,
Ministers recognise their responsibility to put themselves forward to
be asked questions by elected representatives in this Chamber, and not
simply to give statements to the press.</p><p><a name="06100913000329"><b><a name="_spnew91"><a name="06100913001243">Dr.

point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure that the whole
House is seized of the importance of the report of a successful nuclear
weapons test by North Korea. Was an approach made to the Speaker this
morning by a Minister asking for the opportunity to make a statement?
Obviously, there is an urgent need for an early debate or

they are not ones that the House or anyone can go back over now. I
understand the concern expressed by the right hon. Member for
Maidenhead (Mrs. May), which she has put firmly on the
record. Mr. Speaker&#146;s views about such matters are
well known. We have a crowded programme today, with two statements as

clauses 6 and 7 deal with taxis and private hire vehicles, sometimes
known as minicabs. Both clauses have the same objective: to make travel
safer for people who use those modes of transport. Against the
background of the Bichard report and the legislation that we have
brought forward in that regard, we have considered carefully whether we
should use the opportunity presented by the Road Safety Bill to deal
with any urgent safety concerns relating to taxi and PHV legislation.
The result is these new clauses to deal with two worrying aspects of
the legislation that we identified.</p><p><a name="06100913000340">New clause 6 addresses our
concern about a taxi or PHV driver&#146;s right to continue working
while appealing against a decision to suspend or revoke his licence,
even if he is considered to represent an immediate threat to public
safety. The new clause gives local licensing authorities in England and
Wales, outside London, a new power which will enable them to suspend or
revoke a taxi or PHV driver&#146;s licence with immediate effect on
safety grounds. That power has been available tothe licensing
authority in London&#151;Transport for London&#151;for a number of
years.</p><p><a name="06100913000341">Drivers&#146;
automatic right to continue working pending appeal has been a source of
justified concern to many taxi and PHV licensing authorities. They want
to use their licensing powers to ensure that passengers are safe using
local taxi and PHV services. They play a tremendously important role in
protecting residents and visitors who use taxis and PHVs in their
areas. The new clause will enable them to do so even more thoroughly in
some circumstances&#151;for example, when a driver has committed a
serious offence or is suffering from a medical condition that makes it
unsafe for him to continue
working.</p><p><a name="06100913000342"><b><a name="_spnew95"><a name="06100913001250">Derek
Conway (Old Bexley and Sidcup) (Con):</b> I am sorry to
interrupt the Minister so early in his speech. He will know that there
is concern among private operators who provide special-needs transport
because they are subject to enhanced Criminal Records Bureau checks,
and many are locked into local authority contracts until 2010.
Operators in my constituency want to know when the Minister intends the
enhanced protection regulations to come into force, because owing to
the local authority contracts they are already subject to the checks. I
gather that there may be some room for manoeuvre over when the
imposition will actually occur. If the Minister could provide any
guidance, those operators would be very
grateful.</p><p><a name="06100913000343"><b><a name="06100913001251">Dr.

accepted today, there will be a consultation with all stakeholders
following Royal Assent. One of the issues that we will consider during
the consultation is the time at which the changes will come into force.

key principle on which we shall have to decide when making a decision
is the safety of the public. I am sure that he and his constituents
would agree with that. There may therefore be a conflict between the
interest of protecting the public and the interests of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituents who have existing contracts. I hope
that we shall find a way of resolving that conflict, but if there is no
way of doing so, we shall have to come down on the side of public
safety. I hope that despite that caveat, and given the promise of a
thorough consultation involving all stakeholders, the hon. Gentleman
will be reassured that we will listen to his constituents&#146;
concerns.</p><p><a name="06100913000344">New clause 7
deals with our concern about what is commonly known as the contract
exemption: the provision that exempts drivers, vehicles and operators
outside London from licensing if the vehicles are hired only under
contracts lasting seven days or more. On Second Reading and on other
occasions, the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)
expressed concern about what will now be clause 53, which tightens the
definition of a private hire vehicle in London and will bring vehicles
dedicated to contract work within the London PHV licensing
regime.</p><p><a name="06100913000345">One of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s points was the clause would be inconsistent
with retention of the contract exemption outside London. In Committee I
promised to consider the matter, while warning the hon. Gentleman that
those who open a can of worms must expect what they are likely to find
in it. Having considered, I reached a conclusion&#151;also reached by
the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member
for Lincoln (Gillian Merron)&#151;that was not the one for which the
hon. Gentleman had hoped. Our conclusion was that public safety, and
indeed consistency, required not that we did not make the provision in
London, but that we extended it to the rest of the country and ensured
that contract private hire work was licensed both in London and
elsewhere. That is why we tabled the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06100913000346"><b><a name="_spnew96"><a name="06100913001252">Rosemary

before and, if she will accept it, I will deal with them in greater
detail at a more appropriate place in our debate.</p><p><a name="06100913000350">To continue my discussion of
new clause 7, there are no compelling reasons why private hire services
provided under long-term contracts should be outside the arrangements
for ensuring public safety, which are considered to be essential for
other private hire work. The need to ensure public safety remains the
same, regardless of whether the hiring is a one-off or part of a
long-term contract. For a passenger possibly at risk, the method of
hiring is not relevant; what is important is that there is no doubt
that all the necessary checks and procedures have been comprehensively
and effectively carried out. There are good grounds for removing the
contract exemption in terms of ensuring a level playing field in the
industry. Unlicensed contractors have a commercial advantage over their
licensed counterparts, which cannot be
justified.</p><p><a name="06100913000351">I believe
that both new clauses are strongly supported by those who have
responsibility for taxi and PHV
licensing.</p><p><a name="06100913000352"><b><a name="06100913001256">Mrs.

are so keen on the safety of drivers and that we are introducing so
many sensible amendments, will he explain why there is no discussion of
pedicabs, which are highly dangerous, yet seem to be of no concern to
anyone? It is quite possible, if one is bored with someone, to put them
in a pedicab.
</p><p><a name="06100913000353"><b><a name="06100913001257">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> It would be wrong for me to debate Mr.
Speaker&#146;s selection of amendments. I know that some hon. Members
tabled amendments on pedicabs, but they have not been selected.
However, I know that Transport for London intends to bring pedicabs
within a regulatory regime. In my view, the proposed arrangements will
be adequate to cover the issue. My hon. Friend may have a different
view, however, as she does on so many issues that we
discuss.</p><p><a name="06100913000354">As I was saying, both new
clauses are strongly supported by those with responsibility for taxi
and PHV licensing and have been welcomed by many in the industry. They
are necessary to safeguard the public and I commend them to the House.
<b><a name="_spnew97"><a name="06100913001258">Stephen
Hammond (Wimbledon) (Con):</b> We agree with the Government on
one of the new clauses, but probably not on the other. New clause 6
introduces new provisions into the Local Government (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1976. That Act currently allows a local authority or
other licensing power or body to exercise the power to revoke, suspend
or refuse a licence where the subject is convicted of specific offences
or for &#147;any other reasonable cause&#148; that the authority
has &#147;grounds&#148; for believing. If I understand the
intention behind the new clause, it will allow a local authority or
licensing body to revoke or suspend the licence of taxi driver or
minicab with immediate effect where it is a &#147;matter of public
safety&#148;, or on other grounds after21 days where notice
has been served on the driver.</p><br>

clarification, is this; the Government currently have powers under the
1976 Act to revoke a licence for &#147;any other reasonable
cause&#148; and for a &#147;specific conviction.&#148; The
proposed public safety grounds represent a power that is additional to
the Act and it is unclear how this will work in
practice.</p><p><a name="06100913000356">I
assume that a conviction for a serious driving offence would be covered
under the specific conviction provision. I assume that a conviction for
an assault such as actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm against
another road user, a pedestrian or a passenger would again be covered
under the specific conviction provision. I assume that driving a
vehicle without a valid MOT or in an unroadworthy condition as
designated by the police or by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency
would be covered under the reasonable cause provision. I assume that a
deterioration in a given medical condition would be covered by that
provision as well.</p><p><a name="06100913000357">If
the Minister is willing to tell me that my assumptions are incorrect, I
will see the need for the new clause. If so, perhaps he will give me
three specific examples where public safety needs arise beyond those
already dealt with by the 1976 Act. The Minister made much in Committee
about powers that were not being enforced at present and that we should
not introduce more new powers that were unlikely to be enforced. We
need clarity from the Government as to exactly how the new clause will
work.</p><p><a name="06100913000358">There was
substantial discussion in Committee of new clause 7 and the Minister
has done what he warned us he would do; he has closed what he described
as the can of worms. However, as new clause 7 puts into effect for the
rest of the country what clause 53 does for London, is it necessary?
The 1988 Act is working perfectly well within London. There are vast
numbers of contractors supplying private hire services to councils on a
contract basis. They are Criminal Records Bureau-checked and their
vehicles are checked and comply with safety provisions but they are not
available to the public. There seems to be no reason for the Government
to intervene in an Act that is working well. This seems to be another
piece of unnecessary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06100913000359"><b><a name="06100913001259">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being slightly
disingenuous. Were we here today debating an abuse of a vulnerable
person by someone driving a private hire vehicle who had not been
appropriately checked and who had been allowed to drive because of the
contract exemption, I suspect that his argument would be that I should
resign my position because I had not taken the opportunity of the Road
Safety Bill to close that
loophole.</p><p><a name="06100913000360"><b><a name="_spnew98"><a name="06100913001260">Mr.

process that someone must go through to have the right to drive a

exemption, at a competitive disadvantage, because he would now have to
pay for his drivers to be checked. Clearly there is a loophole. I
agreed in Committee to look at the matter and to decide whether, in the
interests of consistency, we should close the loophole not only in
London, as Transport for London had requested, but in the rest of the
country. We took the view that we should close it in the rest of the
country.</p><p><a name="06100913000362">The hon.
Gentleman asked me to cite three examples, but I cannot do so. I hope
that nobody will ever be in a position to do so, because we have closed
the loophole. Serious questions would certainly be asked if we did not
do so. Will the change be a major regulatory burden on the industry?
No, it will not. I hope that anybody who has used the contract
exemption in the past has checked their drivers and gone through the
whole process. The fact that they will now have to do so by law is
neither here nor there. It should be no additional burden if they have
followed best practice in the past. If they have not been doing so,
there will be an additional burden, but I argue that it is an
appropriate burden for them to
carry.</p><p><a name="06100913000363"><b><a name="06100913001262">Stephen

minicab driver can be suspended for being convicted of a specific
offence or for any other reasonable cause decided by the licensing
authority. I would like the Minister to tell us what public safety

Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the purpose
of the new clause and I accept full responsibility for not having
explained it. There will be no new powers to suspend or revoke a
licence. One would still have to satisfy the grounds for a suspension
or revocation of a driver&#146;s licence as under the present
legislation. The difference is that at the moment if the individual
whose licence is suspended appeals against that suspension, they can
continue to drive people around while they await the hearing of the
appeal. If someone is accused of a serious offence&#151;as serious as
rape or some other sexual offence&#151;it would be horrendous if they
were allowed to continue to drive a private hire vehicle while waiting
for the appeal against suspension to be heard. Under the new clause,
when the licensing authority takes the view that the offence is
serious, it will be able to suspend the licence.

put to us by some taxi drivers was that it might leave them open to
false allegations and they might lose their livelihood over a trivial
allegation while awaiting the hearing of appeal against suspension.
However, in the experience of the use of the power in London, where it
has been in place for some time, it has not been abused. Drivers have
had their licences suspended pending appeal only in cases in which a
serious allegation has been made against them. Given the seriousness of
the offences that might be involved, I think that the new clause is a
proportionate response to the situation. No driver should lose their

seek to confirm that the making of level crossing orders can be
delegated to the rail safety regulator. First, I apologise to the House
for the short notice given of the amendments, and for our failure to
table them earlier, but I hope that it will accept the
explanation.</p><p><a name="06100913000379">Level
crossing orders set out the protective measures that are to be provided
at each level crossing. &#147;Protective measures&#148; are the
types of signs, barriers and lights needed to ensure that the crossing
has the most appropriate measures for safe operation by both rail and
road users. The general process has been that, after consultation with
the local authority, the level crossing operator&#151;Network Rail in
most cases&#151;applies to the Secretary of State for an order
setting out the measures that it wants at the site. The proposals are
considered by Her Majesty&#146;s railway inspectorate and the order
is made by HMRI on behalf of the Secretary of State. That procedure
continued after 1990, when HMRI transferred from the Department of
Transport to the Health and Safety
Executive.</p><p><a name="06100913000380">With the
transfer of HMRI from the Health and Safety Executive to the Office of
Rail Regulation earlier this year, we intended that HMRI would continue
to make level crossing orders on behalf of the Secretary of State, but
I am afraid that doubt has been cast on whether the wording of the
Railways Act 2005 allows that. In turn, that has cast doubt on whether
the delegation to the HSE in 1990 was sufficiently robust. We therefore
seek to amend the 2005 Act to put beyond doubt the fact that the making
of level crossing orders can be delegated, and to make it clear that
orders made on behalf of the Secretary of State by HMRI inspectors of
the HSE are valid. If approved, the amendment will confirm that the
legal position is what everyone always thought it was, as it has worked
well for level crossing
safety.</p><p><a name="06100913000381"><b><a name="06100913001267">Mrs.

who causes a bridge strike. The amendments that were sought at an
earlier stage would have provided additional powers that are
unnecessary. I take issue with my hon. Friend&#146;s belief that the
Department has been caught out. I remind her that it is not the
Department under this Government that was caught out, but the
Department under the auspices of the previous Government, back in 1990.

the passage of the Bill in the other place six new clauses were added
to deal with safety at level crossings. The Government stated at the
time that they would remove them. In Committee, my hon. Friends and I
aired and discussed those clauses and amendments, which were designed
to protect the public, punish drivers who fail to obey signals at level
crossings and who fail to obey bridge guidelines. To their shame, the
Government voted against each of those sensible amendments to aid road
safety.</p><p><a name="06100913000388">The Minister
stated that the Government would make new proposals to improve safety
at level crossings by clarifying the powers of the relevant
authorities, yet today we have before us a new clause whose intent is
merely to amend paragraph 7 of schedule 3 to the Railways Act 2005, so
that the Office of Rail Regulation can make regulations. Provisions
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 allow the Health and
Safety Commission to do the same
thing.</p><p><a name="06100913000389">That
is all that the Government propose to do and it is a huge
disappointment to those of us who have spoken to Network Rail and to
the operators. The Government cannot be aware of what Network Rail said
about the seriousness of the offences being committed&#151;of drivers
pulling out and overtaking queues, zigzagging around barriers or
pulling out on to the line and reversing to avoid trains and vehicles.
They cannot be aware of the seriousness of the impact of those offences
and of the consequences for human life when a train collides with a car
due to a failure to stop at red warning lights. The Minister seems to
be saying&#151;as he

are exactly the same as those elsewhere. They are not. A driver who
skips a red light at an ordinary road junction will not hit or derail a
train. It should not need pointing out that a collision on a level
crossing between a car and an express train travelling at speeds of up
to 125 mph is likely to cause the death not only of the driver but
scores of railway
passengers.</p><p><a name="06100913000390">The new
clause is a monumental lost opportunity. The Government had the option
to write into the Bill sensible measures that would have had an
enormous impact on road safety. Current fines and penalties for
offenders at level crossings&#151;often serial offenders&#151;are
insufficient. Those offences are at least as serious as drink driving
and sentencing ought to reflect that. Magistrates could have had powers
to impose substantial custodial sentences and endorsement penalties on
persistent offenders. The matter should be on the face of the Bill. New
clause 28 will not affect the problem and the Minister stands charged
of failure to fulfil what he undertook to do in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06100913000391">We are also
dealing with new clauses 37 and 38. They say that imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery, so I am grateful to Lib Dem Members for
proposing provisions that are so close in form and substance to those
we tabled in another place and which we aired in Committee. If the Lib
Dems had been writing a novel they might have been guilty of
plagiarism, so some of them might want to join us and support the real
thing rather than follow a pale
imitation.</p><p><a name="06100913000392">We applaud
new clauses 37 and 38 and the flexibility that would allow magistrates
to pass custodial sentences. Our original amendments proposed slightly
higher custodial sentences and endorsement penalties. None the less, we
noted the Liberal Democrats&#146; support in Committee and if they
are minded to test their new clauses tonight I shall ask my hon.

them.</p><p><a name="06100913000393"><b><a name="_spnew100"><a name="06100913001272">Mr.

is quite improper to suggest that running a red light at a level

a road.</p><p><a name="06100913000395">I, too, have
seen the videos produced by Network Rail. Some of what is recorded is,
frankly, chilling. The way in which some drivers are prepared to take
risks at level crossings is exceptionally disturbing. This debate is
partly about the message that we are sending, and I fear that the
message being sent by the Government does not attach sufficient
seriousness to the offences as they apply daily at level
crossings.</p><br>

such a change to type approval would be necessary and, if so, how we
pursue it.</p><p><a name="06100913000416"><b><a name="06100913001284">Rob
Marris:</b> Would it not be a lot cheaper and simpler to have
something 100 m from a bridge that is of the same height and that would
form a soft barrier across the road&#151;it could be roughly the
height of a heavy goods vehicle&#151;so that vehicles would hit the
soft barrier instead of the bridge?</p><p><a name="06100913000417"><b><a name="06100913001285">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, but, again, we
would not need the proposed amendments to require that. I suspect that
the same people who are asking us to agree the amendments would soon
come back and introduce ten-minute Bills about street furniture and the
clutter on our urban and rural roads if we were to do so. Nevertheless,
we would not require the proposed measure to do what has been
suggested.</p><p><a name="06100913000418"><b><a name="06100913001286">Mr.
Robert Goodwill (Scarborough and Whitby) (Con):</b> As an HGV
driver, I am all too aware of the problems of low bridges. I am sure
that the Minister agrees that in most cases of an HGV or double-decker
bus driver hitting a low bridge it is an inadvertent act. I am unsure,
therefore, whether increasing the penalties would reduce the number of
bridge strikes.</p><br>

suggest that the Minister drive between Wakefield and Doncaster, where
there is a low bridge? A beam across the road about half a mile before
the bridge warns HGV drivers that they might strike the bridge if they
continue. If the Government are serious about wanting to reduce bridge
strikes, more such technology should be deployed in other parts of the
country.</p><p><a name="06100913000420"><b><a name="06100913001287">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a constructive
suggestion, and we will certainly discuss it with Network Rail. Again,
the amendments are not necessary for us to pursue that course of
action. I had not appreciated that the hon. Gentleman is an HGV
driver&#151;I have not seen him floating around the Members&#146;
Tea Room with a Yorkie in his hand&#151;but he makes a sensible
suggestion, which we shall
pursue.</p><p><a name="06100913000421">I am not
persuaded of the case for special offences in respect of breaching red
lights at railway crossings; nor am I persuaded of the case for special
offences in respect of bridge strikes. There have, sadly, been many
tragic instances on the roads where crossing a red light has had
catastrophic consequences for motorists and pedestrians&#151;as
catastrophic as a collision on a railway crossing. I understand the
point about far more people being involved in railway crossing
violations, but jumping a red light anywhere could lead to
somebody&#146;s death, and if it is done in a wilfully it should be
treated exactly the same
way.</p><p><a name="06100913000422"><b><a name="06100913001288">Stephen
Hammond:</b> We have again heard the
Minister say that he regards the two violations as the same offence. He
surely must recognise that there is a major difference between jumping
an ordinary red light and jumping a red light at a level crossing. The
potential impact and other possibilities are significantly greater than
they are for jumping a red light on a normal road, and the consequences
thereof need to be accepted and the offence recognised. The point was
made both in Committee and on the Floor of the House today that those
who commit the offence are usually serial offenders who endanger their
own lives and, more importantly, the lives of others at rural level
crossings. The magistrates courts need the power to deal with
them.</p><p><a name="06100913000423"><b><a name="06100913001289">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The point is that the courts do
have the power to deal with them. Someone who recklessly endangers the
lives of other people should be prosecuted not for jumping a red light
but for dangerous driving. The police will prosecute if the evidence
can be gathered. If people wilfully jump a red light on a level
crossing, it might be dangerous driving, and if they jump the traffic
lights around Parliament square they should be prosecuted
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06100913000424">I
challenge the hon. Gentleman to answer the following case that would be
put to him if we were to accept that there is a difference between the
two offences. What would he say when a parent brought the photograph of
their dead child into this House and said, &#147;My
daughter&#148;&#151;or son&#151;&#147;was killed on a street
because somebody jumped a red light and you treat their offence
differently from that of somebody who does the exact same on a level
crossing&#148;? I suspect that if the hon. Gentleman were in my
position now, he would find that unanswerable.</p><br>

merits. The police need to take a view on the appropriate offence, and
the courts need to take a view on the appropriate sentence. Where a
violation is blatant and dangerous, the driving can and should be
prosecuted as such, with a significantly higher penalty, including
custody, than that which applies to a normal breach of a red
light.</p><p><a name="06100913000426">The
hon. Gentleman accused me of making promises in Committee that I have
not kept. I have to say to him that, again, he is not being entirely
accurate. In Committee, I introduced into the Bill the measure that is
now clause 50. That amendment had been agreed with, among others, our
stakeholders&#151;including Network Rail&#151;in order
significantly to improve the safety of level crossings. It is my
understanding that Network Rail no longer supports the amendments that
are before the House, and that it is happy with the position that has
been agreed. In Committee I said that I was sympathetic to the argument
that a specific tougher penalty would send a message to lunatics who
frequently zig-zag through crossings, possibly endangering the safety
of rail passengers, and that if there was evidence of a problem I would
be prepared to consider using the subordinate powers under clauses 3
and 4, subject to the agreement of Parliament, to set a higher fixed
penalty and a higher penalty points tariff for breaches of red lights
at railway crossings.</p><p><a name="06100913000427">I still believe that the
current offence of careless and inconsiderate driving with a maximum
fine&#151;subject, again, to Parliamentary approval for clause
22&#151;of &#163;5,000 is sufficient to deal with bridge strikes.
In extreme cases where danger is caused to other road users it might be
appropriate to prosecute for dangerous driving, but I believe that the
power already exists to enable that.</p><p><a name="06100913000428">The hon. Member for Orkney and
Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) asked when the Government became
aware of the need for new clause 28. Ministers were made aware of the
issue early in September. I do not have a precise date, but if he is
interested in knowing the precise date when it was first brought to our
attention I am happy to provide it to him. However, I can assure him
that as soon as it was brought to our attention Ministers moved rapidly
to try to assess the issue.</p><p><a name="06100913000429">The
Attorney-General was consulted on whether existing legislation is
sufficiently robust before we decided to move to bridge the possible
loophole. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris), who requested this information, that the
clauses have been checked by counsel. I promise him that I shall have
them checked again before the Bill passes to the other place.</p><p><a name="06100913000430">The loophole is possibly the
last of the errors of the disastrous railway privatisation, and we
moved to close it as soon as we discovered it. I should of course
emphasise to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland that we will not
know whether retrospection will be necessary unless somebody takes a
test case to the courts and they confirm our interpretation of the law.
It may well be that everything was all right; nevertheless, in our view
it was essential to move as rapidly as we did to close any loophole in
such an important area of the

Chope:</b> I should say at the outset that a lot people
thought that it was already an offence to be at the wheel of a car with
illegal substances in one&#146;s body, but that is not the law as it
stands. We do not tolerate train drivers who have illegal substances in
their body when they are driving trains, or airline pilots who have
illegal substances in their body when they are at the controls of an
aircraft, yet the law seems to be much more relaxed about those who
take the controls of motor vehicles on our roads, some of which, as we
need not remind ourselves, are very large lorries. New clause 1 would
outlaw driving with illegal substances in the body. I am the first to
accept that before introducing a new criminal sanction we need to be
satisfied that there is a real and serious problem that needs to be
addressed, and I hope that the House will accept that there is. Not
only that&#151;the problem is getting worse. Many innocent people are
being killed or seriously injured as a result of Parliament&#146;s
failure to address the
problem.</p><p><a name="06100913000445">I began
looking into this issue in February last year, when I was the shadow
transport Minister taking the lead on road safety matters. The
<i> Southern Daily</i><i> Echo </i>reported an horrific case in which a
driver was jailed after a crash in which he killed a young Bournemouth
university student on the first day of their university career. That
accident occurred because the driver, whose vehicle hit the
student&#146;s car head on, had been under the influence of
amphetamines&#151;an illegal drug&#151;which he had been taking to
try to keep awake. Although taking amphetamines may have that
short-term effect, when it wears off a state of acute drowsiness
occurs. That is what happened in that case, and a young life was lost
on our roads as a result of a driver with illegal drugs in his
system.</p><p><a name="06100913000446">Sadly, such
an occurrence is far from unique. In 2000, the Transport Research
Laboratory published data on the percentage of drivers killed in motor
accidents who had illegal drugs in their body. I was amazed to discover
that 22.9 per cent. of drivers killed in motor accidents had illegal
drugs in their body.</p><p><a name="06100913000447"><b><a name="_spnew105"><a name="06100913001293">Paul
Rowen (Rochdale) (LD):</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain
what he means in his new clause by &#147;traces&#148;? In dealing
with other drugs such as alcohol, we state the limit. Does he accept
that this is an open-ended clause that could lead to anybody being
&#147;done&#148;, as with athletes who have minor traces of a drug
in their body which has no effect on performance
whatever?</p><p><a name="06100913000448"><b><a name="06100913001294">Mr.
Chope:</b> The question of the amount of the
drug is obviously a matter for mitigation, but as the hon. Gentleman
may know, at the moment, a train driver who has traces of an illegal
drug in their body is guilty of an offence and will probably lose their
job immediately. I know that the Liberal Democrats have a history of
being slightly soft on this subject, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will realise that, at the moment, there is a big anomaly, and that
there is everything to be said, in terms of road safety, for putting
those who drive other vehicles on a par with those who drive trains or
pilot aircraft.</p><br>

seeking to mount a successful prosecution of someone charged with
driving while unfit through the use of drugs. In particular, properly
proving that someone has cannabis in their system, and that it makes
them unfit to drive, is a real issue. I know that those who have
successfully defended such cases have been sympathetic to the problems
faced by the prosecution. When someone has traces of cannabis in their
body, it is often difficult to determine whether that is because they
passively smoked it as a passenger in a car in which it was being

Chamber who has any doubt about the gravity of this matter or about the
growth in drug-driving, I commend to them TRL report No. 495, because
it shows that since the 1980s the incidence of alcohol in road accident
fatalities has decreased, while the incidence of drugs has risen from
just over 7 per cent. to more than 22 per cent.&#151;and who can
doubt that it is probably even higher
now?</p><p><a name="06100913000458">In July this
year, <i> Auto Trader</i>, that well known magazine for those who are
interested in buying or selling motor vehicles, surveyed 2,100
motorists. One in seven of those surveyed admitted driving under the
influence of illegal drugs, and one in 15 admitted having had an
accident or a near miss while so doing. That is pretty compelling
evidence. These are people who are responding to a survey and admitting
to that culpable behaviour. It may not be illegal behaviour, but they
are admitting to culpable behaviour and also to having taken illegal
drugs.</p><p><a name="06100913000459">Unfortunately,
that survey has been corroborated by other surveys. In June this year,
More Th&gt;n, a well known insurance company, surveyed more than 1,000
people between the ages of 25 and 35, and 21 per cent. of that sample
admitted driving after taking
drugs.</p><p><a name="06100913000460"><b><a name="06100913001303">Mr.
Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> The crux of the issue
is that &#147;The Highway Code&#148; has a prescribed limit for
alcohol, but with regard to drugs says only that one must not drive
under the influence of drugs and that taking illegal drugs is highly
dangerous. My hon. Friend&#146;s point that there should be zero
tolerance on this is totally
welcome.</p><p><a name="06100913000461"><b><a name="06100913001304">Mr.
Chope:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. In
case anyone thinks that this is just an English problem, I should say
that it is also a problem in Scotland. In 2000, a report published by
the Scottish Executive central research unit under the title
&#147;Recreational drugs and driving: a qualitative study&#148;
showed that 85 per cent. of club-goers in Scotland had at some time
driven after using illegal drugs. I do not know whether that is just
because of the cost or unavailability of buses or the cost of taxis in
Scotland, but it is a pretty staggering
statistic.</p><p><a name="06100913000462">We may not
need to go into the following area, but does drug use affect
one&#146;s driving? The British Medical Association has the following
opinion:</p><a name="brev_12"><a name="06100913001042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
known effects of cannabis are that it can impair co-ordination, visual
perception, tracking and vigilance. Impairment is also shown when
subjects are tested under simulated driving conditions. Studies report
that the majority of fatal cases with detected levels of cannabis are
compounded by alcohol. Alcohol alone, or in combination with cannabis,
increased impairment, accident rate and accident
responsibility.&#148;</p></ul><br>

illegal yet to smoke, although I see in tonight&#146;s <i> Evening
Standard</i> that it is proposed to make it illegal to smoke in the
open air in London. That is barking and disproportionate. What I am
talking about is what I see as a serious issue of people who are taking
illegal substances, thereby committing a criminal offence in itself,
and then compounding that by driving motor vehicles when they are
likely to be impaired as a result of having taken those drugs,
sometimes with alcohol, sometimes without, sometimes with a series of
different drugs. Fortunately, the police are taking it increasingly
seriously. The effect of cannabis and other drugs on people&#146;s
state of mind is an issue on which medical and expert opinion has
changed dramatically over recent years as a result of what we have seen
in our streets and towns where people have committed major crimes as a
result of being

David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on making his case so powerfully. There is a serious problem
with people driving under the influence of drugs. There is an offence
already of driving when ability is impaired by drink or drugs, and to
date the main problem in enforcement has been the absence of a roadside
test that is accurate enough in detecting the presence of drugs in a
person&#146;s body. Does the hon. Gentleman intend to deal with how
we will detect and therefore enforce his proposed

Chope:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his

point, I should just add that this summer Cleveland police felt it
necessary to take out television advertising in their area in order to
warn drivers about the consequences of taking drugs and then getting
behind the wheel of a
vehicle.</p><p><a name="06100913000467">The
Government recognise that we have a serious problem and that is why
under schedule 7 to the Road Traffic Act 2003 new powers were provided
for the police to carry out impairment tests at the roadside. The
problem is that the equipment for doing that is not up to the job, and
we also have evidence from a study by Glasgow university that in one
third of cases the equipment is not even capable of detecting those who
have illegal drugs in their system.</p><p><a name="06100913000468">To take up the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, new equipment is now available. It is
colloquially called a drugalyser, and it is already being used
effectively in Germany, Switzerland, Australia, and, for all I know, in
other countries as well. It is, in essence, a hand-held device. It can
detect cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine, and from one swab of saliva a
police officer can test for a single drug in 90 seconds at the
roadside, and he can test for more complex cocktails in six minutes.
That is pretty astonishing to me, and it shows the extent to which the
new technology has changed over the past couple of years, which we as
legislators should take

that really led to the change in the law, replacing the impairment test
for driving with drink in the system with a test for excess alcohol,
because we could measure the amount of alcohol in the blood or in the
breath.</p><p><a name="06100913000469"><b><a name="06100913001309">Mrs.
Dunwoody:</b> I am listening carefully, because the hon.
Gentleman has an extremely important point to make. However, I am a
little worried that he does not seem to be addressing the problem of
people who take medicinal drugs and do not treat them as though they
have an effect on their driving ability when it is clear that they do
so. Does he envisage some extension beyond simply the drugs that he has
mentioned so that the amount in the bloodstream can be
assessed?</p><p><a name="06100913000470"><b><a name="06100913001310">Mr.
Chope:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. I would
like the Government to acknowledge this issue first, which is about
illegal drugs, although it is important in road safety education that
we should emphasise that people who are taking prescribed drugs should
be very careful about continuing to carry on their recreational or
professional driving. The Government have done some work on the issue,
and there has been some talk about new labelling on some prescribed
drugs to warn about their effect and about possible impairment while
driving, but that is a large and separate issue. If the House will
forgive me, I do not want to go down that route, because there is a
more easily detectable and distinct area of criminality. I do not want
to criminalise people who are on prescription drugs and who unwittingly
find that those drugs adversely affect their driving, whereas people
who deliberately take illegal drugs and then go driving are more
culpable.</p><p><a name="06100913000471">Returning to
1967, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr.
Cameron) was one year old, the Road Safety Act introduced the
breathalyser and the concept of making it illegal to drive with excess
alcohol. The legislation recognised that proving impairment by making
people walk along a white line, which required police officers to
supervise, monitor and assess the test, was disproportionate to the
problem on the roads, which involved too many drivers having excess
alcohol in their blood and on their breath. The law was altered to
reflect changing technology and a change in society, which wanted a
tougher line to be
taken.</p><p><a name="06100913000472">The situation
is similar 39 years later. We have an increasing problem of people
driving after having taken illegal drugs, which has resulted in carnage
on the roads. For example, the RAC Foundation has said that one of the
main contributory factors to the large increase in fatalities among
young people on the roads is the use of the dangerous cocktail of drugs
and
alcohol.</p><p><a name="06100913000473"><b><a name="06100913001311">Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a
good point, but I want to return to the point raised by the hon. Member
for Rochdale (Paul Rowen). The hon. Gentleman has prayed in aid the
1967 legislation, which concerns excess alcohol in the blood. The
problem involves the thresholds for such measurements, because

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 72</b><br>some illegal drugs, such as heroin, can be present in the body for
between three and six months after use. I suspect that most medical
experts would recognise that the presence of heroin in the body of
someone who last used the drug three months earlier would not impair
their driving. Although the act of taking the drug is illegal, it would
be made a further illegal act under new clause
1.</p><p><a name="06100913000474"><b><a name="06100913001312">Mr.
Chope:</b> Many people take the view that their driving is not
impaired when they are over the excess alcohol limit. In order to cut
through such arguments, Parliament decided to introduce an arbitrary
cut-off limit, which relates to a lawful substance. However, we are
discussing unlawful and illegal substances, the possession or use of
which are criminal offences in themselves. If we were to introduce a
law under the umbrella of road traffic legislation that deterred people
from taking illegal drugs, a double benefit would arise. We are not
comparing like with like when we compare alcohol with drugs, because
one substance is lawful and the other is
not.</p><p><a name="06100913000475">As I have said,
it is already illegal to take such drugs, so if people take illegal
drugs and get behind the wheel of a car, lorry or motorcycle, why
should it not be an offence? New clause 1 would send out a strong
message about the use of illegal drugs. One consequence of the 1967 Act
was that Parliament gave an excuse to the weak-willed who were
pressurised into drinking and driving. It allowed them to say,
&#147;I am sorry, but I am not going to have another drink, because I
am going to drive.&#148; If we pass new clause 1 into law tonight, we
will send clubbers and other young people a similar message, which will
allow them to turn to their friends and say, &#147;I am not going to
take any drugs, because I am going to be at the wheel of a car tonight
and do not want to cause an accident or injury, to lose my licence or
to suffer a penalty.&#148; New clause 1 would reinforce some
important
messages.</p><p><a name="06100913000476">It
is encouraging that my proposal has attracted wide support. More than
90 per cent. of those surveyed by <i> Auto Trader</i> acknowledged that
drug-driving is dangerous; 80 per cent. acknowledged that punishments
for drug-drivers are too lenient; and 80 per cent. supported roadside
testing for drugs. Perhaps most encouragingly of all, the insurance
firm More Th&gt;n found that if we were to introduce roadside tests,
more than one third of those who were surveyed and who currently take
drugs and drive would be deterred from so doing, which would result in
a one third reduction in drug-driving at a stroke. That would be a
substantial win for road safety, which is sufficient justification for
new clause 1 in itself. The RAC 2006 motoring report states that 55 per
cent. of respondents named drug-driving as one of the top three road
safety issues, and the RAC believes that drug-driving could be as
prevalent and dangerous as
drink-driving.</p><p><a name="06100913000477">Today,
a demonstration has taken place outside Parliament by people who think
that we do not discuss the issues that matter to the British people.
This debate is an example of an issue that affects the British people.
The issue is getting worse, and it has affected so many lives and
caused untold misery. I therefore hope that both Opposition Members and
Government Members will not hesitate to support new clause
1.</p><br>

the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety&#151;although
I no longer chair the conference, I am still a member&#151;on
drug-driving. On the day, the big issue was the one that I raised in my
intervention on the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)
about reliable forms of roadside detection for use by the police. At
that conference, a manufacturer made a presentation about the latest
product, which is used to perform the tests that, as the hon. Member
for Christchurch has said, are available in some European Union
countries.</p><p><a name="06100913000479">I was a
member of the Standing Committee that considered the Criminal Justice
Act 2003, which included a requirement for the police to test for drugs
when releasing people from custody, whether or not the offence with
which such people had been charged or arrested involved drugs. Stafford
police station was one of the pilots for that testing, which allowed me
to see what was then the up-to-date technology. I made several visits
over a period of months, during which time the technology changed from
the analysis of swabs taken from inside the mouth to the analysis of
swabs taken from the sweat on the palm of someone&#146;s hand, so the
technology is developing all the time. As the hon. Member for
Christchurch has said, the technology is catching up, and it allows us
to introduce a provision such as new clause 1. However, I suspect that
a final product is a little way away, and we need to obtain approvals
similar to those for breath tests for
alcohol.</p><p><a name="06100913000480">We also need
to debate the precise wording of the law. I have been impressed by the
arguments about thresholds, and we need to debate the issues of people
who take legally prescribed drugs that contain as a base a drug that is
illegal in another form and people whose blood contains a low level of
a drug that would not impair a driver. I await the Minister&#146;s
response to those points with interest.</p><p><a name="06100913000481">New clause 30
concerns drink-driving and the legal limit for alcohol in a
driver&#146;s blood, urine or breath. Today&#146;s amendment stands
in the names of several Liberal Democrat Members. I tabled similar
amendments to the previous Bill that we debated before the general
election. The Minister will see that I have given up trying to persuade
him to accept such an amendment. I recognise that his objection is
solid, but that does not mean that I agree with his judgment that we do
not need to change the law. In summary, his view is this: we have a
robust law with firm penalties, but some people exceed the maximum
legal limit by a great deal and cause many deaths, so they are the top
priority for enforcement, and when we have got them off our roads to a
satisfactory degree, perhaps we can consider changing the
limit.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_11"><a name="06100913001053">6.30

appreciably; neither is the number of breath tests carried out by

the police a new power on the targeted use of breath tests in order to
catch the very people whom my hon. Friend has talked about, but he
resisted it. I see no signs that we are cracking

on top of that problem, we will never address the issue raised by new
clause 30. In the meantime, people are dying on our roads because there
are people just exceeding the current limit who would, by any
reasonable estimate, adjust their drinking and driving if the law were
changed. PACTS commissioned a study that found that reducing the limit
from 80 mg to 50 mg would save about 65 lives a year and save about 230
people a year from serious injury. That is why most of the road safety
lobby and the British Medical Association support an amendment such as
new clause 30.</p><p><a name="06100913000483">Although my hon. Friend can be
congratulated on some further reductions in road casualties in the 2005
statistics, and although one of those is a fall in fatalities due to
drink-driving since 2004, I hope that he will not rely on that as an
argument for his approach. In 1998, there was a low of 460 in the
number of deaths caused by drinking and driving. In 2000, that figure
rose to 530, and by 2004 it had reached 590. There is a clear trend of
rising deaths owing to drink-driving. In 2005, there was at last a
reduction to 560, but that is still high by historical standards, and
at a time when the overall figures are showing a reduction in people
killed and seriously injured year on year. Something is seriously wrong
when drink-driving deaths are not falling in line with all the other
reductions.</p><p><a name="06100913000484"><b><a name="06100913001314">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Even on the figures that my hon. Friend has given
us, if 65 people had between 50 and 80 mg of alcohol in their blood,
495 had more than 80 mg. That is why I argue that at this stage it is
better to try to deal with the 495 than to worry about the
65.</p><p><a name="06100913000485"><b><a name="06100913001315">Mr.

which we must take action to keep the trend in road deaths going
downwards. My point is that the trend in drink-driving deaths is not
going downwards, unlike all the others. More therefore needs to be done
in terms of lowering the drink-drive limit, giving the police the power
of targeted breath testing at the roadside to detect these people,
rehabilitating drink-driving offenders, and introducing an alco-locks
pilot. All those together, as a programme, will make a difference. The
Minister is saying, &#147;Until I&#146;ve solved one problem,

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 75</b><br>We have won that argument. We have reduced the number of deaths on our

by adopting a limit of 50 mg in blood instead of our limit of 80 mg. I
am not suggesting that we have to follow others, but we are falling
behind the rest of the civilised world in our limits despite having led
the way in introducing them in the first place. The Minister should
give more thought to ensuring that combating deaths due to drinking and

respect.</p><p><a name="06100913000489"><b><a name="_spnew113"><a name="06100913001318">Mr.
Owen Paterson (North Shropshire) (Con):</b> I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and my
right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)
on tabling the new clause, which represents our policy on the previous
incarnation of the Bill which fell at the general election.</p><p><a name="06100913000490">Research shows that almost a
quarter of those killed in road traffic accidents have illegal drugs in
their bloodstream. There have been an increasing number of accidents in
which the presence of drugs in the driver&#146;s body may have been a
contributory factor in the cause of the crash. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch said, drug-driving is most common among 20 to
24-year-olds, and clubbers are particularly prone to taking control of
a car in a chemically altered state. As a survey by the Scottish
Executive showed, well over 80 per cent. of clubbers have driven after
recreational drug use, often under the misguided apprehension that
drugs can improve their driving skills. In fact, as the BMA and other
authorities have shown, commonly taken illegal drugs such as cannabis
cause concentration to wander, affect reaction times, and can cause
paranoia, drowsiness, distorted perception and a sense of
disorientation, all of which could lead to loss of control at the
wheel.</p><p><a name="06100913000491">Cannabis is
the most commonly traced drug, with more than 800,000 people travelling
under its influence every year. A study produced by the Transport
Research Laboratory established that people who drove a car at 66 mph
had a stopping distance of about 270 ft, but after smoking a joint that
increased on average by15 per cent. to 310 ft. In a slalom
test, those who had just smoked a joint knocked over 30 per cent. more
cones. Similarly, cocaine is a psychostimulant that leads to misjudging
driving speeds and stopping distances and gives a distorted sense of
light and sound and a feeling of overconfidence. My hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch mentioned amphetamines, but ketamines, LSD and
magic mushrooms also strongly influence the senses and give drivers a
sense of unreality, placing themselves and other road users in
danger.</p><p><a name="06100913000492">As the hon.
Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) said, there has been a
problem with detection, but I understand that detection methods have
dramatically improved. It could be said that one advantage of these
drugs is that they remain detectable for longer than alcohol. The urine
test EMIT&#151;enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique&#151;can
establish the presence of amphetamines for up to two to four days; that

weeks; that of cannabinoids for three to 30 days; that of cocaine for
two to four days; that of opiates for two to four days, and that of
anabolic steroids for up to 14 days. The technology has moved on and my
hon. Friends&#146; proposals are therefore considerably more
practical.</p><p><a name="06100913000493">We have
slipped behind other countries. A meeting of the International Council
on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety took place in 2002, with
representatives of 16 nations and 12 US states. It established that
most statutes required proof of impairment owing to the use of an
illegal drug. That legislative approach has been difficult to enforce,
because proving that the drug caused the impairment has been a major
problem. Germany, Belgium and eight US states have established a per se
law, which avoids having to prove impairment due to the drug. That
approach allows the prosecution to be based solely on the analytic
detection of drugs in body fluids such as blood or urine.</p><p><a name="06100913000494">The Belgian
experience shows how a country got a grip on the problem, developed a
strategic plan, gradually changed legislation, overcame a myriad
political problems and implemented a comprehensive drug-driving
strategy. The result is that, sadly, we have fallen behind. The
detection rate for drugged driving is much higher in Norway&#151;750
cases per million inhabitants. In Finland, it is 190 cases per million
inhabitants; in Sweden, it is90 cases per million, whereas we
are down at 30 cases per million. Conservative Members believe that the
technology has caught up. Other countries have shown what can be done
and we will support new clause 1 if it is pressed to a vote.</p><p><a name="06100913000495">The hon. Member for Halifax
(Mrs. Riordan) is not here and perhaps she will therefore
not press new clause 5. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Indeed, perhaps she has
fallen asleep. A diagnosed narcoleptic is required to declare his
condition to the DVLA and failure to do so voids his insurance cover.
The DVLA will generally issue a temporary licence to a narcoleptic,
renewable every three years, provided that the applicant&#146;s GP
can satisfy the DVLA that the condition is controlled by treatment. If
that were properly enforced, it would appear to cover the intention of
new clause 5. I shall be interested in the Minister&#146;s comments
on that.</p><p><a name="06100913000496">I had a most
interesting visit to an organisation called TTC group&#151;Telford
Training Consultants&#151;during the recess. It managed to get itself
on the front page of our local papers by pointing out that the new pub
opening hours were sweeping up a large number of people who were
unaware that, although they behaved responsibly, they had alcohol in
their blood that put them over the limit. I was told of a case of a
highly responsible person&#151;a police constable&#151;who had gone
out for a curry, been measured in the amount that he drank,

points. First, 10 years ago, wines were 9 per cent. alcohol by volume
whereas they now average 12.5 to 13 per cent. Secondly, the group

standard or small glass. I cannot believe that many hon. Members in the

is nearly half a pint. The group did a demonstration with differently
shaped glasses. The shapes were deceptive. I benefited from that brief
introduction, and it was proved that re-educating offenders reduced
recidivism by 50 per cent. Such courses are of low cost to the
taxpayer. Those who go on them have to pay &#163;100 and &#163;150.
I would prefer to go down that route rather than chase a tight
target.</p><p><a name="06100913000498">I appreciate
that the hon. Member for Stafford has spent much time on the matter,
which he raised in Committee. However, trying to reduce the figure from
80 mg to 50 mg when we are struggling to enforce80 mg is not
the right way to proceed. I should like the effort to be put into
re-education, and I believe that the Government share that
view.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_12"><a name="06100913001054">6.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06100913000499">Bluntly, we
need more traffic policemen. They have declined from 9,201 in 1997 to
7,103. Conservative Members believe that more active enforcement is the
way ahead. Let us get 80 mg established. We have made massive progress
but rather than trying to screw the figure down to 50 mg, education and
more active enforcement are more sensible uses of Government
time.</p><p><a name="06100913000500">The retesting
requirement in new clause 39 would not be used in the context of
testing skills but is simply an addition to section 36 of the Road
Traffic Offenders Act 1988, which lists convictions, and requires,
after obligatory or discretionary disqualification, the court to
instruct the person who has been convicted to take another test. I do
not like the idea of taking a driving test being part of the
punishment. Again, I prefer the route of education. The little bit of
extra research that I have done since I went to Telford convinced me
that education would be more effective.</p><p><a name="06100913000501">Amendment No. 51 deals with
alco-locks. The matter was raised in Committee and Conservative
Members&#146; opinion has not changed. I know that the Minister does
not like my rattling off stuff from the internet so I shall not go into
detail at length. Evidence from the United States, Australia and Canada
shows a 40 per cent. or even a 90 per cent. reduction in the rate of
drink-driving repeat offences. However, that appears to happen only as
long as the alco-locks are in place. In Europe, where we are only
beginning to establish such programmes, the Swedes have a programme
with 900 drink-driving offenders, but because they have been so strict,
almost a third of the participants have dropped out. France is about to
introduce a pilot project in Annecy and we have not even started. We
fear that the programmes are a bit of a distraction.</p><p><a name="06100913000502">In Belgium,
the Belgian Institute for Road Safety has produced a report. Under the
heading, &#147;Effectiveness. Has the project reached its
objective?&#148;, it reported that no project results were available
for evaluation. We believe that it is a little early to decide about
such projects. They could be a distraction and, again, we would like
the effort put into re-education because when the locks are removed, we
believe that the hardcore cases will revert. We are also convinced that
a strong sentence&#151;a short, sharp shock&#151;could be more
effective.</p><p><a name="06100913000503">That is a
quick canter through our thoughts on the group of the
amendments.</p><br>

Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) tabled and I want to
contribute to
that.</p><p><a name="06100913000505">The hon. Member
for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) approaches the matter from much
the same viewpoint as me. Although I have a great deal of sympathy with
the issue that the hon. Member for Christchurch raises, it struck me
that current provisions in the Road Traffic Act 1988 catch many of the
different scenarios relating to driving while unfit through the
influence of drink or drugs that he outlined. Some related practical
matters require further attention and I shall deal with them shortly.
However, I continue to be worried by the lack of precision in new
clause 1 to enable individual citizens to regulate their conduct
according to it.</p><p><a name="06100913000506">My
hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) sought clarification
of a &#147;trace&#148;. That can vary greatly between drugs. My
recollection from my days of studying forensic medicine some years ago
is that lysergic acid, for example, can remain traceable in the body
for up to six months. Reference has also been made to heroin, which can
remain in the body for between three and six
months.</p><p><a name="06100913000507"><b><a name="06100913001320">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there
is no mention in new clause 1 of the amount of the illegal drug. Would
he accept, however, that no minimum sentence would be attached to such
an offence either? Someone with a trace of such a drug in their body
that was deemed by experts to be fairly minimal could therefore be
dealt with appropriately by the courts.</p><p><a name="06100913000508"><b><a name="06100913001321">Mr.
Carmichael:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right; that is a perfectly fair point. However, I do not
think that we should be quite so blas&#233; about creating offences
that would have enormous resource implications for the courts and for
police time if the benefit to be derived from them were not
proportionate. If we sought to prosecute everyone who was found to be
driving with a trace of an illegal drug in their body, it would take up
an enormous amount of court time&#151;and to what
effect?</p><p><a name="06100913000509">We are dealing
with the Road Safety Bill, and it is entirely appropriate that we
should have regard to the test that we have always had: that of a
person&#146;s fitness to drive being impaired through the use of
drink or drugs. Drink and drugs are relevant to road safety because
they impair a person&#146;s fitness to drive, and once we move away
from that simple test, we open up a whole range of conduct for
examination. It would be very easy for someone to say that they did not
know that there would still be a trace of drink or drugs in their
bloodstream.</p><p><a name="06100913000510">The hon.
Member for Christchurch referred to train drivers and pilots, but I
cannot recall the existence of any criminal offence in that context. If
he can enlighten me on that, I will be interested, but I cannot think
of an instance in which a pilot or train driver would be guilty of a
criminal offence merely by having a trace of drink or drugs in their
body. If he or she were unfit to drive or fly through having used them,
that would of course be a different matter. Pilots, train drivers and
others who are found, through a work place testing

caught by their employer&#146;s disciplinary procedures, but that
does not involve a criminal offence. Once we start to blur the
distinction between a criminal offence and a disciplinary offence under
employment law, we will be going down a dangerous track.</p><p><a name="06100913000511">I should like to say a word or
two in defence of the present approach in road traffic law, which
places the emphasis on impairment and unfitness to drive. This point
was also made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr.
Burrowes), and I am sorry that he is no longer here, because, as a
court practitioner, he has an important contribution to make to the
debate. In practical terms, there is usually a reasonable ground for a
driver to be stopped&#151;normally that of erratic or defective
driving. Thereafter, a breath test will almost certainly be carried
out. If that test is negative, the police officer involved should
surely look for another reason for the impairment. All sorts of other
symptoms might be present, including dilated pupils or slurred speech,
depending on the illegal substance in question. My recollection from my
time as a criminal court solicitor and as a prosecutor is that a
lengthy checklist is gone through, which would thereafter entitle the
officer to arrest the person and take them back to the police station
where the full impairment test could be undertaken.</p><p><a name="06100913000512">As the hon. Member for
Christchurch rightly said, a number of much more sophisticated devices
are now on the market, and I hope that they will be tested and, if
appropriate, approved for use by the Department for Transport. All
these factors will improve the workability of the present law on
unfitness to drive as a result of the use of drink or drugs. I am not
without sympathy for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal, and I
certainly do not underestimate the scale of the difficulty facing us in
relation to drug- driving, but I remain to be convinced that his new
clause is the panacea that he suggests. It could create problems as
well as solutions.</p><p><a name="06100913000513"><b><a name="06100913001322">Mr.
Bone:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that the testing
equipment is not good enough to trace drugs, or that the new clause is
not a good proposal because it uses the term &#147;traces&#148; of
illegal drugs? Would he be happier if a limit, such as that relating to
alcohol consumption, were included in the
proposal?</p><p><a name="06100913000514"><b><a name="06100913001323">Mr.
Carmichael:</b> No, I approach this from the point of view of
first principles. The reason that we arrived at what has been described
as the rather arbitrary limit for alcohol was that it was decided that
that was the level at which a driver&#146;s ability to respond would
be impaired. The question of a limit is therefore consistent with the
general approach of punishing those who drive while unfit through their
taking of drink or drugs. I cannot as yet envisage a mechanism by which
it would be possible to set a similar level for illegal substances. It
might happen, but I think that it is highly unlikely. We shall probably
always rely on the question of fitness to drive in relation to
drug-driving. There is a lot more to be done on the training of police
officers, prosecutors and the judiciary as to what constitutes fitness
to drive

assessing fitness in the way proposed in the new clause is unnecessary
and would be a step too far.</p><p><a name="06100913000515">The hon. Member for Stafford
referred to new clause 30, which he supported tonight. Indeed, he has
supported similar proposals many times in the past. He has already made
many of the points that I was going to make, and I shall not reiterate
them. The Department for Transport has demonstrated through its own
research that there could be a reduction of about 50 fatalities and 250
serious injuries per year if the Government were to adopt this measure.
The hon. Gentleman was quite right to say that the Minister sets up a
false choice by suggesting that we can target either those who are
grossly over the limit or those who fall into the rather narrower band.
I happen to think that, for very little additional effort and use of
resources by the police and the prosecution services, it would be worth
saving those 50 lives and preventing those 250 serious injuries every
year. As the hon. Gentleman also said, the proposed lower limit would
bring the United Kingdom into line with virtually every other country
in western Europe.</p><p><a name="06100913000516">New clause 39 would bring
within the ambit of section 36 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988
all those offences that involve driving while under the influence of
alcohol. We are proposing a fairly measured response here, by seeking
to introduce a requirement for someone who has been disqualified from
driving for a drink-driving offence to re-sit their driving test before
they are given their licence back. The proposal would apply to anyone
who received a sentence of disqualification in excess of the minimum
12-month period under section 5 of that Act. This reflects a practice
that has already been adopted in many courts up and down the country in
all the jurisdictions that make up the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06100913000517">We should
also have regard to how road traffic law has developed in a wider
context. There is something profoundly anomalous about a new driver
with six points on his or her licence, as a result of perhaps two
speeding offences, being required to re-sit the test as a result of the
new drivers&#146; regulations while somebody who has been convicted
of a drink-driving offence that merits more than the minimum sentence
of disqualification does not have to go through the same
procedure.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_13"><a name="06100913001055">7

50, 51, 53, 52 and 54 deal with the use of alcohol ignition interlocks,
or AILs, which the Government are, bravely and quite rightly, bringing
into use through the Bill. However, I have severe reservations about
how they are doing that, because introducing the use of AILs&#151;or
alcolocks, as they are more colloquially known&#151;as a mechanism by
which somebody might reduce the period of disqualification sends out
the worst possible signal. The development of those devices offers us
particular opportunities, but we are in danger of missing them by using
AILs in the way that the Government
suggest.</p><p><a name="06100913000519">The
amendments propose a period following disqualification in which the AIL
would be fitted at the disqualified person&#146;s expense, thereafter
ensuring a continued period of protection for the public following the
expiry of that disqualification. The proposal is not,

certain ways to get round it, but I say to the Minister that it would
be a further defence that would enable the effort to be targeted on
those who pose the greatest risk to our communities&#151;the repeat
offenders.</p><p><a name="06100913000520">By erecting
that further barrier and by making things difficult for such people, we
would have the opportunity to reduce the number of people who come
before the courts as repeat drink-drivers. That has been borne out by
research in other parts of the world. The hon. Member for North
Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) touched on that in referring to a
90 per cent. reduction. That is, in fact, a 90 per cent. reduction in
reoffending rates, which the Traffic Injury Research Foundation of
Canada found to have taken place after the trial of an AIL in that
jurisdiction. That also follows the experience in a number of states in
the United States, which have also taken results-based decisions to use
AILs following
trials.</p><p><a name="06100913000521">We commend and
support the Government on the introduction of AILs through the Bill,
but we believe that the manner in which they want to use them is not
appropriate and can be improved. I hope that the Government will give
the closest possible consideration to the improvements outlined in our
amendmentsNos. 50 to
54.</p><p><a name="06100913000522"><b><a name="_spnew114"><a name="06100913001324">Mr.
Robert Syms (Poole) (Con):</b> I support my hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and new clause 1.
Technology has moved on, and we know that drugs are a real problem on
the road. I would like to hear from the Minister that there will at
least be more trials, or indeed more public education, on this very
important subject.</p><p><a name="06100913000523">On
the whole, Britain does not have a bad record in terms of the number of
people killed on the roads. Not that long ago, the figure was 5,000 a
year, but we have got it down to about 3,200. However, over the last
two or three years, we seem to have been stuck at that number. If we
are to drive that figure down further, which I think is what we all
want, we must focus on the reasons for people being killed on the
roads. Drugs are an important cause, as is alcohol and, in particular,
the hard core who break the current limit. We have to get much tougher
with them. We must also consider tyres, weather conditions, road design
and layout, and tiredness, all of which
contribute.</p><p><a name="06100913000524">One
consequence of relying a lot more on speed cameras and redeploying
people from traffic policing is that, although we might catch more
people speeding, we do not have the traffic policemen to look out for
tyres, tiredness and the other factors that sometimes cause accidents.
My hon. Friend raised an important point in that
context.</p><p><a name="06100913000525">There are
still doubts about the technology, and we have heard concerns about the
level of drugs in blood, but it is time that the House sent a message.
We ought to be trialling a lot more. The most compelling argument that
my hon. Friend made is that youngsters put under peer pressure to take
drugs could say, &#147;No, I&#146;m driving tonight. I am taking
you home and I&#146;m not going to do
it.&#148;</p><p><a name="06100913000526">We have

drinking to excess. We have changed attitudes on that issue, and we
have to change attitudes on drug taking, as well as to the practice of
people taking cocktails of drugs and alcohol and thinking that they can
get away with it.</p><p><a name="06100913000527">A
lot more has to be done. I hope that the Minister will at least say
that he has listened to what my hon. Friend said and perhaps make some
Government proposals on this important matter. We need to drive the
number of deaths on the roads down from the figure of 3,200 that we
seem to be stuck at, and we need to consider the range of issues that I
have raised if we are to achieve
that.</p><p><a name="06100913000528"><b><a name="06100913001325">Dr.
Ladyman):</b> I must take issue with the hon. Member for Poole
(Mr. Syms) about the figure for road deaths being stuck at
about 3,200. If he looks at the figures for the last two or three
years, he will see that they are again on a downward trend. Of course,
once a number of road deaths is reached&#151;albeit one that is still
way to high; I acknowledge that immediately&#151;that is, compared
with the distances travelled, the lowest in the world, it becomes
increasingly difficult to reduce the figure. We must expect that, and
we must expect the rate of improvement to slow. Nevertheless, we still
have that rate of improvement, and the hon. Gentleman is right in
saying that messages about drugs and about drug taking and driving will
play a key part.</p><p><a name="06100913000529">The
hon. Gentleman said that we need to do more to get the message across.
I say to him that, to get the message over on drug-driving, we try to
target those who are most likely to be drug-drivers. I might be wrong,
but I do not think that Conservative Members of Parliament are a target
group for that message, but young people are, so we target it on the
radio channels that young people listen to, pop concerts and other
places where young people
congregate.</p><p><a name="06100913000530">Our
evidence suggests that we are pretty good at targeting those messages,
and we hit that target group, but does that go far enough? No, it does
not. So, let me say to the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr.
Chope) that I entirely agree with the sentiments that he has put to us
tonight. If I was in a position to tell the House that there is a
robust method of detection and that there is agreement that there is a
correlation between the level of a drug in someone&#146;s system and
the level of impairment when driving, I would be here with a Government
proposal to introduce the measures to the House. However, we do not
have that robust system of detection and we do not have that agreement
on what is an appropriate level of drug taking to indicate impairment.
We are somewhat stuck over a way to move
forward.</p><p><a name="06100913000531">The hon.
Gentleman, in introducing the new clause, essentially told the House,
&#147;Look, we don&#146;t have agreement on what an appropriate
level is, so let&#146;s just say it&#146;s any level. If
it&#146;s any level, you&#146;re breaking the law.&#148; That is
entirely inconsistent with existing legislation, which requires a level
of impairment. In a moment, I shall come on to the problems of
detecting the amount of drugs in somebody&#146;s system, but I also
suggest that a key problem with detection is exactly what is being
detected.</p><br>

cannabis spends only a short period in the blood. Detection systems
therefore tend not to detect the active ingredient that would impair
driving. Detection systems detect a metabolite of cannabis that stays
in the blood for a long time. The presence of that metabolite in
someone&#146;s system does not, however, mean that their driving
performance would be impaired; it simply means that they have used
cannabis at some time in the previous few days. If one is trying to
devise a detection system for an employer who wants to make sure that
none of his employees has ever used drugs, it is a perfectly acceptable
test. The presence of the metabolite allows one to say that the person
has used drugs, although one does not know whether they used them
yesterday or last week. Therefore, if an employer has a policy not to
employ those who use drugs, he can say that he will no longer employ
that person. If one is trying to test whether someone&#146;s ability
to drive a car is impaired, however, testing for that metabolite is not
reasonable. That is one of the key problems with
detection.</p><p><a name="06100913000533"><b><a name="_spnew115"><a name="06100913001326">Mr.
Goodwill:</b> Does not the Minister think that, in practice,
the Crown Prosecution Service will take a view based on how successful
litigation has been? While it is illegal, for example, to steal things
in this country, one is unlikely to be prosecuted for stealing an
orange, but more likely to be prosecuted for stealing a lorry full of
oranges. The CPS will take a view based on the amount of drug or
metabolite in the person&#146;s system, as well as on whether the
person was stopped for a tail light being out or where multiple
injuries were involved. Does not he think that legal cases would set
the norm for such prosecutions?</p><p><a name="06100913000534"><b><a name="06100913001327">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but he is
tempting us into a minefield where the courts would be asked to judge
whether somebody&#146;s driving had been impaired as a result of drug
use that may have happened some considerable time previously or
passively rather than actively. I am told by the lawyers that it is
possession of drugs that is illegal in this country, and that if they
are in one&#146;s system, one is not legally in possession of them.
It is not as if a body of case law exists to suggest that because
people have particular metabolites in their system the courts may take
a view on whether they have been using drugs, as they will not
necessarily have broken the law or be prosecutable for it.</p><p><a name="06100913000535">I have been speaking about
cannabis, but there is a panoply of different drugs that could impair
one&#146;s performance. Many of the comprehensive sample tests, such
as sweat, saliva, urine or hair, are not technically accurate for
several drug groups. Where a blood sample is taken, analysis for all
the drug groups can be very expensive, and costs about &#163;1,000
per blood sample. How much resource are we going to devote to that
when, with the best will in the world, resources are limited?</p><p><a name="06100913000536">The hon.

can be used for roadside testing. I take issue with him on that. The
Home Office takes a view on such matters, and studies them regularly.
Its view is that there is not a robust test that can be used

known as ROSITA II was carried out to evaluate the usability and
analytical reliability of onsite saliva drug-testing devices. Although
that was an EU project, it also involved some non-European countries.
At the end of the study, it was concluded that no device was reliable
enough to be recommended for roadside screening of drivers. The report
acknowledged that experience in the state of Victoria, Australia, had
shown that random roadside oral fluid testing of drivers for
methamphetamine and cannabis had had a deterrent effect, but also
pointed to the risk that drivers will realise that the tests being used
are limited, and will therefore feel more confident about driving
without risk of detection. They will then start to use the drugs that
are not included in the panoply of roadside tests. If we send out the
message that we can test only for cannabis and methamphetamine, we can
expect drivers who have been using cocaine and other drugs to take to
the road.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_14"><a name="06100913001056">7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06100913000537">Unlike with
alcohol, there is no clear relationship between the amount of drug
taken and its impairing effect, with large variability between
individuals who have taken the same dose. Issues of drug tolerance and
withdrawal are additional problems. Some studies have found that the
risk of crashing for drivers with cannabis in their systems is lower
than for drivers with no drugs in their systems. Other studies find
that the risk of crashing for such drivers is between one and a half
and two and a half times that for sober divers. Evidence about the
crash risks associated with benzodiazepines is also mixed. The level of
risk tends to vary with the type of benzodiazepine and how long the
driver had been using it, with the greatest risk associated with early
use. Crash risk elevation is between 1.6 to five times that of a driver
with no drugs in their system. As hon. Members will probably be aware,
the relative crash risk for a driver above the current alcohol limit is
in the range of six to 10, so there is a clear disparity in relation to
the risk level among drivers using drugs.</p><p><a name="06100913000538">Clinical studies have tended to
be inconclusive because of ethical and safety considerations, so
studies have tended to use lower dosages of drug than might be taken by
typical users. The issue of drug control, of course, is dealt with
under other Government legislation, and I believe that that should
remain the case. For road safety, however, the dangers of drug misuse
extend to medication. I think that my hon. Friend the Chairman of the
Select Committee pointed that out. Drugs used every day, such as in
headache preparations, may also be taken contrary to pharmacological
guidelines. Benzodiazepines, which are found in commonly prescribed
tranquilisers, are possibly one of the most impairing drugs in drivers
when used improperly. Methadone, used for the treatment of heroin
addiction, is not illegal, but, if abused, it can impair. The current
law, under section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, deals with
that.</p><p><a name="06100913000539">I fully
recognise that right hon. and hon. Members do not seek to undermine the
existing legislation. It is important, however, that we do not give the
public a misleading impression that the proposed new offence is a
universal panacea for dealing with drug-driving. Rather than the zero
tolerance approach implied by the

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 85</b><br>new clause, the right response to the drug-driving problem must be to
try to establish legal limits to drugs, similar to those imposed for
alcohol&#151;levels that have been demonstrated to be impairing, or
at least beyond what could be attributed to medical treatment. I will
not pretend that that will be easy; if it were, it would have been done
already. World experts are not fully in agreement with each other, but
we can expect some convergence of views as more research is
done.</p><p><a name="06100913000540">In the
meantime, the priority must be to address detection. I am advised by
colleagues in the Home Office that a specification for a drug screener
will be issued shortly, which will mean that manufacturers can supply
devices to the police to help them identify drivers who are using
drugs. That will facilitate the process of obtaining an evidentiary
blood sample and reduce the costs of doing so. In due course, the
police should be able to give us more information about the prevalence
of drugs in the driving population and at accidents. On that basis, we
will be better armed to establish an absolute offence based on crash
risk, rather than having to rely as we do now on evidence of
impairment.</p><p><a name="06100913000541">In the light
of what I hope was a comprehensive response, I hope that the hon.
Member for Christchurch will be prepared to withdraw new clause 1. I
assure him once again that as soon as the science gives us the
information that we need, and as soon as robust roadside detection
devices are available that can be used by the police force under all
conditions, I will want legislation to be brought back to the House to
change the current position. Until such a time, however, it would be
foolhardy to proceed with his new clause.</p><p><a name="06100913000542">New clause 5 has not been
moved, but I acknowledge the comments of the hon. Member for North
Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who is right that the existing
law on sleep apnoea is sufficiently robust if properly
enforced.</p><p><a name="06100913000543">That brings
me to new clause 30, and the comments of the hon. Member for Orkney and
Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on drink-driving. I suspect that we
could argue about that for a very long time and never agree. I remain
convinced that it is right for us to enforce the current level of 80
mg. If we did that with any reasonable degree of success, we would save
several hundred lives on our roads. That would be better than focusing
on the 65 people involved in accidents&#151;only involved; not
necessarily a causal factor&#151;whose level was between 50 and 80
mg.</p><p><a name="06100913000544">Let me now say
something that may be controversial, and may even get me into a bit of
trouble. I believe that in some parts of the country the police have
dropped the ball on drink-driving, and are not enforcing the existing
80 mg level with the vigour that I would like to
see.</p><p><a name="06100913000545"><b><a name="_spnew116"><a name="06100913001328">David
T.C. Davies (Monmouth) (Con):</b> The Minister might be right
in saying that the police are finding it difficult to enforce the law
as they would like, but, as one who spent some time on the police
parliamentary scheme with him over the summer, may I suggest that that
may be partly because so many are seconded to squads set up by the
Government, or are filling in the plethora of forms that the Government
have provided for them?</p><br>

Ladyman:</b> I am rather sorry that I gave way to the hon.
Gentleman. He is talking absolute nonsense. The Government do not
second police officers on to anything. I suspect that if the Government
interfered in the life of the constabulary in that way, the hon.
Gentleman and his friends would table a great many emergency motions to
enable the House to discuss it.</p><p><a name="06100913000547">The Government agree targets
with police forces, which the Home Office accepts after thorough
consultation with its stakeholders because they reflect the views of
members of the public who want to see our streets policed safely. I
believe that in some constabularies the chief constables and police
authorities may well have got the balance wrong, and diverted too much
of their resource from roads policing to other areas of police
activity. If they have done that, it is not for me or for the
Government to intervene; it is for local people and the local police
authority to do so, and to make their views known.</p><p><a name="06100913000548">Any Member
who feels that the drink-driving law is not being properly enforced in
his or her area should raise the matter directly with the local
constabulary. I have raised the issue with the Association of Chief
Police Officers, and with the chief constable responsible for roads
policing. He is doing his best to convince his colleagues that there is
a significant gain for them from enforcing the rules properly. I have
undertaken publicly that once I am convinced that there is proper
enforcement at the 80 mg level, and believe that we have secured all
the benefit of enforcement at the 80 mg-plus level, we will be prepared
to reconsider and adopt the position of my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford on 50 mg. Until I have seen that effort start to pay
dividends, however, I believe that the resources are going to the right
place.</p><p><a name="06100913000549"><b><a name="06100913001330">Mr.
Paterson:</b> Will the Minister name the police authorities
and chief constables whom he has in
mind?</p><p><a name="06100913000550"><b><a name="06100913001331">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> No, and it is not for me to do so. I am a Kent
Member of Parliament, and if I had concerns about the constabulary of
Kent I would certainly express them; but it is for other Members to
make their views known, for me to raise the issues with ACPO, and for
ACPO to try to deal with matters
themselves.</p><p><a name="06100913000551"><b><a name="06100913001332">Mr.
Kidney:</b> In the last nine years, we have
changed the law in this place so that the Home Office can publish a
national policing plan containing the overarching priorities for all
police forces in the country. Do my hon. Friend&#146;s discussions
with Home Office Ministers include representations suggesting that the
plan should make roads policing a higher
priority?</p><p><a name="06100913000552"><b><a name="06100913001333">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I do raise that with my Home Office colleagues,
and roads policing is part of the national policing plan. If we
continue to have concerns about whether roads are being properly
policed, I shall have to raise the matter with them again and ensure
that it is addressed in future versions of the plan; but I hope that
the argument based on the reduction in casualties, and indeed the
strong link between criminality on the roads and general criminality,
will convince chief constables that they need to provide proper
resources.</p><p><a name="06100913000553">For all
those reasons, I urge the House to resist the proposal to reduce the
level further at this stage.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 87</b><br><p><a name="06100913000554">The Liberal Democrats, who
tabled new clause 39, raised the question of mandatory
disqualification. I believe that the new clause is among a number of
amendments inspired by the insurance branch of the Royal Bank of
Scotland. I am happy to congratulate the Liberal Democrats on their
interest in the matter and the work that they are doing. The views and
constructive ideas of stakeholders are always welcome, and I can see
the logic behind the proposal, but I simply do not accept
it.</p><p><a name="06100913000555">When the original
provisions of clause 36 were made following the road traffic
review&#151;the so-called North report&#151;it was decided that
while mandatory re-testing should apply to drivers who committed the
most serious road traffic offences, such as dangerous driving and
worse, it was less appropriate for drink-drivers, whose driving skills,
it might be argued, were less in question than their judgment about
drinking.</p><p><a name="06100913000556">I remind the
House that the vast majority of drink-drivers are disqualified for 12
to 18 months, during which time their driving skills may not diminish
as much as those of drivers who are disqualified for longer. More
recently, however, it has been considered that the worst drink-drivers
who were disqualified for longer periods, such as two years or more,
should be subject to a re-test because of the length of time for which
they were off the road. Clause 36 will enable that to be done by means
of secondary legislation, but it will be subject to further
consultation. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Member for Orkney
and Shetland will not press his new clause.</p><p><a name="06100913000557">Finally, let me deal with the
issue of alcohol ignition interlocks, which feature in a number of
amendments proposed, again, by the Royal Bank of Scotland. If I
understand correctly, their purpose is to impose a wider application of
alcohol interlock programmes by extending their availability to all
drink-drivers, and to require courts to impose orders unless they
believe that there is good reason for not doing
so.</p><p><a name="06100913000558">We currently want
to target the most serious offenders, and certainly those who cannot
stop themselves from reoffending. That is where we can expect both the
incentive and the commitment to participate fully, and, of course,
where we might expect to achieve the best accident risk reduction.
There may be a case for a more widespread application, but it has yet
to be made. Best practice advice based on research suggests that a
period of interlock use of less than a year is not likely to provide a
benefit, and for shorter periods the fixed costs of installation and
training may make it less
cost-effective.</p><p><a name="06100913000559">As for
making the scheme mandatory, I have some difficulty with the idea of
courts&#146; imposing such cost burdens on drivers, some of whom
would not have the financial means to undertake the programme. Such
drivers might have to sell their cars to pay for it. The Department
would welcome the opportunity to have further discussions with
insurance companies about drink-driving and other aspects of road
safety.</p><p><a name="06100913000560">I remind
Members that our proposal is modelled on the successful drink-drive
rehabilitation programme introduced by the last Administration in the
early 1990s and rolled out nationally by this Government in 2000. In

change their behaviour. We should be very cautious about deviating from
an approach that has served us well so far. I hope that the House will
reject those amendments as
well.</p><p><a name="06100913000561"><b><a name="06100913001334">Mr.
Chope:</b> We have had an excellent debate. The
Minister&#146;s was a classic &#147;Yes, Minister&#148; response.
As a former transport Minister, I congratulate his civil servants on
having taken to heart his brief, which was to try to find an objection
to every possible solution.</p><p><a name="06100913000562">Every Member recognises that
there is a real problem that needs to be addressed. It is causing the
loss of a great many lives on our roads, unnecessarily, every year. But
the Minister has come up with a whole lot of trivial objections. For
example, he says that we need to establish the correct level for
illegal drugs, but why do we need a legal limit for illegal drugs?
Surely any level of illegal drugs should be illegal and the law should
deal with it. What sort of message does the Government&#146;s talk on
this matter send out to young people who may be tempted to get into the
drugs
scene?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_15"><a name="06100913001057">7.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06100913000563">The Minister
says that there is a large variability of effects for the same dose
taken. Well, that is exactly the same argument that was used against
the breathalyser law. Perhaps you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, can
drink 10 pints without it having any effect on you, whereas some
colleagues might drink one pint and be paralytic. What are the
Government doing in resorting to that old, failed
argument?</p><p><a name="06100913000564">From the way
in which the Minister spoke about the difficulties of testing, anyone
would think that we did not have drug testing in prisons, schools and
in sport&#151;all promoted by the Government. So why cannot we have
drug testing at the roadside? That is what the new clause is about. My
Front-Bench colleague was absolutely right to draw our attention to the
statistics that show that the proportion of drivers detected and
prosecuted for drug-driving in this country is far below that of other
countries. That is not because we do not have drug-driving, but because
the Government are not dealing with the problem.</p><p><a name="06100913000565">I believe in joined-up
government, but what we have had from the Minister is a silo mentality,
whereby drugs issues are viewed as nothing to do with his Department. I
would like to see his Department deal with drug taking and drug use
alongside the Home Office. One way of achieving that would be to make
it an offence for anyone to be at the wheel of a car with illegal
substances in their body. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member
for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) for making it clear that
the Opposition will support the new clause. I hope that many Government
Members will join us, too.</p><p><a name="06100913000566"><i> Question put, </i>That the

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 93</b><br>We were sure that the Government had seen some sense; with the Lords
accepting the amendment, it seemed that the Government would let it
ride.</p><p><a name="06101011000026">There
were arguments in Committee about whether this very minor change could
be brought in at the earliest possible stage. I pay due regard to my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), who tabled
an amendment in Committee to ensure that this measure could be
introduced as early as 2007. Not only did the Government not accept it,
they voted against clause stand part, meaning that we had no
opportunity to introduce this very minor but important
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101011000027">I will not
speak for very long. I hope that the Government have rethought their
position, but I want to deal with some of the canards relating to this
very small change. The biggest stumbling block appears to be that if we
made the change we would be outwith some marvellous EU ability to deal
with the matter. However, it appears that the EU is likely to accept
the placing of retro-reflective materials on the side of heavy goods
vehicles. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East raised a
point of order, as did the hon. Member for North Shropshire
(Mr. Paterson), to point out, in the nicest possible way,
that what the Minister was saying was not the whole truth. Italy has
passed the measure into law and the EU does not appear to be chasing
Italy around. Italy does not seem to be having difficulties; it is to
be congratulated on getting on with this minor but important
change.</p><p><a name="06101011000028"><b><a name="06101011001288">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Italy
did move on this matter, but there were objections to that not only
from Great Britain, but from France and Germany. The European
Commission is almost certainly&#151;it has started the preliminary
stages&#151;about to begin infraction proceedings against Italy. As I
have said repeatedly, no matter how strong the merits of
retro-reflective tapes, we have to conform to ECE regulations. We
cannot move ahead of those regulations without facing the same measures
that Italy will
face.</p><p><a name="06101011000029"><b><a name="06101011001289">Mr.
Drew:</b> I am not sure that that helps, but it does put the
matter into perspective. If we are to proceed at the speed of the
slowest vehicle&#151;in this case, the EU&#151;we are all doomed.
This is a simple measure and it makes sense to do it now to save lives.
If the argument is that we must proceed at the speed of the EU, it is a
crass abdication of responsibility. This should be introduced
now.</p><p><a name="06101011000030"><b><a name="06101011001290">David
T.C. Davies:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree therefore that
slow moving and overloaded juggernauts should be removed from the

possible?</p><p><a name="06101011000031"><b><a name="06101011001291">Mr.
Drew:</b> If only we had that power. I will stick to the
retro-reflective tape, if the hon. Gentleman does not
mind.</p><p><a name="06101011000032">I
wish to address other canards. It is argued that the measure would be
too costly. All the research&#151;including the Government&#146;s
research done by Loughborough university, for which I am grateful,
because I have been pursuing the issue for more than two
years&#151;suggests that this is not a cost issue. The addition of
&#163;100 will not break the bank for those buying new vehicles worth
&#163;100,000.</p><br>

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 94</b><br><p><a name="06101011000033">I would like to go much further;
we could do more retrospective work. Another canard is that such
changes will make very little difference, but the evidence shows that
although accident rates are declining, the rate of accidents involving
heavy goods vehicles has increased by 8 per cent. There is also
evidence that the greatest threat is at night. Many heavy goods
vehicles are well lit, but not all, and the minimum we expect is that
British HGVs have the tape fitted to make them clearly visible and
further to decrease the number of road traffic accidents. I do not
understand why the Government are so reluctant to accept that point. As
Lord Berkeley said in the other place, this issue is a
&#147;no-brainer&#148;. It is a straightforward minor measure, but
the Government have got very steamed up about it.</p><p><a name="06101011000034">The final canard is that the
pressure to adopt the measure comes from those who manufacture the
tape. I have worked with lobbyists on the issue, but if it saves
people&#146;s lives it is appropriate for the industry to promote it.
Many companies have already installed the tape, and drivers and
cyclists&#151;as I am&#151;know that it can be seen clearly at
night. That gives cyclists especially a chance to get out of the way.
Too many accidents are caused because people simply do not see the
poorly lit vehicles that do not have the appropriate reflective
tape.</p><p><a name="06101011000035">This is a minor
road safety measure that could make a difference and I plead with the
Government to accept it. Everyone seems to want it and I suspect that
opposition to it comes from within the road transport lobby, although I
do not know. That lobby is split on the issue, and given that
people&#146;s lives are at risk, we should be prepared to make our
case. Otherwise, we will be surrendering to the basest instincts and I
am not prepared to do
so.</p><p><a name="06101011000036"><b><a name="_spnew118"><a name="06101011001292">Mr.
Paterson:</b> I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for
Stroud (Mr. Drew), who managed to get his name down first on
our amendment. We are happy to join him, because this is a ridiculous
situation. We debated the issue at some length in Committee and the
facts are clear. Indeed, the Minister agrees with us. We had all-party
support, because everybody agrees that night-time collisions are a
problem.</p><p><a name="06101011000037">In 2001,
there were 9,000 collisions in which an HGV was struck by another
vehicle. In 34 per cent. of those cases, the HGV was struck on the
side. Research by the university of Darmstadt found that 37 per cent.
of all collisions with trucks at night occurred because they were seen
too late. The same study also found that adding retro-reflective
contour markings reduced accidents involving trucks and passenger cars
in conditions of poor visibility by 95 per cent. In the USA, where
retro-reflective markings are mandatory, side and rear impact
collisions involving HGVs have fallen by 41 per cent. The Loughborough
report, which was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, showed that fitting
ECE 104 markings to new HGVs would cost about &#163;100, or just
0.001 per cent. of the vehicle&#146;s
cost.</p><p><a name="06101011000038">The measure is
inevitable. As long ago as 2004, the Commission recommended that all
new HGVs in the EU weighing over 3.5 tonnes should be fitted with ECE
104 retro-reflective tape. It is not only the Italians who have broken
ranks. They went ahead and imposed this simple measure, which has a
remarkable impact, and

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 95</b><br>the Greeks, Spanish and French are also considering similar action. The
Dutch transport safety board has also recommended the compulsory use of
retro-reflective contour marking. We do not, therefore, understand why
our Government are being so timid. I am astonished that the Minister
said that he had been involved in action against the Italians. That is
bizarre.</p><p><a name="06101011000039">The total
cost of road accidents in 2001 was&#163;17.76 billion. The
markings cost only &#163;100 per lorry, but the cost of having a
lorry off the road is &#163;212 a
day.</p><p><a name="06101011000040"><b><a name="06101011001293">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should
find it surprising that we seek to defend British industry from
anti-competitive practices in other countries. That is the rationale
for a commitment to the whole of Europe moving together on such issues.
It is not an EU matter alone. The UNECE is the body that has to agree
the measure on behalf of all the states in Europe, not only those in
the EU. The simple reason why we argue that the change cannot be
achieved before 2010 is that we believe in the rule of law and it would
be illegal. I do not know how many different ways I can say that. Even
if we accept the new clause tonight, it would be illegal and we would
be breaking treaties to which this country is a
party.</p><p><a name="06101011000041"><b><a name="06101011001294">Mr.
Paterson:</b> That is a bizarre way of looking at cost. To a
haulier, costs arise when their trucks are not running on the roads. If
trucks are not run into, they carry on running, and the haulier does
not have to bear the cost of having to repair them, will not have them
off the road, and will not lose business. The Minister&#146;s way of
looking at the issue is completely inverted&#151;<i> [Interruption.]
</i>Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&#146;s and John Lewis have already

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 96</b><br><p><a name="06101011000045"><b><a name="06101011001297">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I shall say this one final time: they are not
doing so. The Italians have gone ahead and will face infraction
proceedings as a consequence. The others may have talked about it, and
bodies may have recommended the measure to them&#151;just as bodies
have recommended it to me&#151;but if they go ahead, they will face
the same infraction procedures.</p><p><a name="06101011000046"><b><a name="06101011001298">Mr.
Paterson:</b> So it is a choice between infraction procedures
and hanging around until 2011, by which time there will have been 1,540
more collisions. We are discussing a road safety Bill at a time when
more than 3,000 people a year are killed on our roads, and before us is
a measure that is backed by responsible Members of Parliament of every
single party. The Minister is being utterly
pusillanimous&#151;absolutely feeble to a degree. We will push the
new clause to a Division later, and I hope that the hon. Member for
Stroud (Mr. Drew) will join us. The situation is utter
nonsense. Our very simple measure would save lives, and we feel
strongly about it. We believe that given that Members of Parliament
think that the new clause would save lives, they should have the right
to vote on it, and it should be made
law.</p><p><a name="06101011000047">Moving on to the
other new clauses in this group, we have a similar case in respect of
mirrors. We find it extraordinary that the Minister, as a Kent MP, did
not back new clause 21. I cited in Committee the terrible example of
what happened to the wife of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury
(Mr. Brazier) who was driving in the fast lane of a motorway
in Kent. Alongside was a Hungarian truck that was correctly set up
according to Hungarian regulations, with mirrors on only the left side
of the vehicle&#151;that is, on the driver&#146;s side in Hungary.
The truck was completely blind on the right-hand side&#151;the
offside, where my hon. Friend&#146;s wife was driving&#151;and the
driver forced her into the central barrier. I am glad to say that she
was not hurt, but we have found that there is a consistent pattern, as
those accidents are always happening. It is such a simple measure to
make it mandatory to install mirrors on both sides of all heavy trucks
operating in the UK. The Hungarian driver was aghast and horrified by
what had happened, but he was operating within the rules as they stand.
Again, the Minister has been utterly feeble, which I find bizarre
considering that he represents a marginal Kent seat.</p><p><a name="06101011000048">There is a political angle to
the issue, because why should not just British citizens but all those
who come to this country&#151;there were 1.5 million vehicles from
abroad here last year&#151;be put at risk for the simple lack of a
mirror on the continental blind side? The Minister appears to be
lagging behind the European Commission, which only last week said that
it would require large trucks to install blind-spot mirrors. EU member
states have to improve infrastructure on vehicles, and the Commission
would ensure that vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes installed new
mirrors so that they could see not just cars but motorbike riders and
cyclists. It said in a
statement:</p><a name="brev_14"><a name="06101011001251"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Every
year approximately 400 road users lose their lives in accidents,
because lorry drivers fail to notice them when taking a right
turn.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101011000049">All that the new
clause would do is pre-empt the European Commission and introduce a
measure with profound safety benefits in this country.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 97</b><br><p><a name="06101011000050">Again, other countries have
already taken action; the Dutch and Belgians have introduced measures
on blind-spot mirrors. I therefore hope that the Minister who, as I
said, has been utterly pusillanimous on the issue of retro-reflective
tape, will steel himself to take action on this issue. The measure
would be very cheap, as it does not cost much to install mirrors on
heavy goods vehicles. It will soon be mandatory to do so, but let us
get on and make it mandatory now.</p><p><a name="06101011000051">Turning to new clause 22, it is
the same old story. Every year, about seven people are killed in this
country while hitching up a tractor to a parked articulated trailer.
The trailer&#146;s air brakes remain on until it is connected to the
tractor&#146;s air supply. When the tractor reverses, there is a
large clunk as the fifth wheel engages with the trailer and the whole
unit remains stable, because the air brakes are still locked on the
trailer. All too often, however, the driver does not engage the
handbrake because he believes that the whole unit is solid. After
jumping down from the tractor he climbs on to the trailer to connect
the Susie hoses to engage the air. As soon as the air passes into the
trailer, the brakes disengage, and the whole unit moves. In some cases,
sadly, the driver panics, and while trying to jump off and scramble
into the cab he is run over. In other cases, the united vehicle rolls
up or down the slope, crushing someone else.</p><p><a name="06101011000052">Our extraordinarily simple
technical measure would, we estimate, prevent seven deaths a year. The
kit would cost about &#163;100, as we are merely suggesting that an
alarm is triggered if the tractor is left with the handbrake off. In
Committee, the Minister said that he could not proceed with the measure
for all the reasons that have just been given, as the infrastructure of
vehicles is a European competence. However, the European Commission is
not composed of unmenschen&#151;its members are human beings. If he
engaged with them and talked to them&#151;he said that he would do so
in Committee, and he has had the whole summer to do so&#151;we could
achieve a result. The measure is terribly simple and would save seven
lives a year.</p><p><a name="06101011000053">Finally, new clause 27, which
was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire
(Mr. Knight), requires daytime running safety lights to be
installed on motorbikes. On the whole, we think that that is a good
idea. Indeed, a study by the Institute of Transport Economics at Oslo
in Norway discovered that it resulted in a 32 per cent. reduction in
multi-party daytime accidents. The proposal therefore has merits, as
information about permanent lights on motorbikes from the Transport
Accident Commission in Victoria in Australia demonstrates. We therefore
support the new clause. Our main aim, however, is to persuade the
Minister to steel himself to take action. We have tabled three measures
that would save lives, that are very cheap, and that have been
introduced in other European countries. Will the Minister therefore

Leech:</b> May I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 98</b><br><p><a name="06101011000055">I wish to express my support and
that of my right hon. and hon. Friends for new clause 12, which was
tabled by hon. Members on both sides of the House and would make the
use of ECE 104 retro-reflective markings mandatory on all UK-registered
HGVs. Although there would be a minor cost to the owners of such
vehicles, the new clause would have a significant impact in improving
road safety and reducing casualties on our roads. The new clause would
enable other motorists more easily to identify the size and shape of
the vehicle, especially in poor light and at
night.</p><p><a name="06101011000056">Evidence
suggests that in 2001 about a third of all collisions involving HGVs
were when they had been hit on the side by another vehicle. More than a
third of those side collisions at night occurred because the other
driver saw the vehicle too late. The same research, which was carried
out by the University of Darmstadt, concluded that the number of
collisions in poor visibility or at night could be reduced by up to 95
per cent. simply with the addition of retro-reflective
markings.</p><p><a name="06101011000057">Where those
markings were introduced as mandatory in America, it resulted in
significant reductions in side impacts on HGVs. Not only has it reduced
the number of accidents, it has also had a significant cost benefit in
terms of economic savings because there were fewer accidents.</p><p><a name="06101011000058">The cost of introducing the
markings would be only about &#163;100 per vehicle. When that is
factored into the overall cost of an HGV, it is a mere drop in the
ocean. I have never bought an HGV, but I have been given information by
Reflect, which estimates that the cost of the markings would be less
than 0.01 per cent. of the overall cost of the vehicle. By comparison,
that would be equivalent to paying only an extra 80p on the cost of my
car to improve its
safety.</p><p><a name="06101011000059">I am slightly
disappointed that the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby
(Mr. Goodwill), who has much experience with HGVs, is
unfortunately not in the Chamber to add something to the debate. I am
sure that he could have made a number of comments and I was looking
forward to hearing what he had to
say.</p><p><a name="06101011000060">The overall cost
would be a small price to pay for saving lives. It would reduce the
number of collisions by an estimated 1,185 between now and 2010, if the
Loughborough university report is to be believed. Given that the number
of deaths from accidents involving HGVs has risen while the overall
number of deaths on the roads has dropped, it is clearly time that this
practical, cost-effective measure to improve HGV safety was made
mandatory.</p><p><a name="06101011000061"><b><a name="06101011001300">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> I rise to draw the House&#146;s attention
to my new clause 27, which would require all motorcycles used on a
public highway to display dipped headlight beams continuously and a red
light during daylight hours, with an exemption for historic
motorcycles. Any motorcycle failing to comply with that requirement
would be guilty of an
offence.</p><p><a name="06101011000062">It
is not a radical innovation. Careful motorcyclists in this country have
already developed the practice of using their headlights at all times.
Why? Because it increases their visibility and safety, so it is to be
welcomed. The practice has been given official sanction. The highway
code advises all motorcyclists to use their lights during

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 99</b><br>day-time hours. It even includes a cartoon with a caption pointing out
that it is wrong to drive a motorcycle without lights, so there is
official blessing for the contents of new clause 27 in the highway
code. The new clause would merely enshrine good practice in
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101011000063">Personally,
I am against unnecessary legislation, so if the Minister can tell me
that the current position, with the recommendation in the highway code,
is an effective practice to which most motorcyclists adhere, I should
probably be content and would not wish to push new clause 27 to a vote.
But I have a second purpose in speaking to the new clause: I should
like to tease out from the Minister his wider view, which I hope is
that the provision should not be extended to cover all motor vehicles
at all times on our roads. I hope that his support will extend only to
motorcyclists, because somewhere deep in the heart of Brussels there is
a regulation-ridden, form-filling, pen-pushing nincompoop of a Eurocrat
who feels that the one-size-fits-all policy, which we see all too often
in the EU, should be applied to day-time running lights and every EU
member state should have compulsory day-time running lights on all
motor vehicles, and further that such a provision should be
retrospective and should thus apply to existing vehicles on our roads.
I hope that the Minister, while indicating his support for the aims of
new clause 27, will also be able to tell the House that he does not
support the proposal currently being debated in Brussels to make every
motor vehicle on the road use day-time running
lights.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_17"><a name="06101011001267">8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101011000064">There are a
number of reasons why new clause 27 is good, but to go further would be
bad&#151;clutter, to start with. One benefit for motorcyclists in
having their headlights on is that it makes them more visible to other
road users. If every motor vehicle on the road was obliged by EU law to
run with headlights or day-time running lights, we should have visual
clutter and light pollution. Motorcyclists would be less visible
because we would not be able to identify them from other vehicles. Such
a law would remove the current safety benefits for
motorcyclists.</p><p><a name="06101011000065">The
one-size-fits-all view is also wrong when we consider the climate and
the number of daylight hours of EU member countries. Some European
countries have few daylight hours; indeed, in the depths of winter some
have no daylight. What might be right for them is not right for the UK.
In some EU countries it is not light until 9.30 or 10 in the morning
and it is dark again by 2.30 or 3 o&#146;clock. In this country,
there are many periods of good, bright weather in winter, so to say
that motorists should have their headlights on at all times is
inappropriate. It is the heavy hand of the nanny
state.</p><p><a name="06101011000066">If such a
provision came into force, there would be a side-effect as it could
affect the use of historic motor vehicles. At this point I declare an
interest as the owner of several historic vehicles and as chairman of
the all-party historic vehicles group. As the Minister knows, it is a
technical issue; some early motor vehicles use gas lighting and the
majority of historic and classic motor vehicles use a generator rather
than an alternator to recharge their battery. The generator
is&#151;</p><br>

side-effects would be to take historic vehicles off our roads because
they would be unable to

Minister will say that although he supports motorcyclists using
headlights&#151;as does the highway code&#151;he does not see the
need for us to go any further. Of course, new cars fitted with day-time
running lights, such as the Volvo, have lights of slightly less
intensity than dipped headlights, so older vehicles, manufactured
before a change in the law, would experience a bigger drain on their
battery.</p><p><a name="06101011000070">I do not know
whether unanimity is required in any EU discussions on the issue. I
fear that it is not and that the issue could be decided by a majority

considerable amount of extra fuel would be used if the regulation went
through.</p><p><a name="06101011000072"><b><a name="06101011001304">Mr.

I am not sure that that is correct in every case. Certainly, if one
runs air conditioning, it is true, but I am not sure whether a dynamo
or an alternator has the same effect. If it does, my hon. Friend has
made a very good
point.</p><p><a name="06101011000073">I hope that
when the Minister comes to speak to these new clauses he will tell the
House that he will oppose, with all the powers at his disposal, the
implementation of mandatory daylight running lights on all motor
vehicles in the United Kingdom. I hope that if, in the discussions that
he will no doubt attend, all appears to be lost at some point in the
future, he will at least plead for an exemption for all those vehicles
in the UK that are currently registered or taxed as historic. In
earlier interventions the Minister made it clear that when the EU has
spoken it is often too late to take the action that we would like to
take. I hope that on this issue he can persuade the EU to show us a
period of
silence.</p><p><a name="06101011000074"><b><a name="06101011001305">David
T.C. Davies:</b> I rise to support my colleagues in their new
clauses. In answering a point made by the hon. Member for Stroud
(Mr. Drew), may I say that as somebody who has worked in
road haulage for a number of years I am not aware of any lobbying from
within the industry to prevent lorries, particularly new ones, from
being fitted with reflective tape? I can understand why a haulier who
owns 50 or 100 vehicles would baulk at paying what I think would be
considerably more than &#163;100 a time to have that fleet fitted
with reflective tape retrospectively. But if this measure is to apply
to new vehicles and if the cost is to be only &#163;100 a time, it is
a drop in the ocean for any haulage operator. Those who operate new
vehicles tend to be the big boys anyway, and they are usually very keen
to adopt any new safety procedures.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 101</b><br><p><a name="06101011000075">The hon. Gentleman plaintively
says, &#147;It&#146;s a no-brainer. Where is the opposition coming
from?&#148; It is clear that it is coming not from the industry but
from Brussels or whoever it is within the bowels of the United Nations
who decides what sort of reflective tape should go round a lorry. That
is a decision that should be made in a sovereign nation. If we have
signed up to legislation saying that somebody else should be making
that decision, I say that we should unsign it and say that this is a
matter that should be devolved. We are perfectly capable of deciding
for ourselves in this country what sort of reflective, illuminated tape
should go round our
HGVs.</p><p><a name="06101011000076">Frankly, it was
even more astounding that the Minister then went on to say that he has
been responsible for taking action against states that have pressed
ahead with the legislation before the UN or the EU has got around to
it, because it is anti-competitive. I speak as somebody who knows a bit
about the hardships faced by people in the haulage industry. If the
Minister is worried about anti-competitive measures, why is he not
looking at the fact that vehicle fines and tachograph procedures are
not properly enforced on the drivers of foreign vehicles that come
here? Why is he not looking at fuel duty? Every British haulier could
tell him that we are paying far more in fuel duty than anywhere else in
Europe, and that we have to pay to use roads on the continent, yet when
continental drivers come over here, they do not have to pay for any of
that. That is why so many of the very large operators are now
registering their companies in the Netherlands and elsewhere&#151;to
get out of paying some of the taxes. As a result, British hauliers are
going out of
business.</p><p><a name="06101011000077">I
particularly wanted to speak to new clause 21. This, too, is a bit of a
no-brainer. I do not know whether the LGV test has changed
significantly since I took it back in the early 1990s. At the time, it
involved a minimum of two weeks&#146; training and at least 40
minutes was spent taking the test itself. We got those licences and
took that training in a flat-bed vehicle with a tractor fitted with a
rear window and a rear-view mirror, so it was relatively easy. As soon
as one gets out on to the roads, one is normally driving either a
box-type vehicle or a curtain-sider. Even if one is driving a flat-bed,
obviously for much of the time it is fully loaded. I have driven many
kinds of articulated vehicles both here and abroad, and my recollection
is that very few of the cabs are fitted with a rear-view mirror. Even
if there is a rear window it is quite distracting for the driver to
look in a rear-view mirror because, most of the time, they will be
driving a fully loaded vehicle and will be unable to see anything out
of it.</p><p><a name="06101011000078">It is obvious
that if the driver of a 40-ft, 40 tonne vehicle has only the
driver-side mirror to look into when trying to move back across from
the fast lane or, on a motorway that forks, to go into a left-hand
lane, they are driving a death-trap. Driving on the continent, the
danger is greatly magnified. So once again, we have a new clause that
is a complete and utter no-brainer. In fact, it was news to me that
someone could drive an articulated or goods vehicle without a mirror on
the passenger side. I find that quite extraordinary. No responsible
haulier would send a vehicle out like that, although I do know from
experience that there are plenty of irresponsible ones around, so it
would not surprise me if one or two do.</p><br>

pointing out that a 3.5 tonne vehicle is still a dangerous one to be
driving without a passenger-side mirror. Most people would think of
such a vehicle as being a Ford transit, but there are larger vehicles
that have a slightly lower payload but nevertheless can travel at 80
mph. I would not know that from experience of course, but many of them
will be able to do that. Those vehicles will often be in the middle
lane if not the fast lane of the motorway, and the idea that they could
be changing lanes without a passenger mirror is absolutely
frightening.</p><p><a name="06101011000080">We must
bear it in mind that any sort of goods vehicle will often be loaded,
and any loaded vehicle, whether it is a flat-bed or some sort of a box,
will not allow a proper view out of the rear-view mirror. We should
therefore not only be pushing for HGVs&#151;anything over 3.5
tonnes&#151;to have a passenger mirror as quickly as possible, but
extending that to any kind of goods vehicle.</p><p><a name="06101011000081">I am totally anti-regulation,
as a rule. I am completely against piling further unnecessary
regulation on to the haulage industry because I have seen so many of my
friends going bankrupt as a result of unnecessary regulation, but this
is one bit of regulation that no responsible operator would want to
avoid. It is one thing that we ought to do to increase safety on the
roads and ensure that responsible hauliers are not operating at a
disadvantage because the irresponsible cowboys are driving vehicles
that should not be let loose on the
road.</p><p><a name="06101011000082"><b><a name="06101011001306">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I do not know how many different ways I can say
it: the United Kingdom is a law-abiding nation that signs treaties and
then tries to live by them. We believe in the rule of law, and when we
agree to follow certain rules and laws, we do not break them and we do
our best to make sure that everybody else complies with them. That is
the way we live our lives because once we break that rule as a
Parliament&#151;once we say that there are some laws that we as a
nation can ignore&#151;we are saying that everybody can ignore any
law that they do not particularly
like.</p><p><a name="06101011000083">We signed a
treaty that stated that because there are competitive issues involved
in the type approval of vehicles, we would abide by rules laid down at
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Why did we choose
UNECE to lay down those rules? I cannot tell the House that. I was not
involved at the time that we made those agreements. I suspect that that
occurred under the previous Government. The reason is that not every
state in Europe is a member of the European Union, and we needed a set
of type approval rules that would cover not just the European Union but
Switzerland, Norway and any other country whose vehicles might be
driving through Europe, so we agreed to follow UNECE
regulations.</p><p><a name="06101011000084">European
law&#151;the European Community regulations &#151;requires us to go
along with UNECE regulations on type approval. Those regulations
provide for retro-reflective tape to be made mandatory. In the
discussions we are pressing for that to happen as soon as possible, but
that is unlikely to be before January 2010. We will press harder to try
and get it done faster. I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
(Mr. Drew) will accept that assurance from me, but the date
is likely to be 2010.</p><br>

small amount of money on the price of a new vehicle, but it is a point
of principle that we must have the type approval. The hon. Member for
North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) accuses me from the
Opposition Front Bench of being pusillanimous for not agreeing to break
the law, which, as I have explained, is the position he is trying to
put me in. He calls that pusillanimous. I call it the reason why we
have a Parliament in this country.</p><p><a name="06101011000086">The hon. Gentleman then argues
that we should obey the same rule in respect of close proximity mirrors

rules that he says we should break when it suits us are the rules that
will require those to be fitted to new vehicles in Europe from the
beginning of next year. If we decide not to obey the rules, will we
accept that people elsewhere in Europe can decide not to bother with
close proximity mirrors and drive into our country in future? Is it
only when we agree with a set of rules under the treaty that we will
obey
them?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_18"><a name="06101011001268">8.30

my hon. Friend tells us that something as simple as putting reflective
tape on heavy goods vehicles cannot become law until 2010, there is
something seriously wrong. Our Government should go in with hobnail
boots on and deal with the matter. It is not a little matter if someone
dies on our roads. It is a big matter if one person dies because of the
lack of reflective tape. I hope my hon. Friend will give the House an

usually take. Our assessment is that it will probably take until 2010.
If we can get agreement to implement the measure more quickly, we will
do so. There is nothing to stop the voluntary fitting of the tape by
anyone who is buying a new vehicle. What we are not allowed to do is
require the mandatory fitting of it by everybody who brings a new lorry
into Europe in the intervening time, but I can assure my hon. Friend

passenger-side mirrors, he claimed an expertise which I am not
convinced he has. We are not talking about passenger-side mirrors. Of
course lorries must have passenger-side mirrors. We are talking about
an additional close proximity mirror, which will be required by
law&#151;the same laws and rules to which the Opposition
object&#151;to be fitted in new vehicles from January next
year.</p><p><a name="06101011000091">The new clause
would require us to make that mandatory now. By the time we have Royal
Assent and we have done all the paperwork and got the lawyers involved,
it will be quicker to wait for the new European requirement to be
introduced in January. The hon. Member for Monmouth kept speaking about
passenger mirrors. We are not dealing with passenger-side mirrors.
Neither he nor the hon. Member for North Shropshire correctly referred
to them as close proximity mirrors. They and other speakers implied
that the problem that we face with the side-swiping of vehicles would
disappear once close proximity mirrors were fitted.</p><p><a name="06101011000092">I challenge that, although I
think close proximity mirrors will have a role to play in reducing the
incidence of side-swiping. The hon. Member for North Shropshire gave
the statistics for the number of accidents caused by side-swiping as
vehicles change lane. What he did not tell the House was that 80 per
cent. of vehicles involved in such accidents already had close
proximity mirrors fitted. So close proximity mirrors are not the
solution&#151;or at least they are not the only solution&#151;to
this problem.</p><p><a name="06101011000093">That is
why the Department for Transport has been showing real leadership
across the European Union in exploring the question of what is the
genuine blind spot that causes these accidents. We are about to start a
trial with a Fresnel lens, which we will distribute to a number of
lorry drivers coming into some of the channel ports, because we believe
that such lenses allow the driver to see not the blind spot that close
proximity mirrors reveal, but a blind spot that appears to exist to the
side and just to the front of heavy goods vehicles. If that experiment
is successful, we will have gone a long way toward preventing
side-swiping.</p><p><a name="06101011000094">Close
proximity mirrors will reduce some of the problem and they will be
fitted from the start of the new year, but we should not kid ourselves
or anybody else that they will be the solution to the problem, because,
as the statistics show, 80 per cent. of side-swiping incidents are
caused by vehicles that already have close proximity mirrors. I should
also point out to the House that none of the four fatalities caused by
this sort of accident involved a foreign-registered vehicle; they were
all British
vehicles.</p><p><a name="06101011000095"><b><a name="06101011001311">Mr.

this must be something to do with foreign lorry drivers with a blind
spot on the passenger
side.</p><p><a name="06101011000099"><b><a name="06101011001313">David
T.C. Davies:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
and I can assure him that he need not spare my feelings: many people in
the Chamber both here and in Wales have been a lot ruder to me than he
was just then. We have phrased the new clause in simple language, and
perhaps the language that I used was a little simple, as well. Perhaps
I reverted to a past profession, when I should have remembered that
when one enters politics, one should try to use loquacious language.
Nevertheless, the Minister knew exactly what we
meant.</p><p><a name="06101011000100">It is important
that we solve this problem. The Minister must travel to the continent
quite a lot, so he must know that when we go to France, we have to
change the lights on the front of our cars in order to fit in with
French regulations. Therefore, for him to say that we cannot do
something different in Britain, either with cars or heavy goods
vehicles, from what is being done on the continent surely cannot be
correct, because different countries on the continent already apply
different rules and expect drivers&#151;whether of heavy goods
vehicles or not&#151;to obey
them.</p><p><a name="06101011000101"><b><a name="06101011001314">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> French drivers and other continental drivers when
they come to this country have to fit lenses to their cars so that the
lights dip on the other side. The rule is the same for all of us. When
we drive on the right the lights have to dip in one direction and when
we drive on the left they dip in the opposite direction, so that is not
a good analogy. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman does not think that I
was being particularly rude to him. The Under-Secretary of State for
Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron), said
that I need to try harder.</p><br>

Marris:</b> May I suggest that when my hon.
Friend is considering mirrors with blind spots he should do what we did
when I drove buses in the &#146;70s in Canada. On the passenger side
we had an arm sticking out on the front on the passenger side, somewhat
like a proboscis, with a convex mirror on it. A convex mirror, properly
positioned, will get rid of almost every blind spot, and the solution
has been around for 30 or more
years.</p><p><a name="06101011000103"><b><a name="06101011001316">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I will certainly ensure that my hon.
Friend&#146;s suggestion is considered, but I hope that he will
accept the general principle from me that resolving the issue of
side-swiping is not the simple matter that some people, and some
newspapers in particular, have portrayed it to be. However, we are
determined to get to the bottom of
it.</p><p><a name="06101011000104">I come now to
audible warning devices. The hon. Member for North Shropshire said that
I had made certain promises in Committee and I have honoured those
promises. My officials raised the matter at the meeting in September of
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on brakes and running
gear. We asked for information from international sources on the scale
of incidence of runaway trucks and trailers and the level of the
problem that he has identified, and member states represented there
have shown considerable interest in the fact that we have raised this
issue. We are waiting for responses from them and we intend to pursue
the matter through the UNECE and hopefully therefore obtain buy-in from
all continental member states in order to resolve the issue in due
course. On that basis, I hope that he will not push the new clause to a
vote.</p><p><a name="06101011000105">With regard to
day-time running lights there is the new clause with its literal
meaning proposed by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire
(Mr. Knight), and then there is his real concern, which I
share, that changes in the EU might lead to mandatory fitting of
day-time running lights and even their mandatory use on all vehicles on
all the roads of Europe. I have strongly opposed that in all forums
that I havebeen represented at. In particular, I made strong
representations at the Transport Council that that is not in the
interests of road safety for exactly the reasons that the right hon.
Gentleman gave. In this country, because motorcycles use day-time
running lights, they have greater visibility than they would do if
everyone used such lights.</p><p><a name="06101011000106">Given that one of the most
serious problems that we face in this country is to bring down sharply
the stubborn rate of motorcyclist fatalities, we cannot afford to
compromise an important safety concernfor motorcyclists.
Therefore, I have made strong representations at all the meetings at
which I have been represented and I intend to do so again at the
ministerial road safety conference in Verona in two or three
weeks&#146; time. I am making a presentation about motorcycle safety
in general and what we need to do to try to reduce motorcycle
casualties, but one of my key points will be the need to maintain the
existing state control on the issue, because opinion on whether to
compel the use of day-time running lights will vary in different
states. In this country, I firmly believe that we should not do
so.</p><br>

pessimistic. The tide is running against me. A number of powerful
states believe that it is a good idea. I believe that they think that
it is a panacea and an easy solution to which their public will not
object and which will help to reduce their casualty statistics. I do
not think that it will reduce their casualty statistics, but it will
affect our casualty statistics. I will continue to fight the good
fight, but I cannot promise that I will

there is a typographical error in the text of the new clause, in that
some words are repeated. In lines 5 and 6, the words &#147;six months
or to a fine not exceeding&#148; should be omitted. The intention is
clear, and I am prepared to allow the clause to be moved in its
corrected form.</p><br>

Isabel and SCID. I also congratulate all the road safety groups and
lobby organisations that have taken such an interest in the Bill and
given us their advice. I have not always accepted it or agreed with it,
but it has always been constructive and useful to us all in our
debates.</p><p><a name="06101011001120">Since 2004,
the total number of deaths and serious injuries has fallen by 13.5 per
cent., and by 33 per cent. compared with the 1994-98 baseline. That is
well on the way to our target of a 40 per cent. reduction by 2010. The
number of children killed or seriously injured has fallen by 49 per
cent. compared with the baseline. I am proud to say that this country
has one of the safest road networks in the world, at or near the very
top of any European league of road safety. We are making progress, with
the number of road casualties falling every year. However, if we want
to ensure that the number continues to fall, we cannot be complacent.
Nine people a day are still dying on our
roads.</p><p><a name="06101011001121"><b><a name="_spnew124"><a name="06101011002296">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> We have
indeed seen notable successes on British roads in recent years, but
will my hon. Friend comment on an article in the <i> British Medical
Journal </i>that fails to find much of a correlation between the number
of serious injuries caused by road accidents as recorded in hospital
admission statistics and as recorded by the police? There seems to be a
discrepancy that needs to be
bridged.</p><p><a name="06101011001122"><b><a name="06101011002297">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I can comment on that. The fact is that there has
always been a known under-reporting of accidents. There is, of course,
no under-reporting of fatalities. Everyone agrees that fatalities are
reported to the police as well as appearing in hospital statistics. The
figures that I have just given include the fatality figures, and they
are still falling. There has always been under-reporting of other
accidents, but as it has always been there, there is no reason to
believe that it is becoming more serious now than it ever was. Whether
we take the police or the hospital figures, the trends are falling.
However, the Department has acknowledged that further work is needed,
and we are continuing to conduct research on the matter. Indeed, I
would argue that we identified it as an issue needing research even
before the appearance of the article in the <i> British Medical
Journal.</i></p><p><a name="06101011001123">As I was saying, if
we want to continue to drive down the number of accidents and
fatalities, we cannot be complacent. We need further measures to raise
the standard of driving and to make irresponsible driving a thing of
the past, and that is exactly what the Bill seeks to
do.</p><p><a name="06101011001124"><b><a name="_spnew125"><a name="06101011002298">Mr.
Henry Bellingham (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> Does the
Minister agree that dual carriageways are much safer than ordinary
single carriageways, but that they need proper crash barriers? Is he
aware that some stretches of dual carriageway do not have such crash
barriers? Is he concerned about that and will he give any priority to
the matter?</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 118</b><br><p><a name="06101011001125"><b><a name="06101011002299">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am always anxious to see
measures put in place that are based on evidence. Not all roads need
crash barriers. A risk assessment has to be performed and if we use
resources unnecessarily in one place, they cannot be used more
effectively in another place. As a matter of principle, I would expect
most dual carriageways to have crash barriers and, ultimately, they
will all have them. On the trunk road system, however, where we have
decided that crash barriers are unnecessary, the decision has to be
based on a risk assessment of a particular stretch of road. I cannot
provide the hon. Gentleman with a definitive statement about any
specific road, but I can tell him that a mile of motorway in this
country now costs an average of about &#163;25 million, while
four-lane dual carriageways cost about &#163;16 million a mile. No
one can accuse us of under-engineering the new road infrastructure. It
is partly that engineering that has led to the decrease in the number
of accidents and it helps to explain the fact that we have among the
safest roads in the world. That is not to say that they cannot be made
more safe or that we should not attempt to do more.</p><p><a name="06101011001126">The Bill is designed to address
irresponsible driving and to deal with non-UK residents who break the
law. By seeking deposits from the drivers of heavy goods vehicles, we
will deal with foreign drivers who break the law in the belief that
they can get away without penalty. It even allows us to impound their
vehicles if they do not have the cash to pay the deposit. It allows us
better to enforce insurance legislation by moving towards a system of
continuous insurance. The bane of honest drivers&#146; lives are
people who are driving around this country without paying their
insurance, costing us all an extra &#163;30 a year on our premiums. I
hope that that will be dealt with by the continuous insurance
provisions.</p><p><a name="06101011001127">The Bill
also deals with many other important issues, such as speeding,
recklessness and people who cause death by careless driving&#151;a
major new provision. Currently, someone may face a long custodial
sentence if found guilty of dangerous driving, but because it is a
difficult case to prove, he may be found guilty only of careless
driving. He may then be given what appears to many victims and their
families as only a slap on the wrist. The Bill fills that gap very
well.</p><p><a name="06101011001128"><b><a name="06101011002300">Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Minister accept the thanks of many of my
constituents for introducing this new law? A young girl, Alexine
Melnik, was killed by a careless driver, who received a wholly
inappropriate penalty. Labour and independents as well as Conservatives
in Wellingborough have long campaigned for a change in the law. The
father, Mr. Peter Melnik, is delighted to see this law
passed.</p><p><a name="06101011001129"><b><a name="06101011002301">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I am delighted that he and
other Wellingborough constituents are happy. I can understand their
pain. A constituent of mine was killed by someone driving dangerously
at a set of traffic lights, but because of the vagaries of the current
law the driver was fined just &#163;100 for causing a young
man&#146;s death and leaving a widow. That is unacceptable and the
new legislation fills the gap in the law and fulfils our manifesto
commitment at the last election. I am proud that we have been able to
agree on the new measure. I very much hope that the House of Lords will
accept the view of the Commons and will not attempt to change this
provision.</p><br>

want to go through a long list of thanks to various people, because I
know that hon. Members will want to contribute to our Third Reading
debate. I would, however, like to pay tribute to both Front-Bench
spokesmen for the constructive way in which they have participated. We
have not agreed on everything, but we have had good fun debating the
matter. Their arguments have been constructive, if occasionally
wrong-headed. We have had a good debate and I commend all members of
both Front Benches for
that.</p><p><a name="06101011001131">I
wish to mention some of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), whose private
Member&#146;s Bill introduced the careless driving provisions that we
have made part of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
(Mr. Kidney) has been a long-term campaigner on road safety
and is a former chairman of PACTS. He has been constructive throughout
the debate. He and I have different opinions on how we enforce the
measures on the level of alcohol in the bloodstream, but there are very
few things on which we disagree.</p><p><a name="06101011001132">A Member who cannot be here
tonight&#151;he has apologised&#151;has been with this Bill since
2004 but finally had to give in and go off with a Select Committee: my
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). Had he been
here, he would have been rebelling with my hon. Friend the Member for
Stroud (Mr. Drew) on retro-reflective tape.</p><p><a name="06101011001133">Other hon. Members have
contributed to this enjoyable debate and I would particularly like to
mention the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr.
Knight), a doughty defender of the owners of heritage Bentleys. I am
sorry that he cannot be here for the final stage of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101011001134">I
wish to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter), my PPS, who has looked
after me throughout the Bill. Most of all, I wish to thank my officials
for the wonderful work they have done. We cannot acknowledge anything
that happens outside this Chamber, but were they listening. I hope that
they would feel proud of their contribution to making our roads safer.
I commend the Bill to the

Paterson:</b> It has been a long ride; I feel
positively arriviste as my participation goes back only to the new
year. However, the Bill began in 2004 and the Minister quite rightly
said that its main objective is to reduce the number of those killed on
our roads. In 2005, 3,201 people were killed on our roads; there were
271,017 casualties, of whom 141 were children who were killed. We have
no intention of opposing the Bill because there are certain measures
that we think will help to reduce that figure. The Minister said it had
come down, but it is still an unacceptable figure and we have a nasty
feeling that it may have plateaued.</p><p><a name="06101011001136">We are pleased about some
elements of the Bill, such as road safety

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 120</b><br>Friend will join me in recognising that road safety grants provide an
opportunity for groups such as Time and Place in my constituency to get
extra funding to continue the good work that they have done,
particularly with younger drivers, to help bring down the rate of
fatalities.</p><p><a name="06101011001138"><b><a name="06101011002304">Mr.
Paterson:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am not aware
of the details of the organisation, but it is probably the sort of
educational project of which we approve.</p><p><a name="06101011001139">We are in favour of the
financial penalty deposits and the immobilisation and removal of
vehicles. That would certainly help our haulage industry, which is up
against fearsome competition following the huge increase in the number
of foreign trucks on our roads&#151;up from 671,000 a year in 1997 to
1,595,000 in 2004. We hope that those sensible measures will work. We
approve of medical inquiries for high-risk offenders following
disqualification and of some of the measures to try to prevent deaths
by uninsured drivers, although we feel they do not go far enough.
Similarly, we approve of the measures to keep vehicles that do not meet
insurance requirements, although we would want to go further. We like
the tightening up on registration plates and the regulation of vehicles
modified to run on fuels stored under
pressure.</p><p><a name="06101011001140">Overall,
however, we felt that the Bill was a missed opportunity. As the
Minister acknowledged, we did not take a partisan approach. We tried to
table constructive amendments and new clauses that would help to save
lives, but we are ultimately disappointed with the Bill. We will not
oppose its Third Reading tonight, but it could have been so much
better.</p><p><a name="06101011001141">Some
of the measures were petty, such as the ban on detection devices which
effectively give drivers an extra pair of eyes and ears. We were also
disappointed by the Government&#146;s continuing pigheadedness and
pusillanimity about taking on the European Commission on safety issues
on which other countries have already gone ahead. Those issues included
retro-reflective tape, mirrors and
alarms.</p><p><a name="06101011001142">We were
disappointed on the issue of the inclusion of a rudimentary first aid
element in driving tests. There is good evidence that if one can clear
the airwaves of someone in an accident within four minutes they will
live, but if not, they will die. We thought that such a provision would
help to save lives, but we were turned down.</p><p><a name="06101011001143">The nearest we got to changing
the Government&#146;s mind was on motorbikes in bus lanes. We all but
got the Minister to accept that there should be a presumption that
motorbikes should be allowed in all bus lanes unless specifically
excluded, perhaps outside schools, hospitals or fire stations, but the
Minister did not even give in on
that.</p><p><a name="06101011001144">We could not
persuade the Government on other issues, including some of regulation.
We proposed a regime for licensing limousines, the number of which has
increased spectacularly from 3,000 in 2003 to more than 11,000 now.
Those large vehicles are not properly regulated, but many people travel
in them and we fear that there may be a horrible accident. We also
proposed regulation of pedicabs. We tabled amendments, having consulted
the businesses involved, but time and again we were rebuffed.</p><br>

big areas. We consistently tabled amendments that would have toughened
up&#151;</p><p><a name="06101011001146"><b><a name="06101011002305">Dr.

Paterson:</b> We won the amendment and then the Minister voted
down the clause, so it was a pyrrhic
victory.</p><p><a name="06101011001148">The first big
issue is the problem of rogue drivers. Some 750,000 cars are not
properly registered on the database. Some 2 million drivers drive
without tax or insurance, and some 500,000 may be unlicensed. The
Department for Transport told us in September that as many as three in
10 vehicles may operate outside the laws on registration, vehicle
testing and insurance. Research shows that drivers of such vehicles
are10 times more likely to have been convicted of drink
driving, six times more likely to have been convicted of driving an
unsafe vehicle, and three times more likely to have been convicted of
driving without due care and attention.</p><p><a name="06101011001149">Our
amendments would have borne down on hit and run drivers, for whom we
wished to introduce a maximum penalty of 14 years so that there was no
incentive to leave the scene of a serious accident if one had had a
drink. We were disappointed that the Government did not accept the new
clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire
(Andrew Selous), which would have caught those who constantly flout the
law by giving a false address. We fear that instead of targeting the
small number who cause disproportionate damage and mayhem, we risk
alienating the 34 million drivers who just want to get from A to B
safely and in
comfort.</p><p><a name="06101011001150"><b><a name="06101011002307">Andrew
Selous (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> I am grateful to

Paterson:</b> My hon. Friend has spoken with real passion on
the subject, and he is absolutely right. It was disappointing that we
did not manage to discuss the matter on Report or Third Reading. I urge
the Minister to find out whether something could be done in the Lords,
when the Bill goes back there, because there is a serious
problem.</p><p><a name="06101011001153"><b><a name="06101011002309">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I remind hon. Members that the reason why we did
not pursue the matter is that the head of roads policing for the
Association of Chief Police Officers assured us that the police do not
believe that any new powers are necessary. He is convinced that the
police can enforce the matter without any change in the
law.</p><br>

strongly about the issue. I suggest that the Minister invite my hon.
Friend for a serious chat about the problem, to find out whether it
could be resolved.</p><p><a name="06101011001155">Looking at
the clock, I see that I must make progress. I fear that we have not
concentrated enough on rogue drivers. The danger, as I have said, is
that we risk alienating the huge number of law-abiding drivers who want
to get from A to B. There were 200,000 speeding fines 10 years ago, but
that has rocketed to 2 million today. There are 1 million drivers on
six or more penalty points, but the number of traffic policemen has
fallen from 9,201 in 1997 to 7,103 in 2005. We are worried that there
is too much dependence on mechanical, fixed forms of enforcement, and
not enough on human beings&#151;policemen&#151;who can take account
of varying conditions. We are concerned about that serious failing in
the Government&#146;s strategy.</p><p><a name="06101011001156">We are concerned about young
drivers. Drivers under the age of 29 cause a third of such accidents,
and drivers between 17 and 20 are six times more likely to be involved
in a collision causing injury than a driver over 40. We would like more
emphasis on education, and on the need to show drivers that passing
their test and no longer needing a provisional licence is only the
beginning. It should be the start of a lifelong process of engaging
with people who know more about driving, so that they can secure more
skills and build them up. A massive opportunity has been missed in the
Bill: I would like the Secretary of State and the Minister of State to
take that on board, because young people cannot end the learning
process at 17 or 18, as soon as they have passed their test. There
should be a progression throughout their lives, and all of us should be
involved.</p><p><a name="06101011001157"><b><a name="06101011002311">David
Taylor:</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to education, but would
he include in the categories of drivers to be sent back to the
classroom the drivers of Chelsea tractors&#151;the 4x4 vehicles that
are the environmental polluters? In the <i> British Medical Journal</i>,
to which I referred a moment ago, they have been shown to be much more
likely not to be wearing seatbelts, and much more likely to be using
mobile phones in a dangerous manner. Does not that category of driver
require more
attention?</p><p><a name="06101011001158"><b><a name="06101011002312">Mr.
Paterson:</b> That may be one category, but a wide range of
people cease to concentrate on their driving skills. There should be a
carrot among the measures; my last point is that the Bill is all stick.
The Government&#146;s strategy is dependent on stick, but it should
concentrate on the rogue drivers, and there should be a carrot for the
vast majority of drivers who, as I said, want to get from A to B in
safety. We do not have that incentive system, which might possibly work
for the people mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06101011001159">Other hon. Members wish to

seek assurance from the Minister on two issues. As he knows, I tabled
two amendments that we were unable to discuss today. The first was to
make the penalty for using a hand-held mobile phone obligatory
disqualification, as it is for drink-driving. Research shows that using
a hand-held mobile phone is as distracting for a driver as being at the
blood alcohol limit for driving. Furthermore, the individual driving a
car with a mobile phone in their hand will have impaired physical
ability to control the vehicle. The Bill toughens up the provisions by
making disqualification and points on the person&#146;s licence a
possibility, but I urge the Minister for an assurance that the
Government will keep the matter under review, because the penalty is
not high
enough.</p><p><a name="06101011001163">My
second amendment related to the fitting of vehicle data recording
devices&#151;often called black boxes. Manufacturers are already
doing that, but we do not have a regime for using the information from
those devices, which are a major safety aid. In my area, the West
Midlands police are retro-fitting black boxes in all their vehicles.
They believe that the boxes will pay for themselves. In one case,
information from the black box fitted in a police vehicle was used to
exonerate a police officer accused of driving carelessly and injuring a
pedestrian. The data from the electronic box showed that that was not
the case. I seek the Minister&#146;s assurance that the Government
will continue to press that issue in the European Union so that we can
have a regime across the EU whereby all new cars are fitted with
vehicle data recording devices, which are a major aid to
safety.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_23"><a name="06101011001273">9.41

Minister indicated, the proceedings in Committee were, by and large,
constructive and good humoured. As someone who came to my present job
after being part of the Home Affairs team, that was a pleasant
change.</p><p><a name="06101011001165">I
place on record my appreciation of the efforts of my colleagues, my
hon. Friends the Members for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) and for Manchester,
Withington (Mr. Leech), and my predecessor in this job, my
hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who
led for us on Second Reading, which was some time ago. I echo the
congratulations of the hon. Member for North Shropshire to the
Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Glasgow,
South (Mr. Harris), on his well deserved appointment to the
ministerial team. The hon. Gentleman has been uncharacteristically mute
this evening, but I know from the experience of many years locked with
him in small studios at 4 Millbank, broadcasting to a tiny number of
people in Scotland, that he is a doughty defender of Government
interests. I have no doubt that when he is released from his silence
his contributions will be characteristically well informed and of
assistance to the
House.</p><p><a name="06101011001166">At times, I
wondered whether we would ever reach Third Reading. It seems so long
since we finished even the Committee stage. As has been reflected in
other contributions, much in the Bill is good. However, so much more
could be better. I feel sincere regret that on the big
issues&#151;the real opportunities in the Bill&#151;there has been
a certain timidity at the heart of the proposals and measures that the
Government have
introduced.</p><p><a name="06101011001167">A
reduction in drink-driving limits would have been a real opportunity
for the House to make a significant difference in the number of lives
lost and injuries caused, and to reinforce the message about the social
unacceptability of drinking and driving. Likewise, there could have
been an opportunity to reduce default speed limits in built-up areas,
which we see already in many different communities throughout the
country&#151;Newcastle, Aberdeen and other places are making real
progress in that regard. What a chance there was to offer those
opportunities to every community, but unfortunately, owing to timidity
and lack of conviction, the opportunity was
missed.</p><p><a name="06101011001168">Then of course
there is that issue of massive geo-political significance&#151;the
fitting of retro-reflective markings to heavy goods
vehicles&#151;which ultimately, it seems, will have to be resolved by
the United Nations Security Council. It beggars belief that so many
excuses can be produced for not doing something that is so sensible. It
really was like finding oneself in the middle of a &#147;Yes,
Minister&#148; sketch listening to the Minister tonight trying to
defend the Government&#146;s position.</p><p><a name="06101011001169">Of perhaps
less central importance but significant none the less is the question
of pedicab regulation. I am concerned that we have missed an
opportunity for proper, effective and responsible regulation of the
pedicab industry. That is of particular importance to the capital, and
for pedicabs to be squeezed off the streets by Westminster city council
and taxi operators is neither fair nor sensible. I do not know how we

the courts, and it was something that we could have dealt with in this
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101011001170">I fear that we
have not yet seen the last of the Bill. There are still a number of
issues outstanding with the other place. I refer of course to the
provisions relating to level crossings and to bridge strikes. We finish
with the Bill tonight, allowing the Minister and his colleagues time

consideration, he will see that there is worth in what the other place
has done. I hope that he will not continue to resist Members in that
place.</p><p><a name="06101011001171">Those points

that we are not talking just about car users. We should also be talking
about cyclists and pedestrians. Sometimes we spend an awful lot of time
talking about one aspect of casualties on our roads&#151;those who
drive cars or who are in cars. Of course, cars have collisions with
bikes and people. I hope that in due course we will also see further
regulation to protect those who are not in cars or heavy goods

Burrowes:</b> It has been a long road to get to this point in
improving road safety. Certainly I can commend much in the Bill, and my
constituents will do likewise. It has been a particularly long road for
those in my constituency who have been campaigning on a wide range of
road safety issues, not least the Galli-Atkinson family, who lost Livia
when, in 1997, she was the victim of a tragic crash caused by a
dangerous driver who received a lenient sentence. They have been
campaigning since then, not only on the need to increase penalties for
dangerous driving but on a wide range of issues of education and other
aspects of safety. They will no doubt commend much of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101011001175">The family
helped to set up the Livia award. Its panel met last month with my
predecessor and others to commend those police officers who have been
most meritorious in their investigation of road crash incidents and who
have shown outstanding service to road crash vehicles. During that
meeting one example exposed a gap that the Minister is too ambitious in
saying has been plugged. Last year, a driver high on drugs and drink
sped away from a police patrol car, overtook a car on a pedestrian
crossing by travelling on the wrong side of the road and struck a
married couple on the crossing. The husband died and the wife survived
but in a brain-damaged condition, and she now requires 24-hour nursing
care. The eight-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 126</b><br>relatively appropriate, but there was no sentence at all for the
injuries to the wife. I suggest that no sentence is provided by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101011001176">Another example
is that of Rachel Jones, aged 13. She was crossing a road when she was
hit by a car driven dangerously by Carl Smith at 98 mph. We all have
concerns about dangerous drivers speeding and driving unlicensed and
drunk. Rachel was left severely brain damaged and in a wheelchair for
the rest of her life. She has no movement in the right side of her
body. Her mum, Sheri Ozdemir, described Smith&#146;s two-year jail
sentence as &#147;a joke&#148;. She
said:</p><a name="brev_24"><a name="06101011001258"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;He
&#145;killed&#146; the Rachel we had for 13 years and yet he can
get away with doing just two years. Rachel&#146;s future as a bright
and active young teenager was cruelly taken from her by a man who did
not even have a licence to drive a
car.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101011001177">The driver received
a two-year sentence. The victim and her family have effectively lost a
life. Although she is living, she is brain
damaged.</p><p><a name="06101011001178">The concern
that I and others have, which we should like to have debated further on
my new clause 26, is the gap between those convicted of dangerous
driving and those convicted of causing death by dangerous driving. The
gap in sentencing is too large, considering the serious injuries that
often result from such incidents. In response to a consultation paper
in February, the Government said they would take account of non-fatal
injuries by way of a sentence for bad driving. They intended to
increase the penalty for dangerous driving from two years to five
years. They should reflect whether we need further legislation or an
increased penalty for dangerous driving to plug the gap that still
exists for those who have suffered serious injuries but not
death.</p><p><a name="06101011001179">Although the
penalties for dangerous driving have increased, those who are almost at
the point of death, who are seriously injured to the point of brain
damage, do not receive the justice that they deserve. One cannot see
the qualitative difference between the husband and wife who were both
injured. One died and the other was left brain damaged. What is the
qualitative difference between them as victims? That gap needs to be
filled. It is not adequate for the Government to say that they will
deal with the matter by introducing an aggravating factor for causing
death by dangerous driving or for dangerous driving. We need a specific
offence or, at the very least, increased penalties for dangerous
driving.</p><p><a name="06101011001180">Northern
Ireland has an offence of causing death or grievous bodily harm by
dangerous driving, but we do not. Why is that good for Northern Ireland
but not for the rest of the United Kingdom? The Bill raises questions
that victims in my constituency and elsewhere would ask. How can
Parliament justify a penalty for causing death by dangerous driving but
not for causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving? How can the
Government and Parliament justify a penalty for causing death by
dangerous driving but not for brain death by dangerous
driving?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_26"><a name="06101011001276">9.52

further the casualties that occur day in, day out on our

was able to publish some good news recently, with the 2005 statistics
for casualties on our roads, with reductions in deaths, serious
injuries and total injuries. That is a good picture which he can feel
some pride in. However, there was one worrying blip in those
statistics&#151;the number of cyclists killed in the last 12 months
of the period covered by the statistics. I am sure my hon. Friend and
his excellent team will want to evaluate what has gone wrong over the
past 12 months and what we can do through further measures of
education, enforcement of the existing laws and engineering measures to
bring down the number of deaths of some of the most vulnerable road
users.</p><p><a name="06101011001183">Generally, the
trend has been downward over a number of years. My hon. Friend can say
that the Government are well on target to meet their casualty
reductions for 2010. Some measures in the Bill will help towards those
aims. In addition to the list that my hon. Friend provided, I draw
attention to the promotion of a greater use of rehabilitation and
driver improvement courses. They will prove to be significant over
time.</p><p><a name="06101011001184">Quite properly,
the House is taking seriously the matter of death on our roads. There
are a number of measures to do with death in the Bill, such as causing
death by careless driving and causing death when driving illegally.
Equally significant will be the alternative verdict permitted in a
manslaughter case, which I hope will encourage prosecutors to be a
little braver in charging people with manslaughter in appropriate
cases&#151;the most serious
ones.</p><p><a name="06101011001185">So all in all,

more than 18 months, I and Bedfordshire police&#151;and, indeed, many
other police forces throughout the country&#151;have been trying to
convince the Government that there is a very real problem with drivers
who register their vehicles to addresses where the police cannot
contact them. In response to my intervention on a Front-Bench colleague
a few moments ago, the Minister said that the Association of Chief
Police Officers told him that that was not a problem. Merely asserting
that to be the case does not make it so. Officers from Thames Valley
police and from the forces of Suffolk, Greater Manchester,

few&#151;those who actually have to do the job&#151;have told
Bedfordshire police that there is a very real problem. They have tried
to feed that message up through ACPO. Perhaps there is a blockage in
ACPO and its senior people are not listening to the officers on the
ground who have to enforce the law, but there is a very real problem
here.</p><p><a name="06101011001188">I do not know
why the Government have not moved on this matter; they have had plenty
of warning. There have been two meetings at the Home Office and
twoat the Department for Transport, and we have had 18 months
to look into this issue. In my constituency, there are horrendous
examples of people driving unbelievably dangerously&#151;speeding
past cameras and jumping red lights time and again&#151;whom the
police can do nothing about. Bedfordshire police recently gave me a
list of five fatalities, including that of an 18-month-old child, all
of which could have been prevented if the Government had taken this
issue seriously.</p><p><a name="06101011001189">The

the amendments that I tried to put before them&#151;we would have had
before us a new clause 17 tonight&#151;but at no time have they come

Ladyman:</b> I did not say that the current system is
acceptable. What I said was that ACPO has given me a categorical
assurance that it believes that this matter can be dealt with through
policing techniques. Chief constable Med Hughes, who is the ACPO
officer responsible for road policing, has told me that in his
view&#151;he believes that this is also the view of ACPO&#151;this
issue can be dealt with by different forms of policing. That is where

suggests that it does not work and that they simply have no options.
The result is thousands of offences for which the fines are not
collected, and the offences are repeated again and again; indeed, a
whole morass of crime underpins this situation. Why would someone
commit a crime in a vehicle other than one whose use means that they
cannot be contacted? So I am afraid that I am not satisfied with the

an issue in the years that I represented Basildon because of the

entirely responsible for the vibrant economy that we all experienced
then. What a contrast life is in Southend, where assistance is urgently
needed with the regeneration of the wonderful seaside town, part of
which I represent together with my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford

will be focusing primarily on the programmes of structural, economic
and cultural development in Southend. However, the main goal underlying
regeneration must be to capture and embed the town&#146;s sense of
identity. Hence the projects in the most visible and central areas of
the town, including Victoria avenue, the high street and the seafront
will be at the forefront of the educational, retail, office, culture
and leisure initiatives planned for the future. Critical to this will
be the use of the council&#146;s land assets and a corresponding need
to ensure that there is a deliverable strategy that also takes into
account parking and transport needs and the sad issue of cliff slippage
in Westcliff.</p><p><a name="06101011001206">My own
constituency of Southend, West, encompassing parts of Westcliff and all

linked under Southend unitary authority, sharing the same public
amenities, transport infrastructure, culture and leisure facilities,
and, most importantly, a want to see Southend thrive in
the21st century. Therefore, tonight I very much want to
address some of the problems facing Southend. For instance, in the
constituency that I represent of Southend, West, Leigh creek sadly
needs dredging, which would take a considerable amount of money but if
it could be done it would help the cocklers and local
fishermen.</p><p><a name="06101011001207">There is no
doubt that a major part of Southend&#146;s revival will be its
re-establishment as an attractive and vibrant seaside town for visitors
and residents alike. Peter Hampson, who is a director of the British
Resorts Association, has blamed transport policy for neglecting train
routes to seaside resorts, noting that train fares to coastal towns are
often more expensive than a flight to a European destination&#151;we
all realise that cheap flights will not continue for ever. In order to
compete seriously with overseas locations, seaside towns need to offer
the public more than nostalgia. As Professor John Lennon of Glasgow
Caledonian university has
noted:</p><a name="brev_30"><a name="06101011001264"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To be
viable, seaside resorts have to diversify. It&#146;s no good offering
just one visitor attraction and expecting visitor numbers to
rise.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101011001208">Holidaymakers have
become more sophisticated and demand more from seaside
resorts.</p><br>

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 132</b><br><p><a name="06101011001209">Southend&#146;s early growth
derived from its success as a fishing port, but that was overtaken in
the late19th century by internal tourism as rail
infrastructure grew. Towards the middle of the previous century, the
town diversified with local industrial and office economies. More
recently, those sectors have declined in the town as commuters have
made use of the two mainline stations, which connect to London. Despite
the comprehensive rail network, Southend still suffers some of the
worst traffic congestion in the eastern region, and public transport
does not meet all needs at the moment.</p><p><a name="06101011001210">Sustainable
development must be the priority in the regeneration of Southend, which
means continual inward investment building on the high number of
business start-ups and investing in affordable housing for key workers
and local people, which is controversial. Tourism has a major role in
the town&#146;s economy, and projects such as the redevelopment of
Southend pier following, for the third time, a fire will be central to
the town&#146;s fortunes. That seasonal industry can thrive only in
the presence of other strong local enterprises. I am delighted to say
that Southend has been identified as a major regional centre in the
Thames Gateway plan with an emphasis on culture and education, but we
will need significant investment from outside the town if it is to
fulfil that potential. Southend&#146;s unsuccessful and perhaps
controversial bid for a regional casino has been well documented. The
important point is that Southend wanted a leisure complex, which would
have benefited the town enormously.</p><p><a name="06101011001211">In addition to attracting more
people to Southend, it is essential that we continue to provide
first-class public services for our constituents. For example, there
was recently a successful world record attempt in my constituency for
gathering together the greatest number of people aged over 100, and the
ageing population has increasingly put public services in the
spotlight. We are very fortunate to have Southend University Hospital
NHS Foundation Trust, which is reaching all its clinical targets while
balancing its books, but other areas, such as social services, are
currently under desperate
pressure.</p><p><a name="06101011001212">One
problem that continues to undermine Southend borough council&#146;s
spending capacity are the woeful financial settlements awarded to it
after the 2001 census, which miscalculated the town&#146;s population
by 20,000 people. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend,
East and I had an unsatisfactory meeting with the Office for National
Statistics, which was not followed by any movement, and local residents
are suffering as a consequence. The Government grant to the council was
reduced by &#163;7 million, which has resulted in a 2 per cent.
increase for 2006-07 compared with the national average increase of 3
per cent. That matter is a great concern for local
residents.</p><p><a name="06101011001213">The
errors that led to the Government&#146;s funding shortfall to
Southend have needlessly damaged public services and the town&#146;s
faith in its council, which has had its hands tied on finance. Despite
those set backs, however, I am determined that the town fulfils its
place as the cultural hub of the Thames Gateway, a successful centre of
learning through the expansion of the university of Essex Southend
campus, a key location for transport and, importantly, accommodation
during the Olympic games and a lively tourist destination that people

proud. Local identity has been pivotal for several regeneration success
stories in the UK in terms of providing a sense of place. For instance,
Newquay, Southport, Brighton and Blackpool have all established their
identities very
successfully.</p><p><a name="06101011001214">Southend
has been identified as the centre of culture and leisure in the Thames
Gateway. As part of that project, the Government are looking to create
13,000 new jobs and several thousand new homes in Southend by 2021. The
plan envisages that growth being achieved through employment-led
regeneration to produce a more sustainable balance between housing and
employment, with growth targets carefully calculated in an attempt to
reduce out-commuting.</p><p><a name="06101011001215">Renaissance Southend was
incorporated as a private limited company on 18 March last year in
response to the need for regeneration. Its objectives are to assist,
promote, encourage, develop and secure regeneration in the social,
physical and economic environment of Southend-on-Sea. The high street
benefits from two mainline rail stations serving a large number of
local stations within the immediate and adjoining urban areas. It also
has good proximity to the seafront and a high number of seasonal
visitors. However, although work is being undertaken to redevelop
Victoria plaza, the quality of retail outlets on offer is generally not
ideal for a town the size of Southend and reinforces the impression
that residents generally may wish to shop elsewhere, which is very sad.
In addition, despite Southend&#146;s being reported as the
&#147;safest&#148; place in the country to live in a crime survey
earlier this year, there is a general perception that the high street
is unsafe after shopping hours, which is largely exacerbated by
pedestrianisation. I do not think that Southend high street has ever
recovered from the loss of a major store called Keddies.</p><p><a name="06101011001216">The diversity of the high
street has recently been enhanced by the relocation of South-East Essex
further education college. Work has also commenced on the next phase of
the university of Essex campus, with a new enterprise and innovation
faculty. A further phase of the university&#146;s expansion will be
the redevelopment of the Palace hotel, which is going great guns at the
moment. It will be used as a conference and business training centre
and is due to be completed in late 2007 through a &#163;14 million
grant from the Government&#146;s sustainable communities fund, for
which Southend residents are very grateful, and &#163;1.5 million
fromthe East of England Development Agency. Accommodating the
further growth of the University of Essex and South-East Essex college
will help to establish the centre of Southend as a cultural hub that
could also include a new public and university library, and possibly
even a performance and media centre. In addition, Prospects college, a
privately run vocational training establishment, has already secured
funding for the acquisition of a new site and is putting together
funding for the construction of new premises that will significantly
enhance vocational skills and training opportunities, particularly for
construction-related
trades.</p><p><a name="06101011001217">The town is
accessed by two principal east-west roads&#151;the A127 and the A13.
While the former is primarily an access route for commercial traffic to
the main employment areas, it still suffers from severe

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 134</b><br>congestion during peak hours at a number of junctions. Southend&#146;s
road network is not fit for purpose&#151;the result of historical
underfunding by all Governments. The employment-led regeneration
objective of Thames Gateway South Essex will be severely constrained
without investment in the arterial roads, and there is no evidence as
yet that that will be forthcoming. The aforementioned budget shortfalls
following the 2001 census forced Southend borough council to cease
their subsidies to the two bus operators in the town, which in turn led
them to axe all loss-making routes. That has been most harshly felt in
the areas of Eastwood and Belfairs, and it has particularly affected
senior citizens.</p><p><a name="06101011001218">However, our transport problems
in Southend will not be solved simply by diverting people on to public
transport&#151;commercial vehicles must be able to access businesses
in the town too. The strategy for Southend&#146;s regeneration must
therefore include wide-scale plans for overhauling our road network. My
hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East might want to
mention the Ministry of Defence site in Shoebury. There are also issues
regarding the Priory crescent development, which has not yet been
signed off. Apart from that, there appears to be no commitment to any
other major transport infrastructure for the town to support growth and
regeneration.</p><p><a name="06101011001219">Southend
airport, which is run by Regional Airports Ltd, has planning permission
for a new terminal and rail station plus a current application for an
adjacent park-and-ride facility. It recently published a masterplan
following the principles set out in the airports White Paper. It
reflects its current business plan objective to increase passenger
numbers to 1 million people per annum in the next four to five years.
Of course, that is again rather
controversial.</p><p><a name="06101011001220">The
local partners who are engaged with Renaissance Southend have worked
hard to develop strategies aimed at overhauling the structural and
cultural amenities in the town. Those strategies must tackle the
town&#146;s ailing tourist industry by re-establishing well-known
landmarks such as Southend pier. However, as I said earlier, we cannot
rely on a single modern monument and nostalgia alone. More active
intervention is imperative. Local residents welcome any tangible and
sensible assistance in the regeneration of
Southend.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_31"><a name="06101011001281">10.15

Duddridge (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):</b> I
congratulate my colleague, neighbour and hon. Friend the Member for
Southend, West (Mr. Amess). I should like to make four
points.</p><p><a name="06101011001222">First,
I reiterate my hon. Friend&#146;s point about the 2001 census.
Several meetings were held with Ministers in good faith to try to
resolve the problem but it persists. Every time that the Government try
to redistribute money via local government, Southend gets a poor deal.
I hope that the Under-Secretary&#151;an Essex Minister&#151;can
shed some light and perhaps even a ray of hope where other Ministers
have failed to
shine.</p><p><a name="06101011001223">Secondly, there
is a democratic deficit in relation to Southend and Essex&#151;and, I
suspect, in relation to regeneration generally. We have Thames Gateway
South Essex, Thames Gateway, a Whitehall tsar for Thames Gateway, the
East of England Development

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

and now Renaissance Southend. There is a confusion of regeneration
organisations. There are some very talented people in those
organisations but I believe that the structures are dysfunctional. The
further we move money away from individual members of the public
towards either pan-national organisations such as the European Union or
regional organisations or quangos, the more poorly it is
spent.</p><p><a name="06101011001224">Thirdly, I
want to consider infrastructure and Priory crescent. I would greatly
appreciate it if the Under-Secretary updated the House on the dualling
of Priory crescent. The decision about whether we should dual has been
controversial in Southend. However, the matter has been through a
public consultation and it would be wrong, having gone through it, and
giventhe need to improve east-west communications, for the
road building not to go ahead. I look to the Under-Secretary for an
update about the funding and some assurance that protesters will not
block the democratic right of local people to dual that
road.</p><p><a name="06101011001225">Fourthly, let me
look forward to Southend 2012. There is an enormous opportunity to give
Southend&#146;s position leverage in the region as we approach the
Olympics. We have the campus at the university of Essex and we have the
airport, as my hon. Friend said. Southend would be an ideal place to
base an Olympic team. Let me refer to Members&#146; interests:
Southend United made a donation to my party before the election. It was
a case of the blues supporting the blues and I reciprocate on
Saturdays. Southend is building a 20,000-seater stadium, which I
support. That is a possible venue, not for the Olympics, but for a
training camp and general
training.</p><p><a name="06101011001226">There is so
much opportunity. I look forward to hearing from the Under-Secretary
how she and the Department will step up to that enormous opportunity. I
am sure that she wants to do
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_32"><a name="06101011001282">10.18

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):</b> I congratulate the hon.

today&#146;s debate, which gives us the opportunity to examine the
continuing significant work on regeneration in Southend. I am pleased
that he recognised the work that is continuing on jobs, skills,
culture, education and
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06101011001228">I have
a fondness for Southend. The hon. Gentleman mentioned his time in

is interesting for me to be here today, replying to this
debate.</p><p><a name="06101011001229">The

coastal towns and on the issues facing those towns. That will be
valuable in determining the issues that are generic to a number of such
towns. Southend faces a number of problems that

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 136</b><br>are caused largely by structural weaknesses in the local economy, and by
an over-dependence on tourism, on fishing and on certain types of
financial and business institutions. Southend needs a mixed economy,
and I am pleased to see the increase in tourism that has taken place
since 1998. It might be helpful to look atthe figures. In
1998, tourism was worth just over&#163;135 million to
Southend. By 2004, the figure had increased to &#163;217 million.
That is a great achievement, but we need to see economic regeneration
as a whole.</p><p><a name="06101011001230">Southend
is often regarded as a leafy, affluent seaside town, but there are
pockets of deprivation and economic inactivity, mainly centred around
the Milton, Victoria and Kursaal areas in the constituency of the hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), which border
the sea front. To improve the lives of all the people in Southend, we
need not only to improve the physical infrastructure but to create an
environment in which the economy can thrive. Education is particularly
important in that regard.</p><p><a name="06101011001231">Both hon. Members referred to
the census figures, which have caused certain difficulties. Numerous
representations have been made between the council, local MPs and the
Office for National Statistics. We appreciate the concerns that have
been expressed, but the Government set their grant allocations based on
the best information available, which comes from the ONS. I appreciate
that correspondence on this matter is ongoing, and the Minister for
Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and
Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) has met MPs and members of the
council to discuss the issue. I understand that the ONS has invited
Southend to participate in a project on improving migration and
population statistics. That project will look at the areas of migration
that have caused concern to the council and to local MPs, and I hope
that the work will provide an explanation and help us to reach a
solution.</p><p><a name="06101011001232">The hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East mentioned the revenue support
grant. Southend received a net increase of 2.2 per cent. in formula
grant in 2006-07, and will provisionally receive 2.7 per cent. in
2007-08. Council tax was increased by 4.9 per cent. While the hon.
Gentleman and the hon. Member for Southend, West are discussing these
matters with the ONS to see whether any progress can be made, they
might also like to look at the Audit Commission&#146;s &#147;use of
resources&#148; assessments that formed part of its comprehensive
assessment work. Southend&#146;s use of resources and providing value
for money in 2005 received a score of two out of four, so perhaps there
is room for Southend council to make some progress there. The
Department would of course be happy to help in that regard.</p><p><a name="06101011001233">Speaking as
someone who loves Southend pier, I was sorry to hear, a year ago
today&#151;it was my husband&#146;s birthday, so I remember the
date well&#151;that the pier had been attacked by fire for the third
time in living memory. I am pleased to report that the pier reopened in
August 2006, however. Hon. Members might be interested to note that,
between December 2005 and June 2006, more than 44,000 visitors came to
the pier. That is a tremendous achievement, and it shows just how
popular an attraction 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 137</b><br>the pier is. I also recommend a visit to the wonderful pier museum to
anyone who visits the pier. It is right, however, not to see the pier
as the sole attraction, and the work that has gone into supporting the
Pier Hill redevelopment, involving nearly &#163;6 million in
Government and European money, has had a significant impact in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06101011001234">The role of
Renaissance Southend in the regeneration programme is important to the
town as a whole, and I was disappointed in the comments of the hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East about a democratic deficit. It
is important to bring together the public and private sectors in this
programme. I know that Renaissance Southend is keen to work with
Members of Parliament, and I understand that both the hon. Member for
Rochford and Southend, East and the hon. Member for Southend, West have
met its representatives. It is also working closely with the local
council, and it is engaged in stakeholder workshops. Last week, it
undertook an audit walk through the town centre with invited members of
the public. It is also planning more continuous, conventional forms of
engagement. The work that it is doing to develop the town as a cultural
and educational centre, and the work that it is doing for the
university, will be conducted with all partners being involved. I
understand that the council is closely involved with the board of
Renaissance
Southend.</p><p><a name="06101011001235">I was
delighted by the enthusiasm for the Olympics shown by the hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East. I share his commitment, and Essex has
a tremendous amount to gain. Obviously, the focus will be on east
London, but geographical proximity means that we can benefit enormously
through such things as the image of our area internationally, the
tourism economy and the growth that we will see in business and
transport services, skills and jobs. All those will be important to
us.</p><p><a name="06101011001236">The Department is
closely involved with the Olympic steering committee, and will look at
the games and the legacy to see how we can benefit, as well as the
whole Thames Gateway group. I am happy to keep the hon. Gentleman
informed on those issues, given his commitment, but there is a great
advantage for the whole of Essex, including Southend, which will
benefit.</p><p><a name="06101011001237">Both hon.
Members mentioned road improvements in the Priory Crescent area. Part
of that is the development between the A127 and Cuckoo Corner areas,
which is being considered. Approval was granted by the Government in
the 2000 local transport capital settlement, and the Department for
Transport contributed &#163;14.5 million. Southend council came back
to say that additional money was required, because the project was more
expensive than was first thought. In June, the council requested
additional funding, not just for road improvements, but for a bus
passenger transport corridor. I understand that my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Transport is looking at this issue and
expects to make an announcement
shortly.</p><p><a name="06101011001238">Another issue
that is worth mentioning, and both hon. Members referred to it, is
tackling crime and antisocial behaviour. Southend is a safe place to
be. It is one of the safest areas in the country, but there is
no 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 138</b><br>doubt that the people of Southend&#151;a MORI poll recorded a figure
of 81 per cent.&#151;want crime and antisocial behaviour to be
tackled
better.</p><p><a name="06101011001239">On
Friday and Saturday nights, about 13,000 young people move around the
clubs and pubs in the Southend area. About 60 per cent. of crime in the
borough is committed between 10 pm and 4 am in the town centre and the
adjacent streets. The Government have allocated &#163;232,000, which
is a great deal of money and which includes &#163;25,000 to tackle
antisocial behaviour, to the Southend crime and disorder reduction
partnership. There is also &#163;133,000 for a family intervention
scheme and &#163;1.6 million from the neighbourhood element of the
safer and stronger communities
fund.</p><p><a name="06101011001240">That is all
having an effect, and I must tell hon. Members that violence against
the person, sexual offences, robbery and theft of motor vehicles have
all decreased in the last 12 months. There is a very strong message: we
are not prepared to tolerate antisocial or yobbish behaviour, and the
Government are putting their money where their mouth is to try to
tackle those
areas.</p><p><a name="06101011001241">There are major
development opportunities in the Southend area that can make a
difference, but if we really want to make a difference to the economy,
we have to tackle education opportunities as well. The campus of the
university of Essex has already been mentioned. This is a &#163;52
million investment in South East Essex college, right in the heart of
the town centre. The state-of-the-art campus of the university of Essex
at Southend will provide educational facilities, a business development
centre and an innovation centre alongside commercial space. We
anticipate that it will create up to 800 jobs in
Southend.</p><p><a name="06101011001242">There is
also support for the establishment of a trust school at Thorpe Bay,
which will bring a failing school out of special measures and create a
major new vocational training centre. There are funding opportunities,
as pump priming funding has also come in to support work on Pier Hill.
As part of the commitment to establishing Renaissance Southend, the
East of England Development Agency has pledged to spend an average of
&#163;3 million to &#163;5 million a year in the Southend
area.</p><p><a name="06101011001243">Southend airport
also has the potential to contribute more to the economy of Southend.
It has aspirations for growth of about 1 million passengers a year by
2012.</p><p><a name="06101011001244">In conclusion,
it is important that we look forward. As both hon. Members said,
Southend has the potential to be a major hub of prosperity in the
region. Given the way in which people are working together in the
primary care trust, police, council and Renaissance Southend, I hope
that the slogan when I lived in Southend, &#147;Southend-on-Sea, the
place to be&#148; will come true again for Southend. There are
challenges ahead, which I would not underestimate, but I hope that the
hon. Gentlemen will be reassured that the support from the Government,
ongoing activities, plans and investment are there to make
Southend&#146;s prospects much brighter in the future.</p><p><a name="06101011001245">Finally, it is worth noting
