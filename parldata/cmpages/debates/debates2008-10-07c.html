However, we were told by people in Iran that bellicose statements threatening Iran militarily make those who do not support the Ahmadinejad regime rally behind it. It is a lesson of history that people will often rally behind a regime when their country is threatened. Will the Foreign Secretary take on board the fact that language is very important? That is not to say that we should not carry a big stick, but language is very important.</p>

We are also making a serious offer to Iran for economic, cultural and scientific co-operation. I think that that is the way forward, but it is not a way forward while the Iranian Government continue to defy not only the UN Security Council, but the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has continuing serious concerns about their programme and about their refusal to come clean about it.</p>

 I do have genuinely huge respect for my right hon. Friend, but I cannot associate myself with that last sentence which he uttered. He will know that almost from my first day in this job I have emphasised that we are 100 per cent. committed to a diplomatic course with Iran and to a process of making it a serious offer that presents it major economic&#151;never mind political&#151;benefits, but that we must be insistent that a uranium enrichment programme in defiance of not only the UN Security Council, but of Iran&#146;s obligations under the non-proliferation treaty is a serious danger to stability in not just the middle east, but in the world.

 Could the Foreign Secretary say a little more about the outcome of the human rights discussions, because how Iran treats its own citizens gives some indication of how it might treat other people if it ever got the chance? Is he aware of reports of widespread executions, including mass executions and the executions of minors? If he has not already done so, could he make it clear to the Iranian Government that if they want to play a part in the world order and to persuade others that their own religion is other than barbaric, they must conform better to world standards of human rights?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point: how a country treats its own citizens is often a good indicator of how it is willing to treat citizens in other parts of the world. Perhaps I can give him the figures, which are horrific. Some 235 people have been executed in Iran during the first eight months of this year, and there were more than 300 executions last year&#151;that was an increase from 177 in 2006. He also rightly says that Iran executes more juvenile offenders than any other country in the world. He is absolutely right to raise those human rights questions. We raise them too, and we deplore the way in which the Iranian Parliament is also now discussing a draft penal code that would set out a mandatory death sentence for the crime, quote unquote, of apostasy.

 Would the Foreign Secretary agree that President Ahmadinejad&#146;s speech to the UN was probably the most consistently anti-Semitic speech by any leader since the end of the Third Reich? Does he also agree that the Conservative Muslim Forum&#146;s argument that Iran should have nuclear weapons is not helpful? The Prime Minister said last night, in an important speech, that we have to look at tightening up and increasing sanctions. Does the Foreign Secretary agree therefore that we need unity in this House, in Europe and with the United States and the world&#146;s democracies, but not with those who find excuses for Iran&#146;s leader?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes three important points. If he looks at the special UN Security Council discussion on the middle east the week before last in New York, he will see that I specifically raised President Ahmadinejad&#146;s description of the, quote unquote, cesspool of Zionism, which was a disgraceful, anti-Semitic attack and a threat to a whole country. It was one member state of the UN threatening the life of another, which I am sure is abhorrent to all hon. Members. It is fair to say that we have seen a fair degree of unity across the House&#151;in all three main parties&#151;on this issue. The twin-track diplomatic approach is the right one. The so-called carrots of economic and scientific co-operation are right, but they have to be balanced by the potential sticks of economic sanctions.

Compared with last year, the overall area under opium poppy cultivation this year is down by 19 per cent. and the number of poppy-free provinces is up from 13 to 18. However, production fell by only 6 per cent. due to higher yields. Those figures reflect the growing success of the Afghan Government&#146;s drug control strategy.

It is a difficult situation. We are making progress and I think that we can defeat the Taliban in their efforts to usurp the will of the Afghan people through their democratically elected Government, but it is not just a question of having a military strategy.

 I am always happy to meet hon. Members or delegations, and either I or my hon. Friend the Minister of State will meet them on that date, depending on availability. When we talk of Israel implementing its commitments under UN resolutions, which I support, we must also call on all parties to implement all their commitments under the UN Security Council resolutions.

 As well as the illegality of the settlements themselves, does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the disturbing things that has happened recently is the upsurge in injuries as a result of settler attacks on Palestinians in the west bank? Although the Israeli Government cannot control their militants any better than the Palestinians can control their militants, is it not worrying that according to the UN between 80 and 90 per cent. of cases have their files closed by the Israeli authorities before prosecution?</p>

 Certainly, violence on any side is to be deplored. In the west bank at the moment, as I have seen for myself, there is a delicate process of building up the Palestinian security force, with a training centre in Jericho funded by the UK and the new move into Jenin, which has put Palestinian security forces on to the streets of Jenin, including its refugee camp, for the first time. That needs to be supported, and it needs to be supported by the Israel Defence Forces controlling areas where it still has a presence, and also by the Israeli Government.

 To my knowledge we have been regularly pressing the Israelis on the issue since 1995-96, when in the wake of Oslo it was clear that settlement building was continuing. Since Oslo the number of settlers has more than doubled. Every single day that a Palestinian is looking across at a settlement, the fact of Israel&#146;s settlement policy gainsays whatever else Israel says about seeking peace and a sustainable two-state solution.

 The problem that the hon. Gentleman identifies is absolutely right and the diagnosis is shared on the Government side. What we do about it is to press the Israelis, both publicly and privately, and work with our partners to ensure that there is a robust peace process. I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that for seven years after January 2001 there was no political process at all. Alongside settlement building, the absence of a political process meant that there was nothing for Palestinians or Israelis who wanted a two-state solution to invest in.

 The EU has just completed its fourth session negotiations with central American countries on the association agreement in July. The latest session is ongoing and good progress has been made so far. The UK is supporting the EU&#146;s eagerness to push forward in the next session, particularly with regard to sustainable development, and environmental and political issues. On trade and aid, it is probably worth saying that trade is very much a powerful engine for growth, and for poverty reduction. Some 70 per cent. of UK Government aid for supporting trade development is delivered through various multilateral institutions, which enables poor people to trade their way out of poverty.</p>

 Three months in, the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur, UNAMID, is still well below planned strength, with UN members failing to provide 18 requested helicopters, despite a recent NGO report showing that Italy, Romania, Spain and the Czech Republic, among others, collectively have at least 70 suitable aircraft available.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. I share his frustration at the fact that the UNAMID force is now made up of 9,000 peacekeepers, not the 26,000 who were promised by the UN resolution. The issue was raised in New York with the Vice-President of Sudan, because it has important responsibilities. My hon.

We have been living beyond our means, both as a nation and individually, and now the day of reckoning is coming. As we look to rebuild our economy on a stable, sustainable basis for the future, it is clear that Governments of all political persuasions will have to embrace the practice, not merely the rhetoric, of fiscal discipline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81007-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08100734000166">Fiscal discipline was supposed to have been delivered by the Prime Minister&#146;s much-vaunted fiscal rules, but they have failed to protect us from this Government&#146;s fiscal irresponsibility.

<a name="81007-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08100734000351"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;our fiscal rules have been specifically designed to preclude party political manipulation of the public finances for electoral purposes.&#148;</p>

Those rules failed to constrain fiscal policy during the years of growth, and that failure is directly responsible for Britain entering this period of economic turmoil with the largest fiscal deficit of any nation in the world except Egypt, Hungary and Pakistan. They did not stop this Government borrowing right the way through the top of a boom, at a time when many of our neighbours were running budget surpluses, paying off debt, and getting themselves leaner and fitter to confront whatever the future held for them&#151;fixing their roofs while the sun shone. A third of OECD countries are now debt-free. At the end of an unprecedented period of world economic growth, however, the UK has net debt at a higher proportion of gross domestic product than in 1997&#151;without taking account of the billions salted away through Enron-style accounting practices, off the balance sheet, out of sight and out of mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81007-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08100734000168">It was not that the incoming Labour Government did not recognise the issue in 1997, or that they denied the importance of fiscal discipline. Far from it&#151;the then Chancellor placed his fiscal rules at the heart of his economic strategy, alongside Bank of England independence, as one of the key building blocks in his claimed commitment to fiscal and economic stability. However, like the debt-fuelled boom, the fiscal rules have turned out to be an illusion. They failed. They did not do what a set of fiscal rules had to do to be credible: they did not prevent borrowing at the peak of a boom. On that there is now widespread consensus.</p>

car crash in slow motion. It began in 2005, when the then Chancellor avoided breaching the golden rule by the skin of his teeth with an eleventh-hour announcement of a reassessment of the timing of the economic cycle. From that point on, reputable commentators and publications have progressively ceased to refer to the fiscal rules as a serious measure of Government performance on the public finances.

It was precisely the traditional practice of loosening fiscal policy at the first sign of political trouble that the fiscal rules were supposed to avoid. They were intended to be a constraint on Government, a discipline that would ensure that something was put aside in the good years so that Government would be able to support families and businesses when more difficult times arrived. Instead, once again we are watching a Labour Government running out of money and being singled out by the International Monetary Fund for fiscal irresponsibility.</p>

Our purpose in calling this debate today is not merely to draw attention to the failure of the fiscal rules and the absence of fiscal discipline or to the contribution that that failure has made to the situation we are now in and the Government&#146;s lack of room for manoeuvre in responding to it. Our purpose is to look to the future and to put forward an alternative framework to try to ensure that we collectively never allow ourselves to do this again&#151;to borrow through a boom, to spend money we have not got, to pile up debt we cannot afford and to mortgage our future and the future of our children with the borrowing today that will inevitably become the taxation of tomorrow.</p>

 Further to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), does my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary believe that the Prime Minister&#146;s claim to have ended boom and bust contributed to the fact that people in this country cut their rate of saving at first in half and then just to a fraction of its level in 1997, leaving homes and families throughout this country in a much worse position to face the bust that is now coming at the end of the Brown boom?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The message that went out was that low interest rate easy credit would be with us for ever, and that it was safe to borrow far larger multiples of income and to draw equity from one&#146;s house in a way that, with the benefit of hindsight, was incredibly imprudent and ill-advised, and the Prime Minister will have to bear the responsibility for that message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08100734000190">Step one in developing an alternative framework to the discredited fiscal rules was to understand why the current fiscal rules so comprehensively failed to deliver, and step two was to analyse whether they could be fixed. The sustainable investment rule is the simpler of the two rules to deal with. It says that in every single year, net Government debt should remain below 40 per cent. of GDP. That is a rather unambitious target in the face of our rapidly ageing population and the Government&#146;s own long-term fiscal projections show that if we do nothing, public spending will rise simply because of the demographic profile. The target takes no account of the need to put money aside for the future, and it has simply been broken, with current net debt at 43.3 per cent. of GDP and set to rise, and, as important, the use of off-balance sheet financing to conceal billions of pounds of private finance initiative debt alone makes it meaningless. Worse, the Government&#146;s determination to avoid being seen to breach the rule for as long as possible has led to a hugely costly distortion in public procurement as more and more projects have been forced into PFI structures, not because risk is being genuinely transferred, but so that capital spending can be financed off-balance sheet.</p>

That is a perfectly sensible proposition, but it has not been delivered.</p>

 On a technical point, the hon. Gentleman refers to the definition of projects within PFI, but I think he recalls that the Office for National Statistics normally carries out the task of reviewing whether a project should be placed on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet. Is he questioning the judgment that has been exercised in that respect?</p>

<p><a name="st_o125"><a name="08100734000193"><a name="81007-0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="08100734000510"><b>Mr. Hammond:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman will recall that the Government committed to bring a large amount of this PFI liability back on-balance sheet from this year and then, apparently for technical reasons, pushed things back by a year. It will now be next year that some, at least, of this stuff comes back on to the balance sheet. When we examine these large numbers&#151;these large percentages of GDP&#151;it is important to remember that we are seeing only part of the picture; another bit of the picture remains off the balance sheet at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08100734000194">The golden rule has not been delivered on because, this Government have consistently overestimated since 2001, tax receipts and underestimated the deficit, because the Chancellor has been allowed to mark his own scorecard and, crucially, because measuring compliance with the rule depends on the precise dating of the economic cycle, and that can be known only after the event&#151;sometimes long after the event. In other words, the rule is backward-looking, while any credible judgment of fiscal sustainability must be forward-looking.</p>

So the golden rule is flawed not only in its implementation; it is flawed in principle. The Prime Minister&#146;s fiscal rules have failed the practicality test, because just as no sensible set of fiscal rules would suggest that Government borrowing and net public debt should not rise at a time of economic slowdown, so no sensible fiscal rule would allow us to arrive at such a time with borrowing bumping up close to the ceiling, leaving no room for counter-cyclical responses to the economic downturn and no room to help hard-pressed families and businesses, never mind for any additional measures that may be necessary to deal with the financial sector crisis.</p>

systems on the basis of the empirical observation that, in practice, rules either tend to be too loose to be effective or so inflexible that Governments break them. While it might be possible in theory to design a rule that suggested the right response in all circumstances, such a rule would inevitably be too complex to operate in practice. So after careful consideration and consultation, our preference is for institutional reform to entrench fiscal stability. Last week, my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor put forward our proposals for a new fiscal responsibility framework, as part of our plan for a strong economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para10"><a name="08100734000200">The framework will be at the heart of our economic policy. Its starting point will be that Governments, like the rest of us, must live within their means, not only because economic stability requires it, but because intergenerational fairness requires it. That will ensure that collectively we never make the same mistakes again, and in future all British Governments will be forced to fix the roof while the sun is shining. They will have to acknowledge that Governments cannot abolish the economic cycle, whatever Chancellors might like to claim, and will be forced to put something aside for the rainy day that will periodically come around.</p>

First, we will scrap the discredited fiscal rules, which are neither use nor ornament and, with the benefit of hindsight, never were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08100734000202">Secondly, we will introduce a tough, new, forward-looking mandate for the public finances at the end of a forecast horizon, with falling debt as a percentage of GDP and a balanced current budget, after adjusting for the economic cycle. Thirdly, and crucially, for the first time in Britain we will create an independent body accountable to Parliament, the office of budget responsibility, to publish independent forecasts and to assess the performance of Government against the outcomes it has specified.</p>

and crevices such as the private finance initiative, Network Rail and under-recognised depreciation on military equipment. That should appeal to a Prime Minister who I saw on the telly last night calling for more transparency&#151;except that of course he was calling for it from someone else, not from his Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para14"><a name="08100734000206">Let me explain, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), how the OBR will monitor the health of the public finances and hold Governments to account on an ongoing basis. First, the Chancellor will set the mandate for the public finances. This will remain his responsibility, just as the inflation target is set by him within the monetary policy framework. Then, every year, in advance of the Budget, the OBR will present its fiscal forecast, which will include a judgment of the sustainability of the public finances against the mandate it has been given. It will also include the OBR&#146;s best independent estimate of the true scale of all future Government liabilities. The judgment will state how much fiscal loosening or tightening the OBR thinks is needed by the end of the forecast horizon in order for its central forecast to meet the Chancellor&#146;s mandate. Crucially, however, the mix of any tightening or loosening between tax revenues and spending&#151;a political decision&#151;will be explicitly outside the OBR&#146;s remit. That will remain the responsibility of the Chancellor of the day, who will deliver in his Budget his judgment of the required net loosening or tightening of fiscal policy against the backdrop of that OBR-published report. If for any reason he or she does not agree with the OBR judgment, he or she must explain why to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para15"><a name="08100734000207">Finally, the decisions taken in the Budget would be taken into account in the OBR&#146;s next report and the OBR would comment on the likely medium and long-term fiscal consequences of any significant deviation from its recommendation.</p>

We will put in place a mechanism for scrutiny by the Select Committee on Treasury and by Parliament of appointments not only to the OBR but to the Monetary Policy Committee, enhancing and strengthening the independence of both institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="81007-0005.htm_para16"><a name="08100734000210">We need a fresh start, a proper recognition of the extent of the nation&#146;s liabilities, a clear plan for dealing with them and a mechanism for holding Governments to account for irresponsible borrowing. There will be no more marking by the Chancellor of his own exam papers and no more backward-looking targets that cannot be determined until years after decisions are made. Instead, there will be a system that delivers a constraint throughout the cycle based on the independent assessment of the office for budget responsibility, holding the Government publicly to account for their performance. That will call time on the repeated fantasy forecasts of jam tomorrow that we have seen in successive Budgets  <br>

bust that is following it is that there are no free lunches. Prosperity is built on hard work, not easy credit. We can rebuild Britain&#146;s economic future, but to do so we must rediscover, and then never again lose sight of, the fundamentals of a strong economy&#151;sound money, fiscal discipline and living within our means. We must earn our keep rather than putting everything on the nation&#146;s credit card for our children and our children&#146;s children to pay.

Given the wider economic events that we have seen, it is perhaps a surprise that the Opposition have chosen to focus on the fiscal rules rather than on the overall events in the world economy. The House will have a chance on Thursday to discuss more widely the events in the economy, and we have also had yesterday&#146;s statement from the Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08100734000226">The fiscal position is of course affected by those major world events. The Chancellor&#146;s statement made it clear that we are continuing to see significant turbulence in the global financial markets, and there is also continuing pressure on financial institutions across the world. That pressure has been evident in Iceland today, and in other countries too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08100734000227">We have already provided support across the system, such as through the special liquidity scheme and the actions of the Bank of England, and we have also taken action on individual banks that have got into trouble&#151;for example, in the cases of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock. It was unfortunate that Conservative Members opposed and continue to oppose the action on Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock. Had we not stepped in to support those two institutions and to take action, there would have been massive consequences for the financial stability of the British banking system and serious problems for the economy, for the public finances and, in particular, pressure for individual savers across the country. It was right that we should step in to support them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08100734000228">As the Chancellor said yesterday, there has been considerable speculation about capital and the banking sector in recent days. In examining options for restoring stability to the banking sector, it is right that we look at every aspect&#151;liquidity, capital and regulation&#151;with other countries and, of course, with the financial sector itself. That process is continuing and we will update the House at the appropriate time.</p>

 In fact, the action being taken by the Financial Services Authority is to look at the need for regulation on liquidity and not simply on solvency. Its report in the light of the events of last summer made that clear, and it is right that it should do so. We have needed to provide considerable additional liquidity support across the system. It is probably also right to say that there were not sufficient assessments of liquidity risks internationally and between countries, as well as of the work that has been done by the FSA.

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) has just told the House that lack of fiscal discipline is the root cause of the problems we face. That is economic illiteracy. Forget sub-prime lending in the US mortgage markets; forget the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the hugely complex bundling of toxic assets from the US; and forget the volatility in the money markets or the responsibility of international bankers. According to Opposition Members, the problem in the international markets is simply the level of UK Government borrowing and debt. I have to say that that view is utterly irresponsible and if Opposition Members do not understand the problem, they cannot be trusted to take the right decisions on how we deal with it and how we solve it to go forward.</p>

 If the right hon. Lady looks up the last three Budget debates, she will find that I always pointed out that the level of growth we were still enjoying was sustained by a bubble of Government and household debt, and that it was unsustainable. She will see that the reply of Ministers was to treat that with total disdain. Indeed, they claimed credit for the prosperity that was flowing from the boom, which was the product of their own remarkable economic policies. They denied the need to take action against such things as 140 per cent. lending on the value of houses or six times earnings when people certified their own earnings. They took credit for the boom, but they never saw the bust coming and circumstances in the UK are as bad as they are in the United States because of the Government&#146;s complacency.</p>

In particular, our country was bottom of the G7 when it came to national income per head of population when he left office, but it is now the second in the G7 as a result of decisions that the Government took and the investment and economic stability that we experienced. We face significant world economic problems as a result of the dodgy lending that started in the US mortgage markets, the bundling of assets round the world and back again, and a lack of understanding of where risks lay, not just in the banking sector but among credit rating agencies and regulators.</p>

 The Chancellor yesterday told us that a number of building societies had unsustainable business models, and now had to be bailed out. Why was that allowed to happen?

 The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the issues to do with the economy, either deliberately or otherwise. He is confusing different kinds of borrowing and different kinds of debt. I understand that he has a political interest in doing so. He simply wants to muddy the waters and pretend that the private-sector credit crunch is somehow the result of public-sector debt. That is economic illiteracy, and it is simply not the case. The problem is not simply inexperience on the part of the Opposition. I do not think that their misjudgments in the cases of Northern Rock or Bradford &amp; Bingley are simply the result of inexperience; opportunism and ideology are also involved. They want to claim that market problems are all the result of failure on the part of the Government, but that blinds them to the fact that sometimes we need Governments to step in to deal with the failure of markets, just as this Government did in the cases of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s party repeatedly opposed our doing so, despite the serious risks that might have resulted for the financial system and the economy.</p>

Is not the urgent priority to recapitalise the banks? That will not happen on its own. It will require some form of Government intervention. When is the appropriate time?

 As the Chancellor said yesterday, we are, and have been, looking at a wide range of options for support of the banking system, and we will continue to do so. We have rightly already taken action across the board with the special liquidity scheme, and are dealing with particular pressures that arise. When we think that further action is needed and further measures must be introduced, we will say so, but it is irresponsible for people to speculate on the pros and cons of particular measures. It is right that we should take measured judgments and do the right thing to support the markets, given the instability and turbulence that we have seen.</p>

 Certainly, when I was first appointed to the Treasury at the beginning of the year, I did not expect that the first parliamentary Act that I would take through the House would nationalise Northern Rock. I think that it was the right decision to take. It would have led to considerable financial instability if we had not taken it, and that would have jeopardised confidence right across the banking system. It was the right thing to do. Faced with the unprecedented events that we have seen right across the globe, Governments have had to be prepared to take unprecedented action. That is the right thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08100734000243">The debate is about the fiscal framework and I shall make a few points about that. Before 1997, there was no fiscal framework in place at all. Decisions were taken from Budget to Budget according to no clear and consistent approach. To the extent that principles were set to guide fiscal policy, they tended to change from one year to another. In 1992, the objective was a balanced Budget over the medium term. In 1993, the proposal was to move back towards balance over the medium term and borrow no more than net capital spend. In 1994, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) will remember, the position changed again and there was no reference to borrowing. Such change from one year to another provided fiscal instability that was bad for the markets, as well as for the approach to the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08100734000244">In 1997, we introduced a new fiscal framework and legislated for the code for fiscal stability, based on the five principles of transparency, stability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency. Within it we set two fiscal rules to cover borrowing for investment and the level of debt. The consequence of that framework is that between 1997 and 2007, borrowing peaked at just 3.3 per cent. and ran at an average of only 1 per cent. Compare that to the previous 10 years, when borrowing peaked at 7.8 per cent. of GDP and averaged 3.1 per cent., and the 10 years before that, when borrowing peaked at 5.1 per cent. and averaged 3.6 per cent. Over the previous two economic cycles, average borrowing was more than three times as high as it was over the last economic cycle.</p>

 So if the fiscal rules are so effective, can the right hon. Lady confirm that they are not about to be junked?</p>

 As I am due to say, we will set out the position on the fiscal framework at the pre-Budget report, as the my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has already said. It is worth recognising again the impact that the fiscal framework has had. The discipline imposed on the public finances by the framework has seen debt cut from 43.3 per cent. in 1996-97 to 36.6 per cent. in 2006-07. Debt in the UK is lower than in every country in the G7 bar Canada, so we are the second lowest in the G7 in terms of our public debt, and it is lower than the EU average as well. That is precisely why we can borrow more now, and why it is right to borrow more now in order to get our economy through the tougher times ahead.</p>

editorial pointed out yesterday, most independent commentators are predicting for the financial year beginning 2010 borrowing between &#163;90 billion and &#163;100 billion. Even the Institute for Fiscal Studies is quoting a figure of &#163;60 billion, which is twice the figure that the Treasury is still maintaining. Surely the collapse in corporate tax receipts, which is an inevitable outcome of problems in the financial services sector, should be factored in, or is there something that I do not understand.</p>

<p><a name="st_o154"><a name="08100734000248"><a name="81007-0006.htm_spnew15"><a name="08100734000539"><b>Yvette Cooper:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the economy has an impact on the public finances, so, for example, the reduction in receipts from stamp duty or from the financial sector will, of course, have an impact on tax revenues this year. We will set out the next forecast for borrowing and for the public finances at the pre-Budget report. As he knows, we do so twice a year as part of the Budget and as part of the pre-Budget report. That is the normal practice for reporting to the House and for ensuring that we have appropriate forecasting and fiscal stability in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08100734000249">It is worth recognising, too, that the fiscal framework has protected public investment. Under the previous Government public investment reached a low of just 0.3 per cent. of GDP in 1988. As many of us know from our constituencies, that left a legacy of decaying public services and infrastructure. I remember that on one of my first visits to a primary school in my constituency, staff showed me where they put the buckets to catch the leaks from the Victorian roof, and I remember talking to the residents of one of the council estates in Pontefract, where they showed me the metal windows that rattled and the tiles that had blown off the roof&#151;part of the &#163;19 billion backlog of repairs and maintenance to Britain&#146;s council houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08100734000250">The Conservative party did not fix the school roofs, the council house roofs or the hospital roofs. Under this Government, investment has grown by more than three times the 1997 level to 2.2 per cent. of GDP this year, and that sustained investment has allowed us to invest in the council homes, new hospitals, schools and transport infrastructure that we badly need. That is not just about mending the roof in the sunshine; it is about being still up there mending the roofs through rain, wind and stormy weather as well.</p>

 It is important that we should increase borrowing this year as a result of the need to support the economy in difficult times, and it is right to do that.

made clear, it is right to increase borrowing this year and next to respond to the economic shocks that we have faced. These are unparalleled in scope and scale because we have had the commodity price shock and the credit crunch at the same time. Who would have thought that the US Government would need to step in and end up backing half the mortgage assets in America through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That alone is the equivalent to the national income of France and Italy put together.</p>

 The Chief Secretary has just referred to debt and mentioned the figure for 2006-07 as being 36 per cent. In fact, on 30 September, the Office for National Statistics, which is now independent, issued its own assessment, and it says that the amount in question is a minimum of 43 per cent. and that if Northern Rock is included, which is about to be rerouted under new rules, at the end of 2007, it would be 46 per cent. Is not the right hon. Lady&#146;s estimate not out by something of the order of 10 per cent.?</p>

 As I have made clear, it is right that we should take unprecedented action to support the financial stability of the economy. We have done so with Northern Rock, and the ONS has made it clear that it is right to look at public sector borrowing and public sector debt, including Northern Rock, but also separately from Northern Rock. All sensible economic commentators have done exactly the same. The position of a temporary nationalised bank, which will be returned to the private sector with the assets that it has to back that lending, is clearly very different from the kind of current expenditure that we deal with in public services on a day-to-day basis. If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that that should be treated differently, again, he misunderstands the economic consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81007-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08100734000256">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge took some time to present to us what he said would be his alternative framework, and he claimed that it would be the most credible and responsible in the entire world. That is simply not true. The Opposition&#146;s proposals are far from clear. They have proposed an office for budget responsibility to apply a mandate. The trouble is that they have not been clear about what that mandate would be. It is not clear whether this is about a fixed end-of-forecast period or a rolling end-of-forecast period, and that makes a huge difference. It is not clear whether this means borrowing goes up or down or that debt goes up or down. The mandate that they have set out could mean any of those things. Either the office for budget responsibility will have an awful lot of power to decide what in practice fiscal policy should be, or it will be extremely confused. I suspect that the answer might be the latter, because it is hard to understand what Conservative Members are calling for. They have said that they want to share the proceeds of growth, but also that that means simply sticking to the Government&#146;s spending plans, which their leader has repeatedly called &#147;very tough&#148;. They say that they want to rein in borrowing&#151;they used the phrase repeatedly last week&#151;yet at the same time they say that they want to cut taxes and increase spending.</p>

of tens of billions of pounds, which would come in addition to the consequences of the current economic circumstances on the public finances. Only last week, the shadow Chancellor published a document that included tax cuts for millionaires&#146; estates, which would cost &#163;2 billion; ending the so-called couple penalty, which would cost &#163;3 billion; measures on stamp duty that would cost &#163;400 million; a council tax proposal, which would cost a further &#163;1 billion; high-speed rail links, which would cost &#163;1 billion a year; 4,000 extra health visitors; and 1,000 new academies.

That includes being able to increase borrowing this year, exactly because we have cut debt in the past 10 years as a result of the decisions that we have made. It is because we have one of the lowest levels of public sector debt in the G7 that we are able to increase borrowing this year, and that is the right thing to do to support the economy.</p>

Setting fiscal frameworks is very difficult, as experience all over the world teaches us. One can either have a very rigid structure such as the European Union&#146;s Maastricht rules, which are inflexible and pose all kinds of problems about how to enforce them, or a very loose structure that is more like the American model of politically driven fiscal policy, but with independent scrutiny. As I understand it, the Conservatives would like to move towards the American model. However, the problem with that system, as the Bush Administration have demonstrated, is that it can lead to extreme fiscal incontinence, with enormous deficits that make our Government look positively miserly.

I have said on many occasions that if I could claim intellectual property royalties on soundbites, I would be very rich as a result of the flows coming from the Conservative Benches.

The National Audit Office is the obvious body to carry out such independent scrutiny. It would perhaps need reinforcing with a few more technical staff, but it has the great advantage of independence and respect, and it connects Parliament with the process through the Public Accounts Committee. Surely, if we are to have a proper independent system of auditing fiscal policy while retaining democratic accountability, that is the way to do it.

the test has been met. It seems likely that the test has not been met, because independent bodies such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research have estimated that during the past five years the Government have been running a structural deficit of &#163;5 billion to &#163;10 billion. I think that that is what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge means when he talks about the roof not being mended. There has been a persistent and substantial&#151;we are talking about 0.5 per cent. of GDP, which is not mega&#151;structural deficit that has remained year after year without being corrected. Any system that does not acknowledge that failing, and that does not have a mechanism built in to acknowledge and correct it, is clearly not working well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08100734000276">The second rule, on sustainable investment, will be broken, and the Government are clearly gearing themselves up to tell us that it will be broken. It is worth breaking down the reasons, because the sustainable investment rule is being broken for a mixture of good and bad reasons. One of the bad reasons is the cumulative effect of all the structural deficits. The amount of &#163;5 billion to &#163;10 billion a year over five years adds up to a substantial sum, which all adds to Government debt. That is not acceptable policy, but there are other respects in which public debt is increasing for understandable reasons. We want good public investment that earns a decent social return and ultimately repays the taxpayer. The purpose of having a public investment rule is not to choke off sensible public investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08100734000277">The most important reason why the rule has been broken relates to asset acquisitions. Two banks have been nationalised&#151;Northern Rock and more recently the &#163;30 billion for Bradford &amp; Bingley. I am not sure how the &#163;200 billion liquidity facility is accounted for in the public rules, but perhaps we will have an explanation of that. Later this week, if all the rumours in the press are correct, we will have a rescue plan for the banks involving recapitalisation that could involve &#163;30 billion or &#163;50 billion&#151;who knows? On that point, the Conservatives would do well not to be too self-righteous because they&#151;and we&#151;have argued for that facility, which will add very substantially to Government public debt.</p>

Government aspire to. The matter will be extremely difficult, which is what worries me about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s rather dogmatic way of presenting it. It is all very well to use the phrase &#147;forward-looking&#148;, but none of us can predict the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08100734000280">I remember arguing strongly that over-borrowing and debt in the private sector would lead to the sort of recession that we are now in. I seem to remember that Conservatives, as well as Ministers, scoffed at that analysis. We cannot predict the future&#151;none of us can&#151;so a forward-looking measure of the Budget is open to an enormous amount of uncertainty and risk for any future Government, just as it is for the present one. The approach is sensible, but let us not be over-confident that the rule can be met. There will be an enormous increase in the budget deficit this year, partly because of structural factors and partly for the entirely justified reason of the workings of the stabilisers&#151;the fall in income tax, corporation tax and national insurance. That must be allowed to happen; indeed, it would be foolish to stop it happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08100734000281">The second element in forward-looking fiscal policy is the investment rule. Again, I am not sure how the Conservatives would deal with that. The Conservative spokesman is quite right that the investment rule is important for two reasons: first, because we have to protect future generations from over-borrowing; and, secondly, because the Government need to be careful about their borrowing due to the effect on bond markets and yields and the cost of capital in the long term, which is, of course, important. However, if the figure is not 40 per cent., what should it be? What are the criteria? The Chief Secretary has already said that if we take out the nationalisations, Britain&#146;s performance against the 40 per cent. rule is not bad, so what should we be arguing for?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08100734000282">My view&#151;this is just an ad hoc response&#151;is that a much more sensible solution than defining a figure would be to have complete transparency about what the public debt is, and then the markets can make up their mind about whether there is a sustainable level of debt. We do not need the Government or even an independent body to do that. If everything is out there&#151;if the private finance initiative debt and pension liabilities are declared&#151;the markets can form a judgment when the Government sell bonds about how sustainable the debt is. That is a more sensible way of going about things than being overly prescriptive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08100734000283">We have seen in the past day or so what happens if the Government are too cavalier about public debt.

When we see a developed country going bust, we see the end product of extreme carelessness with fiscal policy. That has to be the ultimate brake on what Governments do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="81007-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08100734000284">Just to recap, the motion is perfectly sensible, and I have no hesitation in supporting it.

I am afraid that that will prove a very serious problem, because people in their 40s and 50s cannot begin to hope for the standard of living in retirement that many pensioners currently enjoy.</p>

Spending was up, and much of it was financed through stealth taxes&#151;the definition of which is that they are concealed from individuals, who are not meant to notice them&#151;which have a distorting effect on the economy. The weakness that was building up was masked by an extraordinary world tailwind of prosperity caused by globalisation. The prosperity of the Asian tiger economies, followed by the so-called BRIC economies&#151;Brazil, Russia, India and China&#151;combined with the benefits of globalisation, led to the symptoms of our problems being masked, and we did not realise how bad the situation was becoming.</p>

That is a laudable intention, but it does not work, and it is distorted by two factors. First, private finance initiatives are not taken into account in expenditure, and expenditure is treated as coming from future revenue, not current capital. Secondly, public sector pensions are largely unfunded, and that huge liability is also regarded as a duty of future revenue streams.

My first principle is that this is no time for laissez-faire. My second principle is that initiatives must be on an international basis, so I welcome the international meetings taking place today. It is obvious that we cannot find our way out of this by ourselves, especially as the economy in this country is in a less good position to cope with the problems than those of many other countries. Therefore, we must have international co-operation.</p>

I was very much involved in the Lloyd&#146;s of London rescue&#151;I was one of the four members of the Lloyd&#146;s audit committee. What we did then was draw a line between bad and good assets, and I think that, somehow or other, the same needs to be done now. That is why I am so opposed to the Paulson plan in the United States. Henry Paulson proposed a $700 billion fund to buy toxic assets at more than their market value, thus pumping money into the banking system. I think that that is completely wrong, because it goes against the principle of moral hazard and also leads to the impression that there is a rescue fund of $700 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08100734000305">During the discussions on the Paulson plan, we heard many Congressmen say that they wanted some of the $700 billion for people in their constituencies. That is completely the wrong attitude. There is not a fund to be shared out; rather, there is pain to be shared. We must find ways of coming together and establishing how that pain can best be shared between those who can afford to share it and those who should bear it, because my next principle is that we must respect the importance of moral hazard&#151;those who have taken the risk must bear a proportionately higher share of the pain.</p>

 I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. There are some good elements in the economy. Is not one of our problems the fact that we have allowed the manufacturing sector to decline and now have a gigantic balance-of-trade deficit in manufactures and goods in general? We must rebuild that sector of the economy, rather than relying wholly on the financial sector, as we have for so long.</p>

The point was made most effectively at a CBI conference, when one of the delegates said &#147;People talk all the time about the service sector&#151;servicing what?&#148; Manufacturing is, at root, the dynamo of the economy, but, given globalisation, the distinction matters less. If there are jobs that have value added greater than the manufacturing sector, it is logical that manufacturing should stay in the lower-paid parts of the economy. I do not think many people would suggest that we should try to repatriate heavy shipbuilding from Korea and China. The hon. Gentleman has made a good point; an allied point relates to our independence and our ability to remain independent without being sucked too much into global markets.</p>

 I accept much of what the hon. Gentleman has said, but does he not agree that a strong comparison can be made with Germany, which has retained much of its manufacturing and a balance-of-trade surplus in manufactures, but whose economy is, in other respects, very similar to ours&#151;it is of a similar size, for instance? Would it not have been better to go some way in the German direction and retain some of our manufacturing base, rather than letting all&#151;or much&#151;of it disappear?</p>

 How do we retain our manufacturing base? Do we impose import duties to prevent the import of cheap products? We have been served exceptionally well by globalisation, and we have been served very well by the ability to import products from other countries that can manufacture them more cheaply than us. We have concentrated more on the financial sector than on manufacturing&#151;and I think that the Germans would be deeply envious of our financial sector, which has also served us exceptionally well. This is part of a much broader discussion. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but I do not go very far along the road with him. I reiterate, however, that there is much of good in the economy.</p>

The Government must use their influence to ensure that the remuneration of anyone working within banking and other sectors is proportionate to their duties. They must use their influence to ensure that banks and other financial institutions set their remuneration at levels that do not affront other people, because there is a lot of anger out there among people who see that bankers have got them into this mess and now bankers are being rescued.

The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) has departed, temporarily one hopes, but he will bear out the rigid adherence to the previous Government&#146;s spending plans&#151;which he, I think, confessed he would never have attempted to adhere to himself.

which many Labour Members found uncomfortable to wear. That bears some relevance to the history lesson that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge gave us, because this Government started with a rigid adherence to both of the rules that we are supposedly discussing this afternoon and to the tight controls on Government spending imposed by an election pledge. That was in place for a purpose, which I believe most Labour Members bought: we needed to make clear our intentions to a wider community than just the Labour party, and I think our approach worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08100734000318">If a further message were needed about that stern discipline, it was sent in the decision to set aside the one-off benefit from the sale of mobile telephony licences to pay off a proportion of the national debt, instead of using that money&#151;as undoubtedly the previous Government would have, given their approach to the disposal of national assets&#151;to fund ongoing expenditure. Although the decision that that extraordinarily large sum should not be used to fund any current expenditure or infrastructure investment but instead be set aside purely to reduce ongoing debt obligations was again greeted with concern by some Labour Members, the message was clearly understood, both in this House and outside: this Government were serious in their endeavour to maintain tight control over spending and over the uses they made of any proceeds of assets sale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08100734000319">That message was clearly understood by the markets at large. I do not want to be too partisan, and I shall address some of the unfortunate elements touched on in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, but it is fair to say that the approach was also intended to be a counterpoint to the virginal approach to fiscal discipline of the previous Government. I mean &#147;virginal&#148; in the sense that such discipline was wholly absent, not that it was guarded with some determination. The previous Government&#146;s approach led to record borrowing in the early 1990s, which, to be fair to him, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe sought to address over his chancellorship&#151;the Prime Minister continued the task in the early years of this Government.</p>

I cannot remember the details because they change so frequently, but quite what measurement of monetary expansion we were supposed to be following at any time appeared to vary according to the whim of the Chancellor, Prime Minister or Prime Minister&#146;s adviser. The firm intent in 1997 was to set some of this experience behind us and to demonstrate a purpose and a clarity that had been wholly absent from the past.</p>

I am retiring from this House at the next election, so I can probably be fairer than others sometimes might be. I had to pop out of the Chamber towards the end of the contribution of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), but I noted what he said about the structural deficit that emerged during that time, and I agree with him. I shall go on to explain why that happened, but the trend was clearly emerging during that period and was not addressed.

Friend the Chief Secretary set out the priorities of the Government during that time, and I too had classrooms held up by pit props, infant children having to use outside toilets and other horrors of public provision that are, thank goodness, behind us&#151;certainly in my constituency and, I imagine, virtually every other constituency. The imperative for change was evident, and I can well understand the pressure on the Government to deliver higher public spending, together with the public pledge that had been made to respond to relatively low levels of health service spending set against the European model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08100734000322">I stand to be corrected, but it is my opinion that the difficulty that occurred in that period was more due to over-optimistic projection of revenue than to poor controls on public spending. The Treasury Committee has noted on several occasions that revenues, and especially tax streams, tended to be overestimated consistently, without anyone analysing properly why. I do not have an immediate explanation, although oil revenues tended to show huge variances. People said that they could be explained by this or that happening out in the North sea. I shall not venture into that territory, as I am ignorant about it, but one area that deserves further scrutiny is income from corporation tax. I suspect that this country faced increased competition in corporate taxation over a long period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08100734000323">Both under the previous Conservative Government&#151;to some extent&#151;and certainly in the first years of the Labour Government, this country had significant advantages in the taxation of corporate bodies. We have not lost those advantages, but the balance has shifted over time and some of those subject to corporation taxation&#151;depending on the business model adopted&#151;suited other environments better. We have not studied carefully enough how that has happened and the effect that it has had on the underlying revenue streams on which we must rely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08100734000324">That underlying deficit was perhaps made more acceptable by its occurring during a period of above-trend economic growth, but it was not acceptable to say that because the economy was growing strongly&#151;as it certainly was at that time&#151;we would just live with the unexplained deficit. In one of the many good reports it produces every year, the Treasury Committee gives tables that show the steadily changing forecasts for each revenue year over a long period, and the consistent trend is that the figures deteriorate. The reality does not come anywhere near the projection: it is almost uniformly worse. That should have rung alarm bells. It did so in the Committee, but perhaps we did not set the alarm bells ringing loudly enough. It is certainly true that the Government received regular reminders of the emerging picture of poor performance against projections in public sector discipline.</p>

a desire to fool ourselves, rather than using what the fiscal rules provide, and I shall come back to the value of those rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08100734000326">The fiscal rules are more of a prompt for scrutiny of the underlying issues in the economy than anything else. I personally do not think a 0.5 per cent. variation in one of the rules makes any material difference in economic terms, and obsession with a precise 40 per cent. figure does not help us a great deal. However, the rules should prompt people to ask questions about what the trends are and in what direction we are travelling. I do not think that those questions were asked robustly enough during this period. The difficulty with this tweaking approach and of tying the rules to economic cycles is that one relies incredibly on data that are provided to us on economic performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08100734000327">The other consistent message I have seen throughout this period is that quite sharp changes in data are frequent&#151;for example, changes in the projection of what happened in terms of economic growth are not at all uncommon through this period. Those are often changes not merely of the odd 0.1 per cent. but of quite material amounts. That is true in other areas of data related to the targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="81007-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08100734000328">Let me turn to the picture presented by the Opposition, because I have possibly earned a few hits by being fairly candid about what I think some of the problems have been. I honestly cannot see the merit&#151;I confined my interventions to two rather narrow technical issues, because I was not going to question the politics&#151;of the &#147;wise men&#148; proposal as it has so far been set out by the Opposition. Without any idea of the mandate that those people will have, the approach is of little value. One of the other critical points is how the body will interface with the parliamentary systems of scrutiny and with the role of the Office for National Statistics, which, as I sought to remind the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, makes objective judgments about the placing of investments on or outside the balance sheet of our nation. There was little development of that idea from which one could hope to make a reasoned judgment about whether it would be a valuable initiative.</p>

If we will have to learn one thing from what has happened in the past six to nine months, it is that experts have their faults too. Forecasting the future is a pretty chancey activity and even understanding the present is pretty tough. I am an historian, and that is why I choose to look at the past. It is hard to see what those people would bring that well-informed and well-resourced support for a parliamentary system of scrutiny might not do better. I would encourage some thought in that direction.</p>

good and right, as we should have a robust debate about the statistics that we prepare. Arguably, as I have said, we have suffered relative poverty in that area, with some degree of complacency. We now need to resource that independent ONS better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81007-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08100734000331">I noted, and was worried by, the concerns expressed by the Bank of England about the quality of the data used for its decisions about setting interest rates. I think that my honourable colleague on the Treasury Committee, the hon. Member for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers), will also remember those concerns, and we should listen to them very closely. I do not question the professionalism of the ONS at all, but we need to make sure that judgments about economic policy are made on the basis of information that is as up to date, robust and well founded as we can make it.

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81007-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08100734000332">Another point is that I think that we probably need a mutually agreed target, although I am not sure that rules are appropriate.

I should prefer a system that tackles the point raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham. I do not know whether he is right honourable, although he is very honourable.

 The basic answer is that we need to act like grown-ups. Incidentally, the hon. Gentleman raises two points, to each of which I would give a different answer. I have a view about how trade deficits correct over time. We should debate in an adult way in this House an underlying budget deficit that lies relatively firmly under our control. I have no problem with the fact that there will be political disagreements about how we should tackle such a problem, but it is a subject that should at least be discussed properly so that we can attempt to agree our goal.

It was a nonsensical notion. There is absolutely no way in which the amount of money required could possibly be provided by the taxpayers of Europe. Some of the countries of Europe would be devastated by the idea that they should contribute to a bail-out for one country. That is why Germany took a position in relation to its own vital national interests. The same applies to Ireland.</p>

The real problem is a lack of prudence and discipline, but that has not been generated over a very short period. In fact, it is implicit in what went wrong in the arrangements developed under the Maastricht treaty, a matter that was raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham.</p>

Here, we are speaking of the United Kingdom, but we might also have regard to the eurozone and Europe as a whole. From the outset, it seemed to me that the stability and growth pact, rather like subsidiarity, was a con trick. It set out rules that were never going to work. When the European Union stability pact was proposed, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote a letter, dated 22 November 1996, to all Members of Parliament&#151;he obviously regarded the matter as important&#151;setting out in detail why it was such a good idea.</p>

countries are running their affairs. There are dangers in both the over-borrowing by the countries concerned and in the over-lending by the banks.

 I sympathise a great deal with the hon.

Is it not sensible to nationalise banks and to borrow and spend where necessary?</p>

 I should put it on the record that I am not a great advocate of nationalisation. At present there is a severe crisis, but I am somewhat concerned that in all the BBC commentaries the argument tends to gravitate to the high street, banking and city element, all of which requires a great deal of intensive discussion, but not enough attention is given to the question of the way in which individual countries are running their own affairs.

A short time after the original proposals for the stability and growth pact were issued&#151;the Chancellor of the Exchequer had written to all Members of Parliament to explain the matter because it was obviously important&#151;I wrote to all Conservative Members saying:</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way yet again. Is it not the madness of the eurozone that countries such as Italy cannot change their interest rates&#151;Trichet seems bent on keeping them too high&#151;and they cannot devalue, so the only flexibility that they have is with spending?

 The situation becomes more difficult, and that is what concerns me. The level of indebtedness is not just a question for the banks; this debate is about fiscal rules with respect to Britain and, by implication, the rest of Europe, because we are affected by what goes on out there. Because of the legal framework that has been created, that does not work. It is completely absurd that we are in the situation that we are in, and it has to be renegotiated. It is interesting that the member states in question, in an attempt to try to extract themselves from the impossibilities, have now gone off in a range of divergent ways precisely because they are completely different economies with different circumstances. The one-size-fits-all policy no more applies to the single currency than it does to the question of borrowing. It is completely absurd that we are in this situation.

I cannot believe that the amount of money that appears to be hidden in relation to our economic affairs and in relation to how our accounts are presented can possibly leave off-balance sheet vast sums of money which when added in would change the picture as substantially as I believe they would. It is utterly irresponsible for us to conduct our affairs in such an imprudent manner, and I would strongly recommend that we engage in a policy of sound money, balance the books and have sensible accounting principles.</p>

In my experience, the more Europe gets involved, as with the exchange rate mechanism and, as I have said, the stability and growth pact, and in relation to all these other matters where Europe will inevitably find itself, as it has always found itself, in suggesting more regulation and more of a European framework, the more the problems will multiply, so that when the reckoning comes there will be monumental implosion because it will have created a compression chamber with vast levels of debt that it cannot sustain because most of the manufacturing goes on in places such as China and not in our country or in Europe.</p>

 I want to return to the fiscal rules themselves. One of the basic lessons that I learned from business and helping to run a large public sector organisation was the need to ensure that there was a clear and honest framework with which to measure progress and success, and to which one could be held accountable while retaining flexibility in the means of delivering against it. What gave confidence to investors and regulators was not only that the framework and criteria were measurable and robust, but that the underlying assumptions were realistic, consistent and quantifiable and that the flexibility in delivery did not undermine the stability of the business or the ability to stick to the plans that had been drawn up. On that level, I have problems with the Government&#146;s fiscal rules, which, it seems to me, are the precise opposite of what I have described. There is a lack of flexibility over the layers of control and a series of rules the underlying basis of which allows for considerable discretion in determining how they are measured.</p>

If we cannot do anything about the amount of debt and are stuck with an accumulated mountain of debt&#151;which many commentators believe will exceed the 40 per cent. barrier with or without the effects of the financial crisis&#151;the only variable is the size of GDP. Here, too, we have seen considerable ambiguity: the revision of how the financial services sector was measured added &#163;20 billion to the size of the economy, but caused great surprise because it was less than had been originally hoped for. Such ambiguity was not helpful.</p>

We have seen that debt cannot today be measured by what goes on the balance sheet. We have had many references to the realms of accounting for private finance initiative liabilities and the valuations of the long-term service contract elements. However, it cannot any longer be in the interests of transparency to maintain significant amounts of liability off balance sheet and to allow significant ambiguity in valuation.</p>

I am aware that the economics and business definitions of &#147;investment&#148; can be slightly different, but even under the broader, economics definition, there is an expectation that money spent as an investment will generate some new or additional outcome or produce a result that will be used to give benefit in future.</p>

When looking at IT spend, for example, I have seen for myself that it is sometimes difficult to know whether software development should be characterised as investment or current spend. The only point that I would make on that is that under the regime imposed on local government, there is a much stricter and clearer definition of what is and is not capital.</p>

accounting rules will not allow that, the current criteria clearly do not deserve to be at the centre of fiscal policy. We have ended up in the worst of all worlds: we have a system of fiscal rules that now constrict flexibility in how the economy can be managed, but are themselves so full of holes that they provide less credible help in the management of the economy.</p>

It is time that the rules were abandoned and that a new framework that sets a more rigorous prospectus for the public finances&#151;with comprehensive definitions of measurement criteria that are less susceptible to political interference&#151;was introduced.</p>

 I am slightly surprised that this is an Opposition day debate, because I would not have thought that any sensible Opposition would want to create an opportunity to display their ignorance of basic economics in such a way. My right hon. Friend the Secretary to the Treasury&#151;I mean Chief Secretary; it is difficult to keep up with her meteoric rise, on which I congratulate her&#151;was right to attack the economic illiteracy that lies behind the Opposition&#146;s motion. I wondered whether the idea came from New Zealand&#146;s Fiscal Responsibility Act, in which they have been displaying considerable interest, but I concluded that it could not have done because that imposes duties on the Opposition in the shape of a requirement to say, if they propose an increase in expenditure, what they are going to cut or where the money is going to come from to sustain that increase. We could do with that in relation to our Opposition, who are proposing all sorts of things without telling us how they will be paid for or how they will be combined with the programme of cutting public spending and taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81007-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08100746000031">The motion represents an attempt to shackle the Government by imposing inflexible rules on their borrowing. The hon. Member for Henley (John Howell) criticised some of our golden rules for borrowing. I have sympathy with him on that, because I never thought that they were anything more than a public relations exercise to show how respectable and responsible we are; they were not a serious framework of rules to abide by. The strength of the golden rule was that it was subject to interpretation in terms of when the cycle began, when it ended, and whether the money was going to investment or to spending. That is how rules have to be&#151;politically flexible and subject to political interpretation. I went along with that because I did not regard it as a serious exercise but as just a PR exercise to show ourselves to be respectable and disinclined to borrow on a large scale.</p>

discredited. The world has moved on, but the Opposition have not. They have a responsibility for bringing themselves up to date on how economies function and whether there is an intellectual basis for the Friedmanite approach&#151;in my view, there certainly is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81007-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08100746000033">The second argument against rules is that they do not change&#151;they handcuff a Government when circumstances have changed. We are now in a situation where we need to borrow substantially in order to stimulate the economy. That is nothing but simple Keynesian economics. Borrowing must suit the circumstances of the time. In a recession or depression, it is necessary to borrow and to spend. We cannot therefore be shackled by the kind of rules that the Opposition, out of their intellectual ignorance of economics, want to impose on Government. I am sorry that they have been so slow to catch up with the current circumstances given that they announced at their conference that they want to co-operate and work with the Government. It is impossible to work together other than on the same intellectual basis. If the Opposition are going to insist on rules that are inflexible and cannot be operated in the present circumstances, there is little basis for co-operation. They have to bring themselves up to date and modify their thinking by looking at the actual state of the economy and what the solutions are.</p>

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s trenchant critique of the Opposition&#146;s analysis. However, is not part of the problem, and the reason we have got to this stage, the fact that the spectre of neo-liberalism has been haunting not only the Conservative Benches but the Labour Benches?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a point. It is certainly true that we have been too insistent on markets, which is worrying, but there is no possibility of maintaining that approach in the circumstances that we are now trying to deal with. We are grappling with an entirely unprecedented situation that is completely different from the one that has prevailed over the past 11 years. The good years are over. In that situation, neo-liberalism must be completely relegated because it is a shackle on how Governments approach a crisis. It has certainly been junked big style in America by the first socialist President, who is going round nationalising everything in a way that surprises me but probably surprises Republican supporters even more. However, that is a diversion. My point was that rules fixed for one set of circumstances cannot work in another, and circumstances have changed drastically.</p>

 I am reluctant to interfere with my hon. Friend&#146;s comprehensive demolition of this miasmic mess of a motion, but he mentioned PFI. Is it not rather nauseating and perverse of the Conservatives to draw attention to PFI, which was bequeathed to us as the result of a love affair between John Major and the private sector and which our first Chancellor picked out of his waste paper basket and made work in an odd sort of way, the cost of which we will grapple with over the next 25 or 30 years? How can they criticise that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="08100746000040"><a name="81007-0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="08100746000675"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for his criticism of PFI. I agree. PFI was a way of moving things off balance sheet so that Government borrowing figures were not affected. It was a more expensive way of doing things and, as he says, we will pay for the consequences over the next 20 years. Certain health authorities, in particular, have been shackled by it. In its favour, it got the hospitals and schools built and open, but more expensively than would have been the case had it been done through public borrowing at a lower rate of interest. That is an example of my point&#151;if we have rules, they get fiddled by private banks and institutions and by Governments. PFI is like the tax farms in the ancien r&#233;gime&#151;it results in selling off chunks of Government revenue, which is a dangerous thing to do. However, I will go no further down that road in case I excite my hon. Friend even more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81007-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08100746000041">The proposal on rules is worrying because, as I said, the only rule is that there are no rules. That point has something in common with Bank of England independence. We imposed a rule that it was to manage inflation only, which tied us to something like a one-club approach to golfing, and we are now in a different situation where we need the flexibility that the Fed has in the USA. It has a requirement to maximise employment. We should have that, too. I am glad that the Liberal Democrats have caught up with the proposal that I put to the Treasury Committee during last year&#146;s review of 10 years of the performance of Bank of England independence, which was that the rubric should be widened. They always get there in the end, and I hope that they read more of my ideas on my website. We should reduce interest rates to the American level, and the 2 per cent. rule&#151;the rubric&#151;is a shackle on the Government. We cannot have a recovery unless we get interest rates down to American levels. In Japan, a failure to reduce interest rates at the onset of depression in the early 1990s meant that it languished for a whole decade in recession. I shall not continue with that line of argument, but it is an indication of the danger of rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81007-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08100746000042">The present need is not only to reduce interest rates, but to borrow and spend to stimulate the economy. The rules in question would shackle us in that regard. The only economics on which I would base rules is Keynesian economics. If the Government do not borrow, the private sector and private individuals have to borrow more. Government borrowing is necessary now to stimulate the economy to return us to a pattern of growth. That is the only way forward, and it makes the Opposition&#146;s motion even more ridiculous.</p>

If the rules provide financial discipline, why, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have 19 out of 21 comparable industrial country Governments done more than the UK Government to improve their structural budget balances, and why have 16 of them done more to reduce their debt burdens? What sort of financial discipline is it that allows consistent borrowing in good years, leaving us nothing spare in the bad years?

Dates of economic cycles have been altered and public sector contracts have been pushed off balance sheet.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that sustainable fiscal rules include sustainable taxation? Is he surprised to learn that in the 11 and a half years between May 1979 and November 1990 when the now Lady Thatcher was Prime Minister, the proportion of GDP to taxation was five full percentage points above the level that the current Prime Minister achieved in his 10 years as Chancellor? Surely the current Prime Minister&#146;s actions were more sustainable than those of the Lady, whom the hon. Gentleman no doubt admires.</p>

 I am well aware that taxes initially increased under Lady Thatcher&#146;s Government. However, the Conservative Government at that time were reducing debt and borrowing at a faster rate than in the first 10 years of this Government. If the hon. Gentleman is making an argument for fiscal conservatism, I fully endorse it. However, the problem is that the Government increased taxes at a time when the economy was growing. Margaret Thatcher was able to get the public finances in a good position and then reduce taxes through the 1980s.</p>

 I am sure that the hon.

That was a direct shift of income from the poor to the rich.</p>

 At the time, that reduced direct taxes, because we had 98 per cent. tax on unearned income and a standard high-rate income tax of 80 per cent. It was vital to get incentives back into the British economy. It was only by returning incentives to this country that we saw the economic growth from which we have benefited ever since.</p>

Even the credibility of the Treasury&#146;s fiscal forecasts has been badly tarnished. For seven consecutive years, the Treasury has made over-optimistic Budget forecasts, underestimating the size of the Government&#146;s deficit and overestimating how quickly it would shrink, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire has pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08100746000070">A balanced Budget was always round the corner. In 2003, the Budget would be back in balance by 2005. In 2004, that date was 2007; in 2006, it was 2008; in 2007, it was 2009; and in 2008, it was 2011. I predict that in 2009 the date of the balanced Budget will be moved on again from 2011. However, at least then the Government will have the defence that there is an economic slow-down. The previous years were the good years. If the rules allowed the date to be moved in the good years, there is something flawed in the rules. As Robert Chote of the IFS has put it, given that record of forecasting, the Treasury has engaged in a</p>

As the Treasury Committee has consistently said, we must be forward looking, with a Government who concentrate on bringing down debt rather than evading their own rules. We will introduce an office of budget responsibility. It will assess independently the sustainability of the Government&#146;s finances. It will no longer allow a Chancellor to profess prudence on the one hand, but to borrow recklessly on the other. It will give Parliament the opportunity to hold the Government to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08100746000072">Our proposal has been criticised on the grounds that such an office would be a quango and would diminish the role of Parliament. That point was made by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire. He will know that, as a former member, I have a great deal of respect for the Treasury Committee. However, I see our proposal as a way of improving accountability. Let me give one example. In March 2006, I was a member of the Committee and wished to question the then Chancellor about the change in date of the economic cycle for the purposes of the golden rule&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recalls that occasion. I asked whether the golden rule would have been met but for the change in date. The then Chancellor consistently refused to answer.

we would not face the problem of conviction forecasting. It is not for us to determine how a Select Committee decides to take its evidence, but members of the office of budget responsibility would be able to give evidence to the Treasury Committee as part of an inquiry by that Committee. The Treasury Committee would potentially have an important role in appointments to that body, reviewing appointments and taking evidence from potential members.</p>

 Does my hon.

If evidence were given to the Treasury Committee, that would be a powerful reason for giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, too, and for subjecting such a body to cross-examination.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he has brought me on to a point that I was going to make. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) also touched on the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office. Our view is that the National Audit Office does not have the expertise on fiscal matters. It provides a sterling service in scrutinising Government expenditure, but it is not a specialist body, and we are talking about a specialist task. We therefore think that a separate body would be better placed to perform that task. Given that, my view is that the Treasury Committee is in a better position to do so.</p>

Then came the realisation that the complexity and technical details were there more to baffle and confuse than to assist. Finally, there came the recognition that the fiscal rules&#151;perhaps like the Prime Minister&#151;were not as worthy, prudent or reassuring as was once thought, and that they were in fact entirely ineffective in achieving their objective. They were there only for political show&#151;a PR gimmick, in the words of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby&#151;and when it came to substance, there was nothing there. We must do better, and we will.</p>

 I agree that we have had a good debate, and I thank the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) for his kind welcome to me on my fourth arrival at the Treasury. I echo his tribute to my predecessor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08100746000081">The fiscal rules are a key element of the framework introduced in 1997 for long-term macroeconomic stability, which has ushered in the longest period of success in the economy that we have ever seen in the UK. Before it was introduced, fiscal policy frequently amplified, rather than dampened, the fluctuations of the economic cycle, and fiscal policy decisions were made against vague and shifting objectives. We all vividly remember the consequences of that: 3 million unemployed, twice; 15 per cent. interest rates; and record levels of repossessions and bankruptcies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08100746000082">The framework introduced in 1997 therefore marked a genuinely radical change. The code for fiscal stability, underpinned by legislation, sets out the principles for fiscal management enunciated by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury earlier in the debate, along with new reporting requirements and the role of the National Audit Office in the independent audit of key assumptions behind the forecasts. It promotes openness, transparency and accountability, just as the framework for monetary policy did after the Bank of England Act 1998. It puts better information in the public domain, the lack of which was one of the reasons for some of the past severe policy mistakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08100746000083">Today&#146;s global economic challenges are certainly unprecedented, but the framework has made a big contribution to growth and stability in the UK economy over the economic cycle that began in 1997, with inflation and interest rates over the past 10 years averaging around half what they were in the previous two decades. The International Monetary Fund said recently that</p>
<a name="81007-0011.htm_brev6"><a name="08100746000654"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for over a decade, the United Kingdom has sustained low inflation and rapid economic growth&#151;an exceptional achievement...the fruit of strong policies and policy frameworks, which provide a strong foundation to weather global challenges&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08100746000084">The fiscal framework has served our economy well. Net debt is lower as a percentage of gross domestic product in the UK than in all the other G7 countries except Canada, and in the euro area. During the economic cycle that started in 1996-97, net borrowing has averaged 1 per cent., compared with more than 3 per cent. in the previous economic cycle under the Conservative Government. The framework has improved transparency and increased the regularity of fiscal reporting. Fiscal policy has supported monetary policy, helping to smooth the path of the economy, which represents a break from the pro-cyclical fiscal policy of the past; and the golden rule has played an important part in breaking the bias against capital investment that so damaged public services. My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) made that important point earlier. Public sector investment is over three times higher as a share of the economy than it was in 1997-98, having risen from 0.6 per cent. of GDP then to 2 per cent. this year.</p>

 Contrary to the views expressed by the Conservatives, what we have done for Northern Rock and, indeed, Bradford &amp; Bingley was absolutely the right thing to do. I do not think that it would be right to include the Northern Rock figure in the comparison for the sustainable investment rule, and that view is shared by the CBI, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others. We will talk about the position in regard to the Bradford &amp; Bingley figures in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08100746000087">It is absolutely right to focus on sustainable investment and prudent levels of debt, and we remain committed to that, and to the other fiscal policy objectives that we have pursued consistently since 1997.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the benefits of the rules. Discipline through the framework saw net debt cut over the economic cycle that began in 1997-98 from 43.2 per cent. of GDP at the end of 1996-97 to 36.5 per cent. in 2006-07. That gives us the flexibility to support the economy through the current economic shocks, in particular through the automatic stabilisers and the targeted support that we have introduced for the least well off; so borrowing can rise this year to support families and businesses, while maintaining soundness in the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08100746000090">We will not run risks with the public finances.

We are determined to help families and businesses, supporting in particular those who most need support. Our priority is to navigate Britain through these challenges in a way that secures fairness, and we will renew our focus on economic stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08100746000092">We are certainly a great deal better placed to weather these shocks than we were in the 1970s, the 1980s or the early 1990s. There are five reasons for that.</p>

 Yes, we certainly are. For example, we have had more people in work in the UK over the past few months than we have ever had before. The growth of GDP per head in the UK has been higher than that in any other G7 country. Those are changes that put the UK in a very strong position, compared with others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08100746000095">There are five reasons for this. First, Bank of England independence has given us interest rates and inflation well below the double-digit levels that we saw in earlier decades. Secondly, our labour market is the most flexible in Europe, with employment remaining high and more than half a million job vacancies. Wage pressures are subdued, thanks in no small part to our decisions on public sector pay. Thirdly, Britain remains one of the best places in which to do business and is a magnet for overseas investment. There was more foreign direct investment in this country last year than in any other country in the world except the United States. Fourthly, thanks to decisions made since 1997, public debt remains low by historical and international standards. This means that we can provide targeted support to those who need it most, and protect investment in our infrastructure. That investment was sacrificed in previous downturns, but it will in truth underpin our future growth, which is why we need to maintain it. Fifthly, we have taken the long-term decisions to boost competitiveness&#151;on energy, planning, transport, housing, science, skills and digital technology. However, there is no ground for complacency. Britain unquestionably faces great challenges. But we are facing them from a very strong foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81007-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08100746000096">Our immediate priority is financial stability. As my right hon.

We have taken Northern Rock and part of Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership&#151;overcoming opposition from the Conservative party&#151;thereby protecting depositors and making sure that such problems did not spread. We have introduced extraordinary amendments to the competition regime so that the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS could go ahead quickly. We have tackled directly the problems of liquidity in the banking system. The FSA has imposed a temporary ban on short selling to help to calm market volatility&#151;again, in the face of opposition from the Conservative party.</p>

We will work with other countries in tackling the twin global shocks, and will maintain our hard-won economic stability, supporting the economy and keeping inflation low. The principles and objectives set out in the framework remain right. We will ensure that the framework remains sufficiently flexible and robust to cope with the challenges that we face.</p>

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) introduced his party&#146;s proposals, which were interesting to hear. It struck me that he was generous in giving way during his speech until he reached the section on his party&#146;s proposals for a new framework. At that point, he wanted to rush to the end as quickly as possible and avoid answering questions. Clearly, some interesting ideas have been put forward, but there is a great deal of vagueness on the detail, such as on what the forecast period would be. Many detailed points were raised in interventions, but, sadly, as in many other areas of Conservative policy, the detail is missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81007-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08100746000101">The contribution of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) was characteristically thoughtful and helpful, not least in making some trenchant observations and criticisms of the Conservative party&#146;s policies. I enjoyed the contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) and for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), who is right to draw attention to the way in which we have maintained capital investment. Total schools capital investment has risen from less than &#163;700 million in 1997 to &#163;6.4 billion this year. The removal of the need for classroom roofs to be supported by pit props is among the benefits of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81007-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08100746000102">I was grateful to the hon. Member for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers) for his kind remarks. I agree with him about the decisions made in 1997, which he supported. Of course, I also support the other decisions that were made. In relation to the arrangements introduced in yesterday&#146;s legislation on dormant accounts, a long-term process is envisaged. I noticed that the House did not divide on those proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81007-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08100746000103">The hon. Gentleman raised the question of remuneration in the financial sector. The issue is about undesirable incentives towards excessive risk taking, which we have undoubtedly seen. That is why the FSA has said that it will take more account of financial institutions&#146; remuneration structures in its risk assessment of banks, and that is the right approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="81007-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08100746000104">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) queried some of the figures. Let me make the point that the Office for National Statistics figure to which he referred was general Government gross debt rather than public sector net debt, the figure to which I referred&#151;36.5 per cent. in 2006-07, rising to 36.8 per cent in 2007-08.</p>

By taking the right decisions, we can make sure that Britain continues the success of the past decade and meets the challenges of the next, building greater prosperity and fairness. The Monetary Policy Committee has been acknowledged in the debate as a cornerstone of the successful economic policy frameworks that have delivered sustained growth and, on average, lower inflation than in the euro area and the United States. We firmly support the 2 per cent. inflation target, and will support the Bank of England&#146;s Monetary Policy Committee in the decisions it takes to ensure that inflation comes back to target within the next couple of years.</p>

Friend the Chancellor set out yesterday, however, the Banking Bill&#151;introduced earlier today&#151;will enhance our ability to respond to difficulties in the financial sector by: strengthening early regulatory intervention and liquidity assistance; providing the authorities with permanent powers to deal with failing banks; strengthening depositor protection through the financial services compensation scheme; and putting in place a new statutory role for the Bank of England in preserving financial stability.</p>

 The approach simply cannot work in such tough times. That is why Conservative Front Benchers have got all the key judgments wrong in the past few weeks. They were wrong on Northern Rock, wrong on Bradford &amp; Bingley, and wrong on short selling. People are noticing their approach. As the <i> Financial Times</i> said this morning,</p>

None of us wants to see the unemployment rate rise. We all hope that the gloomier forecasts about unemployment prove to be over-pessimistic, but the truth is that things are getting worse, and not only in the financial services sector. Yesterday, we had 600 jobs lost at the automotive firm LSUK in Sheffield. One thousand people per day are currently joining the dole queue. Unemployment is up by more than 40 per cent. in some areas. Employment is falling; vacancies are down by 60,000, and youth unemployment stands at more than 1.25 million.</p>

If one uses the International Labour Organisation measure of unemployment, which, in opposition, the Prime Minister used to prefer, one is told that the jobless total has fallen by only 300,000 over 10 years of continuous economic growth. Almost 5 million people in Britain are claiming out-of-work benefits. The rate of economic inactivity&#151;one in five&#151;is pretty much unchanged from 1997. Some 5 million people in Britain do not have any formal qualification, and the employment rate for those lower-skilled workers has fallen under Labour.

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="81007-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08100776000015">The reality should not be buried in the small print. A perfect example is the Government&#146;s claim that long-term unemployment has been &#147;virtually eradicated&#148;. In fact, they have made it statistically impossible to be long-term unemployed. Young people who claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance for six months and over-25s who claim for more than 18 months are automatically referred to the new deal, and if they fail to find a job initially on the new deal, they are referred to a period of mandatory training. At that point, claimants are moved off JSA and on to a training allowance, and are removed from the Government&#146;s official claimant count. At any one time, about 40,000 people are hidden from the Government&#146;s official claimant count in that way. About one in three people leaving the new deal return straight to benefits, at which point they rejoin the claimant count, their previous claim is wiped clean and they appear to have only just become unemployed. Under the Government&#146;s current system, it is possible for people to be have been unemployed for more than two years, but for them to appear to have been on benefits for only two days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="81007-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08100776000016">Some of the other hidden statistics are equally worrying. According to official figures, 700,000 people who would like to work full-time are working part-time because they cannot find full-time work. Employment among British-born, British nationals is falling fast; 250,000 fewer UK nationals are in employment than two years ago. Until now, this Government have got away with their failure to address the underlying weakness in our labour market, but it is about time that they stopped denying that there is an unemployment problem in this country and started listening to those who are already struggling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81007-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08100776000017">We know that the consequences of those employment failures are not just limited to adults; child poverty is up for the second year in a row. The UK has a higher proportion of its children living in workless households than any other EU country. Almost 1.3 million young people aged 16 to 24 are not in work or full-time education&#151;that is a 19 per cent. increase on the 1997 figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81007-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08100776000018">How should we begin to tackle the problem? First, we must do everything possible to help those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. An important first step would be to accelerate the process of welfare reform&#151;to turn some of the things on which the Secretary of State and I have agreed into reality now, rather than in two years&#146; time or more. People think that talking about welfare reform at a time of rising unemployment is a contradiction in terms; how can one introduce big new changes to the welfare-to-work process when the number of jobs is falling? That is not the right view to take, because we know about the experience from the other side of the Atlantic. When I went to New York in January to look at welfare schemes, I asked people about coping during the recession of the early 2000s. I was told that the introduction of innovative employment programmes, which helped to match people and their skills with the opportunities that were available, helped to make a difference to the rise in the claimant count. The rise in the number of unemployed was less pronounced than it had been in previous recessions.</p>

on welfare reform in January, and the Secretary of State&#146;s subsequent decision to adopt both David Freud&#146;s proposals and ours, there should be cross-party consensus on what needs to be done&#151;so why the wait?

They will need tailored employment programmes that offer, among other things: job search facilities; specialised training to increase suitability for work; personalised career and recruitment advice; interview training with employers; and CV-writing techniques. The reforms that we have all discussed would lead to the creation of a world-leading back-to-work system, through centres all around the country delivering the necessary support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81007-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08100776000021">We have some of those skills in Britain already, but as the Government&#146;s amendment so clearly reveals, the programmes that are in place barely scratch the surface of the challenge we face. That is why we need to accept the accounting changes that allow the use of benefit savings to help pay for the programmes that get people back into work&#151;the so-called DEL-AME, or departmental expenditure limits-annually managed expenditure, switch. It is no good piloting that change sometime after 2010, because it is needed now. Without it, we cannot build the scale of programmes needed to meet the nature of the challenge we face. The biggest problem with the Government&#146;s Green Paper in the summer was that everything seemed to be timetabled for years down the track.

It would have been easy for the bank to pull the plug, but we were lucky and it did not. With a real team effort, the business pulled through, but many others in that position are not so lucky. Loans can be called in and businesses can collapse almost overnight. We need to take steps to protect good businesses that suffer a sudden problem of that kind.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an important point, and I hope that it will not be lost in party political jibes from the Labour Benches. At the moment, many companies that are well run have severe credit problems because of the banking crisis, in which the banks are not lending to each other, let alone to companies. In these circumstances, well-run companies may be short of credit and in a situation in which they and their creditors do not have time to come to some arrangement, as they would in normal conditions. We are in a crisis, and we require crisis thinking on a collaborative basis, so I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes his point well. In the next few weeks, we must all be careful not to use rhetoric against the financial services sector and the banks that ends up being counter-productive. The reality is that our banks play a crucial role in the fabric of our economy. The disappearance of credit facilities affects individuals and small businesses and could, as my hon. Friend rightly says, force otherwise good businesses into receivership. We wish the Government well in their efforts to ensure stability for our banking system. We also need protection in place for businesses that run into unexpected difficulties that, given time, they might be able to trade through.</p>

The first is to introduce an automatic stay of enforcement. That would prevent banks or other creditors from intervening immediately to enforce repayment of debt while the management stays in place and attempts to negotiate a restructuring. The second is to give a priority status for any financier willing to provide ongoing funding for the company post petition. Unlike in the UK, firms in chapter 11 in the US are able to raise finance even after they have petitioned for bankruptcy. Lenders will lend them money in exchange for &#147;super-priority&#148; over other unsecured creditors. In fact, there is a whole market for such rescue funding in the US. Introducing such a market in the UK could help to protect businesses and jobs.</p>

 The experience in the US suggests that such tax changes might not be necessary.

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does his homework, because he is quite bright. Does he not realise that most large US companies that go into chapter 11 dump their pension liabilities on the US equivalent of the Pension Protection Fund, and their employees suffer horrendously? That is how those companies get afloat again. For example, every major US airline has done that. What it means is that somebody somewhere suffers and pays for those companies to stay in business.

 Right now the priority in this country should be to protect jobs. We are not talking about an exact replication of the US system, but about taking the best from it and applying it here.

 My hon. Friend makes his point succinctly. There will come a time when all the events that have taken place in the financial markets in the past few weeks will of course need to be addressed, but right now our duty as a House of Commons and as a nation is to seek stability in our economy and to take the steps that we need to take to protect jobs, to protect businesses and to ensure that we can look after those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. The other big step that the Government need to take to protect business and jobs is on tax. It cannot help employment prospects in this country if some of our biggest firms are transferring their headquarters and domiciles to other countries so that they can take advantage of favourable tax regimes in places such as Ireland. That cannot help the employment prospects of people in this country either. That is why we continue to argue that we need to cut the main rate of corporation tax from 28p to 25p and to reverse the Government&#146;s planned increase in the small companies rate from 20p to 22p. The costs of such a reform can be met by dramatically reducing the complex structure of allowances that the Government have introduced for business. We need a simpler and more attractive tax regime in this country that makes it attractive to do business here, that protects jobs and that attracts employers to this country in the future.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely fair point. We feel strongly about that issue, and that is why we have argued for the reforms and why it remains our aspiration, when economic circumstances permit and when we are able to share the proceeds of growth, to bring down the tax burden on business and on individuals in this country so that we do not lose major corporations to other countries.

I shall try to address the points that the hon. Gentleman made and some of his rather eccentric use of facts. I shall then turn to his proposals and try to explain that all his main points are already Government policy.

Over the last two days, we have rightly discussed in this Chamber the financial situation and the global economy. All parties agree that there is no way that Britain could not be affected by the international situation. We could not stop the world, even if we wanted to get off. We need to maintain our open economy and to do everything we can to protect people through the current financial and economic situation and to prepare them for the upturn that will come thereafter.

The interesting thing was that there was a steady flow, as there always is, of people signing off benefits, because they have found work, and a flow of people coming in. People asked two questions: first, what is happening in the economy, and secondly, what are the Government doing?

jobseeker&#146;s allowance are now at 250,000 people compared with 200,000 earlier in the year. The steady flow of people in and out that I mentioned seeing in Kentish Town is reflected in the wider economy. At the same time as 250,000 people were flowing on to the allowance, 216,000 people flowed off in August. That is because we have a strong, flexible labour market that is one of the best in the G7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="81007-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08100776000057">The hon. Gentleman tried to make some points about that, but he could not detract from the fact that we have the second highest employment rate in the G7. He cannot detract from the fact that there are 600,000 vacancies in the economy or that 500,000 people start a new job every month. Every time someone loses their job it is a worry, and it is a tragedy if they cannot find the next one. We should all be focusing on exactly what we can do to ensure that people find their next job as fast as they can as well as protecting existing jobs.</p>

He said, for example, that it is not true that employment has been at a record level this year&#151;he quoted an example of that being said earlier this year. Over the past 11 years, the employment rate has been at 74.3 per cent., compared with 71.4 per cent. under the Conservative Government. There has been a significant rise in the employment rate in this country. It is the highest employment level that has ever been achieved in this country. We are coming from a high level and it is therefore wrong for him to say that the economy has not had a successful labour market over the past few years. It is wrong for him to say that 80 per cent. of those jobs have gone to migrants. That figure is simply wrong. The figure is 50 per cent. and 800,000 more UK-born people are in work than there were in 1997. It is wrong of him to say that the inactivity rate is at 20 per cent. That includes students, whose numbers have risen very significantly over the last 11 years, and I thought that that was something that those on the Conservative Front Bench supported. If the number of students is taken out, the inactivity rate has fallen significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="81007-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08100776000059">It is wrong to say that long-term unemployment has not fallen as, even under the ILO measure that the hon. Gentleman quoted, it has gone from 800,000 to 354,000. It has fallen by more than half, so the figures that he tried to quote were, I am afraid, wrong. In his motion, he states that 5 million people are inactive, but that figure includes carers, people who have been recently bereaved, and parents with children under five. Even he does not want to see them in work. Will he confirm that that 5 million figure includes all those people? Is he saying that all carers should go back into work, or that the 5 million figure is a completely inappropriate way of describing the inactivity rate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="81007-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08100776000069">The first lesson is that we should maintain the active approach to getting people back to work. We have looked at the lessons of our labour market history, and the worst possible thing that we could do at this moment is to relax the activity and obligations required in our back-to-work system. How do we know that? We know it because it is exactly what the Conservative Government did in the 1980s, when they took all conditionality off unemployment benefits. That meant that unemployment rose further than it need have done, to 3 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="81007-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08100776000070">We will not repeat that mistake, and we will maintain the conditionality in the system. Why will we do that? We will do it because conditionality means giving people support and requiring them to take it up.

 Jobcentre Plus is better than what is offered in America. I visited back-to-work centres in New York, and people queue for hours. Often, they are sent back at the end of the day.

 I should of course be very happy to meet my hon.

We are confident that the system is robust, not least because an increasing amount of work is being done by telephone and over the internet.

That is a very good record, but we want to go further. We want to strengthen the regime further, so we are making sure that people sign on for skills when they sign on for work. We will modernise our new deals and bring them into a single, flexible new deal, so that they can respond to personal needs. As I said earlier, there will be a period of 12 months&#146; intensive support with four weeks of mandatory activity, and we will fast-track people with greater needs on to the new deal. They will include people who have not been in education, employment or training when they turn 18, or those who are ex-offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81007-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08100776000086">The regime is world class. We have been planning for these economic contingencies, and we have been strengthening the system. The first lesson of the past 20 years in this country is that the activity of the system should not be relaxed. We need an active system, rather than the passive one that existed under the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08100776000087">The second thing that we will not do is to repeat the mistake of the previous Government of massaging the figures to pretend that the numbers are not changing. We will not shift people on to incapacity benefit and consign them to a life trapped on benefits without any kind of support, as a way of keeping the headline figures below what they really are. I can give the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell that commitment, and I hope that he will match it. We will not manipulate the figures in the way that he did. We will not move people on to inactive benefits when they should be on active benefits. In fact, we shall be doing exactly the opposite; we will make sure that people are moved on to active benefits precisely because that is the right thing for them and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08100776000088">The hon. Gentleman may want to listen to the third lesson of the changes, as for once I am about to agree with him. He is absolutely right: we should not take our foot off the pedal of welfare reform. When people may be finding it more difficult to look for work, they should get more help rather than less. He said that we should be accelerating reforms and bringing them in right now. If I may say so, that is a tiny bit churlish given that yesterday we said that we would be bringing in radical reforms to lone parent support, and given that we are abolishing incapacity benefit and bringing in the employment and support allowance this autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08100776000089">A programme of reform is already going on. It is significant and radical and the hon. Gentleman has praised it a number of times over the past few months. We welcome and accept his support, but he should recognise the changes that are going on. We are increasing the support we give lone parents but we are also asking them to do more in return. From this April, every lone parent who goes back into work has a &#163;40 in-work credit every week&#151;&#163;60 in London. They have more help in and out of work; there is a discretionary fund that can pay for a new uniform or for child care costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08100776000090">We have radically improved support for lone parents and in return we think it is right to ask them to look for work at a slightly earlier stage. At present, in Sweden, they have to look for work immediately when their parental leave finishes. In Denmark, the age is one, but in the UK it is 16. Clearly, the balance is not right in this country so we shall be reducing the age from 16 to 12, to 10 and then to seven. That is the right approach: giving people more support, but also expecting more of them in return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08100776000091">We are doing exactly the same thing with incapacity benefit. Under the Conservative Government, incapacity benefit tripled. Lone parent numbers tripled. The numbers went up from 700,000 to 2.6 million. There was no support for people at all. They were given no help with their health or to get back into work. We introduced pathways to work. We know that the process works and that it gets more people back into work and now we are making it available to everyone across the country. We are replacing IB with the ESA. We will re-test everybody on incapacity benefit to see whether they are on the right benefit and we will expect the vast majority of people on ESA to take up pathways to work and the support we offer. Again, there will be better support, which we know works, and we will be asking and   <br>

requiring people to take up that support because we know it will change their lives. It will get more people back to health and back into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08100776000092">It is wrong to say that we are not introducing radical welfare reform right now; we are doing exactly that. To pick up the point the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell made about the AME-DEL transfers&#151;the Ant and Dec of welfare reform policy&#151;we are moving ahead with them as fast as David Freud recommended. The fact that the hon. Gentleman thinks that should be done now shows his complete lack of understanding of how we contract with the private sector. David Freud, whom the hon. Gentleman often quotes, says that we are proceeding at exactly the right rate and that the strategy will be a revolution in the delivery of welfare. I would rather take advice from David Freud than from the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08100776000093">At the end of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks he spoke about the insolvency regime. I am sure the House listened with interest to what he said, but I am afraid I have to tell him that the reforms introduced in the Enterprise Act 2002 have modernised our system, and have meant that it is recognised across the world as one of the very best insolvency regimes. The hon. Gentleman mentioned three things. On automatic sale enforcement, administration already provides for a moratorium for all companies while restructuring is agreed. On priority funding, again administration already provides for priority status over other creditors. The same is true for his proposal on restricting creditor rights to veto restructuring. We have already modernised the regime and we are bringing in further changes next year, yet he tries to pretend that there is a solution to something that the Government have already achieved.</p>

 I am listening with interest to the Secretary of State on this point. I am quite sure that chapter 11 or its equivalent is not in place in the UK at present. Is he really saying that the Government&#146;s Act is the same as chapter 11?</p>

Instead of scoring partisan points and trying to make rather eccentric use of the figures, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell should be focusing on what is right for people. We are continuing to help people, as we have done, and in addition we are making sure that people have proper protection for their mortgages&#151;again improving something his Government left undone. We are making sure that the rapid reaction force is available to people around the country. Most of all we are learning those three lessons: not to fiddle the figures, not to consign people to inactive benefits and, still less, not to slacken the pace on welfare reform. I hope that that is the approach he will be taking.</p>

important issues so soon. When I was looking for an update on the latest figures, I found an estimate produced by the British Chambers of Commerce today that unemployment figures will rise by 350,000 by next year, which shows how important the issue is and how crucial it is that we do something as soon as possible to try to stem the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08100776000098">The recent rises in unemployment have been widespread across the economy in general, but in the main they can be attributed to people who have been unemployed for less than six months, men, those aged between 25 and 49 and those in the north and the midlands. Specific groups need support and help at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08100776000099">In a long-term crisis, we can use indicators to measure the severity of the situation. Looking at those indicators today, some of them are particularly worrying for the future. One of them is the increasing length of time that somebody is unemployed. As it becomes harder to find work, people are unemployed for longer. As we are at the beginning of the crisis, that is not happening yet. However, the number of vacancies relative to the number of filled jobs has been falling recently, especially in certain sectors such as construction, finance and business and other services. That is a worrying indication for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08100776000100">Another indicator relates to average earnings. When times are very tough, earnings grow more slowly as employees&#146; bargaining power is eroded as the job market changes. It is too early to see clear trends, but the latest figures&#151;for June&#151;show that average earnings growth, including bonuses, fell from 4 per cent. at the beginning of the year to 3.4 per cent., which, despite large rises in inflation over the same period, suggests that the bargaining power of employees is beginning to become more limited. That is a worrying sign for the long term.</p>

<p><a name="st_o273"><a name="08100776000101"><a name="81007-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08100776000221"><b>Mr. Davidson:</b>
 May I seek clarification as to whether the Liberal party agrees that in these circumstances we need a substantial increase in the national minimum wage? What is the figure that the Liberal party would like to see it raised to?</p>

 That could be a foolhardy move at this point in time. When a number of businesses are struggling, it could tip some of them over the edge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08100776000103">Another issue that I want to raise is the level of economic inactivity. When there is a long-term crisis in the economy, the long-term unemployed eventually stop searching for work and leave the job market altogether. Fortunately, we have not yet reached that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08100776000104">There are worrying signs, but this evening the Government are clearly taking pleasure in the fact that we are not experiencing anything that looks as severe as the situation at the beginning of the last recession in 1992-93, when the Tories were in power. However, I want to flag up a couple of concerns about the Government&#146;s record. The Government have wasted a great opportunity. In 1997, when they came in, there were extraordinarily favourable conditions for introducing radical welfare reform. There was sustained growth, and the Government put a huge amount of money into welfare reform, but the reforms have been patchy at best. There are persistently high incapacity benefit claimant counts and persistent levels of poverty.</p>

another; I know that the Secretary of State is aware of that, because he visited my constituency earlier this year. Does my hon. Friend agree that that illustrates the fact that the Government have patently failed to do anything to get those people back to work?</p>

<p><a name="st_o276"><a name="08100776000106"><a name="81007-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="08100776000224"><b>Jenny Willott:</b>
 I share my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns. There are areas in the Welsh valleys, very close to my constituency, where there are very high levels of worklessness, which is extremely damaging to entire communities. Despite huge efforts, the Government have not managed sufficiently to reduce persistent poverty levels in the UK. That is one of their failings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08100776000107">I want to flag up the issue of rising youth unemployment. Gordon Brown&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Sorry; the Prime Minister said in 1995, when he was shadow Chancellor, that no young person should spend years without a job, and he pledged that no young person would do so under Labour. However, the new deal for young people has not been as successful as the Government hoped. Youth unemployment is higher than in 1997, and it is rising. It is up 172,000 on its lowest point, which was reached back in 2001. Worklessness among the 18-to-24 age group is worsening for every single category, including those who have been unemployed for up to six months, those unemployed for between six and 12 months, those unemployed for more than 12 months and those unemployed for more than 24 months. It is very worrying for the future that so many young people are unemployed. The figures are significantly worse than they were when the new deal for young people was first rolled out. Worryingly, we are talking about an underlying trend; the recent economic turmoil cannot be blamed for the situation, as the figures were similar last year. That trend needs to be tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08100776000108">The new deal for lone parents, which the Secretary of State mentioned, has been more of a success, although the picture is mixed. Fewer parents with children over the age of 12 have volunteered to participate than was hoped, but it seems to have been reasonably successful; of those who participated whose youngest child was over the age of 12, about half left immediately to go into employment. I am somewhat confused about why the Government are moving lone parents from a programme that appears to be reasonably successful to a sanctions regime under jobseeker&#146;s allowance, given that research from the Department for Work and Pensions itself found that lone parents did not respond to sanctions by going into work. They often did not realise why they had been sanctioned, as they were not certain about how much benefit they should have been on in the first place. That is unsurprising, given the rate of error in the benefits and tax credits systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08100776000109">My main concern about the changes that the Government propose, and the impact on unemployment, relates to the economic climate, which we are all discussing. Introducing conditionality for claimants will mean that if they do not get work, they will face sanctions or have to go into workfare. That seems to be a wrong target, particularly with respect to those furthest from the job market&#151;those who are disabled, who have been out of work for a long time, who have very low skills levels, who are lone parents or who have additional caring responsibilities. The job market is becoming increasingly challenging for those who are out of work, and employers are increasingly calling the shots. They can afford to be  <br>

choosy, and those who are furthest from the job market are most likely really to struggle to get into work. It seems wrong to make them face sanctions. We should not punish those who cannot get into work. Instead, the Government should do more to work with employers, and to tackle the barriers faced by lone parents, those with disabilities and others. They should consider demand as well as supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81007-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08100776000110">I take issue with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell. Under Conservative Governments in the 1980s, there were more than 3 million people unemployed, a figure that we have not even come close to hitting in recent years. As was highlighted by the Secretary of State, when the figures were looking particularly bad for the previous Conservative Government, rather than tackling the issues, they moved people on to incapacity benefit to get them away from the unemployment figures. That created huge numbers of problems that the current Government are still trying to tackle. It created a hard core of people who have not worked for years, who are out of touch with the job market, and who do not have relevant job skills. It makes it even more difficult for people who are suffering from horrendous physical and mental health problems to enter the job market. The cost to the health service and the economy, and the cost in terms of family breakdown among those who are struggling, has far-reaching consequences for British society, so it is a little rich for Conservative Members to preach to the Government about the problems created by unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="08100776000111"><a name="81007-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="08100776000225"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 Does the hon. Lady agree that it is also a little rich for Conservative Front Benchers to criticise the Government for allegedly fiddling the unemployment figures, when, according to my recollection, the previous Conservative Government changed the measure 18 times? This Government have changed it once to bring it into line with international standards and, after that one change, kept it in line with international standards.</p>

 Governments are known for changing figures to best suit themselves. No Government are immune from that criticism. As the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell has said, this year, there is almost no point concerning welfare reform on which the Conservative party has disagreed with the Government. It agrees with the Government on the coercive approach that I have mentioned, and about which I have concerns. That approach is particularly worrying at a time of economic downturn. In fact, the Conservatives have been even harsher than the Government on those who face the greatest barriers to work. They have a three-strikes-and-out policy for those who refuse &#147;reasonable&#148; job offers.</p>

back-to-work support. We need to look much more closely at support that is tailored to individuals. We need to look at what works and replicate it. That would be better than getting rid of programmes such as the new deal for lone parents, which seems to have had some success, and replacing them with much more coercive programmes.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way a second time. Does she not agree that, rather than dealing with the conditionality element all the time, we should accept that many people, particularly the long-term unemployed, need support in gaining skills to get themselves into jobs? For the sake of employers who wish to employ those people, use must be made of benefits to support training while people are in work. If the Government had adopted a scheme with much more flexibility&#151;I know that they are now talking about that&#151;we might have got some of the long-term unemployed people who want to work back into work a lot sooner.</p>

 It is certainly true that the problems that many people faced in trying to find jobs in the past few years arose from skills gaps. In the buoyant job market over the past few years, it is people who did not have the skills who were unable to find work. One of the worrying trends now is that the problem is more likely to be not skills gaps, but the fact that jobs will not be available, however skilled people are. That suggests that there should be a change in emphasis over the next few years.</p>

 I would rather finish. When we are considering unemployment and how to support people back into work, it is clearly important for the Government to take into account the current economic climate and to make sure that, as was highlighted by the Secretary of State, they do not make the same mistakes as the previous Conservative Government and make the situation worse. They must not penalise those who are struggling to get work and are doing their best, but who are simply unable to find work because of the economic circumstances.</p>

The Conservatives left a wasteland that the present Government had to clear up and then build on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08100776000124">In my constituency, we had&#151;I went to see Margaret Thatcher about it when it was in danger, to no avail&#151;an electronics factory that manufactured multi-layer boards. That went under, and it is now a blood transfusion centre. That is one of the legacies of the Conservative party in the Gorton constituency of Manchester. It created a wasteland in which the Gorton constituency was No. 1 in Great Britain for long-term unemployment and No. 1 in England for youth unemployment. We are still above the national average, but the situation in my constituency has been transformed since the Labour Government came to office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08100776000125">How has the situation been transformed? One of the first things that the Government did when they came to office was to sign up to the social chapter, which the Conservative party said would be ruinous to the country. When we introduced the new deal, the Tory party voted against it in the House. We financed the start of the new deal by the windfall tax, and both the Tory party and the Liberal Democrats voted against the windfall tax when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister introduced it.</p>

Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) has said that it would be dangerous to increase the national minimum wage at this point. In fact, the national minimum wage is being increased at this point. When our Government, when they first came to office, decided to introduce the national minimum wage, the Conservative party, with its spokesman, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), said that introducing a minimum wage would increase unemployment. In fact, the national minimum wage, rising regularly and periodically as a result of the Government&#146;s decisions, has not only reduced unemployment, but given workers a self-respect that they did not have before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08100776000127">I had a constituent who, during the period of Conservative Government, came to tell me that his employer&#151;he was a security guard&#151;had increased his working hours from 64 hours to 72 hours alternating, reduced his hourly wage and, what is more, would not pay him overtime. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Employment in the Conservative Government asking  <br>

her what my constituent could do in those fraught circumstances. She very kindly wrote back to me and said that it was open to him to resign his job. He would, of course, have lost any redundancy benefits, if he had done so. That would not be possible now. Under the social chapter, that man could not be forced to work those hours, and his pay would be protected against the most rapacious employer under the national minimum wage. The present Government have not simply reduced unemployment and increased employment availability to the highest level that this country has ever known, but made it impossible for workers to be treated like serfs, as they were under the Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08100776000128">The projects continue. Even over the past month, two new projects have opened in my constituency, both as a result of Government policies. We have the new east Manchester construction centre, in which people, who include not only young people but men and women, are being trained in construction skills such as kitchen and bathroom fitting, plastering, carpentry and joining, and general construction operations. The centre is funded largely by the Government through the Northwest Development Agency, the new deal for communities and the learning and skills council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08100776000129">The head of Manchester college, which is involved in the project, made a speech at the opening, which I attended, in which he said that before 1997 the only money that his college was given for job creation projects was &#163;1 million to demolish a building. Now it has been given &#163;50 million for employment projects. Those employment projects are not simply reducing unemployment in the Gorton constituency, but giving people skills, so that they can get better jobs and not be ground down and obliged to take the only job available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08100776000130">A couple of weeks ago, I attended a graduation ceremony in Gorton monastery, about which I spoke the other day, of people about to be employed in the huge new Tesco that is to open in Gorton later this month. They had an eight-week training period&#151;130 people deliberately and specifically chosen by Tesco in co-operation with Jobcentre Plus, the learning and skills council and Sure Start. I do not know how the Tory party has the nerve to talk about child poverty when it opposed and jeered at Sure Start, which is one of the greatest of a series of projects in my constituency. The Tesco project is exactly what we want in this country today&#151;private enterprise joining with Government and public agencies, including the excellent Manchester city council, in order to provide people with jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08100776000131">When I attended an address at the graduation ceremony for Tesco, I was moved by the way in which people reacted to the opportunities that they have been given. A middle-aged woman said that she had her self-respect back again. That kind of thing is happening only because we have a Labour Government who are carrying out policies based on not some kind of blanket funding, but a one-to-one project. That is the merit of Jobcentre Plus, the new deal and the kind of projects that I have been talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08100776000132">Those are not the only projects that are proceeding. The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon.

That is the kind of thing that the Government are doing.</p>

In 1982, following the death of Jocelyn Cadbury, I fought the Birmingham, Northfield by-election. There was a 0.02 per cent. swing against the Conservative party, the smallest swing ever recorded, and I lost the seat by 289 votes. We were accused of cutting jobs at the Austin factory in Longbridge. Employment had gone down, I think I am right in saying, from 15,000 to 9,000, and we were told that we had cut those jobs. The choice was not between 15,000 and 9,000, but between 9,000 and none. Under this Government, the automotive industry in Britain has been decimated.</p>

Box. It is good to see a Kentish Member on the Treasury Bench. In a couple of years he will be on the Opposition Benches, or not here at all. As the Fisheries Minister he was courteous to our fishermen, and I am grateful to him for that. I know that in his present role he will be courteous to the unemployed, and I fear that before long there will be more unemployed than there are fish around the Kentish coastline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08100776000141">As the Minister knows, Thanet has suffered historically from the highest levels of unemployment and social deprivation in the south-east&#151;among the highest levels in the country. The reasons are not hard to find. Thanet has suffered from an enormous amount of immigration. During the 1980s, the immigration came from around the United Kingdom in what was known as the &#147;dole on sea&#148; syndrome: the unemployed came to the seaside to live on the dole in hotels and guest houses, and Thanet took more than its fair share. That contributed to its unemployed base. The Conservative Government of the time got to grips with that issue, but in 1997 the wave of immigration and asylum seekers began, and that pushed up the figures again. In common with Dover, also on the south coast, Thanet took more than its fair share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08100776000142">Throughout the 25-year period, Thanet has also been the dumping ground for cared-for children from London boroughs and, shamefully, from some of the home counties as well. Those young people have grown up. Very many of them have been damaged and found it extremely hard to find employment of any kind, so we are used to unemployment in Thanet. However, the county council and Thanet district council have made a Herculean effort to attract inward investment, to promote skills training and to enhance employment opportunities in general and in Thanet in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08100776000143">Thanet college is seeking to relocate to provide training in the skills that the sorts of businesses that we want to attract will require. Thanet council has promoted Thanet Earth, probably the most impressive glasshouse horticultural development in the whole of Europe. It is absolutely vast and its hydroponic techniques are staggering. It is highly environmentally sensitive and represents tomorrow&#146;s agriculture. It will employ huge numbers of people, and we want those people to be locally employed. However, the other thing that has impacted on us has been the importation of labour&#151;particularly from the new Europe, but also from aspirant countries on the fringe of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08100776000144">Yes, agriculture does need imported labour; on that we take issue with current Government policy because, as the Minister knows, agriculture in Kent relies heavily on casual student labour for the picking of fruit. Historically, the hop pickers from east London did the job, but now students come from all over Europe to pick our top fruit and soft fruit&#151;and we need them. However, we also need jobs for local people. The recovery in east Kent has been extremely fragile and what we are seeing now, in the current economic climate, is the shattering of that recovery. It is no good those on the Government Benches saying that we Conservatives are talking the economy down&#151;the economy is down. We are in recession. If the Government choose to be in denial, so be it, but we know that out there in the real economy businesses are closing, shops are closing and people are losing jobs.</p>

the Conservative Front Bench. I understand that there is a proposal to close the jobcentre in Whitstable, which is represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). I am concerned about that because the unemployed people involved&#151;there are 220 at the moment, and the figure is rising daily&#151;would have to come to the Herne Bay jobcentre in my constituency for the assistance that they need. On my estimate, were the closure to happen, there would be 500 extra journeys a month, which I do not consider to be environmentally friendly. It would also impact on staff and the services available to my constituents who use the Herne Bay centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08100776000146">I mention the issue not because I believe that the area jobcentre manager is not doing her job well; I am sure that she is&#151;she is trying to maximise her resources. I mention it because I do not believe that now, as we go into a recession with unemployment rising daily, is the moment when this or any other Government should close jobcentres. Those centres will be needed more and more for the foreseeable future. I understand from other colleagues that similar proposals are being made around the country. I mention this now because I believe that the Minister needs to address it immediately in his new role. The game has changed; the economy has changed. Plans that were being laid nine months ago are no longer relevant. We have to look at the situation again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08100776000147">Another issue that I wish to raise has a direct impact not on today&#146;s employment but on tomorrow&#146;s employment and the circumstances that we hope to face when, as we will, we come out of this recession&#151;empty property rates. My political colleague who represents the Conservative interest in South Thanet, Mrs. Laura Sandys, has blazed a trail in east Kent on this issue, working with the chambers of commerce. I freely concede that she was ahead of me, but she has been ahead of many Members on both sides of the House, in recognising the damage that is being done by Government legislation that imposes full business rates on empty properties after six months. House building has virtually come to a grinding halt, with all the jobs that have gone with that. The same applies to the building of industrial properties. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton talked about investment in new industrial premises and said that under a previous Government money was offered to pull those premises down. Premises are being pulled down as I speak so that the owners of those empty properties do not have to pay business rates. If we continue down this road, when we come out of recession we will not have the properties or premises that we need. That must be changed, and Ministers have the power to act under existing legislation at the stroke of a pen. This legislation was designed, or dreamed up, for circumstances that existed three years ago but do not exist today. We must change it today, because tomorrow will be too late&#151;it is already too late for buildings in the Medway towns that have already been demolished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="81007-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08100776000148">My final point concerns the impact that the current economic climate is having on the elderly. When we think about unemployment, we tend to think of young people; indeed, there are far too many unemployed young people. However, today I took a call from an elderly, dignified lady whose husband is too frightened to retire, although he is well over retirement age. After a long and successful working life, that man, fearing for his savings, his bank balance, his pension funds and his modest investments, is stacking tins in a supermarket at  <br>

 The Conservatives are not brave about many things, but they are certainly brave in tabling today&#146;s motion on unemployment in the United Kingdom. They are surely the experts on unemployment, for they gave unemployment to every region, every community and every sector. In Edinburgh, South, their political heartlessness combined with their economic incompetence to leave a legacy of more than 2,000 people on the dole in 1997. That is the golden legacy that they hark back to. Now, in the seat of Edinburgh, South, within large boundaries, unemployment stands at 667&#151;it has fallen by more than two thirds. That means that 1,372 fewer people are now worried about applying for jobs, seeking employment and where they will get the money that they need for themselves and their children.</p>

Of course, none of this happened by chance&#151;it happened by choice when the Government chose to levy &#163;5 billion as a windfall tax on the excessive profits of the utilities to fund the new deal. Instead of 3 million languishing on the dole, unemployment recently fell to its lowest level since 1975. Our choice was to bring long-term unemployment to its lowest for 30 years. The Tory choice would have been no windfall tax, no new deal and not even a minimum wage to stop exploitative employers. But then, as the shadow Chancellor made clear on 17 September,</p>

Unemployment nationally is rising by something like 1,000 a day, and many of those folks are my constituents. Indeed, unemployment in Clacton could be increased by 50 in the next few weeks, by the Government&#146;s decision to close the Revenue and Customs office. The raw data on unemployment hide other facts that should concern us. Almost one in five people of working age are classed as economically inactive. Despite all the Government&#146;s boastful claims, the rate of economic activity today is virtually unchanged from what it was a decade ago.</p>

Some 2.6 million people are claiming incapacity benefit, which is three times more than the number on jobseeker&#146;s allowance. I fear that incapacity benefit could end up being used as a way of trying to force unemployed people off jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;indeed, some say that that is already the case&#151;which could make it much tougher for those who genuinely need incapacity benefit to receive it. If incapacity benefit becomes a substitute system of jobseeker&#146;s allowance, that will not help anyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08100817000005">Finally, some eight out of 10 jobs created have gone to immigrant workers. I have always strongly disapproved of the phrase &#147;British jobs for British workers&#148;. It is a phrase that the Prime Minister used, which was extremely ill judged. The phrase had some unsavoury tones of economic nationalism and, as a free-market liberal, I found it offensive. The phrase is one that I would have expected to hear in the 1930s, not in Britain today. However, the new jobs created have disproportionately tended to go to people who were not born in the UK. I suspect that that is a fairly damning verdict on the Government&#146;s education policy. They have simply failed to ensure that we have an education system that delivers the level of skills needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08100817000006">The Government have had a decade of extraordinary growth. The sun has shone. However, they have failed to reform welfare to help people into work. They have failed to listen even to voices on their side, such as that of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), and to implement some of the proposals that he has made over the years. The Government have failed to produce an education system capable of providing people with the necessary skills to take the jobs that are available. With the Government having failed while the sun was shining, to coin a phrase, we now face a serious problem of unemployment, as the economy goes from boom into bust.</p>

Their indignant outrage is matched only by their references to the past&#151;to history. That shows that after a decade of being in government, Labour Members are out of touch. The rising tide of unemployment that we now face has increased and will increase on their watch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08100817000010">I want to talk about my personal experiences of unemployment from when the Conservative party was in power. I am a 55-year-old&#151;I know that I look a lot younger&#151;and I had friends who left school in the late &#146;60s and early &#146;70s. I had not one friend who left school who did not have a job. People left at 15 and went into labouring. Others left at 16 and went into apprenticeships. People such as myself left at 17 or 18 and went into further education. I remember this as a rite of passage. We left school and were part of society. We felt that we had status and standing, and we received a pay packet or a loan. There was something very special about it. It was our contribution to society, and it was about saying that we had a role in society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08100817000011">In fairness to the Conservatives, every Government, Tory or Labour, since the late &#146;20s and early &#146;30s have been committed to full employment. As Harold Wilson once said, the Labour party is a campaign against poverty, or it is nothing. Tory MPs from Macmillan through to Ted Heath were committed to full employment, but that changed under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. It is naive for the Conservatives to pretend that they have changed, because many of them are still part of the No Turning Back group. They still believe in the basic Thatcherite philosophies that we had to suffer in the working class communities in the late &#146;70s and early &#146;80s. We had a Thatcherite Government who were prepared to indulge in a financial experiment that had an impact on individuals, their families and their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08100817000012">Unemployment in parts of my constituency rose to 26 per cent. all the way through that time. I have seen the lump in operation&#151;it was something that my granddad had told me about. For those who do not know, when the Tories were in power, men&#151;there could be up to 25 of them&#151;had to assemble at a pre-determined place and a builder would come along and pick five of them. He would take them away to a building site for a day, without any training, health and safety or access to a trade union. At the end of the 12-hour day, he would put &#163;10 in their hands. This is what happened. Those unemployed men then had to go through exactly the same process the following day. It was demeaning and humiliating, and it was meant to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08100817000013">The film &#147;The Full Monty&#148; brilliantly characterised what was happening in working class communities at the time. The leading character, played by Robert Carlyle, was a man who had to steal lead so that he could take his child to the football on a Saturday. Then there was the manager who left his house every single day at the same time, dressed for work and carrying his briefcase, because he was too ashamed to tell his wife that he had been made redundant. A third character was a man who could not perform in the bedroom because the Tories were not allowing him to perform in the workplace. His dignity and his status had been taken away from him. The fourth senior character in the film was a man who tried to kill himself, because that was the logic of Thatcher&#146;s view that &#147;there is no alternative&#148;. He took that logic to its natural conclusion. If that was what life was like on the dole, with no status, no standing and no ability to provide for his family, he did not want anything to do with it.</p>

Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) talked about some of the economic difficulties being felt in his constituency. However, that is the reality. If we talk to any of the major recruitment agencies&#151;perhaps some Government Members will have the opportunity to do so in the next 18 months&#151;they will tell us that there is a freezing-up of recruitment in certain important sectors in our economy. This is not just a banking and financial crisis. The real economy is starting to slow down, and a real economic chill is starting to set in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08100817000025">I want to focus on an issue that has been mentioned in passing by several hon. Members&#151;youth unemployment, in which I take a close interest. Ministers have claimed repeatedly at different times in recent years that long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated or wiped out. Unfortunately, the statistics simply do not back that up. Those who do not believe the statistics should go down to any town centre in the middle of a working day. In most constituencies, they will see large numbers of young people doing nothing with their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81007-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08100817000026">My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) hit the nail on the head when he said that although we had experienced 10 years of good times&#151;or relatively good times&#151;involving sustained economic growth, the operation of a flexible labour market and the falling of the headline unemployment rate, during those good times there had been no success in tackling the hard core of youth unemployment. In fact, it has become worse. That represents a major stain on the reputation of the Government who were elected in 1997. I seem to remember from their election campaign that one of their five key pledges was to bring down youth unemployment, but what has actually happened is that youth unemployment has increased.</p>

At a time of sustained economic growth with, as near as dammit, full employment in many parts of the country, when the cohort of 16 to 24-year-olds is shrinking slightly as a proportion of the overall population, why should there be a 70,000 increase in the number of people of that age who are not in education, employment or training? My constituency is in Wales, and in Wales the position is even worse. Nearly 20 per cent. of 19 to 24-year-olds are doing nothing constructive with their lives. Research commissioned by the Prince&#146;s Trust suggests that youth unemployment is costing the country &#163;3.6 billion a year.</p>

I for one do not consider it a negative development that people have come into our country with skills, drive and entrepreneurial initiative&#151;it is a good thing that they have come into this country&#151;but it has let the Government off the hook. They have not seriously had to tackle the long-term problem of youth unemployment.. The fact that 1.2 million young people are not in work has not caused severe economic problems, because the gaps in the labour market have been filled by migrant workers.</p>

During my discussions with them, they have made clear that they are simply not in a position to address the multiple and complex needs of many newly unemployed young people who do not have the basic life skills and basic literacy to perform even very basic jobs in the modern labour market.</p>

I participated in CV-writing workshops, and in all sorts of other activities. That is an example of a third sector organisation that is trying hard to rescue a lost generation of young people and give them back some self-esteem and direction in their lives, or at least to return them to the lowest rungs of the ladder, which will hopefully lead to sustained employment in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08100817000043">The story of the last 10 years is rather different. Unemployment&#151;both headline and real&#151;is down considerably. Employment levels are up by some 7 per cent. One of the highest increases in Wales is in my constituency, where we have seen a 29 per cent. increase in employment levels. That is the real story of Wales today under this Labour Government, compared with Wales in the &#146;80s and &#146;90s under the Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08100817000044">That did not happen by chance. The new deal for the unemployed was a policy, paid for, as has been said, by a windfall tax on the utilities. I am rather fond of windfall taxes, and I have tried to encourage the Chancellor of the Exchequer to go down that road again to help to tackle some of the root causes of hard-core unemployment that the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire discussed. This Government invested in helping the unemployed back to work through that scheme and others. Labour Members rightly believed that unemployment was not a price worth paying&#151;it was a problem worth sorting. During the past 10 years, we have done our best to sort that problem out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08100817000045">Labour also introduced the minimum wage, and, again, that did not happen by accident. The policy was opposed by the Opposition. I hear today that the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott), who speaks from the Front Bench, is not happy that we are raising the level of the minimum wage; I am not sure whether that is Liberal policy. I recall that when the minimum wage was introduced in my constituency, the wages of hundreds of families doubled from &#163;1.80 an hour to &#163;3.60 an hour, giving dignity to families young and old.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08100817000046">By August, unemployment in my constituency had fallen to 4.2 per cent.; it had reduced by 53 per cent. Too many people remain unemployed, but Ynys M&#244;n is not now top of the Welsh league of unemployment; it is halfway down that table, and the levels are well below those of the 1980s. There are black spots of unemployment in my constituency, which is why I intervened on the Secretary of State about the proposal by the Department for Work and Pensions to close a job centre in one of those black spots. It is located in a rural area where it is difficult for people to get to other job centres, as they will be required to do. I understand the back-up provided by the internet and various other things at the contact centre, but that contact centre will be moved. I am glad that he has agreed to meet me, because it is the wrong time to close job centres when unemployment is undisputedly rising. I hope that the closure of the centre at Amlwch in my constituency will not go ahead and that people will be able to get the face-to-face contact that they deserve.</p>

All energy intensive users across the UK, from paper mills to brick and cement works and aluminium smelters, face similar problems. I declare an interest, because I chair the all-party group on the aluminium industry. Electricity prices are too high in the UK, they make British manufacturing less competitive and they could lead to big job losses. According to <i> The Times</i><i> </i>yesterday, the price of electricity in the UK is four times higher than in France.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has just come into the Chamber and has not listened to both sides of the debate or even to the debate about the financial situation. One of the reasons why electricity costs four times more in the UK than in France, and costs more than in Germany, is the lack of capacity. That lack is exacerbated by the fact that we have not built enough nuclear power stations over the past 20 years. Some 80 per cent. of France&#146;s electricity comes from secure sources of electricity&#151;nuclear power&#151;and France is able to keep its price low.</p>

Indeed, I have campaigned for new nuclear build in my constituency, but I have been very disappointed by the Conservative party. It is dithering on nuclear power stations, trying to use the policy as a last resort, when we all know that it takes a decade for them to go through the planning system and be built. I am prepared to take an intervention from a Tory Front Bencher on that point&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] Well, I would &#147;Get with it&#148; if I knew what the Conservative policy was.

 The hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) echoed a remark by the hon.

The Thatcher Government created invalidity benefit and saw a huge surge in the number of claimants. The number has floated up slightly over the last 11 years, but the huge growth occurred much earlier.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has been in and out of the debate, unlike the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) who has just come in. That point has been addressed by many Labour Members, because the Thatcher Government not only massaged the figures, but they did so 18 times to mask unemployment levels. They put people on to long-term sickness benefit, contributing to long-term unemployment in many areas.</p>

I hope that the Government will take that on board. I welcome the fact that the Chancellor decided against the duty increase this autumn, because that will help the road hauliers, but more has to be done to help intensive fuel users such as fast ferry companies. They transport people and goods to help the economy to keep moving at full speed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08100817000055">I have raised challenging issues for my constituency and they need to be addressed. The Government are not running away from their obligations, but it is right for Labour Members to remind people of recent history. The hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) is not in his place at the moment, but I know that the Conservatives would like to forget recent history and their record on employment and unemployment. We need to secure existing jobs and provide opportunities and hope for the long-term unemployed. That is why it is worth investing in skills for our young people and in re-skilling older people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08100817000056">We must help those who are still on long-term unemployment or sickness benefit to get back to work.

They are also right to invest in people and communities. Getting people off unemployment benefit is a price worth paying. The immediate prospect of global and financial turmoil will be challenging, but we must remain focused on the need to modify and reform the welfare state by giving support and hope to our people, instead of returning to the bad old days of mass unemployment in the 1980s, which still scar my constituency and many others across the UK. We must move forward, not back to those days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08100817000059">I thought that the debate was generally most interesting and that it tried to be constructive where possible. The most important issue to come out of the debate was the fact that the shadow Secretary of State pledged the Conservative party to a chapter 11 proposal, but I do not think that the Secretary of State understood the situation. Chapter 11 gives companies the time to reconstruct, to go to court, to get the whole thing on a level playing field, to get their business in order and to continue to trade. That does not happen in this country when companies go into administration. As my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) said, the banks come along and close the company down, and there is no method to save that company. That, of course, leads to increased unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08100817000060">I thought that those on the Government Front Bench were very complacent about the situation. We clearly have a boom-and-bust situation. I know that the Prime Minister kept saying that that would never happen, but if we are not careful, we will have the worst bust for more than 100 years. Unless a Government recognise a problem, they will never put it right. Now I have said that, I hope that I can be more constructive in my comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08100817000061">I have heard time and again how the wicked Tories left the country in a terrible mess last century, in 1997, how everything was evil and how it was terrible for people, so I thought that I had better look up the unemployment figures for Wellingborough in August 1997. Unemployment then was at 1,678. That must have been terrible, because we have heard time and again that it was the pits and that the whole world was going down at that time. Unfortunately, unemployment in Wellingborough today is at 1,710, an increase since 1997. Instead of there being a wonderful economic miracle up until now, the economy in Wellingborough has gone backwards. If it has gone backwards when there have been good times, what on earth will happen during the bad times that are just around the corner?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08100817000062">Let me make a point on a serious note, which I hope will worry the whole House. We have in Wellingborough a good multicultural society. We have people from all races in the town and we have had for a long time. I run a &#147;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&#148; survey, which tracks people&#146;s concerns. Until a few months ago, immigration never appeared in that survey as a problem. It is now coming out as the first or second issue. I could not understand how that could have changed, but it is actually to do with unemployment. If we look behind the headline subject of immigration as the No. 1 issue, unemployment is the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08100817000063">Let me give an example. A new supermarket opened in the town and needed to take people on. Let us imagine that we were the manager of that store. A Polish worker might come along, smartly dressed, and say, &#147;I used to work in a store in Poland. Please give me as much overtime as possible. I don&#146;t mind working nights; please give me as much work as possible.&#148; On the other hand, someone from the jobcentre might first ask, &#147;How much holiday will I have?&#148; and say, &#147;I can&#146;t possibly work weekends.&#148; It would not be unreasonable as store manager to give the job to the Polish worker. The problem is that the person from the jobcentre, who is British, would get offended. It takes only a few evil people from the British National party to come along and exploit that situation.</p>

So we have gone from being a town that did not have a problem to being one that does. I am sure that that problem is being repeated across the country. I do not know the solution, but it is a real problem. Unemployment is going up, while migrant workers are coming in, and the BNP says that they are stealing British jobs.

We clearly face a problem with the hard-core unemployed, and I very much regret that we missed an excellent opportunity when the economy was booming to move many of those people into employment. We should have allowed the market to pull them into jobs, but instead we acquiesced in a policy of unlimited immigration.</p>

As he said, an employer might have to choose between a person from eastern Europe who is highly skilled, motivated and educated and someone who has not worked for 10 years, who has a problem with drink or drugs or who has difficulties with attendance. Who will that employer select? The answer is a no-brainer. In my constituency, vacancies were not made available to people who would have benefited very much&#151;given the right supervision and support&#151;from those opportunities.</p>

with the hard-to-place individuals to whom I have referred. If we are going to get them into the habit of work and attendance, so that they experience the pride that comes from making a contribution, we will have to create an agency similar to the old community programme. Perhaps it could be called the new community programme, but we need something that will allow the voluntary sector or local government to offer such people employment opportunities. In the present competitive environment, it would be unfair to expect the private sector to carry people who undoubtedly will be less productive than other workers in the same circumstances. Something needs to be done in that regard. Although much is already being done, it is not sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08100817000071">The second issue that we need to address is how the benefits system interacts with getting people into work. People are not always convinced that they will be better off in employment. I believe in incentives in those circumstances. It is not clear to me or to people in my constituency that they are genuinely always better off in work. The complexity of the benefits system cannot be explained to people who have some difficulty with literacy or numeracy; indeed, it cannot be explained to many people who have no difficulty with literacy or numeracy. It is unclear whether people will be better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81007-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08100817000072">There is a loss of benefits for many people who get employment. They lose council tax and rent benefits, and they lose in a number of other ways. That interaction means either that people are being invited to go into employment for almost nothing or that, as shown by the evidence given to me by local citizens advice and information centres, they are actually worse off. In those circumstances, it is entirely comprehensible and rational on economic grounds that people do not seek employment. That is why we need to decomplexify, if such a word exists&#151;</p>

We have to recognise that the national minimum wage at its current level does not provide sufficient incentive in all circumstances, when taking into account all the benefits that people will lose. We need to address that question, and I am very disappointed that the new Liberal party policy seems to be opposed to any increase in the national minimum wage.</p>

 Our debate this evening takes place against the backdrop of increasingly serious economic difficulty. Over the past few weeks, we have seen great turmoil in financial markets, and Members on both sides of the House share concern that it risks turning into turmoil in labour markets. Unemployment is a scourge. We have to work together across the House to confront enormous economic difficulties, which none of us can wholly understand, to try to do our best to ensure that they do not turn into the unemployment and human misery that the debate is all about.</p>

It is not a proud boast that after 10 or more years of economic prosperity, unemployment stands at &#147;only&#148; 1.7 million. Let us compare that with the situation in many of the years that speakers have mentioned tonight; it is triple what was seen as an absolutely unacceptable level of unemployment in the 1970s. The starting point is not a happy one, which means that what will follow may be extremely serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08100817000082">The climate for future employment is not healthy, and one reason why is that after the 10 years to which I have referred, our economy and fiscal position should be in a much better position to cope. We should now have lower taxation. Instead of Government borrowing, we should have a surplus. We should have higher savings and a massive pensions pot. Sadly, we have none of those things, and in my view, unemployment is relatively high. We have higher taxes, more regulation and the worst budget deficit in the developed world. We have squandered a decade of growth, and that will make the pain far greater when we have to face what is around the corner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08100817000083">We have had a lively debate. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) began the Back-Bench speeches and spoke in his inimitable  <br>

style. I thought that he showed insufficient appreciation of the ferocity of the business cycle&#151;a ferocity that his constituents will yet have to withstand. My hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) spoke about jobcentre closures. He also mentioned empty property rates, which I shall come on to in a minute. I thought that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths) was unduly vitriolic, and looked only to the past. Our concern tonight is about the future.</p>

Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) was especially convincing on the Prime Minister&#146;s view on immigrant workers, but the victor ludorum tonight is the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine), who is temporarily out of the Chamber&#151;it is certainly a brave man who becomes his psychiatrist. The mistake that he made, when levelling accusations against us, was insufficiently to appreciate the fact that so many of the problems of the &#146;80s&#151;high tax, inflation, underinvestment, restrictive practices and loss of competitiveness&#151;were caused by what had gone before. I am not sure whether the Secretary of State was even born then, but he can always turn to the history books.</p>

Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen)&#151;I am sorry that I missed a bit of his speech&#151;was, once again, looking back. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) showed a rather more accurate grasp of history. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), once he had decomplexified everything, showed a much greater sense of realism, which he injected into our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08100817000086">I am the Conservative spokesman for the Department for business. It is vital that the UK has a strong business sector, and that Whitehall speaks up strongly for business, if we are to counter the scourge of unemployment. I fear that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, whose Ministers I face across the Chamber, has not done as well as it could have done over the past 10 years. There have been 38 Ministers and seven Secretaries of State, and the Minister with responsibility for small firms has changed on average once every 18 months. The construction portfolio alone has changed six times since 2001. We are talking about the Department that needs to oversee all the economic activity that ultimately gives us all our wealth, which all other Departments then spend.</p>

For these few days, until he is duly ennobled, I can accurately call him Mr. Mandelson. It is a great pity that I will not face anyone of Cabinet rank across the Dispatch Box. When we had a Cabinet Minister in the Lords, be it Lord Carrington or Lord Young, there was always a Member of this House of Cabinet rank whose voice in Cabinet from the Commons would always be there, but we do not have that under the future Lord Mandelson.</p>

for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), is a fine parliamentarian who will do a fine job speaking for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="08100817000091"><a name="81007-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="08100817000645"><b>Alan Duncan:</b>
 Yes, but he is not in the Cabinet, as I have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08100817000092">I fear that the prospects for employment are grim. We have seen institutional mayhem, and the concern is that even within a matter of weeks businesses, small, medium and large, will have their credit lines withdrawn and their overdrafts cancelled, that they will not be able to pay their bills, and that people who are paying them will take longer and longer to pay what they owe. The picture that we can therefore foresee of a credit squeeze going right to the high street, to households and into corporate Britain is potentially apocalyptic. If the bank problems that we face today are not addressed in short order, the mayhem in the business community will hit people in a way in which no one has been hit for nearly a century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08100817000093">We must address the matter carefully. The problem is that almost everything that the Government have done in the corporate sector over the past decade will make things worse. It is so easy to tax and put burdens on business as the economy is rising, but when the inevitable downturn comes, those burdens are like an albatross around its neck. The danger, therefore, is that those burdens on business will convert immediately into unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08100817000094">People can pay &#163;20,000 in stamp duty on housing when the market is going up. When the market is going down, that renders it immediately stagnant, driving out of work estate agents and people who do up houses, and the whole collateral of many small businesses is diminished. We have seen tax for businesses rise. Corporation tax, particularly for small businesses, was raised at just the time when it needed to go down. There has been messing around with capital gains tax. We have seen a challenge to income shifting, which is exactly the underpinning focus for families and couples who run a business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08100817000095">We have seen fuel duty interrupt the clear economics of business. We have seen regulation increasing. We have seen employment tribunals making it too intimidating for an employer to take on their first employee. We have seen business rates that are particularly punishing for small businesses and high street shops. The ports sector&#151;some Members present may have one of the 56 ports in this country in their constituencies&#151;is about to face national domestic rate demands backdated in an immoral way to April 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08100817000096">Perhaps most immoral of all, taxing something that generates no revenue does enormous damage. Removing the tax relief for empty property rates is bringing to a grinding halt any kind of activity for preparing business premises or developing wrecked premises for future use. It is taking money from people who have not got it to the point where they have to take the roof off or demolish what they have just built.</p>

Perhaps the Minister can tell me whether he agrees with his own Back Benchers that the tax is but one of the measures that is making the future rise in unemployment higher than it would otherwise be, which is adding to the recession that the British Chambers of Commerce says is already upon us.</p>

 The jokes might be fun, but they are made at the expense of the Opposition, because at this time of all times in this place, with all that is going on in the broader country, all we have heard from the man who purports to speak for the Opposition on business is that there should be less borrowing, less taxation and less regulation. Conservative Members should run away and turn their televisions on. At this moment of all moments, borrowing and taxation equal public expenditure, the very public expenditure that we shall use here and elsewhere to lessen the impact of any slowdown.

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0810081000004">Yesterday, a senior member of the Tory Front Bench said:</p>

intervention is essential, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said. They could have said that a lot has been done to great effect over the past 10 years in assisting those currently and previously unemployed. They could have headlined that they will keep up the pressure on us to ensure that the pace of welfare reform is greater not lesser. They did none of that. Instead, we heard a complete dismissal from the hon. Gentleman of all that Jobcentre Plus has done for so many of our communities throughout this country over the years; work that means that whatever the severity of any forthcoming slowdown we are better placed than we have ever been to help and assist those who are unemployed for however long. For it to be so glibly dismissed by the hon. Gentlemen defies belief.</p>

Among other things they could have apologised for, as so many of my right hon. and hon. Friends have so eloquently put it, was the scandalous waste of human talent in the 1980s and 1990s when the Conservatives were in charge, when there was no intervention of any substance to assist the unemployed and no conditionality, and when there was precisely the fiddling of figures that is the charge falsely laid against us at this stage. They could have apologised for putting so many of our people and communities on the proverbial scrapheap, causing heartbreak and destruction.</p>

 What would my hon. Friend say to the former miner whom I met only last Thursday? That former miner may have seen this debate in a crystal ball.

Member for Epsom and Ewell to help me, the Government and the country with the welfare reform agenda, as he promises to. I want him to make clear exactly where he stands on every aspect of our Green Paper, subsequent White Paper and Bill.

that we will be waiting a long time. Whatever the rhetoric&#151;heightened, sub-prime or otherwise&#151;in this place, it is simply not good enough to condemn the progress made by initiatives such as Jobcentre Plus and the other significant progress on getting people back into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0810081000012">It is no accident that there was a Celtic tinge to the contributions from my hon. Friends. My hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), for Livingston (Mr. Devine) and for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) all spoke, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), who made a point about decomplexification. They were not wallowing in the past, as was suggested by the Conservatives. They recognised that we cannot go back to the &#146;80s and &#146;90s and that we cannot have the non-intervention, &#147;not our fault, guv&#148; approach that the Conservative Government took in those decades. It is time that there was some consensus in this House. Whatever the depth of the current downturn, and however much harder it makes it to find work, it is not a reason for despair, as has been suggested by some Conservative Members&#151;not least because of what we have already put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81007-0019.htm_para23"><a name="0810081000013">My right hon. Friend said clearly that we should treat the current downturn as a spur across the Dispatch Box to ensure that we get even more help to those who need it to overcome challenges&#151;not by fiddling figures or consigning people to inactive benefits and still less by slackening the pace of welfare reform, but by ensuring that we have high expectations, effective support and real obligations not for the minority, but for everyone. We know and understand the lessons of history and we want to get to a stage at which this time, whatever the level of unemployment, nobody in this country will be written off or left behind. As is clearly stated in the Government amendment, we will build on the progress that we have already made to make sure that we do not return to the shameful history and experience of unemployment, perpetrated by the Conservative party in this country.</p>

The petitioners believe that violence against women is a cause and consequence of women&#146;s inequality. In 1995 the UK adopted the platform for Action in Beijing at the 4th World Conference on Women to address the goals of inequality, development and peace for all women around the world. There were twelve critical areas of concern where strategic action was needed; one of these was violence against women.</p>

 I am delighted to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) to his new position of Minister with responsibility for disabled people and to wish him well in that post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="81007-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08100819000023">Supporting people with disabilities to obtain useful and satisfying employment and to remain and, hopefully, progress in it is rightly an issue that commands great public interest and cross-party support. One such long-standing initiative has been the supported employment placement scheme, currently known as Workstep, whereby funding from Government&#151;in this case the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;is matched by a host employer. Among the local authorities who have taken part in this scheme has been my own, Blackpool council, which is Conservative controlled and whose adult social care and housing department has been responsible for administering it.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08100819000025">Unfortunately, the sequence of events that I have to relate tonight strongly suggests that for some of the people on Blackpool&#146;s Workstep scheme those supportive words have not been lived up to. Blackpool council initiated a process at the end of April this year that led to five months of pressure, anxiety and uncertainty for the people concerned and their families and friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08100819000026">At that time, Blackpool had 30 people on the Workstep scheme, of whom 11 held contracts with Blackpool council but were placed with host employers. A number of the Workstep employees had been in long-term employment with host employers&#151;hard-working and dedicated to the jobs they were doing, which provided them with self-esteem and financial stability. However, suddenly, without prior warning or consultation, those people were told that Blackpool council had reviewed Workstep scheme. The 11 who were contractually employed by Blackpool council but who&#151;in the rather cold words of the note that was issued to them by the social care department&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08100819000027">were told, along with their employers, that the council would no longer support the scheme as previously operated. As a result, I was contacted by family and representatives of two of the people affected, who were my constituents, and subsequently by an employer in my constituency of a third person. All those people had been left concerned and bewildered by not only what had been proposed, but the manner in which it had been presented.</p>

The money paid out by the Council to support this scheme is greater than the money brought in. Unfortunately the Council cannot support the scheme in this way any longer.</p>

What had further disturbed me since being made aware of the proposals was that conversations between my Westminster office and the contract provision delivery team of the Minister&#146;s own Department had confirmed that despite the funding provided to Blackpool council for the Workstep scheme by the Department&#151;some &#163;400 a month per employee&#151;the council did not consult the Department&#146;s officials or, as far as I am aware, Jobcentre Plus, before acting unilaterally. Nor did it discuss the possibility of transitional arrangements to ease the stress and turbulence with which these employees were now threatened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08100819000033">I asked about the motivation for acting now, given that the Department had not altered its national funding or criteria, and the next national review of Workstep was not due until late 2009. The letter that I received back from Mr. Pullan did not address the financial issue but said instead, rather disingenuously, that as the Workstep contract</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08100819000036">My two constituents have worked with their host employers for about 20 years each&#151;indeed the original placements were made via Lancashire county council, from which Blackpool council inherited responsibility for their contracts when the Blackpool authority became a unitary one 10 years ago. Why, therefore, had Blackpool council waited until now to decide that it needed to be moved on to encourage progression? It is perhaps not surprising that when comparing the reasons given in the notice that the adult and social care department issued with those given to me by Mr. Pullan in his reply to me, the relative of one of those affected said in an e-mail to him that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08100819000037">What is equally puzzling is that, only five days after I had received my letter from Mr. Pullan, an e-mail sent by another council official to the employer, who had also queried the reasons and timing for the changes, said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08100819000040">The council has continued to deny any financial motives for its actions, and, indeed, at a meeting with me last week Mr. Pullan again sought to insist that his junior officials had misunderstood the situation in their written explanations&#151;but to do so not once but twice, in writing, looks at the very least, to echo Lady Bracknell, like carelessness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08100819000041">My meeting with Mr. Pullan came only after four months and two further letters from me both to Mr. Pullan and to Councillor Lily Henderson, the cabinet member with responsibility for his department&#146;s administration of Workstep, in which I questioned whether the council&#146;s actions were not against the spirit and possibly the letter both of equality and disability legislation, and also the Government&#146;s partnership with local authorities on Workstep. As well as being very slow to respond to direct questions from me and representatives of my constituents, the council has been evasive as well as insensitive in not appreciating how it has turned the lives of vulnerable people upside down more than a year in advance of a national review&#151;as well as running the risk that because host employers had been placed under an unreasonable deadline, these people would end up redundant and demoralised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08100819000042">The fact that these issues have dragged on over the summer has exacerbated the situation. I have discovered that the assessments that were supposed to take place for employees to access their potential for progression were, at least in some cases, never properly carried out. I am disappointed that, despite both Councillor Henderson and Steve Pullan being made aware of the human impact of this situation, they failed to act urgently to relieve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08100819000043">I have known one of my affected constituents and his family for 10 years. At the end of July, I visited him and his elderly mother in their home, where she was increasingly  <br>

house-bound and where he had taken on increasing caring responsibilities. It was clear that they were both very upset and stressed at the threat to his job, and a note sent from the council&#146;s own occupational health doctor to the host employer over the summer confirmed that. Sadly, on 1 September, my constituent&#146;s mother died and since then he has been on sick leave. He is keen to return to work, but his doctor has advised against it at present. On 25 September, two women representatives of Blackpool council called on him and told him that the</p>
<a name="81007-0021.htm_brev13"><a name="08100819000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;redundancy steps were still in force and could be acted upon at a time of their choosing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08100819000044">The money saved by Blackpool council by abandoning its contractual obligations and top-up funding would, as Mr. Pullan has admitted to me, be comparatively meagre&#151;probably less than &#163;30,000 if enacted for all 11 employees. After all, the overwhelming proportion of the money comes not from the council but from employers, and the Government. Blackpool council is Conservative controlled, but I am pleased to report that my constituents&#146; cases have been robustly supported by their individual councillors from both sides of the council, and I pay tribute to the strong advocacy by Labour councillor Fred Jackson and Conservative councillor Jim Holdsworth. I appreciate also the involvement of the council&#146;s chief executive, Steve Weaver, in trying to achieve closure on some of these issues. But even now the situation remains uncertain and not properly resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08100819000045">Mr. Pullan tells me that seven of the 11 individuals have now been transferred to host employers, but of course their salaries and terms and conditions are not guaranteed to be the same as they were. Of the other four, the gentleman who lost his mother is still at risk of redundancy. In one case, the council appears to have reversed its position and guaranteed employment until 2009, but whether that will be via the existing contract or by transfer to the host employer is still not clear. My office was told by the employer in my constituency that his employee was made redundant by the council, paid redundancy money and then re-employed by the host employer. When I raised this at my meeting with Mr. Pullan, he was unaware of the situation and I am now waiting for clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08100819000046">After all the inconsistencies and unequal outcomes that Blackpool council has produced, the decisions still appear to have been taken without any consultation with the Government or its agencies. In addition, the upheaval on which Mr. Pullan embarked and in which Councillor Henderson colluded ignored the overall context in which local authorities as providers of Workstep are obliged to operate in return for being funded by the Government.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that the recent consultation document on the Government&#146;s welfare to work strategy talks clearly about empowering people with disability, listening to people with disability and supporting people with disability in getting into work and while they are in work? Does he agree that in this instance our local authority has failed to do any of that and that it owes an explanation to the individuals concerned in the cases that he has outlined and to the Government?</p>

Blackpool council should also now make that commitment as well as giving an undertaking to make sure that progression, assessment and support issues for disabled people with supportive employment are properly and professionally handled in future. At a time when the ruling Conservative cabinet of Blackpool council is keen to be seen to be promoting new equality initiatives, it should do no less if it aspires to be taken seriously about supporting disabled people. That might be some compensation for those who have been put through the wringer by the way in which Blackpool council has mishandled its stewardship of the Workstep scheme for the people it held under contract, to whom it owed a duty of care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08100819000053">The Government believe that paid work is the best route out of poverty, and the best route to social and economic inclusion. We need all our partners across the board&#151;local authorities, voluntary sector organisations and many other agencies&#151;to deliver the programme. It cannot be delivered without them, and we rely on their co-operation and partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08100819000054">In July, we published our ambitious plans for welfare reform. These plans are all about making better use of the human resources at our disposal and ensuring that no one is written off. Despite the economic downturn, we remain determined to head for an 80 per cent. employment rate, and to reduce social exclusion by improving employment prospects for people facing the greatest challenge. We will not achieve that goal unless we help greater numbers of sick and disabled people to fulfil what I believe is their ambition&#151;that is, paid employment. We need to have in place a modern framework of flexible support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08100819000055">Earlier this year, we consulted on proposals to reform the specialist disability employment services, including Workstep. Our proposals received strong support from the 450 people and organisations who responded. I referred earlier to the welfare reform Green Paper entitled &#147;No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility&#148;, which was published in July this year. It promised that the Department would implement these reforms. The Green Paper also said that the Department would expand its supported employment budget&#151;by amounts yet to be decided&#151;and proposed that disabled people who could be helped effectively through more mainstream employment programmes, such as our new deals, wherever possible should use this support rather than specialist provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08100819000056">We propose to enhance the role of the disability employment advisers in Jobcentre Plus to help to ensure that support is targeted toward those who need it, and that disabled people get the right support package to help them achieve their employment goals. Our aim is to move away from the current separate programmes, including the job introduction scheme, work preparation and Workstep, and towards a new, more flexible and less prescriptive programme that can be tailored more easily to the individual needs of disabled people and that is more focused on job entries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="81007-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08100819000057">That approach will help us to move away from &#147;one size fits all&#148; and towards a more flexible approach that recognises the very individual needs of every person. This is in line with our welfare reform approach to offer more flexible and personalised support. The programme will be delivered in partnership with organisations from the public, private and third sectors, and will cover pre-employment support right through to job retention and longer-term supported employment. We expect to publish the DWP&#146;s response to the public consultation later in the year.</p>

people to take up and keep paid work. That is part of our philosophy of putting money into support instead of benefits. The Green Paper contained a commitment to doubling the access to work budget for 2013-14. That will enable us to expand the reach of the programme, enabling us to reassure employers, benefits claimants and people seeking help to retain their jobs, that support will be available to all those who need it. We estimate that that will expand the programme&#146;s capacity to around 48,000 by 2013-14. I am keen to explore how we can make access to work more responsive to the needs of customers with fluctuating conditions, including mental health conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="81007-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08100819000059">I turn now to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South. As I said earlier, I understand the concerns of customers on this scheme. While the DWP of course wants to encourage as many people as possible to secure contracts with their host employers, we have not insisted that they do this for all customers or by any set date. I hope that that is very clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="81007-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08100819000060">Even when we introduce our reforms, we accept that some customers will require long-term support, and that this might not always be provided by a host employer. My Department can continue to provide funding in respect of those customers who remain on the books of the provider, although we will expect that every effort will be made to find host employers. We need to strike the right balance between incentives for customers to have contracts with host employers that improve their work experiences in the long term and longer-term support with providers for those who need time to acquire the skills and experience that employers want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="81007-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08100819000061">I am pleased to tell the House that of the original 11 Workstep customers my hon. Friend reported as having no contract with a host employer, seven now have such a contract. All seven customers are still being supported by the Workstep programme, under the existing Workstep contract held by his local authority&#151;Blackpool council. The four who do not are still employed by Blackpool council, which I understand is continuing its efforts to obtain contracts with host employers.</p>

The Department has not been made aware of any other local authority that is taking action similar to that of Blackpool council in relation to their Workstep contracts. I said earlier that we rely on the partnership of the people and organisations with whom we place the contracts, so I say to Blackpool and any other local authority with concerns about particular people on the scheme that they should pick up the phone. They should contact us. That is the way to resolve concerns and problems. Let us work in partnership&#151;I am sure that Blackpool council talks a great deal about that in its community. I do not seek to blame; I simply say to Blackpool or any other council, &#147;Pick up the phone and we will resolve the issues&#148;.</p>
