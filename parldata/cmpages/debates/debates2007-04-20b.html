 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have just had a Division in which no Members voted for the proposition that the House should sit in private, following the call for that to be subject to a vote. Surely, with due respect, we ought to test the feeling of the House. Generally, when votes are taken on matters, an attempt is made to establish whether there is some support for a measure&#151;and obviously there is no support for this one. Is it possible for only one Member to require a Division in this situation?</p>

 What would the hon. Gentleman say to those who say that the House of Commons decides on freedom of information for almost everybody, but is attempting to exempt itself? Does not that make a mockery of the House of Commons? If this measure was passed into law, which I hope that it will not be, it would do a great disservice to Members of Parliament, because the inevitable reaction would be, &#147;Well, of course, MPs have something to hide.&#148; I hope that none of us has anything to hide, but the suspicion will be that we are trying to hide our expenses, travelling allowances and the rest of it. That would do a grave disservice to Parliament.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a strong point very early on, and I am grateful for that expression of a clear view. He has been a Member of this House for an extremely long time, and for the whole of the period of the debates he has argued for freedom of information. He will remember, as I do, that one of the things that the Labour Government did, to their credit, when they were first elected was to take up the argument, which had been going on for a very long time, that we should have freedom of information legislation, and undertook, as we both argued at the time, that that should be coupled with the protection of data by other legislation. Both those regimes are in place, covering thousands of organisations and public authorities. Every Government Department, local council in the land and agency of the public service in the land is obliged to be open about what it does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70420-0001.htm_para13"><a name="07042029000100">All the evidence from the United States and other countries with freedom of information legislation is that that has been a good thing. For example, it has made for better environmental standards, better water quality and better quality of administration and of public service. Like the hon. Gentleman, I would be extremely perturbed. In the past few days, as the reality of this Bill has become more widely known, it has become apparent that the public would be very concerned. At the very moment when we were trying to establish that we were doing a decent job for our constituents, the Bill would have the direct consequence of exempting information on how we spend our money, what contracts we place and our expenses, unless we voluntarily agreed to provide it. Voluntary agreement has never been an acceptable answer for Government Departments, Government agencies or local authorities, so it should not be acceptable for us. Although Mr. Speaker has indicated that the intention of the Speaker&#146;s Office and of the Commission would be to carry on as we are, there would be no guarantee of that; we could rescind that at any time, by one vote. That position is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70420-0001.htm_para14"><a name="07042029000101">The further point, which the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) made well, is that the  <br>

Bill would mean that although, back in the late 1990s, we came to a considered conclusion that Parliament should be included in freedom of information legislation, suddenly, with no proper consideration, consultation or taking of evidence, we would exclude not lots of people and organisations, but only ourselves&#151;and for those really lucky, good people, we may let them see some things because we are very kind and generous. That would be the implication and that is why the proposition is fundamentally mistaken. It is also one that comes to us having had no serious consideration.</p>

 I shall make one more point before giving way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70420-0001.htm_para15"><a name="07042029000104">One thing is seriously troubling, and I accept that we are all at fault in one sense. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was quite entitled to draft his private Member&#146;s Bill, bring it to Parliament and have it put on the Order Paper. When he moved the Second Reading on 19 January, the rest of us were taken by surprise and objections were not made. Had they been, we would not have been in our position today, because the Bill would have been put back and had a Second Reading later, if at all. The Bill has not had a Second Reading involving any debate, only one that put it through on the nod. What was disturbing was that at that moment, the Government, who usually make it clear that they are willing to object at that stage so that there can be a debate, were silent; the Whip on the Treasury Bench who would usually object to make sure that a private Member&#146;s Bill was properly debated, was silent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70420-0001.htm_para16"><a name="07042029000105">The rest of us should have spotted what had appeared at the bottom of the list. Although somewhat belated, opposition will be heard in its full form today, and, if the right hon. Gentleman persists, later as well. However, it was very sad that the Government did not object on 19 January. The clear implication was&#151;I read the speech made by the Minister in Committee&#151;that the Government would be neutral about the issue. I understand that position, but usually the Government will facilitate an opportunity for debate even if they are neutral about a Bill. So far, they have not done so in this case.</p>

 The usual channels wish to make the Bill pass into law. My Government brought in the Freedom of Information Act 2000&#151;all credit to them for that; the previous Government had refused to do so. However, there is a suspicion that the Government are collaborating with the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), who has introduced this private Member&#146;s Bill.</p>

 Of course, Madam Deputy Speaker. The first of the group is amendment No. 9, to which I shall turn in a second. However, I said that I would give way to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore).</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has moved on a little from the point that I want to make. Mr. Speaker has made it clear that expenses and allowances would continue to be published. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I tabled a new clause&#151;unfortunately, it has not been accepted&#151;that would have put that stipulation in the Bill. That would have been preferable, but the fact remains that it is inconceivable that our allowances would not continue to be published as they are at present. The public would expect that, and nothing in the Bill would stop that.</p>

 The difference is that if the legislation stated that allowances should be published, they would have to be, because people would ask for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewes was one of those who did ask that allowances in relation to travel expenses should be published, and they were&#151;but only after he had to take on the matter, not only with the House authorities and the Commission, but in a tribunal. The alternative, in the Bill, is that such disclosure would be discretionary, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North said.</p>

 It is worth putting it on the record that the House of Commons Commission resisted tooth and nail the call for MPs&#146; travel expenses to be published at every stage for two years. It used expensive lawyers to try to fight its case, with no regard to the cost involved, even when it was clear that the Information Commissioner recommended that the expenses should be published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70420-0001.htm_para18"><a name="07042029000115">I make no comment about individuals holding particular positions, but it is clear that in their own behaviour as a body, MPs have not shown consistency or a guarantee that they will allow such matters to be published in due course, as has now been allowed. The only guarantee that could be given would be if those expenses had to be published under freedom of information legislation. If we give discretion, there will inevitably be pressure from MPs to rescind that position.</p>

has a different regime, which is possibly one of the best in the world. Evidence from the Information Commissioner in Scotland shows downward pressure on expenses. That is on the public record. Such pressure is a good thing. Evidence in a note that the Campaign for Freedom of Information supplied about expenses divulged, for example, by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, other police commissioners or authorities and other agencies, shows that, once people have to declare how much they spend on taxi fares, meals, entertaining, travelling by bicycle, car, plane or train, it leads to a proper public debate. We are all trying to be more environmentally responsible and it is good that information about our air travel&#151;its cost and frequency&#151;and about train travel as an alternative is in the public domain. It is therefore not sufficient to say that we want to keep only expenses exempt, even if that was the intention of the promoter and of the hon. Member for Hendon.</p>

Proposed new subsection (2A) in the amendment relates to the House of Lords.

I do not say that to take sides against colleagues in the Lords who have debated the matter.

They can then claim maximum allowances for travel, overnight stays, food, secretarial expenses per day and so on. I recently discovered that all those allowances are tax free. I do not know whether that is widely known by the public. Our salaries are taxable but, because Members of the House of Lords do not get salaries, their allowances are not taxable but are instead regarded as expenses for attendance.</p>

That is of significant public interest. They are legislators. We can debate how they get to be legislators; some of us believe that we need to reform the House of Lords into a predominantly or wholly elected second Chamber, and we voted accordingly the other day. However, it is vital that the public have the same access to information about individual expenses incurred by Members of both Houses. It is therefore proper to include the House of Lords.</p>

The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is now trying to limit the proposal to the House of Commons. Amendment No. 9 would deal with the expenses of both Houses. I hope that all colleagues will agree that information about the expenses of all Members in the execution of their duties should remain available to the public and accessible as of right, not of discretion. That must be the principle.</p>

 There is a further point to make. The Information Commissioner has ruled, after careful consideration, and the information tribunal has supported him, that information about Members&#146; expenses should be released in its current form. Does my hon. Friend agree that, if we moved back from that position and exempted Members, as the Bill suggests, it would fatally undermine people&#146;s confidence in the Information Commissioner and the tribunal process?</p>

 I agree. In some ways, it would be worse. My hon. Friend, with <i> The Sunday Times</i>, applied to ensure that information on expenses was made available&#151;a similar application was made in Scotland, by newspaper representatives by and large. It would be unacceptable if, in the year that we received the tribunal&#146;s judgment&#151;indeed, in the few weeks following the decision&#151;that such information must be publicly available, Parliament said, &#147;You fought the battle, O House of Commons Commission, and lost, and you&#146;ve taken it to the highest tribunal you can, but now we&#146;re immediately going to change the decision.&#148; It would undermine all the arguments that we are trying to present that local councils, Government agencies, quangos and Departments should have to provide information. Having set up a process that provides for an adjudication system, undermining it would be bad news. One of the great merits of the system is that it has an Information Commissioner halfway up the tree, who is the watchdog on behalf of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70420-0002.htm_para6"><a name="07042029000130">Elsewhere, we are having a debate about the Government&#146;s attempt to increase fees and reduce people&#146;s ability to make repeat applications. That is another potential threat to people&#146;s ability to access information from public authorities. In the same year, there would be a move from Government, and, at the same time, from Parliament to reduce people&#146;s ability to access information.</p>

 I do not in any way question the good faith of Members, let alone officials, who took the case to the information tribunal. I have the ruling here with me. Would I not be right, however, in reaching the conclusion that the House itself did not discuss the matter, so that no decision was reached by the House in debate? That led to the case going forward to the tribunal. Had there been a debate on the subject, perhaps the House would have taken the view that there was no justification for withholding the information about Members&#146; travelling expenses.</p>

 I stand to be corrected by any hon. Member present, but I think that the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the decision was taken by the House of Commons Commission, which is chaired by Mr. Speaker and includes representatives of at least three of the political parties. I do not think that any debate was brought to the Chamber by the Commission: it took the view that it did and instructed Officers of the House to do its bidding. They did so and the case was defended. I do not yet know the costs to the public&#151;it is not us who pay for it out of our pockets; it comes out of public provision&#151;of fighting all those battles, though perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes does. As well as Clerks, we employ parliamentary counsel and others who are paid, perfectly properly, out of the public purse. If we employ external barristers, solicitors and others, they, too, will be paid out of the public purse. There will be costs, but the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the matter did not come to us for deliberation. That is not to say that every decision that the House of Commons Commission takes should come to us.

Amendment No. 1 would prevent the removal of the House of Commons and the House of Lords from the scope of the Freedom of Information Act. It is my preferred position and we support that amendment. I believe that, when the time comes, the House should be able to express a view on this amendment, as well as on amendment No. 9, which deals with a separate issue. It is a more limited provision, but guarantees that expenses and other financial matters relating to Members of the Commons and the Lords can be protected and allowed to remain in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70420-0002.htm_para8"><a name="07042029000136">Amendment No. 3 provides a variation on the theme. When we drafted these amendments, I had no idea what the House&#146;s view would be. I took the view that it was important separately to consider whether the Commons and the Lords should be exempt from the application of the Freedom of Information Act. Amendment No. 3 would remove only the House of Commons from that Act, leaving the Lords within its scope. It would then be for the House of Lords to decide whether it wished to amend the Bill further to provide for its own exclusion. This is a private Member&#146;s Bill, which has not got through its stages in this House. If it were to get through those stages, in whatever form, it would go to the House of Lords, which could then add or take away as it saw fit.</p>

their lordships were to take a different view, I would hold to my view. I do not know that they would take a different view: we have not tested it and when it went through in the first place, there was no opposition to the proposition that the House of Lords should, like the House of Commons, be subject to freedom of information legislation.

Proceedings of many Committees take place in private, and the privacy of these would need to be respected. However, the proposed exemption for the integrity of decision-making is likely to protect these discussions. The papers held by individual Members, parties and their Committees do not relate to Parliament&#146;s public functions and would therefore not, presumably, be covered by the Act, just as the political and constituency papers of government Ministers held in government departments will not be disclosable. Papers sent by Members to Ministers and departments may well, however, be covered by the Act in any case.

The Liberal Democrats kept asking the Government when it would come into force, and the Government told us that they needed a lot of time to put it into operation. I understand that, but no protests were made at that time. Nobody said that Parliament should be exempt. I take the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Walsall, North. If, at any point before the implementation date in 2005 any Member of Parliament had said, &#147;This is a bad thing.

 Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying into the second group of amendments. The second group deals with communication with Members of the House of Commons. The group that we are now debating deals with the exemption of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.</p>

 I will of course follow your direction, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I am aware that the second group has that as its principal theme. The reason that I have raised the matter here is that amendment No. 5, which would replace the references to the Commons and the Lords with a reference only to the House of Lords, would mean that we would no longer have an exemption as a public authority. May I suggest, therefore, that there is an overlap between the two groups? I understand that we must try to separate the two debates, but I was trying to do justice to the fact that this amendment would mean that we were no longer a public authority for any purposes, which would change the status of the relationship. I wanted to honour the point that the right hon. Gentleman made about there being a double concern. I shall be happy to make more substantive points about that second issue when we debate the second group of amendments.</p>

 I beg the hon. Gentleman&#146;s pardon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para0"><a name="07042029000159">Amendment No. 4 is consequential to amendment No. 3, and amendment No. 6 is consequential to amendment No. 5. I was advised that, if we were to deal with certain aspects of our public activity&#151;namely, the keeping of expenses and accounts&#151;we would need to change the long title of the Bill. Amendment No. 32 deals with the consequential change to the long title, which would reflect the fact that there were certain exemptions from the provisions of the legislation, rather than a total exemption. Amendment No. 33 would cover any changes to the title, depending on whether we decided to exempt the Commons, the Lords or both. The long title would need to reflect those changes. Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 cover the same subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para1"><a name="07042029000160">I want to make a few more points on the substance of the provisions, but I shall rein myself in from talking about communications. I shall limit myself to talking about the processes of this place. As I said earlier, one of the great benefits of the present system is that, because our activities are now much more in the public domain, we have had to become much more accountable. The public are telling us that they want us to be as accountable as possible. They want to know what we are doing and, in particular, they want to know how we are spending money on their behalf. It is not good enough for us to say that we should decide whether we are going to follow that principle by law. It is difficult enough when we fix our own salaries. We make that decision, and that is invidious enough. It would be regarded as completely beyond acceptable if we were to say, &#147;You may not have some or all of the information about what we do.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para2"><a name="07042029000161">We already have important data protection legislation. No one has suggested, for example, that, in revealing information about the functioning of the House of Commons, we should have to reveal the amount of money that we give to the staff whom we employ. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewes has never suggested that, and I think that the tribunal case made this point clear, although I stand to be corrected on that because he will remember the details better than I can. Such revelations appear to be outwith the freedom of information requirements. The amount of money that we receive as an allowance to pay for staff is about &#163;80,000. I use that money perfectly properly to pay my four members of staff through the Fees Office in the normal way. That is, of course, a matter of public record. Members could, in theory, employ a single staff member on that salary, or use the money to pay two, three or four. In the past, Members&#151;including me&#151;have contributed much more than the allowance for staff purposes. But no one is suggesting that information about individual salaries and the individual contracts of individual members of staff should be included.</p>

 My hon. Friend has dealt with the general point, but let me give another specific example. Obviously, no one wants a Member who represents a constituency outside London and who legitimately claims an allowance to cover the cost of living in London to have to state whether he or she has spent the money on installing a yellow bathroom suite or a white bathroom suite, or on improving a flat that he or she is renting from Mr. X or Mrs. Y. There is clearly a limit, and we all understand that. What is of proper concern to the public is information that allows people to know that we are using our money properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07042029000166">It is perfectly proper for individual Members of Parliament, acting on behalf of their constituents, to visit, for example, a Government agency to inquire about work that is being done. I am having a number of problems with the tax credit service, and am writing a great many letters to a man who is in charge of it, whose office is somewhere in the north of England. I have asked to meet him. I hope that he will come to London to discuss the cases of concern with me, but if he says &#147;I cannot go to London but you are welcome to come and see me,&#148; of course it will be justifiable for me to travel to Blackburn, or wherever it is, on behalf of my constituents, and the disclosure of the cost of my train journey will be covered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07042029000167">What emerged in the Scottish example was that there had been a misuse of funds. A Member of the Scottish Parliament had wrongly claimed expenses for a trip to the party conference. I think he paid the price, and gave up his position as leader of his party in the Parliament. Clearly the public need to know that we are not mixing party spending, which is accountable and is governed by specific rules&#151;we raise money for it locally and receive Short money; discussions are taking place about whether there should be other sources&#151;with our parliamentary expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para7"><a name="07042029000168">All this, obviously, is about our expenditure in our capacity as Members of Parliament. It does not affect anything done by the Under-Secretary of State in her capacity as Minister; that is dealt with separately, quite properly. I am sure that, like the rest of us, the hon. Lady understands the distinction. She knows exactly what are her constituency obligations, which she will continue to fulfil, and she is perfectly entitled to claim recompense for money that she properly expends for that purpose.</p>

the taxpayer, the council tax payer or the business rate payer is paying for members of police authorities, chief executives, councillors or other public figures, he or she is entitled to know how that money is being spent. There used to be large abuses and considerable suspicion. Polls conducted by organisations such as Ipsos MORI have revealed the level of discontent, but&#151;the point made by the hon. Member for Walsall, North is very germane in this context&#151;the discontent is not normally with the local Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para9"><a name="07042029000170">People have a relationship with their MPs. They see them in their communities. They know what they do, and can judge whether they are active and competent. But they have a general concern: they feel that Parliament does not do its job properly, and that MPs are abusing the system. That is the central point in the debate. We must ensure that the House of Commons collectively is seen to be following the rules that we think everyone else should follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para10"><a name="07042029000171">There might be an argument for the Bill if there had been any discussion of the issue before&#151;if any Select Committee had conducted an inquiry, or if any evidence had been provided that it was a matter of public concern. The Bill is unusual, in that, however well motivated it may be, it has not justified its further progress because it has not received what was described by the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills as the pre-legislative scrutiny that Bills should be given. Private Members&#146; Bills come from a different place, as it were, but we are entitled to say &#147;Hang on a minute: is the case made?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para11"><a name="07042029000172">One of our complex tasks if we were thinking of adopting these proposals&#151;the tribunal case dealt with this very well&#151;would be to explain to the public the interrelationship of freedom of information legislation and data protection legislation, both of which are not uncomplicated. Freedom of information governing United Kingdom public bodies applies throughout the United Kingdom, but there is separate legislation for exclusively Scottish bodies in Scotland. Northern Ireland has a separate regime, but it is governed by the legislation that applies here. The Northern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies are governed by the general proposition; there is no proposition in the Bill that either should be exempted, although that would be possible because their public authorities are on the same list as those specified in the United Kingdom legislation. The Bill does not propose an exemption for the London Assembly. The proposed exemption is solely for us&#151;for the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It strikes me as ill-considered to concentrate on one part of the United Kingdom&#146;s constitutional arrangements, and to suggest exempting two Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament but no other Parliament or Assembly. There is no argument in favour of such a piecemeal approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70420-0003.htm_para12"><a name="07042029000173">I hope Members will conclude that, although there may be an issue of concern, there is no evidence to support the proposals in respect of communications between Members of Parliament and public authorities; and that exempting other parliamentary arrangements, such as expenses and administration, from the legislation and leaving them to our discretion would therefore be a move in entirely the wrong direction.</p>

 My hon. Friend said that no public concern had been raised about the present arrangements. I would say that public concern had been raised, but in the opposite direction of travel from that suggested in the Bill. Evidence suggests that the public are very concerned and, sadly, do not hold Members of Parliament in very high regard.

 I was not arguing that there was no concern in the opposite direction. I have spent much of the last hour arguing precisely the reverse. There is plenty of concern that we should be accountable: the public want to know. I have heard no suggestion that we should be more secretive, take more power back to ourselves, and give ourselves discretion. I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border really intends that part of the Bill to remain, or whether he now realises that the idea does not have much merit and, indeed, could prove extremely damaging politically; but such a move has not been supported in any argument that I have heard since the legislation came into operation.

I understand that there is a reluctance in these matters to quote the Speaker, but perhaps I may be allowed to refer to what he said. I should quickly add that the Speaker was writing on behalf of the Members Estimate Committee. He said that even if the Bill became an Act, the House of Commons Members Estimate Committee would continue to publish every October the information on travel, allowances, accommodation and secretarial costs. I accept that that is the position, but in effect that would be optional, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said. A future Members Estimate Committee may decide that that would not be in the interests of the House of Commons. Therefore, if the Bill became law and the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to the House of Commons, that information might not be published at all.

 I am prompted by what the hon.

 Indeed. All the information concerning those elected bodies would be in the public domain. What about the House of Commons, the sovereign Parliament?

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07042029000195">It is a crucial time to seek to exempt the House of Commons and the House of Lords for a number of reasons. The flame of freedom of information has only recently been lit; it is not yet in the bloodstream&#151;I apologise for mixing my metaphors&#151;of the population and the public institutions of this country. There is a danger that the candle flame of freedom of information could yet be extinguished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07042029000196">We in the House of Commons have fought for many years for freedom of information. That has been supported by the Labour party, and by the Labour Government who introduced the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It has also regularly been supported by my Liberal Democrat colleagues and by individual Conservative Members, such as the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), as well as by Members of the nationalist parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07042029000197">The freedom of information argument has finally been won, and Parliament is central; the role of Parliament&#151;of the House of Commons and the Lords&#151;is key. Freedom of information has been accepted as a concept, and the arguments have been won that openness and accountability in government and in Members&#146; dealings in this House lead to better performance by Government in terms of how they discharge their duties and better financial management by MPs in terms of House expenditure and our personal expenditure as Members of Parliament. The argument has been won that secrecy tends to benefit only those who are corrupt, those who are incompetent or those who are careless with public money. We should not protect the people in any of those categories. The freedom of information regime that now applies to public authorities, and to this House in particular, and which we are discussing in respect of this group of amendments, has led to the beginning of a change in culture in this country and in this House as to how we deal with information. The role of the House of Commons in how we approach these matters is central. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07042029000198">If the House of Commons exempts itself through this proposed legislation&#151;we are seeking to reverse that by means of amendment No. 1&#151;that will not simply be a small matter to do with how we deal with MPs&#146; expenses and with expenditure in this House such as on renovations, including the &#163;422,000 spent by the House of Commons on the ludicrous covered walkway next to the turntable downstairs. Nor will it be a small matter to do with the environmental performance of the House, which is lamentable in many regards. However, it should be said that those issues tend to have been quite well concealed, which it might be thought is one reason why such expenditure and  <br>

performance have been lamentable. Freedom of information drives up the performance of public authorities. That is one of the sensible reasons to have it. Not only does it empower the people&#151;important though that is&#151;but it drives up performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07042029000199">As I have said, if we exempt the House of Commons and the House of Lords, that will not simply be a small matter to do with MPs&#146; expenses. The ramifications of that decision will go far and wide out into society. That is why the Bill is so important, and why it is so important to defeat it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07042029000200">Let us be clear what the consequences will be if the Bill is passed unamended, and if amendment No. 1 in particular is not accepted&#151;I wish that to be voted on in due course. One important consequence would be to drive down further the reputation of Members of Parliament as a whole, which would be regrettable. We already feature below journalists in the list of trusted professions in society. I think that we are marginally above estate agents, although a friend has told me that we have fallen below them in terms of trustworthiness. If the Bill is passed and amendment No. 1 is rejected, that would drive down further the reputation of Members of Parliament both collectively and individually and the reputation of the House of Commons. I do not wish that to happen, and neither in their hearts do Members in all parts of the House, such as Liberal Democrat Members, Conservatives and nationalists. Nobody wants that consequence to result from the Bill, but that is what will happen if it is passed and amendment No. 1 is not agreed to. Members must decide on that.</p>

Members are not allowed to use that word about each other in this House, but plenty of members of the public are using that word in respect of the House because of this Bill. People are asking, &#147;Why should Parliament be exempt from the legislation that Parliament itself has introduced and is now applying to other public authorities?&#148;</p>

 I will be brief, Madam Deputy Speaker, although with respect it is an important point in my argument, but clearly you will correct me if I stray too far. I was making the point that the Select Committee gave careful consideration expressly to the question whether Parliament should be exempt. We have heard from my hon.

If that exemption is not reversed, it will bring the consequences that I had begun to explain to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07042029000216">I have already mentioned that MPs would be brought into disrepute and the allegation that we would be seen as hypocritical, but there are other consequences. In the House, we are keen to ensure that public authorities take freedom of information legislation seriously. I am sure that many Members have used the legislation to make inquiries, whether of the Environment Agency, local councils or whatever. We expect those bodies to respond fully and properly. Unfortunately, it will be more difficult for us to do our job and persuade those authorities to respond fully and properly under the Act if we have exempted ourselves from it. That would send out the message, &#147;You must do one thing, we will do something else&#148;, which would bring the whole Freedom of Information Act into disrepute. It would fatally undermine it and could extinguish the candle flame that was lit not long ago. The Bill has enormous ramifications that go way beyond the narrow terms of MPs&#146; expenses&#151;important though they may be in their own small way.</p>

The commissioner was appointed under the Freedom of Information Act and he is doing a rather good job, although he has insufficient resources to deal with all the matters brought before him. He has given careful consideration to MPs&#146; expenses, covered in amendment No. 9, and to the general position of the House of Commons, covered in amendment No. 1. My application, to which I shall refer shortly, was a test case so it was given close scrutiny by the Information Commissioner. It then received close scrutiny from the information tribunal, which looked at all the arguments, including those we have heard from the hon. Member for Walsall, North and my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey today. The tribunal considered carefully the relationship between data protection and freedom of information. However, if we rejected amendments Nos. 1 and 9, we would be saying that the person appointed under the Freedom of Information Act and the information tribunal&#151;the properly established body set up to assess appeals&#151;can be overridden by a Back-Bench Bill that had no time on Second Reading, spent only one hour in Committee and is now being dealt with on a Friday morning, not in Government time.</p>

to undermine the Information Commissioner or the information tribunal, but that will be the consequence if the Bill is not amended by amendments Nos. 1 and 9, tabled by my hon.

It is worth pointing out that the amendments are supported not merely by two Liberal Democrat Members, but by a Conservative Member, a Labour Member and a Plaid Cymru Member.</p>

 If the amendments were not passed and the measure became law, what would be the position if the devolved Administrations decided that they, too, wanted to be exempt?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely pertinent and valid point. The Bill has the potential to unravel freedom of information provisions throughout the public sector and throughout the country. There is no question but that Members of the Scottish Parliament have accepted, perhaps reluctantly in some cases, the need to be open about their travel expenses&#151;the sort of thing we are discussing in relation to amendment No. 9&#151;and have taken some flak for their openness. They have a more open system than we do, as have Members of the Welsh Assembly and Members of the European Parliament, members of local councils and the London assembly and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07042029000221">We are the cornerstone of democracy in this country&#151;the keystone of the bridge&#151;so if we suddenly say that we are getting rid of provisions on openness, what will be the consequences in other Administrations? The Scottish Parliament, which makes its own laws on such matters, could decide to forget the provisions, too. It could say, &#147;The House of Commons has got rid of the requirement to include itself in the legislation and to publish Members&#146; expenses, so that gives us cover to revise our scheme, too.&#148; The Welsh Assembly could do likewise, and before we know where we are the Freedom of Information Act will be wrecked, which would be a tragedy for this country. We are finally emerging from years of secrecy, but the Bill is a major threat to that process. It may be a small measure in itself but it opens up a huge hole in that important legislation, which is, above all, why it must be rejected. That is why amendment No. 1 is the most important one on the Order Paper and why we should vote for it.</p>

become relevant if the Bill is passed, because the measure will set an example that we do not want replicated. That is the point of making connections between this place and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07042029000226">Amendment No. 1 is the important one, so if it were to be lost amendment No. 9 would, for me, be only second-best. However, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North pointed out, it would ensure that, whatever else happened, information relating to MPs&#146; expenses and other financial matters would not be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act as the Bill would provide. We want to ensure that that does not occur.</p>

I will not repeat it now. Of course, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Speaker&#146;s intentions are entirely as set out. How could I dare to suggest anything else? I have no reason whatever to think that. I make that as abundantly clear as I can. However, with respect, Speakers come and go. Cultures change. If something is not written down in law, there is no guarantee that a convention&#151;that is what it would be&#151;would survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07042029000228">Let us say that the culture against freedom of information increases, as it will if the Bill is passed, and freedom of information becomes seen&#151;wrongly in my view&#151;as not important, as expensive and as something that the country cannot afford in all sorts of ways. Let us say that that argument starts to triumph. Can we really say, hand on heart, that whatever the circumstances, the House of Commons will stick by a convention to publish MPs&#146; expenses? Or will that be subject to some pressure at some future date for reasons that are indeterminate now, but that may well exist later?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07042029000229">A convention is not a sensible way of proceeding. A sensible way of proceeding is to ensure, for the protection of all Members of the House, that the requirement to publish information is there in legislation and cannot easily be undone. That gives us protection. I am afraid that, if that requirement is removed from legislation, it will lead to more questions about the behaviour and conduct of Members of Parliament. Individual Members of Parliament who have nothing to hide and are happy to have their information published will find themselves subject to scurrilous mutterings because information has been kept secret. I do not want that to happen. I want the House to be held in high regard, and the way to ensure that that happens as far as this matter is concerned is to ensure that MPs&#146; expenses are not exempted from the Freedom of Information Act as a consequence of the Bill. Amendment No. 9 seeks to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70420-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07042029000230">Let us think what would be exempt. The allowance scheme, as we know, publishes information relating to the cost of staying away from the main home. It is perfectly proper that we should have the opportunity to have an alternative base, whether it is in London or the constituency, to carry out our jobs. No one is suggesting that that should not be the case, but we are talking about public money. Why should that information not be out in the open, as a matter of right, under freedom of information legislation, rather than as a matter of convention because MPs temporarily agree that it should be there?</p>

That is entirely germane to this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked me earlier how much has been spent resisting the claims. It is approaching &#163;20,000 of public money.

 Let me deal with the intervention made by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick). I have held conversations with colleagues who were involved in the process. The House of Commons Commission is made up of Mr. Speaker, as Chairman, the Leader of the House, a Member nominated by the Leader of the Opposition and three Members appointed by the House. I have talked to my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) about the matter and I understand that the Commission was advised that it would be wise to test the existing law so that the current position could be determined. Today&#146;s debate is timely because in the light of the decision, we now clearly know the current position.</p>

It was reached following an analysis of three things: the Freedom of Information Act 2000; the Data Protection Act 1998; and the possible impact of the request for information. By carrying out that analysis and giving the matter due consideration, it provided an answer on what the appropriate scheme for the House of Commons would be. However, the tribunal&#146;s decision would be overturned by this private Member&#146;s Bill. We have had two detailed considerations of the way in which the House of Commons and House of Lords should be treated under freedom of information legislation, and they are in line with what the situation would be if amendment No. 1 were accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para6"><a name="07042029000248">The two Houses should be consistently regarded as public authorities under the legislation and subject to the same requirements as other public authorities.

Members want a third opinion, it is also the position of the information tribunal. All three have examined the matter carefully and concluded that the House of Commons and House of Lords should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The only argument against that conclusion is this Bill, which was not defended on Second Reading and received minimal scrutiny in Committee. If we were to pass the Bill without the benefits of amendments Nos. 9 or 1, we would be overturning the considered judgment of people in senior positions whom we have asked to consider the matter.

 There is another reason why the public need to understand the importance of our argument. A note provided by the Library, which is clearly objective, states:</p>

Friend&#146;s case had been dealt with, 100 people had been told that they could not get information, but they are now told that they are entitled to much of it, given the tribunal&#146;s decision.</p>

 That is exactly right. The situation shows the endemic nature of secrecy in the House of Commons Commission and demonstrates why people will have no confidence in a voluntary scheme or a convention that says that the processing and publication of information will continue. By the way, it is not clear whether the Members Estimate Committee has promised to publish the information that was produced before the judgment on travel expenses, or information detailing MPs&#146; expenses that includes travel expenses. It would be useful if someone explained today whether the convention&#151;I am not sure that it is worth the paper that it is written on&#151;is meant to take account of the judgment of the Information Commissioner, or whether it represents an attempt to undo that judgment and revert to the position that was previously applicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para8"><a name="07042029000252">Let me refer to the evidence given on behalf of the House of Commons by Andrew John Walker, the House of Commons Director of Finance and Administration, at the tribunal hearing on MPs&#146; expenses. It is worth noting that no one from the House of Commons Commission dared to show their face at the tribunal and left it to an Officer of the House to defend the indefensible. Paragraph 25 of the document produced by the information tribunal states:</p>
<a name="70420-0005.htm_brev2"><a name="07042029000724"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Mr Walker accepted that it was the duty of every MP to use public money carefully. Part of the objective of the annual verification exercise was to draw MPs&#146; attention to the details of travel expenditure so they could understand how they were using allowances and if appropriate review their modes of travel in the light of this duty.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para9"><a name="07042029000253">There was thus an acceptance by Mr. Walker, on behalf of the House of Commons, that the publication of information to MPs, whether publicly or privately, in the form of a breakdown of their modes of travel, would be useful for the reasons that he outlined. In other words, he made my case for me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para10"><a name="07042029000254">The publication of information is a good thing because it improves awareness, holds MPs accountable&#151;not least of all to themselves&#151;and helps to drive down costs. The publication of information on travel in Scotland has driven down the cost of travel claims. I predict that when next year&#146;s details of Members&#146; travel expenditure are published&#151;unless that process is stopped&#151;they will show a downward drive in travel expenses. The production of information is good for the use of public money, as well as being the right moral and philosophical thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para11"><a name="07042029000255">To be fair to Mr. Walker, I think that he put forward the best case that he could for the House of Commons.  <br>

However, although he argues that it is appropriate for MPs to review their modes of travel, greater pressure comes when people outside the House ask MPs about their travel. One of the interesting consequences of the publication of MPs&#146; travel expenses a couple of months ago was that neighbouring MPs were shown to have made wildly different claims. Their constituents properly asked them why their claim was three times as much as their neighbour&#146;s, or why they were travelling by air when their neighbour was travelling by rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70420-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07042029000256">We should be held accountable for our decisions because our travel uses public money and has an environmental impact, which was one of the reasons why I made the application in the first place. At a time at which we are all worried about climate change, our constituents have a right to know whether our decisions show that we are walking the walk rather than just talking the talk. The publication of Members&#146; expenses, which would be guaranteed if amendment No. 9 were accepted, is key to that. If amendment No. 9 is not accepted, the progress that we have made on driving down costs, encouraging people to make environmentally friendly choices and being accountable to public&#151;that counts for something&#151;will be wiped away as if it had never existed and we will return to the dark days. I do not think that that would be appropriate, which is why amendment No. 9 is important.</p>

MPs&#146; travel than does the present scheme, even after the information tribunal judgment. Those MPs who suggest that the present travel expenses declaration goes too far fail to appreciate that it does not go nearly as far as the Scottish system. That is a very Westminster-centric view, which fails to take account of what is happening in other Assemblies following devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It also fails to take account of how the public at large view matters, which is entirely different from the view of those who drafted the Bill.</p>

 Just so that we are clear: my hon. Friend is completely right to say that the Scots go further. For example, MSPs have to declare the destination of a taxi journey.

I have been able to go to my constituents and point out that I am one of the few MPs in my part of the world who has claimed more for rail travel than for a car, and nothing for air travel. That is important to my personal philosophy. A number of MPs have come up to congratulate me on the publication of the figures, saying that they have managed to release information that is very helpful to them, demonstrating their accountability to the public and the fact that they are spending wisely. Far from MPs as a whole resenting the publication of the figures, which may be concluded from reading some of the press, many, in all parts of the House, have welcomed it. The fact that the press have concluded that MPs did not want the measure brings us into disrepute again and lowers the opinion that people out there have of us. That lowered opinion can be reinforced only if the Bill is passed without amendments Nos. 9 and 1, which seek to repair some of the damage that has been done.</p>

We need it to remain as strong as it is; indeed, we need to strengthen it.&#148; This is a key moment. What happens with the Bill and the amendments, particularly Nos. 9 and 1, will be key to determining whether the House of Commons is serious about freedom of information; whether it has moved into the 20th century, let alone the 21st century, in how it addresses these matters; whether it accepts that democracy and the House of Commons are better served by openness and accountability; or whether we are going to return to the dark days, when discussions took place in smoke-filled, or perhaps smokeless, rooms, when cheques were written without anybody knowing and when MPs were largely unaccountable to their constituents. Surely we do not want to go back to those days. That would be the consequence of not agreeing to amendments Nos. 9 and 1.</p>

 I am very keen that we do not neglect any of the arguments that were put in my hon. Friend&#146;s tribunal case. He was there and I was not, but I see from the report that two of the other arguments for amendments Nos. 9 and 1 are that they would allow the public to be more aware of the environmental or green choices made by MPs, as demonstrated by their mode of travel, and that the public would be aware of MPs&#146; choices of mode of travel, in light of their involvement in debating and legislating on transport and environmental matters.

 Exactly so. We in the House have an obligation to be seen to be leading the debate. I hope that we do so on a whole range of issues, but we should certainly do so on questions of financial probity, democratic accountability and environmental responsibility. Those three elements are key, and we hit those targets with the publication of MPs&#146; expenses in an open scheme. That scheme may cause difficulties for individuals in the House; for example, I might be asked why, if I am so concerned about the environment, I have claimed nothing for bicycle travel. We all get asked questions about our individual returns, but so we should. We are accountable. We are not running this place without reference to what happens outside it.</p>

 That is exactly right. Will the Government consider supporting amendments Nos. 9 and 1? They have said that they are neutral on the Bill, so presumably they will say that they are neutral on those amendments. But they cannot be neutral on these matters should they wish to retain the integrity of their own legislation&#151;the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Amendment No. 9 seeks only to ensure that what they included in their own Act is kept. How can they be neutral on a matter that they have introduced and that our amendment seeks to retain in legislation? Are they neutral about their own legislation these days? Does it not matter if particular proposals that they have enacted are wiped away by private Members&#146; Bills?</p>

We need to hear the Government&#146;s view on amendments Nos. 9 and 1.

 I am grateful for that intervention. For the avoidance of any doubt, I should say that I, for one, am happy to accept that there are MPs in all parts of this House who are committed to freedom of information. I hope that they will be supporting us today when amendments Nos. 9 and 1 come to a vote. There are too many doughty supporters of freedom of information on the Labour Benches to mention, although I should say that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher), who has added his name to our amendments, is clearly one. There are supporters on the Conservative Benches and on the nationalist Benches who understand the constitutional importance of freedom of information, and they will be supporting those amendments.

However, every case needs to be examined on its merits. The Information Tribunal first considered fully the interaction between FoI and DP in its judgement on the release of information about Members&#146; allowances in January 2007. The Tribunal found that where the exemption on personal data applied, then the data protection principles in the DPA should be applied without regard to FoI. But para 2(6) of Schedule 2 to the DPA applied a balancing test similar to the public interest test under FoI. Only where the legitimate interests of those to whom the data was disclosed outweighed the prejudice to rights, freedom and legitimate interests of the data subjects, should the data be disclosed. In the case of Members&#146; allowances, the Tribunal found that the legitimate public interest in the expenditure of public money outweighed the privacy of Members, particularly as the allowances related to Members&#146; public functions, not private lives.&#148;</p>

Protection Act. There is no suggestion that asking for further information about MPs&#146; expenses will take us down some sort of endless route into the minutiae of our lives. Such a scenario simply will not happen. Should any Member be concerned that that is the likely consequence of the Freedom of Information Act, I am happy to say that they are wrong, because the information tribunal has applied a careful test to assess on the one hand the rights of MPs to privacy, which we all want respected, and, on the other, MPs&#146; obligation to be open and accountable. That balancing act must be examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70420-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07042029000286">There is no dispute that those two Acts act in concert in a way that affects the issue of MPs&#146; expenses. Quite a subtle relationship is involved. The tribunal has gone into this in some detail in a way that has not been done before. Unless amendment No 9 is accepted, there is the danger of the Bill seeking to overturn that. This is not an open-ended commitment to reveal every single piece of information about a Member of Parliament, because we also have the right to privacy in our own personal matters&#151;they should not be revealed, and nor will they be. Like everybody else in the country, we are covered by the Data Protection Act. Everybody else is protected, so the argument necessarily flows that the same rules should apply to us in terms of protection and in terms of disclosure when it comes to being responsible for public funds and being in a public authority.</p>

It has been plain to me, although other hon. Members may not share this view, that money has not always been well spent in the House of Commons. We found&#151;usually by leaks, well directed parliamentary questions, suggestions or conversations&#151;for example, that the building of Portcullis House went over budget, that there were problems with the contract, that some features did not work, that there was Weil&#146;s disease in the water features in the centre and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70420-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07042029000288">Such information is important, because it demonstrates how we are spending public money on a prestigious building. It also shows whether MPs are capable of spending money well in the organisation of these big projects, and whether they are capable of taking good decisions, of awarding contracts and of dealing with all the other paraphernalia that goes with such a large building. What emerged from that exercise demonstrated that there are question marks about how we organise ourselves in those regards.</p>

Would we be able to guarantee that when money is wasted&#151;for example the &#163;422,000 spent on the ludicrous covered walkway downstairs&#151;the information will become public? Would there be any guarantee that when we are writing blank cheques on behalf of the electorate to benefit ourselves, it will be money well spent? The only guarantee of money being well spent is that people are able find out about things and question the expenditure of that money.</p>

What happens, however, if the House of Commons and the House of Lords are exempted from the Freedom of Information Act and someone has the bright idea of arguing, &#147;The exemption means that we are not obliged to answer parliamentary questions with the same degree of honesty and openness as we have hitherto shown? The House has concluded that this matter should not be in the public domain because it will put MPs in a position where they have to defend themselves and answer questions about expenditure, so it is not appropriate to give the same full answers to parliamentary questions as have previously been given.&#148;? That could be a legitimate argument advanced by someone at a not-too-distant point in the future. Exempting the House of Commons and House of Lords could undermine the system of parliamentary questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70420-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07042029000291">Exemptions from legislation for the House of Commons and the House of Lords do not have a good track record. You may remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, when we were exempt from regulations relating to food safety and health and safety because of the status of this place as a royal palace. The consequence of that, which I remember from my time as a researcher here, was that the quality of the food was appalling&#151;there was actually a poisoning in the House of Lords. It took that sort of incident to persuade either the Government of the day or the House of Commons Commission&#151;I am not sure which&#151;to conclude that the exemption of Parliament from that legislation made no sense and was unhelpful to Members in the discharge of their duties. Similarly, I argue that the exemption of the House of Commons from freedom of information legislation will be unhelpful to us in the discharge of our parliamentary duties.</p>

They will in the long-term be building up huge problems for the accountability of the House, the reputation of MPs, and the proper discharge of public functions and expenditure of public money. We know from the experience of the operation of freedom of information legislation in this country and others that keeping public authorities and public bodies working well requires the ability to find out information about those bodies through FOI requests and other means. The public, MPs and the media have to be able to pose questions to public authorities. When information comes out that is questionable or embarrassing, a self-corrective mechanism comes into play, which eliminates bad practice, incompetence or worse in a public authority.</p>

I challenge her to give us her view on amendment No. 9 and, in particular, amendment No. 1. Does she, on behalf of the Government, want to defend the legislation that they introduced, or does she want to aid the pulling of the rug from under the Freedom of Information Act?

We stand in danger of extinguishing the flame of freedom of information, which is flickering dangerously and is fragile in this country. That is why it is important that we have a statement from the Government. It is why the House should accept amendment No. 9, which would ensure that we do not appear hypocritical in relation to disclosure of MPs&#146; expenses. Most important of all, it is why we should accept amendment No. 1 and not exempt the House of Commons and House of Lords from the provisions of the legislation.</p>

The 2000 Act was a flagship Act of the new Labour Administration&#151;one in which they proclaimed their pride. I supported the dream that we would one day have such legislation, although the Act did not go far enough for my taste. However, the House made a judgment.

The 18- line Bill&#151;in substance, it is 18 lines long&#151;before the House today contains one huge contention: the exemption of the House of Commons and House of Lords as a public authority. That is a huge concept, when one thinks of what a public authority is. Amendment No. 1 hopes to strike out the removal of the Commons and the Lords as public authorities. Anyone considering the structures of Government and the constitution of the country who was asked to name a public authority would name the House of Commons or Parliament.

Everyone in this country would say that the House of Commons or the House of Lords was the pre-eminent public authority.

The removal or continuation of public authority status has consequential effects that touch on the only other subject that the Bill mentions: communications with members of the House of Commons. The two issues are intimately related. Of course, communications is only one of the many instances of areas in which there would be consequential effects, but it is the one that is specified in the Bill. When considering the removal of the Commons as a public authority, we are therefore considering what that means for a wider range of interests, and for our work, doings and proceedings&#151;not proceedings; I rapidly withdraw that, on the ground that I understand a little bit about privilege.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70420-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07042029000314">I am mindful that the concept of &#147;public authority&#148; applies to almost everything that is important in our public processes and public life. As always, I am extraordinarily grateful to the Campaign for Freedom of Information for its diligence and pursuance of argument and reason. It lists, in a useful note, some of the public authorities that now give information that seems to trouble some Members. I am thinking of the expenses of chief constables and one of the areas in which I have had particular difficulty, local authorities. All people sometimes have a natural reluctance to explain what they think is sensitive information. That may be an innate human response, but the truth is that it is, as often as not, the people&#146;s money that is being spent, and I maintain that they have an absolute right&#151;I go too far, because nothing in life is absolute, except death. [Hon. Members: &#147;And taxes.&#148;] I have listened to my hon. Friends on the Public Accounts Committee, and they assure me that taxes are not absolute. That a touch of the golden days should arise is startling. The matter is as near to a certainty as possible; I put it that way. We are talking about a trust in the purpose of our construction of democratic government.</p>

It is like shining a torch into a dark place&#151;that is all that it is about&#151;so that the public may judge whether such things are appropriate. We are all traduced&#151;it is the fate of Members of Parliament to be caricatured, to be told that they are ineffective, to be this, that and the other&#151;but that is the nature of our times and was probably always the nature of the times of this nation. We must be resolute in understanding that if we have a claim, whatever its nature, on the public purse that, just like the chief constable of the Thames Valley police, just like the chief executive of a local authority and just like public services in the national health service, our salaries, expenses and so on are a matter of legitimate concern or interest. It is not just being nosy, as we should be able to judge the effectiveness, the character and the honour of those who purport to spend public money in the interest of the public.</p>

I want to return, however, to the point first made by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) and by the hon.

It has been pointed out that we are the second and third entries in the annexe to the originating Act that the Bill endeavours to amend&#151;in turn, we are endeavouring to amend the amending measure. Our special case is that we make the law. How can it be right for us to direct that a law should apply to everyone else but, having found it inconvenient or not meeting what the Information Commissioner or one or two individual Members wanted, we should do something that no other public authority in Britain can do&#151;change the law? That is what we are doing, but do we really think that it is quite right? Does it not look like the most extraordinary form of special pleading? Many people feel aggrieved, and I can think of a particular chief executive in the west midlands who is outraged at the fact that her salary should be made public. She thinks that it is like looking into her bank account. I can understand her concern. What if we suddenly started to say, having asked for this information to be published, &#147;Now that I&#146;ve found it inconvenient I think I should be exempted in some form or other&#148;? That would be a profound corruption of public standards. I can see that my good friend from Glasgow, the right hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton, West (Mr. McAvoy), disagrees with the burden of that argument. Nevertheless, we have never liked particularisation of individuals or an individual class as against that of the public class in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70420-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07042029000326">When the Bill was debated in Committee, there was no guillotine and it was able to sit for as long as it wanted.

Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey spoke about the public interest in knowing what goes on in Parliament and how the money is spent. I would simply say that a huge amount of information is already made public. The House of Commons Commission publishes its report, which I looked at the other day. It is a huge, extremely complex document, and a mine of information for Members. If that is not enough, the hon. Member for North Devon, who is on the Commission, answers questions in the House, jointly with the Leader of the House. Any hon. Member can table questions, and we have business questions every week. Then we have the resource accounts for the administration estimates and the Members Estimate Committee, whereby, again, a huge amount of information is published.</p>

Only this week, it published a very good report on improving facilities for educational visitors to Parliament.

I take on board the point made by colleagues on both sides of the House that that is a driver for better standards. Every Member now has an eye on trying to give good value for money and is a genuine custodian of the public purse. One example is that of travel. There was a time, before these allowances were published, when Members did not go quite as far as they should have done in trying to find a super-saver ticket, off-peak travel, a travel card concession, or whatever it might be. Now, all Members do those things. Perhaps we should have done them before, but very few Members did. That is just one example.</p>

reiterate what I said in Committee: the Freedom of Information Act 2000 has been a significant success. It has resulted in the release of information that is of real interest to the public. Most importantly, it has increased the transparency of public authorities.  As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) has just said, so much information is now available through Government Departments and the Houses of Parliament on websites and so on that a great deal of information is available to people.</p>

Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), in whose name they stand, would agree. The question for the House today is whether the House authorities should be covered by the 2000 Act; that is the thrust and question behind the amendments. There are very few examples of public authorities being covered for only some of the information that they hold&#151;those that relate to the protection of the journalistic integrity of the BBC, for example. There may be a whole new debate on that, but I do not intend to go into it today.</p>

The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk read out some of the letter that Mr. Speaker wrote to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean); as it stated, the authorities of the House are already very open and already publish information on Members&#146; expenses. The right hon.

It is not just a passing fancy. Yes, it is theoretically possible that a future Speaker could reverse the ruling&#151;and that Mr. Speaker or a future Speaker could reverse a range of things that we have done&#151;but it will not happen. I accept the assurances that we will continue to publish the details of the expenses of Members of Parliament as we have published them in the past, and with the more detailed breakdown on travel that has been provided in the past couple of years after the tribunal decision. That will continue to happen. The House of Commons will not be brought into disrepute because there will be no cover-up on expenses.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) for speaking to his Bill. I want to deal with his points first. He made both a broad point and a slightly narrower point. On the broad point, there are, of course, some hon. Members who are opposed to the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has been a Member of this House as long as I have, so he knows that we have two ways of making arguments: on Second and Third Reading, we argue about a Bill as a whole; and in Committee and on Report, we try to make a Bill as least problematic and least offensive as possible, by improving it. The amendments in this particular case are designed to restrict the scope of this part of the Bill. The right hon.

The law is an external watchdog. The right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is exactly right. I have the latest copy of the Register of Members&#146; Interests with me. It is now regarded as hugely important and failure to comply with it is regarded as very serious, because the public expect to know the financial considerations that might occupy our thoughts and labours. That is absolutely right. However, the hon. Gentleman will know that the argument goes further than that. This has been the argument for all sorts of organisations for a long time. I have recently finished serving on a Committee dealing with compensation claims, in which the Minister&#146;s Department was involved. We were investigating claims farmers who go round putting a note through people&#146;s doors saying &#147;We are willing to take up your compensation claim.&#148; Why were we legislating on that? We were doing so because the Government, supported by colleagues on all sides, took the view that self-regulation would not achieve the right outcome.</p>

These amendments are not about the regulation of private bodies; they deal with the regulation of a public body.

We are seeking, through amendments Nos. 1 and 9, to ensure that the House of Commons is subject to the same requirements.

 Let me then summarise the points in regard to the relative consequence of the amendments for the legislation as a whole. I have not added up the total number of bodies involved, but there are two education authorities in England and Wales, and three in Northern Ireland. There are three police authorities in England and Wales, two in Northern Ireland, and three others. There are 371 other public authorities in England and Wales and 85 in Northern Ireland.

 And&#151;as was pointed out by the hon. Members for Walsall, North and for Aldridge-Brownhills&#151;if we did that for local government, we would be seen as undoing progressive legislation that makes local government more accountable. As the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills said, the salary of that chief executive in the west midlands is of public interest, as it should be. We cannot have one standard for one body and a different standard for another body.</p>

Friend the Member for Lewes. One of the benefits of the exposure of expenditure that we incur here&#151;apart from revealing whether we are using &#147;green&#148; travel&#151;is that people can know whether we, like most other members of the public including us when we are spending our own money, are taking advantage of cheaper fares by, for instance, taking a train after 9.30 am. The only way in which to guarantee such benefits of exposure, and to guarantee that the public have access to the information when they want it, is to support the amendments and, ideally, to reject the Bill even as amended.</p>

I am not sure whether it has been cleared with the party leadership, but it is certainly not consistent with the new cuddly, friendly, open-government, we&#146;re-on-your-side Tory party that the party leader is seeking to sell to the country over the next couple of weeks and beyond.</p>

I hope the hon.

If that is his position, I should be intrigued to hear him defend it against the critique&#151;already clear and voluble&#151;that has been delivered not just by the well-regarded and respected Campaign for Freedom of Information but by the press, not least in the past couple of days.</p>

 I have been surprised that there has been such a lack of clarity. I can understand the Government taking a view that they were content to let the Bill be debated on Second Reading, and to see what the mood of the House was and whether there was any basis for change, but no one here in the debate so far has argued that there is evidence that people outside the Chamber have expressed support for the Bill to MPs. All the argument that has been put to me and others is in support of the sort of amendments that we have tabled. They may not be perfectly drafted, but amendments Nos. 9, 1 and others seek to ensure that we do not today or later exempt the House of Commons or the House of Lords from the provision.</p>

He has argued many times that Members work hard as individual MPs to try to serve their constituents and to stand up for freedoms, and that it is often difficult to persuade Governments in respect of that subject because Governments naturally get nervous about it.

we had the five-year implementation period. Today is a Friday just before the Scottish, Welsh and local elections so fewer colleagues than usual might be present, but on any day of any year after having fought that battle and having only recently reached the place that America, Australia and other countries have reached before, suddenly to row back from that place by saying that the Commons and the Lords should not be exempted from the Bill would be a most bizarre, strange, inconsistent and discordant note for the House of Commons to strike.</p>

Should we include the Commons at all? If we include the Commons as an exempt organisation, should we include the Lords, which is what another amendment in the group proposes?

responses in respect of openness and accountability. We are being called to be more accountable, and as we are now under more scrutiny it would be a particularly bad time to seek to close that down. However clever or generous we might want to be in our arrangements, that would be an inexplicable route to go down.</p>

Gentleman made the point that as far as he was aware there had been no consultation with his colleagues, and that there had been no formal proposition to test the mood of the House. Many matters of House business are brought before us merely in order to take a view&#151;to take a sounding and find out the mood of the House. I have not heard any formal proposition, other than by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border and in other speeches today in the Chamber&#151;</p>

The tribunal has just adjudicated and the law has now made it clear that certain things ought to be made public, although in theory that clarification could go to the High Court. However, the ruling is merely weeks old so I make this point to the public outside, as well as to the House. If we set up systems such as information tribunals and commissioners and are willing to abide by them and give their judgments credibility by respecting what they say, it is entirely inconsistent for us not to support the amendments, because they follow the logic of what the tribunal decided in the recent freedom of information case. I hope the House will make it clear that we support retaining the freedom of information provisions on public authorities that govern the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and that we can make sure that everything that we do financially is as accountable as in any other public body.</p>

 The amendments deal with Members of Parliament&#146;s communications with constituents and public bodies. The wider question whether the House of Commons and House of Lords should be exempted from the legislation was dealt with in the debate on the first group of amendments. The second group relates to the ostensible reason the Bill has been introduced&#151;I hope that I do not misrepresent the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) by saying that. My understanding is that his Bill arose from concern about the security of MPs&#146; correspondence. In general, MPs&#146; correspondence falls into one of two categories. The first is MPs&#146; communications with public authorities in our official roles&#151;as constituency MPs in particular, but in some cases as spokesmen for our parties if we have Front-Bench or shadow ministerial responsibilities. The second is communications with individual constituents, who may write to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07042029000539">There would indeed be grave concern if a letter sent to an MP by a constituent subsequently appeared in the public domain. That would be an intolerable breach of the trust that Members of Parliament quite properly expect to exercise on behalf of constituents who write to them. As we all know, correspondence sent to us by constituents can be of an extremely personal and sensitive nature. We all do our best to deal with their concerns in the most effective way possible, which frequently involves writing to public authorities. It would be intolerable if some of the correspondence that crosses my desk&#151;and yours, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in your capacity as a constituency MP&#151;were to become public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07042029000540">The reality, however, is that that has not happened and would not happen. A change to legislation is not required to ensure that it does not happen. There are several reasons for that. First, we have the Data Protection Act. To assess the impact of any of the changes proposed in the Bill, it is important that the suggested alterations to the Freedom of Information Act relating to MPs&#146; communications with public authorities and individual constituents be read across to the Data Protection Act. Unless that is done, it is impossible to understand how the system works. The system can be quite subtle, but it seems to be effective in the delivery of what we want, and I suggest that what we want is a system that holds Members of Parliament accountable for actions that they take on the public&#146;s behalf, and particularly on behalf of constituents, whether they be approached about personal matters, or matters raised by groups, voluntary organisations or others operating in the constituency. Of course, that is a slightly different matter from the Freedom of Information Act requirements on Members of Parliament to be accountable, open and responsive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para17"><a name="07042029000541">I hope that all of us in the House want an appropriate balance to be struck, so that we are held accountable when we need to be held accountable, namely for the discharge of public money and for the way in which we exercise our duties, both in the constituency and in the House. However, we have a separate role as Members of Parliament&#151;a second job, as it were&#151;which some would say involves acting as a one-person citizens advice bureau in our constituency. We receive large numbers of letters, e-mails, telephone calls, faxes and visits to surgeries from members of the public who have problems, which are often of a highly sensitive and personal nature, and which require the greatest discretion when they are brought to and handled by MPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07042029000542">Of course, it would be inappropriate to discuss those cases today in any way, shape or form, other than to say that the subject matter can range widely. Thinking back to my casework from the past couple of weeks, it has involved the need for a housing transfer for particular medical reasons, issues to do with child abuse, and allegations against the police. There is almost no end to the variety of casework that comes our way, and which we have to deal with in a sensitive manner. That much is common to all Members of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07042029000543">The first question that needs to be asked of the Members who introduced the Bill is whether there are faults and deficiencies in the present arrangements that have in any way justified the proposal to change existing legislation. Also, we need to ask whether there are any reasons why the amendments should not be accepted. As was the case with the amendments in the previous group, by and large, the amendments that we are discussing essentially seek to support the status quo and the Government&#146;s existing legislation. I am trying my best to support the Government, but they did not seem very grateful for it this morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07042029000544">The issue is whether we want to support the status quo, which seems to be working, or whether there is a reason to change. I suggest that it is up to the Members who wish to make the case that the present arrangements are not working to demonstrate in what way a problem has arisen. I went through the <i> Hansard</i> report of Committee proceedings recently. Let us face it: we had no Second Reading debate, and we only had an hour in Committee. We had a bit of discussion this morning, but obviously not on the group of amendments before us, as we were dealing with another matter then. I have yet to hear of any example, from any Member, of any deficiency in the present arrangements that justifies change to legislation.</p>

been a problem. Indeed, the only problem that I have come across, if it is a problem&#151;I do not regard it as such&#151;relates to cases where a public authority is reluctant to release information to a Member of Parliament who is acting on behalf of a constituent. That has been dealt with by an amendment to the Data Protection Act 1998 and should no longer happen, but the public authorities with which I deal are scrupulous in the way in which they deal with individual data protection issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70420-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07042029000547">I have not come across any examples of information being released inappropriately by a public authority, whether or not an MP is involved. Data protection is an issue that is well understood by public authorities, which comprehend their duties, so the Bill&#146;s proposals are not justified. Consequently, the amendments that I tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), the hon. Members for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) and others should be accepted, because they retain the status quo. </p>

 If public bodies released information about Members&#146; correspondence and there was widespread disclosure, that would be a constant issue at Question Time, for instance, and Members would take every opportunity to raise points of order and to protest.

 I fear that that is a correct interpretation of events. The hon.

It would be the subject of ministerial questions, and there would be stories in the newspapers. We would be under pressure to ask why it had happened because, in some ways, the kernel of our job is to look after our constituents and to inspire confidence. No Member of Parliament, however long he or she has served in the House, no matter what part of the country they represent, no matter what their political colour, wants to be party to an arrangement in which sensitive material about a constituent is released, as that would be extremely damaging to them. I believe that all of us, without exception, take very seriously indeed the need to be sensitive and discreet in our use of information with which we are provided. If anyone wishes to suggest otherwise, I challenge them to produce information to that effect.</p>

 I should be grateful if my hon. Friend amplified a point that he touched on. He said that his problem, if he has a problem at all in this area, is the reverse. Occasionally, he has run into difficulties when, with his constituent&#146;s agreement, he has written on their behalf to seek information. Is that still the case occasionally, and are people more careful, rather than incautious, or was that historic commentary?</p>

amendments that I tabled with other hon. Members, is that people are beginning to understand the situation. The slightly complex relationship between freedom of information and data protection is now being grasped by public authorities, and the number of occasions on which they err on the side of caution has diminished. It would be a tragedy to throw that up in the air and rewrite arrangements that are working quite well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70420-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07042029000552">May I deal in detail with the concept of amendment No 2, which seeks to leave out subsection (3) of clause 1 and would ensure that communications by a Member of Parliament with a public authority are not exempted, as the Bill proposes? It is important to deal with that, as reference was made to it in Committee. Even if we are careful with correspondence as Members of Parliament, the argument goes, we could write to a public authority on a constituent&#146;s behalf and it could release that information about our constituent. That is the thrust of argument in the Bill even though, as we know, the measure goes much wider than that. It is proper to ask whether or not occasions arise on which correspondence is released inappropriately by a public authority with the say-so or approval of a Member of Parliament. I have to say that I am not convinced that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70420-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07042029000553">Dealing first with issues directly related to amendment No. 2 that do not involve constituents but a general exchange of correspondence between a Member of Parliament and a public authority, the Bill as drafted would include a new exemption to cover all communications between a Member of Parliament and a public authority. The justification for that is partly that it would protect MPs&#146; correspondence. It is worth pointing out that the exemption for personal data in section 40(2) of the 2000 Act protects information about any identifiable individual, the disclosure of which would breach the Data Protection Act 1998. In practice, that protects any information relating to an individual&#146;s medical condition, housing or social services needs, entitlement to pension or benefits, education, immigration status, criminal record, relations with the police or probation service and similar matters. All those matters are already protected under the 1998 Act, so information cannot be released about them. Given that the existing law seems to be working pretty well, there is no need to try to change it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70420-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07042029000554">The mere fact that a Member of Parliament had written to a public authority on behalf of a constituent, even in the absence of other information about that constituent, would in itself be personal data about the constituent, the disclosure of which would breach the 1998 Act, so that protection is already there. If public authorities are being cavalier in the way they approach this matter&#151;I have seen no evidence of that&#151;the remedy is there in law, because such behaviour can be dealt with under the 1998 Act. The promoter of the Bill seems to be arguing that a law that already exists and achieves what he wants to achieve is not working&#151;although we have seen no evidence of that&#151;so the remedy is to get another law, which presumably would not work either, to deal with the same thing. If there was a problem&#151;I do not know of one&#151;as regards correspondence and other material of a sensitive nature being released, the matter is already  <br>

protected by law, and the answer would not be to enact more legislation but to improve the advice and training given to those who deal with data protection issues in public authorities. The Information Commissioner has told the Campaign for Freedom of Information that he has received no complaints, from anywhere in the country, from any source, about the improper release of personal information, either from MPs or constituents. I would suggest, for example, that had a constituent with a sensitive medical problem found that information to be in the public domain&#151;in the local press or whatever&#151;there would certainly have been a complaint about it. People are not afraid to come forward and make a complaint to an authority when they feel that their rights and privacy have been abused. There are frequent complaints about intrusions from the press, for example, and they are published on a quarterly basis, yet no complaints have been given to the Information Commissioner about the improper release of personal information from MPs or constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70420-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07042029000555">The Information Commissioner, for whom I have a high regard, is a very active person who takes his job very seriously. His staff work effectively. I am sure that had complaints come in they would have been recorded and acted upon, and he would have produced recommendations for this House to say that there is a problem with the law&#151;that there is a gaping hole and information is seeping out. But no such report has been received. He has found nothing wrong with the present law&#151;he has had no complaints&#151;so why should we want to change it? What we need is to change the Bill by adopting the amendments, which would ensure that the present satisfactory arrangements continue.</p>

In such a case, the information would of course be in the public domain, but the Bill would not deal in any way with such a matter. Obviously, if the individual gave permission for information to be in the public domain, or to be passed to a public authority, they would quite properly have been entitled to do so.

My example has been in the public press, which is why I wish to talk about it. It concerns a young constituent of mine, in his 30s, who was losing his sight. Moorfields eye hospital would not make available to him the drug that he required for his sight to be retained. Representatives of the hospital said that they were not sure whether it would work; he said, &#147;I will definitely lose my eyesight if I am not given the drug. I want to try it.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. To be fair to the Government, for those responsible for drafting parliamentary legislation and those who scrutinised the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Data Protection Act 1998, such issues were central to their thoughts.

 That is absolutely right. Members of Parliament also have extra protection, in the sense that we have greater access to personal data than, say, a local councillor would have. If we write to an NHS trust on behalf of a constituent, for example, the trust will take us at our word that we are acting on behalf of the constituent. If a local councillor were to write to the trust, they would need an authorisation form from their constituent to say that the trust was authorised to respond to the councillor. So the law already allows us to go further in our representation of others. It could be argued that that would make problems more likely to arise, but no such problems are arising, even though the arrangements are more flexible for Members of Parliament than they are for, say, local councillors.</p>

 The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) is correct. Furthermore, part of the solution is in our own hands. If I am writing a letter about an allegation of crime, for example, I write it in a way that does not put anyone at risk. I do not put a reference or a name at the top of the letter, and I do other things to protect people. We can solve the problem, and clearly colleagues are doing so, because there have not been any complaints.</p>

This could lead to enforcement action by the Information Commissioner under section 40 of the Data Protection Act. As far as I am aware, no such cases have been brought by the commissioner in respect of MPs&#146; correspondence. Such breaches could also lead to action for compensation under section 30 of the Act, if the individual concerned had been damaged by the disclosure. I am aware of no such cases involving the disclosure of MPs&#146; correspondence.

I would have understood his intentions better had he sought to identify and articulate the problem, cited examples, and then tried to remedy deficiencies in the Data Protection Act, if there are any. The problem that he identified relates not to the freedom of information regime, which is ostensibly what the Bill is about, but to data protection. If that problem does indeed exist, the right hon.

Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey pointed out a moment ago, it might, in theory, be available under the Data Protection Act, but that would not constitute a public release of information. An individual has the right to go to his or her Member of Parliament and ask to see information that is held by that Member of Parliament, or a public body, in a particular file. Members of Parliament are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act in the same way as public authorities, but we are subject to the Data Protection Act.

However, an opinion expressed about an individual&#151;this may be what the right hon. Gentleman was referring to in Committee&#151;is not as such protected, whether it is expressed by a Member of Parliament, a member of a public authority&#146;s staff or anyone else. The right hon.

 We all have massive experience of dealing with these matters. We know that if people complain to us about having been unlawfully sacked, one way of assisting them is to consult their files to establish whether procedures were followed properly. There may be revelations about something that was said inappropriately, but if we think a complaint is entirely self-delusional, there are perfectly proper ways in which we can say that, sometimes to the constituents themselves. We must accept that we cannot say one thing to a constituent and another to an authority, and not expect to be accountable for that.</p>

 That is true, and it brings me to my next point, on correspondence between Members of Parliament and public bodies. I do not think we should have the right to make libellous or slanderous comments about individuals. It is entirely proper to pass on concerns to, for instance, the police or a law enforcement agency about certain information that has been received and needs to be checked out; but it is a very serious matter for a Member of Parliament to make allegations about an individual in a letter to a public body, and I do not think we should be able to do that in a cavalier fashion. We would be able to do that if we were exempted from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. I personally do not have a problem about letters that I send to public authorities being made public. They are accountable. They use public money. They are listed in the Freedom of Information Act as public bodies that are subject to the Act. I am elected, as we all are in the House, to represent the public. We spend public money. We are publicly accountable, so the idea that there should be some problem with correspondence from a public MP to a public authority being released seems to be difficult to sustain.</p>

If that is the case, I believe that that is already covered by the exemptions in the Data Protection Act which relate to health and social work, mental health conditions or other matters of that nature. It is possible to pass on information without libelling or slandering someone. If we are going to exempt MPs from having correspondence scrutinised, the danger is that we will all become loose in our language about individuals who are our constituents. That would be entirely improper.</p>

cast iron case. Will you deal with that?&#148; I invite him to do so. It is a most curious Bill and debate. Arguments are advanced in these amendments and in the previous group of amendments. We do not hear much against them, but there is a vote, with 46 MPs coming from nowhere to decide that the law should be changed. However, that is one of the curiosities of the House of Commons. That is open debate&#151;so far as we have it. The votes are recorded. It shows the value of accountability and openness that we know the result. Accountability and openness are certainly worth preserving in terms of how we operate in the House and how we deal with public authorities.</p>

 These are important matters, as everyone who is here testifies, but there is huge merit in the present system being retained. If I think that my police force, the Metropolitan police, has far too few police and I write to the commissioner of the Met police saying that I think that Southwark should have 200 more police, surely I must expect that to come into the public domain. If I am saying one thing privately and writing another thing publicly, I should be exposed for doing that. If on the other hand I want to say to the commissioner that one of his deputies is corrupt, presumably, I should have the intelligence to ask to see the commissioner privately to say that to him face to face and not put it in a document, which could then be released, with all the implications that would follow.</p>

The Bill as drafted would protect classes of information, including, for example, a response by a Member of Parliament to a public consultation exercise.

I would be very happy for my correspondence with my county council or a Minister on any issue to be available for public scrutiny, provided it did not cut across the data protection legislation protecting constituents. If I am writing on general issues of relevance to my constituents, of course my views should be on the record. My constituents want to know what my views are, as do constituents of all MPs, and they have the right to know them&#151;they have the right to receive a full view. If MPs are to be given the capacity to say one thing in public and then separately to write something very different to a public authority, that will be a dangerous road to go down and it could bring parliamentary democracy and individual MPs into disrepute, as will exempting the House of Commons from the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>

 Should not the distinction be made between when we are writing on behalf of constituents, where it is essential that the information should be confidential, and when we are writing on broader policy matters? When Members of Parliament engage in criticism, we are the first to send out press releases expressing our opinions and the last thing we want is for such information to be kept confidential. If we write to the chief executive of our local authority saying what we feel should or should not be done, we are the first to let the press know about that. Therefore, we should be a little careful about being sensitive about our correspondence being so confidential.</p>

 That is right. It would be easy for public bodies&#151;such as Government Departments, NHS trusts or individual MPs&#151;to present a rosy picture of their activities when there might be something less rosy underneath the skin. The Government are appointing hundreds of new press officers at vast cost and yet they are also telling us that the Freedom of Information Act cannot be afforded. In a democracy we ought to be able to access all relevant information, except in respect of the proper exemptions on which we are all agreed, rather than merely the information that the public authority feels that it is beneficial to it to release. The key test of freedom of information and of accountability of MPs&#151;which is being threatened by the Bill, and which the amendments would negate&#151;is whether information that the body concerned, such as the Government Department or the MP, does not wish to be released can be accessed under freedom of information legislation. If we move to a position where MPs are able to put out a line that is popular and to cover up that which is not popular, that will be dangerous, and it could bring MPs into disrepute.

There might even be an issue that personally involves the MP. There might be a planning application next door to where the MP lives.

authorities would allow Members of Parliament to present different faces at local level and national level. That is also a reason why the exemption is unhelpful. Members of Parliament should be made to make a choice and should be clear where they stand. It is key to whether we are seen to be accountable that members of the public in our constituencies are able to access letters that we have written to public authorities on important matters. Where the matters are inherently sensitive, they will, of course, fall within the scope of the existing exemption in the same way as normal.

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07042029000622">Moving on to a new point, having taken your strictures to heart, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;painful though it may be&#151;I also wonder why the correspondence of Members of Parliament should enjoy special protection that is not available to correspondence from other sources. There is no special protection for communications to a public authority from, say, a local councillor. Local councillors are elected at various levels, including, of course, the London assembly level. They have constituents, as we do, and they take on issues on behalf of their constituents. They have their representational role, as we do. In many ways, their roles in public life mirror what we do. They have a role in creating the framework for action in their council and they have a role in looking after individual constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07042029000623">If the correspondence of Members of Parliament is exempted, why should that exemption not apply to local councillors in the same way? However, there is no suggestion that local councillors should be dealt with in that way. There is no suggestion that Members of the Welsh Assembly, Members of the Scottish Parliament, or anyone in the Northern Ireland Assembly should be dealt with in that way&#151;or anyone in the London assembly, or any other elected public body in this country, all of which have their democratic mandate and constituents with whom they deal, and all of which interact on a daily basis with public bodies of various sorts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07042029000624">So what is so special about the House of Commons that we have to exempt MPs&#146; correspondence in that way? It gives out a double-edged message&#151;a message that we create the law for somebody else and do something else ourselves. That is an extremely unattractive message. It risks our being seen by the public at large as hypocritical and it does not command public support. If we are going to provide a special exemption for Members of Parliament, there needs to be a pretty good reason for it, and so far no such reason has been given. I mentioned local councillors. The same thing might apply to NHS chief executives&#151;</p>

Above all else, we need to make sure that we are seen as pristine clean and that we have our house in order and have the highest possible standards.

The question whether it is implicitly or explicitly supplied in confidence is also important. Constituents will write to us saying that information is being explicitly given in confidence by writing &#147;confidential&#148; on a letter, or by expressly saying in a letter that they do not want the information to be passed on. However, we get a much greater volume of correspondence including information that is implicitly given in confidence. Amendment No. 14 would ensure that that implicit confidentiality was recognised. I hope that that will give succour to hon. Members who still have concerns.</p>

 It is important that we try to build on existing law when possible.

I start by acknowledging that things are being done by the Government, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and other agencies that mark progress since I first raised these matters in the House in the early part of the century, in 2001-02. However, I want to deal with a number of issues that require more response, more action and more initiative from the Government. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07042029000663">I want to deal with two recurring examples of abuse of our elderly citizens. Indeed, they are recurring indictments of the failure fully to realise the nature and scale of the problem and what needs to be done to tackle it. The first is the appalling practice of elderly people in care homes being subject to chemical management by over-medication and inappropriate medication. The second is the continued failure of the &#147;No Secrets&#148; guidance to deliver the professional and compassionate protection that vulnerable and elderly people deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07042029000664">Elder abuse is a widespread, growing and historically under-acknowledged problem. In many ways it is still a taboo subject. The most up-to-date research is from 1995, and I openly acknowledge that during the Health Committee&#146;s inquiry the 1995 estimate of the number of older people being abused was not accepted by the Government as an indicator of the position today. The problem is that two or three years after the Health Committee published its report we do not have an up-to-date figure. The 1995 data given to the Committee during its inquiry indicate that at any one time 500,000 older people are being abused. That is without accounting for the abuse of people in care homes. In 2004, the Community District Nursing Association revealed that 88 per cent. of district nurses reported seeing cases of elder abuse. That cannot continue.</p>

mistreatment of older people in Britain, while 25 per cent. knew an older person whom they believed had been subject to neglect and mistreatment, with half saying that it had occurred either in care homes or hospitals. Lack of personal care was felt to be the greatest failing, and one in 10 respondents cited mismanagement of medicine as a core problem. Despite the growing public awareness, a lot still needs to be done to meet the challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07042029000666">I come now to the question of over-medication and inappropriate medication. That is sometimes described as the &#147;chemical cosh&#148;, although that might or might not be appropriate. I have spoken on past occasions about the dangers of anti-psychotic drugs, their overuse in care homes, the tendency for care homes to use them to sedate patients to the extent that they lose mobility and mental capacity, the way in which the drugs strip patients of their dignity and autonomy, and the Government&#146;s failure to address such abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07042029000667">In 2001, I published a report entitled &#147;Keep taking the medicine.&#148; It detailed the worrying rise in the prescription of those drugs to people in care and highlighted the evidence that thousands of elderly people in nursing homes were being kept in a state of sedation for no medical reason. I updated the report in 2003, finding that little had changed and that action was still required. A third report in 2006 revealed that more than 25,000 people in care homes could be the victims of over-medication and inappropriate medication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07042029000668">The evidence is clear: medicine is being given incorrectly; adverse reactions to the drugs are under-recorded; and better alternatives are available. The Minister may therefore understand the disappointment and concern that I felt last month when I read a report from the Alzheimer&#146;s Research Trust confirming that anti-psychotic drugs are still being used to manage dementia patients, to the long-term detriment of their health, well-being and dignity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70420-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07042029000669">Those drugs are not licensed for the treatment of dementia, yet they are prescribed to as many as 45 per cent. of sufferers in nursing homes, and are used in an attempt to deal with problems such as agitation, delusion, anxiety and aggressive behaviour. The trust&#146;s findings show that far from enhancing the life of those patients, the drugs shorten life, they slow response, mobility and cognition, and they do nothing to treat the illness. That is to say nothing of the fact that the medicine safety experts state that patients suffering dementia are three times more likely to suffer a stroke if they are being given those drugs.</p>

three reasons for that: poor staff training, despite both guidance and support being given; under-resourced care homes that find it cheaper to sedate patients than to employ more qualified staff; and, underlying all of that, poor Government guidance and a failure rigorously to enforce the targets that are being set.</p>

I call on the Government to take action on both of them now. What specific action is the Department taking on the prescription of neuroleptic drugs&#151;or anti-psychotics&#151;covered in the Alzheimer&#146;s Research Trust study? A combination of atypical and typical anti-psychotics are listed in the report. Will the Minister give urgent consideration to the report&#146;s recommendation that their use be withdrawn when treating people with only mild cases of Alzheimer&#146;s?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07042029000675">In my first report on the subject, I called on the Government to reassess the national minimum standards for training care staff, and to start to offer staff an alternative to the application of a chemical straightjacket. Research published last year by the <i> British Medical Journal</i> emphasised that where staff are offered training and support programmes that focused on alternatives to chemical management, the proportion of residents taking anti-psychotic drugs can fall by nearly a fifth; it can fall by 19 per cent. More importantly, that fall is marked by no increase in behavioural problems. So why has there been no progress in this area? What more progress can be achieved?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07042029000676">Secondly, and more broadly, if the Government feel that they can ignore the contributions of an individual Member of Parliament producing reports in this way, perhaps they need to take note of the CSCI report and to take it more seriously. I called for more frequent and more thorough reviews of prescription procedures for these drugs in 2001, but that is still not happening six years on. The national service framework, which sets standards for the care of older people, particularly in respect of medication, said that reviews should be delivered once a year for the over-75s who are on four or fewer medications and once every six months for the over-75s on more than four medications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07042029000677">In 2005 the Department published &#147;Room for Review&#148;, which reported that only 8 per cent. of primary care trusts achieved the first target and only 5 per cent. the second. I take this opportunity to ask again what the Department has done to tackle the problem since &#147;Room for Review&#148;. This is a tragic case study of how best practice and target setting can prove useless without effective enforcement and determined leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07042029000678">Lack of enforcement and guidance brings me to my second concern about the scandal of elder abuse&#151;the continuing and well documented failure of the &#147;No Secrets&#148; guidance to provide thorough, professional and compassionate investigations into reports of abuse of those in care. &#147;No Secrets&#148;, which was widely welcomed, was published to establish local council social services as lead agencies in developing multi-agency codes of practice for the protection of vulnerable adults. Following from that were the equally welcome &#147;Safeguarding Adults&#148; protocols drawn up by the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The measures set out in &#147;No Secrets&#148; were supposed to be  <br>

implemented and completed in full by October 2001&#151;more than half a decade ago&#151;and &#147;Safeguarding Adults&#148; has been in circulation for nearly two years. Although I commend the good intentions behind the guidance and the protocols, I believe that more still needs to be done. We should be showing zero tolerance for abuse of vulnerable adults. Having lists of those who have abused is not adequate prevention; it is merely catching people after the event. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07042029000679">In the past five years, I and other hon. Members have come to the House to raise case after case in which &#147;No Secrets&#148; has failed. Earlier this month, listening to Radio 4, I heard&#151;sadly, but not to my surprise&#151;of three more cases in which &#147;No Secrets&#148; failed the very people it had been put in place to protect. The report arose from research undertaken by the BBC showing that one sixth of the 150 local councils in this country that are responsible for the arrangements fail adequately to safeguard the adults in their care. I shall take two of the cases highlighted by the BBC to illustrate once again how essential it is to do more to protect vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07042029000680">The first case is a story that I have heard far too often. An elderly lady fell and broke eight ribs after undertaking a simple task for which her home care worker should have been responsible&#151;the simple matter of turning on a light switch. The incident went unreported and unassessed by that home care worker, and even though he had clearly seen what happened, he did nothing about it. It was not until her son found her three and a half hours later&#151;she had not moved from her chair and was in a great deal of pain&#151;that the hospital was contacted. The lady died from her injuries two weeks later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07042029000681">It transpired that the son had made numerous complaints to social services both before and after his mother&#146;s death, but they were ignored. He later discovered that they had been lost by the local authority in its internal e-mail system. Eventually, when he went to the local government ombudsman, the ombudsman upheld his view that the council had let his mother down. The question remains, however: why did the lady&#146;s son have to push for an investigation when &#147;No Secrets&#148; should have put in place the very protocols and mechanisms necessary to trigger one?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07042029000682">During the radio interview, the Minister who has responsibility for this matter, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who is not present&#151;I can understand why&#151;said that &#147;this is not acceptable&#148; and that</p>
<a name="70420-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07042029000755"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;they are learning from their mistakes&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07042029000683">but how many more such cases must come to light before we truly have learned from the mistakes? A tragic, high-profile public case of the sort that convulsed the child protection in the 1990s, such as the Victoria Climbi&#233; case, should not be needed to trigger the changes that are necessary to put adult protection on the same statutory footing as child protection. &#147;No Secrets&#148; should have been implemented more than five years ago, but it seems that the most basic lessons have yet to be learned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07042029000684">The second case I want to mention is that of an elderly lady who was attacked and killed in a care home by another, younger, resident. The younger resident  <br>

had a history of mental ill health and physical violence, but the care home was not informed. The council still fails to admit its fundamental failings which allowed that to happen. &#147;No Secrets&#148; says it all, but the secrets are still being kept. Councils are clearly responsible for leading the sort of inter-agency work that is essential to uncovering the secrets and making a difference in people&#146;s lives. I repeat: &#147;No Secrets&#148; should have been implemented by 2001. What is being done to establish the necessary performance indicators by which councils can be made accountable for delivering what is set out in &#147;No Secrets&#148;? I am not alone in stating that &#147;No Secrets&#148; is not working, and that it needs legislative backing. Until it has that backing, councils will not deliver. In Scotland, and overseas in America, Japan and even as far away as South Africa, legal protections for vulnerable adults are being put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07042029000685">More than 10 years ago, the Law Commission produced a report on mental incapacity, which called for a reassessment of the legal protection offered to vulnerable people. It recommended</p>
<a name="70420-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07042029000756"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that local social services departments should be under a duty to investigate where they have reason to believe that a vulnerable person is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm or...exploitation&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07042029000686">and it recommended that courts be given powers to take necessary action in that regard. I congratulate the Government on introducing the Mental Capacity Act 2005; the differences that it will bring are to be applauded. However, they did not implement the proposals of the Law Commission when they had the opportunity, and that is a gap that still needs to be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07042029000687">There are a number of initiatives that still need to be taken. First, the Government need to reassess the use of anti-psychotic drugs in care homes. The use of that chemical straitjacket really has to end. Secondly, the Government must follow through with the recommendations of the Commission for Social Care Inspection report and raise the abysmal standards of medicine management that are all too common in many of our care homes. Thirdly, the Government must do more to make sure that the procedures of &#147;No Secrets&#148; are in not only place, but are being adopted and enforced, are making a difference, and are grounded in law. Fourthly, we need the Law Commission protections in place. Finally and most importantly, as I have said, we need &#147;No Secrets&#148; to be put on a statutory footing, because that seems to be the way to get the necessary action. Every child matters, but at the moment every older person does not seem to matter. That is not the message that should be sent from this House. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the concerns that I have raised, and that we can ensure that the next essential steps are taken to secure an end to the scandal of elder abuse in this country. Whether there are 500,000 cases of abuse or 1,000, there are too many, and it is time for them to end.</p>

crucial issue of elder abuse and the work that he has done on it. I bring apologies from the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis). The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will know that my hon. Friend takes a huge personal interest in the subject, and I have no doubt that he will read the proceedings in <i> Hansard</i> and will want to make his own response to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07042029000689">The Government endorse much of what the hon. Gentleman said and they are, of course, determined to root out abuse in all its forms. There is no room whatever in social care for those who would harm people or place them at risk and we have already done much to help to support that important idea, and I am pleased that he acknowledged that in his remarks. Everyone should feel safe, secure and well looked after, wherever they live, so that they are able to maintain their dignity at all times. We want vulnerable and older people to be treated with respect by everyone who works in social care. They must receive the dignity that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07042029000690">The Government are appalled to learn of terrible instances of abuse in institutional settings and in the community in the recent past. We acknowledge that in a small number of settings, things have been far from ideal. Obviously, abuse takes in a whole spectrum of behaviours&#151;at a basic level, it includes ignoring someone or speaking to them in an unfriendly way, and it goes right the way through to more extreme forms of abuse. Speaking from family experience, it is not uncommon&#151;let us put it that way&#151;for families to have some form of unhappy experience when a loved one is in a residential or nursing home. It has to be said that on the whole, the dedication of the individuals who work in care homes is outstanding and they give a great deal of attention and support to the people under their care. Sadly, however, there are too many instances of care that is not of the standard that we expect, which leads to some deeply distressing and upsetting incidents for the families concerned. This is therefore a rare occasion on which there is a cross-party commitment to work together to improve our systems further so that we make those incidents even fewer and further between, and remove them from our social care and nursing care system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07042029000691">The hon. Gentleman began by referring to the scale of the problem. When people begin to engage with the issue, they will discover that it is appallingly widespread and that there are far too many incidents a year for anyone to be comfortable with. He is right, however, that we do not have the robust level of information that Members of Parliament, councils and other authorities need to give due prominence to the situation. We are therefore extremely pleased to partner Comic Relief in a research project that looks at the abuse of older people who live in their own homes. We expect the results of that research to be published shortly. We are looking, too, at introducing a national collection of reports of abuse to local authorities. At the moment, information about reports of abuse varies across the country, so a single data collection would tell us how many investigations are carried out by each council. There are signs, as I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts, of improvement, but he is absolutely right to point out the issue as it underpins all the policy initiatives to which he has drawn attention. If we have  <br>

that sound evidence base it will make much of what he has called for more likely and more effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07042029000692">The Government are giving every consideration to measures that will effectively tackle the growing concern in our society about this matter. Older people and adults with disabilities have the right to expect that everything is done to minimise the risk of abuse. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will permit me to mention some of the things that the Government have done to help to deal with the problem. On 14 November last year, the Department of Health launched the first ever national dignity in care campaign. Our intention is to create a care system in which there is zero tolerance of abuse of, and disrespect for, older people, as well as a situation in which people are as outraged by the abuse of parents and grandparents as they are by the abuse of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07042029000693">The Department launched the protection of vulnerable adults scheme in July 2004. In short, the POVA scheme is a work force ban, and is one means of ensuring that known abusers who have abused or mistreated vulnerable adults in their care do not remain in the work force or find their way back into such positions again. POVA has significantly increased the level of protection for vulnerable adults. As at the end of March, 6,352 people had been referred to the scheme. I can update the hon. Gentleman: more than 1,009 individuals have been prevented from working in social care, with a further 1,300 provisionally listed, awaiting confirmation. The POVA scheme was set up under the Care Standards Act 2000. In some instances, standards of care are unacceptable and staff need to be disciplined or, in the case of managers, have their registration removed. Care workers in regulated settings prescribed by the Act&#151;adult placement schemes, care homes and domiciliary services&#151;must be referred to the POVA list when misconduct has caused harm or put people at risk of harm. As the hon. Gentleman will know, it is illegal not to do so. I acknowledge, however, that our analysis shows a significant proportion of POVA referrals do not result in people being placed on the list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07042029000694">To assist providers&#146; understanding of their responsibilities, the Department commissioned the Social Care Institute for Excellence to develop practice guidance to encourage referrers better to understand both the referral process and the information required to aid the POVA team to process referrals effectively. We believe that that will lead to better referrals. The guidance was published on the Department of Health and SCIE websites on 17 May 2006. If the hon. Gentleman is not aware of it, may I recommend that he look at it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07042029000695">I come to some of the specific issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. He rightly referred to the importance of people receiving the right medication in care homes. Indeed, he has produced his own report on the issue&#151;&#147;Keep Taking the Medicine&#148;. In February last year, the Commission for Social Care Inspection reported that about 88 per cent. of homes meet, or almost meet, the national minimum standards on medication management. However, we fully accept that work still needs to be done to improve on that. The Department acknowledges the findings in CSCI&#146;s follow-up study and is disappointed that care homes  <br>

have made little progress towards meeting the national minimum standards on medicines management since the last report in 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07042029000696">Through the National Prescribing Centre and Medicines Partnership, we have worked with several primary care trusts to identify what works best and to share that learning with others through the national Medicines Management Services Collaborative. Nearly half of all PCTs have participated in that programme to implement local medicines management schemes so that people get more help from their GPs, pharmacists and others in using their medicines.</p>

 I certainly will. If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I will also write to him with a fuller answer on the issue of anti-psychotic drugs, on which I do not have any specific briefing to give him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07042029000699">The hon. Gentleman asked about &#147;Room for Review&#148;, a guide to medication that was published by medicines partnership in conjunction with the Medicines Management Services Collaborative. That was followed up by the publication of the medication review for patients, which better prepares patients and enables them to ask the appropriate questions. Although the focus has been on older people, the principles apply to other patients, including those with learning disabilities. He asked what the follow-up has been since the publication of &#147;Room for Review&#148;. The national prescribing centre is currently working on an updated version to be published later this year. That will help to deal with some of the issues that he has brought to the House.</p>

Secrets&#148; is being implemented. I appreciate that that is different from his call for it to be placed on a statutory footing, which he has made on other occasions. This is the system that we have at present, and there is no reason why it cannot and should not be effective, given that it is reflected in the star ratings that councils receive. I am told that CSCI will also consider how local authorities are ensuring that directors of adult social services have the resources that they need to meet their adult protection responsibilities. Again, that will be reflected in their overall rating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07042029000701">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and those raised through the Association of Directors of Social Services and others, about financing the implementation of &#147;No Secrets&#148; guidance. That issue is on the Department&#146;s agenda, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will want to update the hon. Gentleman in due course as we further consider it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70420-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07042029000702">Usually, I would want to refer to further measures to reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are taking action on a range of fronts. However, given the time that remains, I shall just give a brief indication. Of course, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill has become the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which will bring into place the new vetting and barring scheme. As a former Home Office Minister, I think that it will have a huge beneficial impact right across our health, education and social care system in ensuring that timely and relevant information is put before employers so that they can make good decisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that will be a considerable step forward. Encouraging progress on the issue is being made and it will build on the principles of the protection of vulnerable adults scheme.</p>
