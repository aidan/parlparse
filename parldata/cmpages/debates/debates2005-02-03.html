 (Lab): What plans he has to extend debt cancellation to heavily indebted poor countries; and if he will make a statement.  [213424]
</p>


<p><a name="50203-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 For the G7&nbsp;Finance Ministers&#039; meeting, which takes place in London tomorrow and Saturday, the UK has put forward detailed proposals for 100&nbsp;per cent. multilateral debt relief for poor countries. We will discuss using International Monetary Fund gold and financing World Bank debt service payments. The aim is to bring to an end once and for all the tragedy of poor countries&#039; unpayable debt.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew0"><b> Ms Russell: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. Today, many of my constituents have travelled down from Chester to attend the &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; rally, which I believe will be addressed in an hour&#039;s time by the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. I am sure that all Labour Members welcome him to London. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] He is on record as calling for the world&#039;s richer countries to make a bigger contribution to helping the poorer ones achieve their millennium goals. What more does my right hon. Friend think that Britain can do to galvanise global action to eradicate poverty and debt throughout the world?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has taken a huge interest in these matters. All Members of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 974</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the House will want to welcome former President Mandela to London and to welcome his wife, Gracha Machel, who is joining him. I gather that he is speaking in Trafalgar square in only a few minutes&#039; time, which perhaps explains why so few Conservatives are here today. I had the privilege of meeting him yesterday, and he urged us to move forward with our proposals on debt relief and on the international finance facility. He speaks not just for the developing world and the emerging markets countries, but for a very large proportion of industrialised countries, which want a solution once and for all to the tragedy of promised debt relief not being given to the poorest countries.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Betts: </b> 
 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the tremendous lead that he has given on this issue on the international stage, but will he clarify two points? First, how can we guarantee that the money saved through debt relief will be spent on health and education, and not on more arms and luxurious lifestyles for some of the leaders concerned? Secondly, how would he provide the money for debt relief if, at the same time, he had to cut &#163;35&nbsp;billion from public expenditure?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. When I had the good fortune to be in Tanzania and to meet President Mkapa only a few days ago, he agreed that the additional debt relief that we are providing unilaterally to Tanzania will go directly towards financing secondary education, free of charge, to pupils in his country. When we signed a similar agreement with the Prime Minister of Mozambique the next day, she said that the money would be used for health, education and infrastructure development. If our proposals for Mozambique come off, debt as a share of its national income will fall from 6&nbsp;per cent. to 2&nbsp;per cent., and then to just 0.5&nbsp;per cent. That would be a major advance, because Mozambique is spending more on debt interest today than on education or health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-01_para0">
On the proposals of all parties in this House for dealing with the debt tragedy, I hope that the shadow Chancellor can say today that he supports us in providing the resources for debt relief, and that he would not cut his party&#039;s overseas development budget.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew4"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> 
: May I also congratulate my right hon. Friend on his personal commitment to this initiative, which will make an enormous difference to the quality of life&#151;and, indeed, the lives&#151;of millions of people? I know that he is keen to promote poorer countries&#039; access to trading systems, so that they can trade with markets such as ours. Does he accept, however, that although freeing up trade for such countries is very important, it is also important that they do not face unfair competition from rapacious producers in countries such as ours, who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would simply destroy their developing trading structures?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, who has also taken a huge interest in these matters, speaks for the millions of people in this country who are concerned about not just debt relief but trade justice. One proposal that we will advance at the G7&nbsp;Finance Ministers&#039; meeting is that, as we seek a solution during December&#039;s world trade talks in Hong Kong, we will make resources available to build up the capacity of such countries, particularly those in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 975</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Africa, to engage in trade in the international community on equal terms. By capacity we mean help with infrastructure&#151;road, rail and communication&#151;and with training and education. That would be an important advance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-01_para1">
My hon. Friend also rightly points to the key element of debt relief, and I am pleased to tell him that yesterday, Canada supported our proposals. Its Finance Minister stated that Canada wants 100&nbsp;per cent. debt relief, and I praise him for doing so. Every day, additional countries are saying that they are now prepared to support a final settlement to the issue of providing 100&nbsp;per cent. debt relief for multilateral debts owed to the IMF and to the World Bank.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew6"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b> 
 (LD): May I add my appreciation for the Chancellor&#039;s work on overseas development and debt, which may stand him in good stead when he is promoted to become the Secretary of State with responsibility for foreign affairs and overseas development?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-01_para2">
Specifically on tsunami relief, will he clarify the position? The Government have offered debt relief and debt cancellation, but the two countries that have applied are apparently being told that payments will be postponed and that interest will be fully capitalised and has to be paid in full. It has even been suggested that there will be interest on the interest. That is certainly not debt relief, let alone debt cancellation. If there is genuine debt relief, where in the public accounts is provision made for extra funding over and above the pre-existing Overseas Development Administration-Department for International Development budget?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes the issue of debt relief complex, but he is simply wrong. He is wrong because we told Indonesia that there would be a moratorium on debt interest payments until such time as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank complete the needs assessment. That assessment will be available this weekend, and we will then look again at the position of Indonesia, which already has a moratorium. We have to look into what more we can do. Indonesia has also been offered a very substantial loan from the IMF for emergency assistance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-01_para3">
For the second country, Sri Lanka, we have offered not only a moratorium on debt relief, but cancellation of the debts that the country owes to the World Bank and other international institutions. We have agreed that Sri Lanka, as a low-income country, should now join the list of 70&nbsp;countries eligible for debt relief. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would support that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-01_para4">
We have put money into the tsunami disaster appeal from the reserve and also provided extra money through tax relief on gift-aid donations. We have also provided tax relief on VAT requirements in respect of the national concert record and the CD that has been issued. No VAT will be charged as a result and we will give a similar payment to the appeal. Through public expenditure, debt relief and forgone tax revenue, we are providing substantial resources and we look forward to discussing with the World Bank president and the managing director of the IMF on Saturday what more we can do 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 976</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for what I hope we all agree should be a united effort among all the rich countries to help these two countries in difficulty.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew8"><b> Sir Peter Tapsell  (Louth and Horncastle)</b> 
 (Con): Did the Chancellor learn, perhaps on the bush telegraph while he was relieving debt in Africa, that the Prime Minister was planning to relieve him of his burdens at the Treasury here in Britain?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I might listen to the hon. Gentleman if he had ever got anything right. He was completely wrong when he opposed the independence of the Bank of England and he is completely wrong again.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b> 
 (LD): Can the Chancellor give the House an absolute assurance that essential services such as education in heavily indebted poor countries will not be damaged while the countries themselves are in the process of qualifying for debt relief? Surely we do not want to find ourselves facing the situation that we saw in Uganda where the Government introduced fees for primary education as a justification during the qualifying process.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must look at the facts. In Uganda, the number of children in primary education has risen from 2&nbsp;million to 6&nbsp;million and primary education there is free. If the hon. Gentleman considered Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa, as well as Uganda, he would find that attempts have been made to remove charges for primary education and health. What worried me most when I visited African countries was that fewer than 10&nbsp;per cent. of pupils were able to get secondary education and those who did had to pay fees. It is with respect to secondary education that the issue of fees arises. That is why we signed an agreement with Tanzania&#151;so that secondary education could be provided free of charge&#151;and why the World Bank has changed its position and is now opposed to user fees for primary and secondary education. I believe that our duty to those countries is to make it possible, through our proposals for the international finance facility, to finance both universal and free education and health care.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Tom Clarke  (Coatbridge and Chryston)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend pointed out very tellingly that something like 80&nbsp;per cent. of the poorest countries&#039; historical debt is owed to the international institutions. Does he agree that it is absolutely right of him to press the IMF to consider the use of its existing assets, including gold, as stability and growth in the developing countries is useful to those institutions as well?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has an honourable record in pushing this issue, and especially debt relief. The poorest countries in the world owe the IMF $12&nbsp;billion. If the IMF were prepared to revalue or sell its gold, that would be the best way of removing those countries&#039; liability. I believe that there is an understanding in most of the industrial countries that that is the best way to deal with the problem. I hope that, in the next few weeks, we will secure agreement among the G7&nbsp;member countries that that proposal can be

<br>&nbsp;<br>made to the IMF meeting to be held in Washington in April. It is to the credit of all parties in this House that time has been devoted to these issues today, but the important thing&#151;especially as we listen to people making their case in Trafalgar square and elsewhere&#151;is to get an agreement among the major countries.

<p>2. <a name="50203-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on current levels of personal savings.  [213416]
</p>


<p><a name="50203-02_spmin0"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b> 
 The savings ratio has risen over the past year. With individual savings accounts, the new child trust funds, the Sandler suite of stakeholder savings products available from April and an expanded pilot of the saving gateway for low-income savers, we are encouraging personal saving with new incentives, simpler products and better consumer information.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Is the Minister aware that, when the Labour party took office, it inherited a very healthy household savings ratio of nearly 10&nbsp;per cent., and a private pension sector that was the envy of the western world? Eight years on, household debt has reached a staggering &#163;1&nbsp;trillion, and the private pension sector is in crisis. What has gone wrong?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The savings ratio is about at the level of the early 1960s, and above its level in 1988, when the hon. Gentleman was on the Government Benches. It is much higher than it is in the US, and about the same as in Japan. As I said, it has risen in the past year, but we want to do more to encourage saving and to build a savings culture across the UK. The new child trust fund is an excellent example of that, and we have made welcome changes in respect of pensions. Across the board, we are doing what is necessary, but I emphasise that the UK&#039;s savings ratio is extremely healthy compared to the position in the US and Japan.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bill O&#039;Brien  (Normanton)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend accept that people now have more scope for saving than ever before, and that their quality of life is much better now than was the case under the Tories? Will he and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor ensure that Tory proposals have no chance to threaten those things, and that we are allowed to continue along the lines that have been set out?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I certainly will. My hon. Friend is absolutely right: there have been substantial increases in pensioner income since 1997, and the rate of increase has been significantly higher than that of earnings. That is extremely welcome, but we will also make sure that pensioners do not suffer from the very high rates of inflation and the 15&nbsp;per cent. interest rates that we had under the previous Conservative Government.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister appreciate that the Government&#039;s &#163;5&nbsp;billion pension tax has served to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 978</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>knock some &#163;100&nbsp;billion off the value of pension fund investments as well as costing them some &#163;40&nbsp;billion in accumulated income?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Turner commission pointed out that the impact of that change was comparable to the change introduced in the Finance Act 1986, about which we hear rather less from the Opposition. No party in this House argues that the change should be reversed, and I know that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the last thing that we should do is go back to the days of very high inflation and 15&nbsp;per cent. interest rates. Those conditions were very damaging, for pensioners and for everyone else.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that there would be a higher level of personal saving if banks had a better reputation among consumers? That reputation could be secured if banks did not charge people for taking money out of cash machines and if they did something about orphan funds&#151;such as investing them in overseas development.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 It is important, as the Treasury Committee has said, to build confidence in long-term savings. I look forward to giving evidence to the Committee shortly, specifically on the point about ATM charges made by my hon. Friend. We need to build confidence, and all the measures that we have taken, particularly the introduction of the Sandler suite of stakeholder products from April, will help the industry as a whole to build confidence among its customers.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Richard Spring  (West Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): Given the desirability of savings, not least to pay extortionate council tax bills, and given the view of the Association of British Insurers that there is an annual savings gap of no less than &#163;27&nbsp;billion, will the Minister limit the terrible damage that his taxes have done to pensions savings by ruling out any further tax grab on Britain&#039;s beleaguered savers?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I do not agree with a number of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments. The change in pension funds that he referred to was offset by the accompanying reduction in corporation tax. The impact of the change is about one tenth of the difference in performance between the best and worst performing pension providers. Pensioners and everyone in the UK have benefited enormously from the remarkable new stability that we have achieved in the economy since 1997, and our focus is on making sure that those benefits continue.

<p><a name="50203-02_spnew10"><b> Colin Burgon: </b> 
 I thank the Chancellor for his reply. What specific measures does he intend to propose to the G7&nbsp;to maintain economic stability and increase growth in the world economy this year?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He will know that in his constituency we now have the lowest interest rates, inflation and unemployment for many years. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Conservatives become restive when we talk about low inflation, low interest rates and high employment, because we did not have much of that when they were in power in the early &#039;90s. As for the G8, we will discuss not only the economic issues arising from the current account exchange imbalance but the path of global growth over the next year. It will be up to every continent to make a contribution to global growth and stability. The American President spoke last night in his State of the Union address about the need to cut deficits, and European Ministers will speak about the need to intensify economic reform. Japan will be asked to look at its financial sector and how it can reform so that it can play a part in achieving growth. The way forward for the global economy is for each continent to say this weekend at the meeting of the G7&nbsp;Finance Ministers that we will all contribute to higher growth levels in the world economy this year.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Francis Maude  (Horsham)</b> 
 (Con): Will the right hon. Gentleman spend a little less time worrying about other countries&#039; economic difficulties, because the reality is that if Labour wins the next election, he will not be Chancellor of the Exchequer? It is common knowledge that the Prime Minister has decided that he is unfit to be Prime Minister after him.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I would spend more time listening to the right hon. Gentleman if he had not spent all his time as shadow Chancellor predicting a recession in Britain. He should congratulate us, because we are the only major industrial country that has maintained consistent growth in the past seven and a half years of a Labour Government. That would not have happened under the policies that he advocated.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew14"><b> Ms Julia Drown  (South Swindon)</b> 
 (Lab): During our presidency, will the Chancellor tackle global poverty by raising the issue of looted assets. The United Nations estimates that $11&nbsp;billion has been looted by corrupt people from Kenya and Nigeria. Much of that money is in western banks in the developed world. There has been an initiative to try to tackle money laundering for terrorism and drugs. Could that be extended so that money can be returned to the poorest countries where it is most needed?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend will know, the question of looted assets from Nigeria is being discussed in some detail by the authorities. As for the general issue of action against terrorism and drugs, there will be a discussion about that at the G7&nbsp;meeting. We must agree to tighten up in every country the rules governing the treatment of those issues. I hope, over the course of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 980</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>year, that we will be able to secure a general statement from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on those matters.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew16"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): The Chancellor said that climate change would be one of his priorities for the G8. Is that just another example of his trying to lecture others when he does little about the issue at home? One of the most obvious things he could do would be to create a differential between unleaded fuel and other fuels, which would significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions. He does not do that. Is that because he is more interested in tax revenue than in the right policy?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The hon. Lady speaks for a party that when it was in government introduced an above-inflation rise in petrol, saying that it was doing so for environmental reasons. The minute we said we would continue with that policy, the Conservatives dropped their policy in its entirety. They said that they would support us on climate change yet they oppose the climate change levy. We shall take no lectures on the environment from the Conservatives.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew18"><b> Dr. Nick Palmer  (Broxtowe)</b> 
 (Lab): Will the Chancellor explicitly reject the suggestion from the Opposition Benches that we should take no interest in the economic policies of other countries? Does he agree that nowadays Britain needs more than ever to work with its partners in the European Union and across the world because the world is interdependent and our prosperity depends on it?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Brown: </b>

But how can he hope to put that vital topic on the G8&nbsp;agenda when his taxes and regulations have caused a drop of a third in Britain&#039;s productivity growth rate?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew21"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I just mentioned the shadow Minister for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deregulation who has congratulated us on our record on the economy&#151;[Hon.

That is the answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s question.

<p><a name="50203-02_spnew22"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 The Chancellor&#039;s concept of an answer is an interesting one. He did not mention productivity 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 981</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>growth rates, which are what my question was about. There is of course a reason why he did not mention them. Britain&#039;s productivity growth rate has been only 1.8&nbsp;per cent. a year over the last eight years, compared to a G8&nbsp;weighted average productivity growth rate of about 2&nbsp;per cent. over the same period. The Chancellor did not always avoid the subject. In 1998, he described productivity growth as

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a fundamental yardstick of economic performance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-02_para2">
I agree. So why, instead of leading the G8&nbsp;efforts to improve productivity, is he proposing to damage our productivity further by more regulation and more tax?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-02_spnew23"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman that he should look at the facts. Year on year, there has been productivity growth in the British economy. Year on year, there has been manufacturing productivity growth. That did not happen under the previous Government when productivity suffered negative growth. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to know about the comparison with other countries, we have closed the productivity gap with Japan, we have closed the productivity gap with Germany, we are closing the productivity gap with France and we are making inroads in the productivity gap with the United States. The reason that we are doing so is that we have achieved a level of economic stability in this country that his party could only dream of.

<p><a name="50203-03_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Total investment in Sure Start, child care, nursery education and children&#039;s services is expected to rise from &#163;7.3&nbsp;billion to &#163;9&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. That is to ensure that not just some children but every child has the best start in life.

<p><a name="50203-03_spnew0"><b> Lawrie Quinn: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend not only for that answer but for the incredible priority that the Government have given to such an important matter for the future of our nation. Last Friday, I visited a brand new children&#039;s centre in the Barrowcliff area of my constituency. Can my right hon. Friend tell the House how the ambitions for the people of east Whitby for a similar children&#039;s centre can be rolled out in the future? I hope that he will be able to continue with those policies so that those people can achieve what they really want.

<p><a name="50203-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has supported the creation of the Sure Start centre in his constituency. The number of Sure Start children&#039;s centres will rise from the 550&nbsp;that we have at present, to 2,500&nbsp;over the next few years. That major extension in the number of Sure Start centres has been made possible by the extra spending that we are proposing. The unfortunate thing, however, is that the Conservative party plans to cut that spending on those children&#039;s programmes.

<p><a name="50203-03_spnew2"><b> Rev. Martin Smyth  (Belfast, South)</b> 
 (UUP): We welcome the extra money for children&#039;s welfare. I take it that that money is spread throughout the United Kingdom, not just the English and Welsh economy. Given the presence on the Treasury Bench of a Northern Ireland Minister who is responsible for education, may I press the Chancellor to ensure that some of that money will go to help the homework clubs, which have been doing a lot to improve the welfare of children in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner), who is sitting on the Treasury Bench, has informed me that that is exactly what he plans to do, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to congratulate him in person.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ken Purchase  (Wolverhampton, North-East)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): May I congratulate the Chancellor on his excellent programme of alleviating difficulties for children, particularly with the Sure Start programme and its like? Does he agree that even more money could be spent effectively and that the source of that money may well be a windfall tax on the excessive profits of the banks? I suggest that he start with &#163;8&nbsp;billion&#151;the additional profit over the &#163;40&nbsp;billion that they recorded for last year.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Without the need for a windfall tax, we have managed to increase investment in those services by &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion over the next few years&#151;that is why my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency can look forward to something like three or four Sure Start centres&#151;but that would not have been possible without our decision to use this country&#039;s resources to invest in children. In the old welfare state, children and mothers received maternity services and vaccination, and they were then asked to appear for school at five years old. The range of services now available in Sure Start, day care, and nursery places, as well as all the help that is now available to mothers, shows that this is the new frontier of welfare policy, helping every child in this country.

<p><a name="50203-03_spnew6"><b> Tim Loughton  (East Worthing and Shoreham)</b>

The Conservative party supports the expansion and improvement of Sure Start, as he knows only too well, and I hope that he will not wish to mislead the House. I am sure that he would not want just to grab headlines without doing the figures first, so will he explain how he intends to increase the number of Sure Start centres from about 500&nbsp;to 2,500&nbsp;over the next three years&#151;a five-times increase&#151;when he has only doubled the amount of cash that he has given to that programme?

</p>





<p><a name="50203-03_spnew11"><b> Mr Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for championing the Sure Start programme in her constituency. She is absolutely right to suggest that there must be help with early learning and health services for the young child and the mother. One of the advantages of the Sure Start programme is that we get invited, sometimes as Ministers, to open those Sure Start centres. To see a Sure Start centre working, with all the parents and children directly involved in its running, is something that makes me proud of our Government&#039;s achievements.

 The hon. Gentleman well knows that our borrowing is sustainable. We have an excellent forecast record. For him to suggest for one moment that the Government need to learn anything from him or his party about borrowing is to live in cloud-cuckoo land.&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that today&#039;s borrowing at 35&nbsp;per cent. is way below that in 1996&#150;97, when it was 44&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product. He should remember that in every year since 1997&nbsp;and in every year of the forecast period, tax has been seen to be below that projected in the last Budget for which the Conservative party was responsible.

</p>





<p><a name="50203-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 I am afraid that that is true. That was the record of the last Conservative Government, under whom we saw some 3&nbsp;million people unemployed, double-digit interest rates and double-digit inflation. At the end of their period in government, they were paying more on the amounts that they had borrowed than they were on education. Conservative Members should be ashamed of that record.

 I always listen with care to anything that the hon. Gentleman says&#151;after all, he is Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.

Only two weeks ago, it said that the most recent public finances data were good news for the Government and that current receipts were on track to meet the Treasury&#039;s pre-Budget report forecast. Indeed, it said that current spending was moving closer in line with that outlined in the pre-Budget report. I listened to that with care, and the reality is that the Government have met their fiscal rules and will continue to do so.

 There is one answer both to the hon. Gentleman and to the former economic adviser. It is that the present Government with the present Chancellor have delivered 50&nbsp;consecutive periods of growth and seen the creation of 2&nbsp;million jobs, low inflation and low interest rates. A Government of which the hon. Gentleman was a member would see a return to double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates and&#151;yes, I am bound to say it&#151;boom and bust.

</p>


<p><a name="50203-04_spmin0"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey): </b> 
 This year, Government revenues from North sea oil and gas are expected to increase by about &#163;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion over Budget forecasts, largely because of increased oil and gas prices. However, the overall impact on public finances is likely to be more limited because of other direct and indirect effects of the higher prices.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 The industry estimates that the effect will be somewhat greater. Does the Economic Secretary agree that the best thing that we can do to ensure security of our energy supply and so that we do not become over-reliant on imported sources is to increase investor confidence, and that talk of a windfall tax&#151;or, worse, its imposition&#151;would destroy confidence at the very time that we need it?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-04_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 When making decisions on the North sea oil and gas taxation regime we attempt to balance a desire to promote investment with ensuring that the companies pay a proper price for the exploitation of a finite natural resource that is a national asset. When profits and prices are high, oil companies pay more tax. Next year, we expect oil companies to contribute almost &#163;6&nbsp;billion through North sea taxes alone. We have no plans to introduce a windfall tax on oil companies.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend will be aware that the Ofgem report produced last year suggested that one of the factors that had caused the increase in gas prices was that the companies all carried out their maintenance at the same time of the year, causing the spike. That resulted in windfall profits. If he is not prepared to go ahead with a windfall tax, will he consider encouraging those companies to put much more money into anti-fuel poverty measures?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-04_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 A number of the companies are making such contributions to relieving fuel poverty. I know that my hon.

 My hon. Friend is right to remind the House that one of the first things that we did on coming to office in 1997&nbsp;was to reverse the increase in VAT that the Conservatives had put on fuel.

 We have halved unemployment since we came to power&#151;that is the point of the new deal. More than 2&nbsp;million people have been helped and we have 2&nbsp;million more jobs in this country.

 Unemployment in Wales is now lower than it has been for 30&nbsp;years.

He should be congratulating us and saying that in future more resources go towards helping those who remain unemployed.

 There is VAT relief on certain goods sold by charities, including donated items and goods sold in connection with certain fund-raising events. Charities benefit from tax relief worth &#163;2.4&nbsp;billion a year.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew0"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 The Treasury has, rightly, been generous over the past few years in ensuring that VAT is returned on some goods&#151;for example, the Band Aid single&#151;and we did not see such generosity in the 1980s. However, there is injustice in one area. We have, rightly, made it possible for many museums and galleries to open their doors free to the public, which has dramatically increased the number of people going in, but some museums and galleries still have to charge VAT on admission. Will the Treasury consider that in the months to come?

<br>&nbsp;<br>following a long consultation on delivering the Government&#039;s policy on free entry to museums, one aspect of the arrangements that museums requested was the ability still to reclaim VAT.

<p>11. <a name="50203-05_wqn1"><b> Tony Cunningham  (Workington)</b> 
 (Lab): if he will make a statement on his recent visit to Africa.  [213425]
</p>


<p><a name="50203-05_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 In January I visited Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa and attended a meeting of the Africa Commission.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew2"><b> Tony Cunningham: </b> 
 For far too long the problems of Africa have simply been ignored, but not any more. A main reason why Africa has been pushed to the top of the political agenda is the passion and commitment of the Chancellor himself, and I pay tribute to him for that. I am sure that on his visit my right hon. Friend saw many of the problems facing Africa, but also the tremendous potential and promise of Africa. Could he say something about that?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I thought that all parties wanted to see debt relief and progress in Africa. I hope that the Opposition Benches will join us in wanting a solution to the debt problem and in taking measures that will unleash the potential of Africa. Over the past 10&nbsp;years many African countries have achieved greater economic stability than in the past, but they have not got growth rates similar to Asian economies. That is why it is important that once and for all we deal with the debt issue, support the private investment and trading opportunities that exist in many of those countries, and help countries that are asking us for help on transparency and macro-economic policy. That is why it is also important in December to have a solution to the trade round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para0">
From my visit to Africa I came away with the thoughts that, yes, there is massive and terrible poverty blighting the lives of millions, people suffering from HIV/AIDS in particular, but, yes, there is also potential. To harness it, however, requires a new partnership between the richest and poorest countries.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster)</b> 
 (Con): What was the single most important economic lesson that the Chancellor of the Exchequer learned from his trip to Africa last month?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 It is impossible for the countries that we&nbsp;visited to benefit from the opening up of trade unless&nbsp;they have the necessary infrastructure. If we cannot help them with the infrastructure in transport, communications and education in particular, it will not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 991</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be possible, even with the opening of trade, for those countries to move forward in both the African and world economies. I would have thought that there would be common cause on that. To make that happen we must deal with the fundamental problems that still exist from the 1980s. They are: the need for debt relief, to fund education where we can to help countries develop, and the need to get some relationship between rich and poor countries for the development of infrastructure. In particular, I saw young people wanting their economies to move forward. They need a better partnership than we have given them in the past. I hope that all parties can join in promoting that.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor knows, there is a need for genuine joined-up work between aid, trade and debt relief. He will have learned that in particular on his visit to Africa. In the past, where we have had debt relief and debt cancellation, it has not always had the impact that we have wanted because of interactions, such as collapsing commodity prices in large parts of Africa. In terms of what he proposes as possible for the G7&nbsp;and G8&nbsp;this year, can he demonstrate how, by bringing them together, he can ensure that debt relief means real debt relief with a lasting impact for the poorest people in those countries?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has taken a big interest in these issues. Eighty per cent of the debt that is now owed is owed to multi-lateral institutions. If they consistently require that interest payments be made over the next few years, most countries will be spending more on interest payments than on education or health. The agreements that we are making with individual countries, meaning that the money that would be paid in interest rates goes to education and health, are an important first step in helping economic as well as social renewal. There are also debts, interestingly enough, owed to Libya, Romania and eastern European countries. We must also find a solution to what is called the non-Paris Club debt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para1">
I believe that there is sufficient goodwill in the international community and I hope that over the next few months we all will urge all countries to reach a settlement of this issue, which is outstanding from the 1980s. That will make it possible for some of the countries that I visited and other countries to spend resources that they need to spend on tackling terrible and difficult problems of illiteracy, disease and suffering.

 How does the Chief Secretary answer the Treasury Committee&#039;s criticism that this is the fourth year in a row that the Treasury has overestimated tax receipts?

 The right hon. Gentleman well knows, and I believe that the Treasury Committee accepts, that our overall record on forecasting is good. As he knows from being in Government, corporation tax growth is only one element of receipts forecasts. Receipts from income tax, national insurance and VAT&#151;the three largest taxes&#151;have come in broadly as expected in Budget 2004.

<a name="50203-05_head0"><h3 align=center>European Union</h3>

<a name="50203-05_time0"><h5>12.31&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50203-05_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on prospects for the European Union in the next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para2">
Twelve months ago, I made several proposals to the House to improve the way in which the Government are held to account for the conduct of European Union business. One was the publication of regular White Papers on &quot;Prospects for the European Union&quot;, the first of which I published in April last year. As with the White Papers that I published on the EU constitution negotiations, I hope that hon. Members feel that the fuller and more timely information on EU business has helped to stimulate wider debate and discussion. Such discussion shapes and strengthens the Government&#039;s position in European negotiations. Consistent with the pledges that I made last year, I have published White Paper Cm. 6450, which sets out the prospects for the European Union in 2005. Copies have been available from the Vote Office since 9.30&nbsp;this morning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para3">
Let me highlight three of the main areas of work that the White Paper covers: enhancing prosperity across Europe and in this country; working together to tackle common threats to our security; and preparations for the United Kingdom&#039;s presidency of the EU in the second half of this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para4">
In the European Union, Britain is part of the world&#039;s largest common market of 450&nbsp;million consumers. That gives new opportunities to our businesses, greater choice and quality to British consumers and boosts jobs and growth here and across Europe. However, there is much more to do to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from that single market by pursuing further liberalisation and reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para5">
We will therefore continue negotiating a directive to liberalise services across the EU. Services account for approximately 70&nbsp;per cent. of the EU&#039;s output, but only 20&nbsp;per cent. of its trade. Creating a true single market in that sector would boost growth in the EU and improve the price, choice and quality of services on offer to businesses and consumers. The Government are also working for better implementation and enforcement of the financial services action plan, which offers great benefits in another sector where this country is especially strong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para6">
We are also working to ensure that EU law&#151;so vital for the operation of the single market&#151;is the most effective possible for business. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced 12&nbsp;months ago, the Government have been working closely with the Irish, Dutch and Luxembourg presidencies on regulatory reform in Europe. We have now extended that team work to include the Austrians and Finns, who follow us in the EU presidency next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para7">
I also greatly welcome the strong lead from Commission President Barroso, whose five-year plan published on 26&nbsp;January made it clear that better regulation is a priority for the new Commission. We will be working with the Commission to ensure that we have a better assessment of the impact of new proposals and systematic reviews of existing EU legislation.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 994</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para8">
The White Paper also highlights the continuing negotiations on the European Union&#039;s budget. The Government are working especially with Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden to ensure that future EU budgets are limited to 1&nbsp;per cent. of Europe&#039;s economic output and that that money is spent where it most adds value. We also continue to make it clear that the United Kingdom&#039;s budget abatement remains fully justified. We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in that area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para9">
As well as dealing with the economic aspects of our EU membership, the White Paper also sets out many areas in which our common work in Europe makes the United Kingdom safer and more secure. It shows how we are improving co-operation between police forces and other authorities so as better to tackle international organised crime and terrorism across national borders. It highlights our work to ensure that European measures to stop asylum shopping and to create a level playing field on asylum across the whole of the EU are properly implemented and evaluated. It also describes work on concluding readmission agreements with countries outside the European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para10">
The coming year will be an important one for the EU&#039;s crisis management and aid operations, which make a direct contribution to our own security. The largest European Union mission to date will help to build stability in Bosnia, under a British commander, Major-General David Leakey. EU police missions will continue to work in Bosnia, Macedonia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A new European defence agency, under a British chief executive, Nick Witney, will increase Europe&#039;s capacity more quickly to deploy effective forces in response to international crises and ensure that they can work better together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para11">
The Government will continue to play a leading part, along with our colleagues in France and Germany, in Europe&#039;s efforts to ensure that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes alone. What we have achieved to date, with Iran suspending the processes that could produce fuel for a nuclear bomb, demonstrates the value of this common approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para12">
The EU is the largest provider of development assistance in the world. As well as delivering Europe&#039;s contribution to reconstruction in the areas hit by the tsunami in Asia, we will work to strengthen the European Union&#039;s work to support Africa&#151;one of our key G8&nbsp;priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para13">
As I have mentioned, the United Kingdom will hold the presidency of the European Union from 1&nbsp;July this year. Our presidency will focus on the themes of security, stability and prosperity, both within the European Union and outside. Africa and climate change&#151;the priorities of our concurrent presidency of the G8&#151;will be important parts of that EU agenda. We will continue to push for economic reform and better regulation in Europe to deliver long-term improvements in growth. We will also steer preparations for the next stage in the world trade negotiations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para14">
This White Paper makes clear, as did its predecessors, the central importance for the United Kingdom of our work throughout, and with, the European Union. It also shows Britain delivering in Europe&#151;delivering because we are engaged with our partners on issues that no country can tackle alone. This Government are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 995</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proud to have put Britain back where we belong&#151;not carping from the sidelines, but a leading power in Europe. We are winning clear benefits for British consumers, British businesses and British families in areas that make a real difference to their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para15">
Through Europe, we are increasing Britain&#039;s power and influence in the world. Our approach has helped us to deliver the European Union&#039;s greatest ever enlargement and agreement to historic membership negotiations with Turkey, which will begin in October under our presidency. It has got us a European Commission that has made jobs, growth and better regulation a top priority. It has also got us European defence arrangements that work with, not against, NATO, and European co-operation on foreign policy that is again delivering significant results, not least those that we saw recently in Ukraine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para16">
Again thanks to this Government&#039;s approach, we have delivered a constitutional treaty that every other country in Europe is calling a great British success. I look forward to debating the facts of that treaty, not the myths of the Conservative party, in the months ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-05_para17">
Ten years ago, this country was isolated in Europe. Today, we are where we belong: leading reform in Europe and working together to enhance Britain&#039;s prosperity and power. That is the difference between this Government and those who want to detach us from Europe&#151;a difference that is clear from this White Paper. We are confident about Britain&#039;s future in Europe and determined to continue shaping that future in the interests of businesses and individuals across the United Kingdom. I commend the White Paper to the House.

<p><a name="50203-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Michael Ancram  (Devizes) (Con):</b> 
 I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and, I must say, for very short advance sight of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para0">
I am puzzled by the reasons for this statement. The publication of the first such White Paper on 20&nbsp;April last year was merely announced in passing by the Prime Minister in a wider statement explaining his somersault on the referendum. No detailed explanation was given to Parliament. Why is this statement needed today, particularly as the Foreign Secretary had nothing new to say? Is not the reason that the Government are involved in a taxpayer-subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para1">
The Foreign Secretary refers somewhat disingenuously in his introduction to the White Paper to stimulating
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;closer and deeper involvement of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the general public, in EU affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para2">
Can he explain how, in the course of that stimulation, the general public are to become more closely and deeply involved in European affairs? This document, replete&#151;extraordinarily&#151;with five and a half pages of a glossary of Euro-speak, is in truth designed to lull the British people into a false sense of security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para3">
Let me give one example. At page 5, the White Paper claims that the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 996</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;will make Europe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. easier to understand&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para4">
Yet the Government last week had to publish a commentary of 500&nbsp;pages to try to explain this easy and simple constitution to the British people. Who are they trying to kid?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para5">
One or two matters of detail arise out of this White Paper. Is there really a need for a &quot;new European Gender Institute&quot;, referred to on page 14, in paragraph 37? What on earth is wrong with our Equal Opportunities Commission? Is this not yet another example of unnecessary European interference and empire building? Will not this new institute duplicate work to be carried out by yet another new European institution, the human rights agency, to which paragraph 63&nbsp;refers?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para6">
While we are on that agency, why did the Commission, in its recent consultation paper, refer to it not as the human rights agency but as &quot;the Fundamental Rights Agency&quot;? What is the difference? Are the Government merely trying to hide the implications of the inclusion of the charter of fundamental rights, which they have tried so hard over the last few months to play down? Does not paragraph 51&nbsp;confirm a further encroachment of the EU into areas of fundamental national jurisdiction, namely matters of criminal justice? Does not that fly in the face of previous Government promises that such matters would remain outside Community competence?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para7">
At paragraph 56, does not the support of qualified majority voting in matters of immigration and asylum fly in the face of the Prime Minister&#039;s boast in 1997&nbsp;to the House, in relation to QMV, that

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we secured unanimity in all the areas where we wanted it, such as immigration&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 18&nbsp;June 1997; Vol. 296, c. 319.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para8">
Given that the Government have opted into every directive on asylum, is not the assertion in that same paragraph that the

meaningless?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para10">
At paragraph 81, the Foreign Secretary refers to the work that he was doing in Iran. Why is his view of Iran so different from that expressed by the President of the United States in his state of the union address last night? Has he taken into account, for instance, the reports in today&#039;s newspapers that Ukraine has in the past sold long-range missiles to Iran? While we are on the subject of Ukraine, why is the Foreign Secretary so lukewarm about Ukraine&#039;s attempts to open negotiations to become part of the European Union?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para11">
Paragraph 85&nbsp;deals with EU-China. Precisely what improvements in China&#039;s human rights record since Tiananmen square justify the Government&#039;s current support for the lifting of the arms embargo?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para12">
Page 11&nbsp;makes much of the Lisbon agenda. We have long warned that that agenda could easily become all about failed targets and today we see with regret how right we were. Halfway through the 10-year programme, little has been achieved and, as the White Paper itself acknowledges, the prosperity and productivity gap in relation to the United States is widening. In the White Paper, the Government describe that as &quot;falling short of expectations&quot;. In the &quot;EUobserver&quot; on 2&nbsp;February, Wim Kok described the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 997</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>goal of the agenda as &quot;a bridge too far&quot;. But was not Romano Prodi nearer the truth last October when he described it quite simply as &quot;a big failure&quot;? Yet the White Paper merely promises more of the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para13">
Is it not the case that the real engine of prosperity and growth is deregulation, competition and a genuinely free market? Is it not also the case that the social model acts as a break on that engine, and is that not why the EU is failing economically? Yet the White Paper offers a lot more talk and no action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para14">
The Foreign Secretary knows well that the prospects for the EU in the coming year will remain uncertain until the outcome of the EU-wide process of ratification of the constitution is known. Yet now we hear that the Government intend to put off the referendum in this country until the latest possible date next year. Prolonging the uncertainty can only be bad for the EU. Why do the Government not have the courage of their convictions and hold the referendum now? Why do they not realise that this country will have no part in the constitution, and begin to build an EU that will work for its peoples rather than its elites?

 The self-deprecating smile on the face of the right hon. and learned Gentleman as he mouthed his last point said it all. It was clear that not even he believes such nonsense. One reason why he does not believe it is that, as someone who throughout his political career&#151;until he became deputy leader of the Conservative party&#151;was an ardent supporter of Britain in Europe who not only voted for Maastricht but spoke up for it, he knows very well that Europe above all other issues has wrecked the Tory party and removed its prospects of power for well over a decade.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked why the statement was needed. I refer him to a statement I made early last year, when I told the House that in my judgment the British Government ought to be more accountable to the House for what they do in regard to European Union business.

I will tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman why we need QMV on aspects of asylum and immigration policy. Back in the early 1990s, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) signed up to a convention that became Dublin I. It had to be agreed unanimously and it was crazy to sign it, because, although it did not come into force until 1997, it was binding and prevented us from maintaining our bilateral agreement with France to return asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who had travelled through France.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para21">
There is no point in the Leader of the Opposition weeping about that decision, which was his responsibility. I tried to get the convention changed, but it took a very long time, because one or two countries proposed vetoing that change. QMV allowed us to make the change, and we now have returns agreements, and the same is true of the Eurodac fingerprinting convention. If the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes wants better to control immigration and asylum into this country, he must understand that we need co-operation with our European partners, a level playing field and, above all, to be able to change the law in our favour, but he is setting his face against all those things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-06_para22">
The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes asked about our position on Iran. In case he has not noticed, the British Government and the British Parliament are responsible for our foreign policy&#151;I noted the implication of his remarks. Every single decision that France, Germany and the United Kingdom have made has been endorsed unanimously by the governing body of the International Atomic Energy Agency, on which the United States and others sit.

Finally and most absurdly, the right hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that progress on Lisbon has not been as good as it should have been&#151;I am glad that he has read that section of the White Paper&#151;but then said that the European Union should secure more liberalisation, greater deregulation, better competition and a genuinely free market. What on earth does he think that the Lisbon agenda is about, if not deregulation, greater competition and a genuinely free market? Some people in the European single market are behind the action, which is why we have worked hard and successfully to get a Commission that represents our vision of the future and that will actively pursue the Lisbon agenda, which did not happen under the previous Commission.

Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), the EU now has a comprehensive arms control regime, which it did not have before.

The hon. Gentleman says that the United States complains that Iran has withheld information; so do we.

 My right hon. Friend referred in his statement to economic issues, but did not mention the most serious economic problem in Europe. I mean the weakness of the eurozone, which exhibits continuing low growth and high unemployment. It is evidence of serious mistakes in macro-economic policy and problems can only be exacerbated by the recent strengthening of the euro in relation to the dollar. That underlines, I believe, Britain&#039;s wisdom in staying out of the eurozone, but does my right hon.

 The generalisation about the alleged weakness of the eurozone disguises very significant variation within different member states, ranging from countries that are doing very well to those that are not doing well at all. It is important that my hon. Friend bears that in mind. It is true that some countries in the eurozone have serious structural problems connected with the inflexibility of their labour markets, which is holding back growth. Other countries, however, have seized the opportunities provided by greater transparency of the euro and are doing very well indeed. The generalisations are dangerous. My hon. Friend will also know that in Germany, the largest single economy in Europe, Chancellor Schr&#246;der and Vice-Chancellor Fischer have courageously embarked on a major programme of economic and social reform.

That is what that Labour-dominated Committee found. Will the right hon. Gentleman accept that Hertfordshire, my own county, and other counties do not want to become a concrete wasteland to be known as &quot;Prescottshire&quot;?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on that carefully manufactured soundbite, but that is about all that I can say for his contribution. As for the proposals announced by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, I can tell him that two thirds of all new dwellings in England in 2002&nbsp;and 2003&nbsp;were built on brownfield sites. That compares with 56&nbsp;per cent. in 1997. The intention is to use existing brownfield sites wherever possible, and to protect the green belt. We also intend to proceed with more affordable housing by using Government land where possible, so that the main cost borne by homeowners is the cost of their home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-10_para2">
That approach compares with Conservative proposals to cut the funding for housing massively, as part of the &#163;35&nbsp;billion in cuts that they hope to make. The hon. Gentleman ought to reflect on that, as voters in the south-east and elsewhere will have to decide between a Labour Government who invest in new housing, mostly on brownfield sites, providing opportunities for new homeowners, and a Conservative party that would cut all that support, and take it away from first-time buyers in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-10_para3">
On the Northern Ireland elections Bill, we would like to publish it as soon as possible. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is a matter for discussion through the usual channels, and that it is being discussed in the House of Lords at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-10_para4">
I agree that the IRA&#039;s statement is very regrettable, but it would be &quot;premature&quot;&#151;to quote the hon. Gentleman&#151;to start reconfiguring the infantry in Northern Ireland. It is very important to keep the peace process on track, and I hope that Opposition Front-Bench Members, for once under their current leadership, will back the Government in that regard. That would contrast with their usual practice of continually undermining and sniping away at the peace process.
</p>

On the Public Administration Committee report, the Government will give a response in due course.
</p>

<a name="50203-10_para6">
The hon. Gentleman will know that there was an argument about the Constitutional Reform Bill, but that that was resolved satisfactorily in the end. Indeed, he and I had a constructive conversation about the matter. However, I remind him that, on the second day in Committee, no Conservative Member was present at one stage of the debate. It is therefore very hard to tell quite why there was such a hoo-hah about providing extra time, given the sheer indifference among Conservative Members to that important matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-10_para7">
The hon. Gentleman asked about the European Scrutiny Committee. He will know that the Committee reconsidered the matter last week. I understand that the vote was tied, with 12&nbsp;hon. Members voting. After that, the Chairman voted and it was decided that the Committee should meet in private&#151;at least for some sittings. The Committee meets in public when it takes evidence, and I have attended in various capacities to give evidence to the Committee. The evidence that I gave was always on the record, and given in public.

The hon. Gentleman asked about the Environmental Audit Committee report, and suggested that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister had transgressed the normal protocols. As I understand the matter, that did not happen. I am advised that he was responding to a report of a leak when the question to which the hon. Gentleman referred was put to him. I think he is entitled to do that. If he or any other Cabinet Minister is challenged on the record by journalists, of course they cannot remain silent in the middle of any story that is beginning to run. It is interesting that instead of concentrating on the substance of the policies and arguing their merits&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman is asking about policy issues in the context of a lot of processy stuff. It is interesting that Conservative Front Benchers are always obsessed with process, never the issues or the policies.

<p><a name="50203-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):</b> 
 Yesterday, we had a very good debate about the excellent local government finance settlement for next year, but a number of issues require further explanation, so could my right hon. Friend find time for a debate in which I could ask about a possible &#163;4&nbsp;billion cut in local government expenditure? As police, education and social services are protected, a cut would surely mean that houses would not be repaired, potholes would not be filled in, litter would not be collected, street lights would be left off, sports centres closed and libraries shut down. That may be the world that the Opposition want to live in, but I am sure that it would find no favour among Government Members.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am absolutely sure that my hon. Friend is right. Whether it is cuts that would devastate communities such as his own and others across the country, or the &#163;35&nbsp;billion of cuts that Conservative Front Benchers are triumphantly proclaiming, everyone understands that they would destroy public services and take us back to high unemployment, economic risk, high interest rates and all the devastation that that would bring.

<p><a name="50203-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 A free vote on precisely what? The last time there was a vote on the composition of the House of Lords there was no agreement on any of the options put before the House. The debate was the result of considerable consultation and preparation. As for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s objective of a reformed and democratically constituted House of Lords, I share the general principle of that objective, although not necessarily the details. I am on record as doing so, and have voted accordingly. There is therefore no surprise about the proposal or anything new in it. If we are to achieve a consensus, as the Prime Minister wants, that will allow us to move forward and resolve the matter, we must work at it rather than simply springing a vote on the House. I therefore advise the hon. Gentleman to wait and see how matters progress, especially after the general election.

As to whether there is time to consider the remaining stages of the Identity Cards Bill on Thursday, that was discussed by the usual channels, and it was agreed to hold the debate then. There is no question of truncating the discussion. How could the Government seek to truncate a discussion about the Bill, when it has been raging in the media? The Bill itself has been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny and detailed consideration in Committee. It is a major item, and it has been agreed on this occasion, as we have agreed on other occasions, to discuss it on a Thursday.

As for the report on identity cards published by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we will obviously study it in full. We welcome the Committee&#039;s view that article 8&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights does not prevent the issuing of any form of identity card&#151;that is the key point. Currently, 21&nbsp;of the 25&nbsp;European states have identity cards. It is only the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latvia and Denmark&#151;which has a national identity register&#151;that do not. That underlines the point that there is no incompatibility between the Bill and the convention. People have concerns about identity cards, and the Home Secretary and the Government as a whole will wish to consider some of the issues raised by the Joint Committee. I do not, however, accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s central proposition.

Friend give us an assurance that primary legislation will be introduced after the consultation? More particularly, bearing in mind the fact that the consultation ends on Friday 6&nbsp;May, if there is a general election in the meantime, can we be sure that enough work will have been done to introduce primary legislation at an early stage in the new Parliament?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The House is grateful for the consistent attention that my hon. Friend has paid to these matters. He welcomed the Government&#039;s introduction of the Road Safety Bill, and he will be aware of the written ministerial statement by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) today. The consultation paper sets out tough new proposals to reform the framework of offences dealing with bad driving, and seeks to address public concern, which he has ventilated, about the courts&#039; ability to deliver justice, particularly when a death is caused by careless driving, death occurs involving a driver who should not have been on the road in the first place&#151;such drivers may be disqualified or may not even have a licence&#151;or when serious but non-fatal injuries are sustained by victims. We are addressing all those issues, and we will continue to do so, I hope, with my hon. Friend&#039;s input in the debate.

 My right hon.

As there is a perception that the policy is Treasury-driven and an attack on vulnerable people, will my right hon. Friend, in a spirit of fairness and equality, ensure that the Chancellor comes to the House to assure us that the same focus, resource and importance will be given to those who avoid paying tax in this country and whose tax burden falls on honest taxpayers?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Obviously, the Chancellor, laser-like, constantly seeks to get rid of tax avoidance or tax fraud and has devoted considerable attention to that. However, as my hon. Friend rightly says, the proposals on incapacity benefit are meant not to be punitive but to provide people who have been on incapacity benefit&#151;some for a long time&#151;with the opportunity to work, which everybody wants, and to fulfil their duty to society in some cases. In the south Wales valleys, I have seen for myself examples of exciting pilot programmes. In many cases, hundreds of people have come off incapacity benefit and gone into jobs, which they never imagined having the opportunity to do. With that individual support, which is costly, and with the incentives to come off IB and go into work, everybody is better off: society, because the benefit bill is lower; those individuals, because they gain the dignity and opportunity of work; and businesses with vacancies, which have those vacancies filled. That is win-win for everybody concerned, which is why we are so determined to take this forward.

 It is indeed important, and I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman raises.

Indeed, because of some anomalies that have crept in&#151;I shall refer to them in a moment to explain where I think we are&#151;the decision was taken to launch the independent Atkinson review. That decision was taken by the national statistician, not the Government: he himself said that he needed some independent advice. For example, under current measures of productivity, if we decrease class sizes, increase the quality of teaching and improve exam results, the statistics show a fall in productivity. If someone dies, that shows an increase in health productivity. Furthermore, 40,000&nbsp;fewer people dying early from cancer and heart disease do not show up in the statistics at all. We have to try to make those assessments impartially, and the ONS, especially under its current leadership, is renowned for that robust independence. I am sure that the hon.

<p><a name="50203-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 This is obviously a serious point, and given my hon. Friend&#039;s expertise and background, I am sure that the House will want to take particular note of it. He has the opportunity to apply for a private Member&#039;s debate on the issue, and I hope he will avail himself of that opportunity. I cannot promise him an early debate, but it is vital that such issues are addressed.

<p><a name="50203-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 May I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the state of British manufacturing industry? In my constituency on Monday, a manufacturer of trailers, Crane Fruehauf, closed its doors. The administrator was brought in and 345&nbsp;employees were made redundant. As the right hon. Gentleman will understand, that has had a devastating impact on the small market town of Dereham. Obviously, that situation came about for many reasons, but is there anything that the Government can do in the short term, through the offices of the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Trade and Industry, to help the workers who have been made redundant?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-12_para0">
Secondly, it seems that the company, like many others, was having great difficulty exporting, owing, among other things, to the high level of fuel tax on lorries. It seems to me that that is unfair competition, compared with many of our European partners.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will want to pay careful attention to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, especially given the importance of the matter in his constituency. For the benefit of his constituents and the House, I remind everyone that Jobcentre Plus provides an enormous range of support for those who, unfortunately, face redundancy. There is also a rapid response service when additional support is necessary, which has made its services available to more than 112,000&nbsp;people facing redundancy. Unfortunately, manufacturing, more than almost any other sector of the economy, is subject to enormous global pressure and a certain amount of churning and changes in jobs. However, it is important to put it on record that last year manufacturing created &#163;150&nbsp;billion of our wealth; 3.5&nbsp;million people earn their living directly from the sector; and it accounts for more than half our exports and three quarters of our business research and development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-12_para1">
There is a thriving manufacturing sector and it is important that we continue to invest in science, skills and other support for it, but obviously I am

 Has the Leader of the House had time to look at early-day motion 579&nbsp;signed by 77&nbsp;Members?
</p>





<p><i>[That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2004 (S.I., 2004, No.&nbsp;3372), dated 17th December 2004, a copy of which was laid before this House on 22nd December, be annulled.]</i>
</p>

The motion reflects deep concern about the local government pension scheme regulations. He will be aware of the huge concern among public sector workers who believe that they are being given very little time for debate. May we have an urgent debate on the matter?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern, which she is not alone in expressing. The changes that she describes, which will come into effect in April, are necessary as part of a wider package that the Chancellor announced to reduce pressures on local authority budgets, thus helping to protect front-line services and, crucially, to keep council tax increases&#151;which she is concerned about, as we all are&#151;under 5&nbsp;per cent. in the coming year. If those changes are not implemented, local government would face increasing pension costs of about &#163;300&nbsp;million per annum over the next three years, which could involve cuts in services, front-line jobs and pressure on council taxes. These are difficult matters, but her concern is being taken into account.

 Following last night&#039;s statement by the Provisional IRA, does the Leader of the House feel, as I do, that we have heard just about everything from that organisation&#151;an organisation that has butchered our fellow citizens for 25&nbsp;years, rejected the Government&#039;s comprehensive agreement and instead carried out the biggest bank robbery in British history, and now has the bare-faced effrontery to say that the Government have tried the IRA&#039;s patience to the limit? Has he seen early-day motion 463, which calls for the withdrawal of privileges from Sinn Fein-IRA in the House?
</p>





<p><i>[That this House notes with concern the statement by the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland that the IRA were responsible for the raid on the Headquarters of the Northern Bank in Belfast when in excess of &#163;26&nbsp;million was stolen; recalls the Prime Minister&#039;s assertion that the IRA and Sinn Fein are inextricably linked; believes that this act of criminality proves that Sinn Fein cannot be treated like a normal democratic party; and calls upon the House to immediately withdraw all privileges from Sinn Fein honourable Members.]</i>

 I raised with my right hon. Friend some weeks ago ATM charging in poor areas of the city of Glasgow and areas with a high elderly population. I have subsequently found more information on that subject. Is he aware that a charge is made at 78&nbsp;per cent. of all ATMs in post offices throughout the country? Those charges are made only in areas with low employment and a high elderly population where many people are on benefits. Is it not time that he called a debate in the House to try to get the banks&#151;in particular, the Alliance & Leicester and Hanco, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland&#151;to stop the disgraceful act of charging the poor and the elderly, as well as those who live outside a main city or town?

It would be very helpful if I could secure a private Member&#039;s debate, in which other hon.

As he says, the poorest and some of the oldest citizens, who do not have cars or the ability to go to a free ATM, are most punitively hit by such behaviour.

Is he aware that, perversely, under regulation 23&nbsp;of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2003, each member who is not registered is liable to a fine of up to &#163;1,000?

 Next week, I hope to attend an important conference on the future of Muslim youth in Europe. Does the Leader of the House accept that constructive events such as that are not helped by the use of racial or religious stereotyping in election propaganda campaigns? May we therefore have a debate on that subject on a free vote? The debate could be opened by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the script could be written by the secret committee that includes Alastair Campbell and various close friends of the unlamented Jo Moore. However, by allowing a free vote, people like the right hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I share with you the latest vivid example of how the Government are making a mockery of Parliament?

The Halliday review, which was commissioned by the Government into road traffic offences involving bad driving, is highly relevant to what the Committee is discussing.

<p><a name="50203-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b> 
 I am astonished by the brevity with which the Minister has started this important debate. Our debates on programme motions often have the qualities of a choreographed Greek chorus, with outrage expressed by the Opposition about the nature of the motion and the Government saying that their predecessors behaved in precisely the same way, but I submit that today&#039;s motion is an outrageous abuse by the Executive of their programming powers. I shall explain why I think so and invite colleagues on both sides of the House to vote against the motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para2">
The Bill, whose Report stage is next Monday, was described by the Government during the debates on the Gracious Speech as a &quot;flagship Bill&quot; and Ministers have made it clear that they attach the greatest possible importance to the legislation. The Minister will confirm that the Opposition have behaved in a classically responsible manner when discussing the Bill on the Floor of the House. On Second Reading we set out those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1025</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>aspects that we supported and those about which we had reservations. Furthermore, no programme motion was required in Committee: we agreed with the Government through the usual channels that eight sittings would be acceptable, although we would have liked more. We said that, in so far as it was within the power of Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition to report the Bill at 7&nbsp;o&#039;clock on the appropriate evening, we would do so, and the Bill was reported within 90&nbsp;seconds of that time. Almost all the key clauses were discussed, and the Opposition&#039;s approach was at all times constructive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para3">
We asked for two days on Report precisely to prevent what is now about to happen on Monday. The first knife in the proposed motion will fall one and a half hours after the debate starts on the provisions dealing with religious hatred. Those provisions might be acceptable to the House, and with good will on both sides we might be able conclude our discussions on that topic within the allotted time.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 I shall be interested to hear why my hon. Friend believes that an hour and a half would be remotely sufficient to discuss a subject as important as religious hatred, given that all hon. Members, I am sure, have received anguished letters from constituents on the subject and Report provides the only opportunity for those who did not have the privilege of being members of the Standing Committee to debate such matters. Will my hon. Friend reconsider his comment, albeit that it was an attempt at generosity on his part?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 Despite the fact that what he says is true, I invite my right hon. Friend to listen to my comments on all the other aspects of the programme motion and to consider, in the spirit of the good will that the Opposition are trying to engender, whether one and a half hours to debate religious hatred might be sufficient.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para4">
The second topic of discussion is intercepts. It is dealt with in a new clause, which has attracted support from hon. Members of all parties. Although it was discussed only briefly in Committee, it is a key provision that abuts on a subject of great concern across the House&#151;those people who are currently locked up in jail and are outside the criminal justice system. An authoritative argument has been made that the use of intercept evidence in court could enable those people to be brought back within the criminal justice system. Acres of print have been published on the subject and it has been discussed on every television channel. It relates to the question of house arrest, and to our liberties, yet under the programme motion we shall be able to discuss it for only half an hour. It will take me almost all that time to move and explain the new clause that stands in my name. If the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who has tabled a perfectly reasonable amendment to the programme motion, were to succeed in persuading the House to accept it, the House will have absolutely no time at all&#151;zero minutes&#151;to discuss the important question of intercepts.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire) (Con):</b> 
 To clarify the argument that my hon. Friend is making so 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1026</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>powerfully and convincingly, let me say that we anticipate at least two votes when the first knife falls, and that they will probably take half an hour.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Even if the amendment to the motion is not accepted, the maximum time available to us will be half an hour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para5">
The topic has not been debated on the Floor of the House. It has been the subject of heavyweight reports by Lord Lloyd and Lord Newton. The report of a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament, including senior Privy Councillors from both sides of the House, made it clear that intercept evidence should be discussed and preferably agreed upon by Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bill Wiggin  (Leominster) (Con):</b> 
 I am perplexed. Can my hon. Friend think of any reason why the Government want such a tight programme, and why we should not be able to discuss such an important issue of liberty for a little longer?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to stress the importance of the issue. It has been widely discussed outside the House, but we are not to have time to discuss it in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para6">
The next subject of the knife is our debate on animal rights terrorism&#151;a matter of great importance on which my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) has produced much good work. During our constructive debates in Committee, he won some concessions from the Government, as did the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). I have just come from an on-the-record meeting with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), who is considering aspects of the Bill, and I understand that some matters have not yet been decided. Our approach has been constructive, but the Government are proposing to allow only half an hour if there are two votes after the preceding debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para7">
The next group of provisions relates to the Opposition&#039;s concerns about the nature of a constable. Under the Bill, regardless of their training, every officer of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, whose creation we support, could have the powers of a constable&#151;that is, powers of arrest. This is a serious matter of principle, and again, of liberty, because it changes the nature of police powers to which this country has adhered for more than 400&nbsp;years. If the Government want to make that change, they have the right to do so&#151;if they can win a vote in the House&#151;but to allow only a half-hour debate on it is wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-15_para8">
The final knife before Third Reading falls on the debate on behaviour in the vicinity of Parliament square, which is another important aspect of the freedom to protest. As I said, I have come from a meeting with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, who was extremely helpful on the Committee. I pay credit to the hon. Lady. She is still considering whether a change should be brought before the House on Monday on the way in which the issue of Parliament square is handled. This is a matter of concern across the House. There are divisions in all parties on the subject, and it needs to be dealt with on the Floor of the House. Nothing has yet been tabled by

<p><a name="50203-16_spnew0"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend may not know that today I tabled some modest amendments to that part of the Bill, partly because I think the Bill could do with improvement, and because considerable discussion is merited on an issue of the greatest importance not just to the House, but to all citizens. Notwithstanding what the Government may or may not do to their own Bill, I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that my amendments will deserve substantial debate.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 I have indeed read my right hon. Friend&#039;s amendment, which reduces the cordon sanitaire from 1&nbsp;kilometre to 200&nbsp;metres&#151;

&#151;to 200&nbsp;yards. It is an interesting amendment, and I can tell my right hon. Friend that the Government are considering it. They are taking a responsible attitude and trying to work their way through the problem. However, it is outrageous that the Executive should come to the legislature and tell us that we can have only half an hour to discuss the matter on the Floor of the House&#151;along with all the other issues, on which we are being allowed only half an hour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para0">
That is ridiculous. It is a Government abuse because they have a large majority and can win votes. They should not be able to stifle debate. This place works on the basis that we have a right to be heard. If the House can spend 700&nbsp;hours discussing foxes, surely we can have two days on Report and Third Reading on the Government&#039;s flagship Bill. If the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) looks back at the record&#151;I speak as a former senior Government Whip&#151;she will see that no Tory or previous Labour Government ever behaved in such a draconian way by curtailing discussion as the motion does. The motion is an insult to every hon. Member, and to those who send us here and pay us to represent them. Above all, it makes a mockery of scrutinising legislation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government drafted the programme motion and published it this morning, they were unable to take into account the amendments that I tabled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para4">
My amendment seeks to find half an hour in a hectic programme to discuss what I consider to be an important issue. I was not privileged to be a member of the Standing Committee. The Committee considered the transfer of the Royal Parks constabulary to the Metropolitan police, but it did not address the individual rights of members of staff who are to be transferred. If we in the House have any role, our prime role is to protect the rights of the individual, whether they be constituents or others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para5">
The Royal Parks police consists of 141&nbsp;officers, of whom 42&nbsp;are members of a trade union, the PCS. Those members of staff, who have served loyally in the royal parks and were commended in Committee for their work, will lose their right to be members of a trade union when they are transferred to the Metropolitan police. They will also lose the value of their pension&#151;estimated at about a 30&nbsp;per cent. loss. There was no debate about that in Committee, because I do not believe that many hon. Members understood the implications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para6">
I can find no opportunity for debate on Monday, except in the last section of the programme, when many other issues will be debated. As the relevant clause is clause 144, it is unlikely to be reached. We are breaching the fundamental human rights of the individuals in question. When we discussed GCHQ and the protection of the right to become a trade unionist, the Government were clearly committed to those human rights. The measure will also affect the future standard of living of those members of staff, and that warrants a debate. For that reason, I have suggested that we give a small amount of time&#151;half an hour&#151;one third of the way into the programme so that we can deal with the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para7">
If we cannot amend the programme motion in that way today, I urge the Minister to take the matter back to her colleagues. It has not been addressed, and I urge her to give sympathetic consideration to the amendments that I tabled and make a statement on Monday about how the Government propose to address this important matter.

<p><a name="50203-16_spnew5"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) illustrates how chaotic the programme motion is. It is still possible to table amendments today, and the Government&#039;s programme motion does not take into account the issues that Back Benchers may want to raise. The problem with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment is the priorities that the Government have set and the time that they have allocated. The business in the first one and a half hour debate is highly likely to provoke two votes, which will take almost half an hour. Accepting the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment means that we would have no debate on intercept evidence, which is extremely important. That is frustrating and worrying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para8">
The Procedure Committee presented a report that aimed to improve the way programming works, and to provide encouragement through the usual channels to produce a consensual programme that would fit most of the business in. Sadly, on the advice of the Government, the House rejected the report. As a fall-back from the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1029</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Procedure Committee&#039;s proposals, the Government would have to use the guillotine process. The report was an attempt to force the Government to recognise the need to build an understanding throughout the House of what should be in the programme. Having rejected that, the Government have become addicted to managing the business for their own convenience, not for the effective scrutiny of legislation nor for effective debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-16_para9">
The programme motion does not allow enough time for adequate scrutiny of fundamental matters such as intercept evidence and the whole new area of vital legislation on animal rights extremists and the effect of their activities on people&#039;s legitimate right to carry out their business. The future of Parliament square is bound to be controversial, so all the remaining topics will receive no consideration. The Government have failed to protect the business so that Back Benchers have an effective and adequate input. Yet again the Government are passing the buck to the other place to scrutinise the legislation. I urge them to recognise the error of their ways, withdraw the programme motion, acknowledge the need for more time on Report and Third Reading, and come back with a far more thought-out proposal.

The Minister has perpetrated an outrage today.

We are seeing evidence of an elective dictatorship. That is exceptionally serious. Programming is bad enough. It is happening with every Bill, and it is happening without proper and adequate consultation&#151;but this is a programme too far. In his admirable speech, my hon.

But the fact of the matter is that the Government are ignoring Parliament, sidelining it and treating it with derision. We were all sent here to play a part in holding the Government to account and in scrutinising legislation that is put before us. It is a duty that we cannot perform if this programme motion is voted through. It will be impossible to debate adequately any of the subjects that the Bill touches upon.

There was a time when someone came into the Chamber, or its predecessor, pointed to the Mace and said, &quot;Take away that bauble,&quot; and Parliament was suspended.

Most people in this House will accept that I try to behave as a House of Commons man: I seek consensus where it can be found. I hope that I am independent-minded on most subjects.

Frankly, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) was over-generous to the Government.

Yet the Government announce peremptorily in the programme motion, &quot;No, you will have only a limited amount of time on this because we, the Government, see it that way.&quot; That eloquently states the narrow relationship between the Government and the House.

In the good old days when there was a proper relationship between the Government and the House, that last matter alone might have taken a day&#039;s debate.

That is a very serious matter, and one on which I am sure that we all have a view, because it touches on the fundamental rights of our citizens. Yet the Government have apparently dismissed it as worthy of little discussion or deliberation.

That is just one relatively small example.

<p><a name="50203-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell: </b> 
 One extremely good example of what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough is saying is the issue that was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)&#151;Parliament square, in which respect even now the Minister is refining the Government&#039;s proposals. She is actually doing a good job in trying to reach consensus on this difficult issue, but if she returns to the House and wants to win its support, she will not be able to do so because there will not be enough time for her to take account of opinion, listen to what is said and explain her proposals.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 It gets worse. No doubt at some stage some Minister will stand up and say that the matter was fully canvassed in Committee. We all know what happens in Standing Committees nowadays. There are knives, the Government majority are compliant and silent, and Opposition Members are prohibited by the time scheduling from expanding the points of view that many members of the public wish to hear debated and considered. It is no good the Government saying that the matter was adequately discussed in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-17_para10">
Furthermore, we all know that Standing Committees are a limited representation of the House of Commons. Those of us who are not on the Bill Committee want an opportunity either on behalf of our constituents or a wider interest group to express our concerns or perhaps our support on issues, such as the curtailment of freedom to do with the law on religious hatred. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and I share the same view of the law on religious hatred. We think that it is a bad idea and that the public should hear the arguments from Members other than those on the Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-17_para11">
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) said a moment ago, intercept evidence along with the question of religious hatred are two of the most important issues concerning civil liberties that the Bill will destroy. What are we supposed to do with half an hour to discuss the civil liberties of our citizens? Do you remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in 1998&nbsp;the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) said, &quot;Hallelujah, this is the Labour Government that is bringing human rights home.&quot;? The Government were going to domesticate the European 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1033</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>convention on human rights by enacting the Human Rights Bill. What a load of codswallop. What a load of trash. They do not know what they are doing. They have no understanding of the constitutional proprieties. This is a disgraceful and despotic Government. The rulers of the Soviet Union would tip their hat to this lot. The Bill should be given proper consideration by this House, and I hope that it will reject this revolting timetabling motion.

<p><a name="50203-18_spnew0"><b> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD):</b> 
 I am aware that the Minister is keen to respond even in the limited time we have to discuss the limited time that we have to discuss the Bill on Report. I have a few brief points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para0">
At the start it was not entirely satisfactory that the Bill was such a portmanteau business incorporating different sorts of legislation, but it is recognised that we have to do what we can in Committee. The Committee was disciplined. In my view there is no reason why a Committee cannot get through such a Bill if Members show restraint, as was shown on all sides, but on the basis that each part, which will inevitably be considered separately on Report, will be given adequate time for discussion. It is unfortunate that the programme motion does not provide for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para1">
In addition, the animal extremism measure is a dramatic piece of legislation. The construction of the five Government new clauses that make up the economic sabotage measure shows that careful discussion and scrutiny is necessary. I question whether there is enough time to do that. Today, I tabled an amendment, the measure having been published only in the last two days, and it is not clear whether there is enough time for consideration. Moreover, the Government could have introduced the new clauses before the conclusion of the Committee stage for us to discuss then, rather than waiting until a few days before a Report stage debate to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para2">
Finally, there is the question of the section on religious incitement. Two new clauses, if selected, will need debate and may well lead to Divisions. New clause 3&nbsp;substitutes a different approach from the Government&#039;s and it has three party support. That means that we are dealing not just with the Government and one or two Front Bench spokesmen, but with Government Back Benchers who will want their say as they have signed the new clause. It is unusual to have that sort of arrangement on Report on a Government Bill, particularly so close to an election. That should signal that there is plenty to debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para3">
In addition, there is a new clause dealing with the abolition of blasphemy. That has hardly ever been debated in the House and the last time was, I think, 15&nbsp;years ago. It, too, has cross-party Back-Bench support and Members will want to give their view. I understand that Conservative Members will have a free vote, so no doubt there will be more than one view held among them. Certainly there will be more than one view on the Government Benches. I do not see how it will be possible to cover that discussion in an hour and a half.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para4">
I urge the Government, who so far have dealt with the business of the Bill in a spirit of co-operation despite the tight scheduling, to reconsider the programme motion 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1034</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to provide adequate time for all those matters. If the Government do not, they know that they will have difficulty in the House of Lords on the question of religious incitement. The failure to debate this properly in this House gives encouragement, rightly so, to the other place to stand firm in their previously expressed belief that this is not what they want to see. Fuller discussion in this House might persuade some of their lordships to drop their objections. The Government are making a rod for their own back by trying to rush that particular measure and this Bill through the House.

<a name="50203-18_time0"><h5>2.43&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 The reason why I moved the programme motion formally rather than exercising all the arguments in favour of its construction was precisely to give Members on all sides an opportunity to state their concerns. This debate is limited. The Government deliberately tabled the debate for today to guarantee that it should not in any way eat into the opportunities for debate on the measures themselves. We guarantee that even if there is a statement, we will get the full amount of time set out in this programme motion.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell: </b> 
 The Minister said that the Government held the debate today so that they could listen to what was said. She has heard from across the House blanket condemnation of the motion. Will she now withdraw it?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 No, I will not. I am using the opportunity to clarify the reasons for what we have done and to ensure that all hon. Members are confident that there will be the full time for debate, as set out in the motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para5">
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr.&nbsp;Garnier) implied that debate in Committee had been restricted. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) serves on the Committee and knows that no knives were used. Indeed, the Government offered additional evening sittings, so the Bill has been fully debated in Committee. Those who have participated in those sittings have acknowledged that in their contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para6">
My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who moved the amendment, was not a member of the Committee. I accept that his genuine concerns were not dealt with in Committee, which considered such matters relatively briskly, but they could well be dealt with at a meeting with my ministerial colleagues. I hope that we can offer him that opportunity and that he will withdraw his amendment. It is easy to do that because, as hon. Members on all sides have said, during the Bill&#039;s consideration my colleagues and I have had extensive meetings with Members and others who have had concerns about aspects of the Bill. We have tried to listen to them. Changes have been made, which hon. Members have graciously acknowledged.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew3"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister is making a point about trying to deal with some of the individual concerns, but the hon. Member for Hayes and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1035</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Harlington (John McDonnell) raised his concerns on the Floor of the House for the rest of the House to be aware that there was a problem in the Bill. She is now proposing to deal with those concerns at a private meeting. Will the response from that be put in the Library or before the House so that hon. Members can see it? It is important that there is a record in <i>Hansard</i> for the courts to see how Ministers have justified their legislation. <i>Hansard</i> provides the record of which arguments they used to justify their case.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 As I understand it, the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington are not necessarily with the proposal in the Bill, but with the impact of the proposal on people who are current employees. It is appropriate for such a matter to be dealt with in this way. I hope that my offer of a meeting will deal with his concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para7">
I am struck that hon. Members, while raising concerns about the amount of time available for debate, have felt that the programme motion focuses on the right five key issues. After all, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) described the measure as a Bill of 220&nbsp;pages with which he agreed with all but two. We therefore sought in the programme motion to focus on the provisions on animal rights extremists, the status of staff in the Serious Organised Crime Agency, protests in Parliament square, incitement and intercept as evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para8">
Hon. Members have raised concerns about the use of intercept as evidence and the risk that the time taken for voting might mean a relatively short time for debating intercept. The matter was not included in the original Bill but introduced through Opposition amendments. During our proceedings, the Opposition specifically asked for a Home Office response, which has been provided and deals with many of the concerns that were raised.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 The Under-Secretary says that the Opposition raised intercept and that she believes that it has been tackled adequately. If the mathematics and anticipation of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) are correct, we will have about half an hour to discuss it on the Floor of the House. That is where legislation should be debated. It may well be that the usual channels have held all sorts of interesting discussions and that Opposition Members or Government Back Benchers have proposed ideas but the Floor of the House, not private meetings or secret, back-door deals, is where public legislation should be dealt with publicly. Does not the Under-Secretary understand the purpose of the constitution and Parliament?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Of course I do. I was highlighting the fact that the issue was raised during the Bill&#039;s development and that it did not initially form part of the measure. The Government are eager to respond to concerns that were raised during the process of considering the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew7"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 The simple fact is that the Government have included the issue in the Bill. Many of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1036</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>us would say, &quot;Good. Well done&quot;, but we want to discuss it. Half an hour for hon. Members of all parties&#151;cannot the Under-Secretary understand that the timetable is far too restricted? Cannot she take away the motion and give us a second day?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-18_spnew8"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I do not believe that that is necessary because the Committee that considered the Bill managed fully to debate all the issues without any guillotine or knives. The Committee went through all the business. The Government offered additional time in Committee, which was not necessary. We have fully debated the Bill in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-18_para9">
The programme motion focuses on appropriate matters. It is clear from today&#039;s contributions that hon. Members are confident that the motion identifies the aspects that they wish to debate on the Floor of the House. Consequently, I am confident that the focus is appropriate. As has been said, the Bill has in large measure attracted support across the House. It has been vigorously debated and there will be a full five and a half hours debate on Report. I emphasise that the time allowed will not be reduced in the event of a statement.

<p><a name="50203-19_spnew0"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b>

</p>





<p><a name="50203-19_spnew3"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 Our constituents often want to know which way we voted on controversial matters. The programme motion suggests that we should not vote on them because that means we cannot debate them.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-19_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is utterly mistaken if he believes that I implied that. I did not. I urged hon. Members not to linger in the Division Lobby. Some hon. Members who have contributed to today&#039;s debate know that they have been responsible for doing that on some occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-19_para0">
There is broad cross-party support for much of the Bill. As a result of the Government amendments that are tabled for Report, to which hon. Members have referred, I hope and expect that disagreement will continue to reduce. I am therefore confident that one day for Report is adequate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-19_para1">
I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington to withdraw the amendment.

The original programme motion tabled by the Government had been discussed through the usual channels and had agreement, but the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) raised concerns in Committee with regard to the length of the allocation for Third Reading. He was quite happy with the allocation for Committee and Report. Having listened carefully to the points that he raised in Committee, and in discussions through the usual channels, I agreed that we could provide for his specific requests. The motion responds to all his requests, and I hope that he is satisfied that I have acted positively and in good faith.

<a name="50203-20_time1"><h5>3.12&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 The motion is for an inherently much less controversial Bill than the one that the House has just discussed and voted on, so I suspect that we will not require the full 45&nbsp;minutes to discuss it. Nevertheless, I want to put on record a few brief points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para5">
The original programme motion for this Bill, to which we were opposed, allocated only half an hour for Third Reading. The Paymaster General is right that we protested about that, both in the Programming Sub-Committee and through the usual channels, as the Opposition&#039;s view was that allowing half an hour for the Third Reading of a Bill, even for a relatively minor measure, set an unwelcome precedent, and we did not want to let that pass. Discussions therefore took place through the usual channels, and in fairness to her, the Order Paper was amended in such a way that if Report does not last until 5&nbsp;o&#039;clock, which may be the case, we will have an expanded amount of time to debate Third Reading. I acknowledge that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para6">
First, however, it is important to remember that the Opposition are opposed in principle to the concept of programming. Secondly, given what has just transpired in the Chamber&#151;the abominable way in which the Government treated the previous programme motion, for which I accept that the Paymaster General is not personally responsible&#151;the Opposition feel that we have no choice but to oppose this one, too. We therefore intend to press the matter to a Division.

<a name="50203-20_time2"><h5>3.14&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 I will not delay the House unduly, but this is an opportunity to say something very important.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1042</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para7">
This Bill is largely uncontroversial. Given the civilised nature of our Parliament, it could properly be discussed in circumstances in which the mechanism could be used without party political division but to get the best Bill possible. I am much impressed by the way in which the Paymaster General has tried to respond to our concerns. Although she and I have had our arguments from time to time, she would accept that they have been on matters of principle and not in any way party political or personal. Will she therefore take these remarks in the same spirit?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para8">
We must recover the respect that the House of Commons has lost in the world outside. Part of the problem is the view that we can no longer manage our affairs to deal with such a Bill without a programme motion, and that we are not prepared to give the necessary time for matters that should properly be allowed serious argument. It happens that the previous programme motion relates to an area in which I have a real interest, which I want to declare. The issue for which that programme motion has left us a relatively small amount of time is of fundamental constitutional, social and religious importance, which I therefore feel strongly that it is important to discuss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para9">
This matter, however, is wholly different. I hope that the Government will now begin to think about how the restitution of what I would call the historic concept of convention is a necessary part of modernisation. We have gone beyond modernisation being about laying down rules about trying to improve things one way and another. We ought to learn that for most Bills a perfectly reasonable procedure is for both sides of the House to come to a reasonable decision about how much time is needed for discussion. This is one of those Bills that ought to have had no programme motion. I know what Parliament in its various wisdom has said, but this is exactly the circumstance in which the Government could have trusted Parliament to make progress in a sensible way. Unless we recover that relationship, it will be very serious.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para10">
Of course we could have a party political discussion about who might win the next election, but I do not want that. I shall put it in obvious, impartial terms. At some stage, this Government will not be the Government of Britain. It may be after the Paymaster General&#039;s life, or next time&#151;whenever it is, it will surely come. In those circumstances, if the Opposition have been driven to a position in which they feel that they have been unable to use the time of the House to have proper discussions about real issues, the difficulty will be that they will not revert to a sensible, civilised system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para11">
I want the Paymaster General to become an advocate for a change&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. Before we proceed, let me say that general discussion about programming is not appropriate. The debate is about programming for this particular Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Indeed, and I wish to keep to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para12">
This is an opportunity for the Paymaster General to say, &quot;Look, the House can handle this without a programme motion. Let us give it the chance.&quot; There is no reason why she should not do it. There is a recommendation by the House, but it is not a rule. I am 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1043</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sorry that she has not done it up to now, I am sure that she cannot go back on her word, and her considerable generosity in ensuring that our needs are met is very helpful. I hope that she will recognise, however, that the Government could make a great contribution to parliamentary democracy in this area by recognising that programme motions are deeply offensive because they do not allow for proper, civilised relationships.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend is making a powerful and cogent case, but does he not accept that when Government impose timetables unnecessarily&#151;when the timetable is too tight or else should not be imposed at all, as in this case&#151;it is this Parliament that is brought into contempt for passing bad laws, because it has not been able to consider them properly, and that when this Parliament is brought into contempt, we as Members of Parliament are brought down in the estimation of the public?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 I must be careful given your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker, but my hon. Friend&#039;s point can be applied to the Bill. We could show the country that we are capable of having a sensible discussion about a Bill with most of which we all agree, but which the Opposition want to ensure is as good as it can be without wanting to be difficult or awkward. I think that we can do that much better without constraint. Indeed, I suspect we might finish much earlier if we were not constrained. The trouble with programme motions is that we tend to fill the amount of time available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para13">
I merely say this to the Minister. I hope she will become increasingly an advocate of the concept that the House must recover control over its timetable for itself. That means not having programme motions but beginning to rebuild a convention in which the House does not improperly stand in the way of the rule of the majority, but neither does the majority improperly stand in the way of the expression of the minority view. Then, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), we shall not have as much bad legislation as we have had, and I shall have fewer people coming into my surgery asking why on earth we passed clause 62, after which I look it up and discover that we never discussed clause 62.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-20_para14">
The differences are not party political: they are differences that will only be brought out by discussion so we can see what the mistake is. I hope the Minister will accept that, in what could be considered a rather non-party political moment, I want to raise this matter seriously with her. To my own Front Benchers, I say that I look forward to a total commitment from the Conservative party that when returned to power it will remove this element. I want that commitment before an election, not afterwards, because I know what will happen otherwise: people will say &quot;They did it to us, so we will do it to them.&quot; That is not a proper answer. I want that commitment now.
</p>

<p><a name="50203-21_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about the business of the House. Let me say two things to him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-21_para0">
First, I consider that to safeguard the functioning of parliamentary democracy is incumbent on us all. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1044</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes we are in danger of undermining our own case by over-elaborating it, and taking longer than we might. The Committee stage did not take all its time, but the Opposition nevertheless asked for more time on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-21_para1">
Secondly, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s general point. The business of the House must run smoothly so that the business of Government runs smoothly, but all Members must agree to allow that to happen. If they do not, the orderly business of the House can be ensured only through programme motions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-21_para2">
I am sure that everyone has heard the considered observations from the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rayleigh. I hope that, on that basis, we can now deal with the Child Benefit Bill rather than the programme motion.

<p></p>




<br>

<br>
&quot;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations made by the Treasury under section 142(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992&nbsp;and section 138(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992&nbsp;shall include provision that a person (who has not attained such age as is prescribed in the regulations) shall be a qualifying young person if he satisfies the condition that he is attending an unwaged training course of a description specified in a list published by the Treasury.
<br>



<p></p>




<br>

<br>
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury, working with other Government Departments as required, shall ensure that reasonable steps are taken to publicise this list, to assist people in understanding the courses a person may attend whilst continuing to be a person in respect of whom another person may be entitled to child benefit.&#039;.&#151;<i>[Mr. Francois.]</i>

 With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 2&#151;<i>Regulations made by the Treasury: qualifying training&#151;</i>
</p>





<p></p>




<br>

<br>
&quot;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations made by the Treasury under section 142(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992&nbsp;and section 138(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992&nbsp;shall include provision that a person (who has not attained such age as is prescribed in the regulations) shall be a qualifying young person if he satisfies the following conditions&#151;

<br>



<p><a name="50203-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 In speaking to these new clauses, I should reiterate our view that this is a brief but none the less important Bill. We examined it in Committee and explored a number of issues, including why the proposed age limits have been set as they have. We gave notice that we would want to pursue two particular issues on Report, both of which I intend to touch on this afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) will then make some more general comments on Third Reading. Incidentally, when we reach that stage we hope to discuss an idea first suggested by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) on Second Reading. We hope to hear more from him in due course&#151;if he manages to return in time from a conference on pensions that he is attending. We shall see whether he manages to join us and to make that contribution.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1048</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para0">
I turn to new clause 1. The Bill extends the payment of child benefit to the families of young people who are in unwaged training. In seeking to define the qualifying young people to whom the Bill will apply, the Government had two options. They could have included all unwaged trainees in the extended benefit qualification, or defined those who would qualify according to specific programmes of activity. They chose to use the second and narrower of the two approaches, even though it could exclude a number of people undertaking voluntary work or work experience. I shall say more about that in a few minutes&#039; time when we reach new clause 2, but assuming for the moment that the Government remain committed to their present policy of defining entitlement by qualifying courses, it is important that as many people as possible understand exactly which courses will qualify for the extended payment of child benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para1">
It is fair to say that there was near unanimity on Second Reading that the existing system of financial support for young people is already very complex. Indeed, the Government&#039;s own social exclusion unit, in a report from a few years ago entitled &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; summarised the problem in these terms:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para2">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A young person&#039;s entitlement to state financial support varies according to their personal status (for example whether they are a lone parent or disabled), what they are doing in education, training or work, whether they are unemployed, and whether or not they are living at home. Money is paid through at least eight different agencies, (with a ninth heavily involved) on behalf of two Government departments. The system is so complex that someone has written a book of around 130&nbsp;pages about it for young people and their advisers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para3">
That broad area remains a live issue up to today. In fact, as recently as yesterday, in the context of educational courses available to young people, the chief inspector of schools, David Bell, said:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para4">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is just conceivable that 4,000&nbsp;educational qualifications are needed for 16&#150;19&nbsp;year olds. But for each young person the choice may appear so daunting that there is no rational way of making it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para5">
We tabled new clause 1&nbsp;with that in mind. It requires the Government of the day to publish a specific list of the courses that will qualify in future for the extended payment of child benefit. In addition, the new clause requires the Treasury, working with other Departments, among which the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions spring readily to mind, to take reasonable steps to publicise the list to make it as obvious as possible which courses qualify.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para6">
I understand that the Government are already working on revised guidance notes for parents and advisers, in time for the scheduled roll-out in April 2006. In fairness, I welcome that, but given the relative confusion that currently exists in this area, we need something beyond it in order to get the message across more broadly. On that point, given that the overall advertising budget has expanded tremendously under the Government, could not just a little of it be diverted to the very practical purpose of helping to publicise the list of courses that will qualify under the Bill? That seems to me to be a more profitable way of spending some of the Government&#039;s advertising budget than having a 160-page supplement of public sector non-jobs in <i>The Guardian</i> once a week.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1049</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para7">
The new clause should not just assist young people who are considering whether to undertake periods of unwaged training and trying to work out the financial implications of their choice but should be of material benefit to the organisations that work with them, such as Connexions, Barnardo&#039;s, Centrepoint, the Prince&#039;s Trust and others to whom young people look for advice in seeking to make their choices. I put down a marker on the matter in Committee and asked whether the Paymaster General would say more about it on Report. If the Bill is to have the desired effect, it is important that its provisions are clearly understood in what already amounts to a complicated field. I look forward to hearing what she has to say, before deciding whether to press the new clause to a Division.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para8">
New clause 2&nbsp;relates to volunteering and the types of training that would not qualify for the extended payment of benefit under the Bill and the present draft regulations, but that might qualify in future if the regulations were to be amended. The Committee also touched on that matter, but our purpose in tabling the new clause for debate this afternoon is to expand the discussion and ascertain whether the Government are minded to be flexible about the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para9">
The issue of extending the provisions of the Bill to encompass voluntary work or work experience has been raised by the Prince&#039;s Trust, among others. I paid tribute in Committee to the work of that organisation, and I do not intend to repeat all of that now. Suffice it to say that it does very good work in this area, which I hope the whole House will commend.

<a name="50203-22_time1"><h5>3.45&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para10">
I remind the House of the point made by the Prince&#039;s Trust in connection with this element of the Bill. In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, it stated:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para11">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In our consultation with young people, many of them specifically talked about voluntary work and work experience, that these should be eligible since these were a form of training that would improve their employability skills and help them move forward in their lives. These, as well as other more informal forms of training, often provide the first steps out of inactivity for more vulnerable young people.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para12">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">If it is only approved &#039;Government supported schemes&#039; that are eligible, then young people may not feel that they have the financial support to participate in these more informal activities. We would therefore like clarification of what is meant by &#039;Government supported schemes&#039; and whether voluntary work, work experience and other more informal forms of training are going to be eligible for Child Benefit.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para13">
That seems to me to be a very reasonable and measured way to put a case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para14">
In addition, Barnardo&#039;s raised the issue in its briefing note in connection with the Bill. It stated:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para15">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If approved activities are to encompass a wide range of provision to meet the needs of these young people&#151;and we would argue that they should&#151;there is also the question of who will assess, approve and monitor the activities. Barnardo&#039;s would like to see a range of specified professionals empowered to do this, dependent on the circumstances of individual young people. Such specified people could be a Connexions adviser, a leaving care adviser, a social worker, a youth offending team worker, a CAMHS worker etc.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para16">
In Committee, we pressed the Government to provide some financial estimate, however broad, of the additional cost of extending measures to include those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1050</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>additional categories of young people. We appreciate that some definition issues are involved, and that there are also problems arising from paucity of data, and we acknowledge that this is not an easy question to answer. Nevertheless, I specifically asked the Paymaster General if she might be able to provide us with such an estimate on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para17">
In addition, I presume that there must have been some outline costings when the two alternative policy options were being considered&#151;not least because this is, after all, a Treasury Bill. So what was the higher estimate, and therefore the additional cost, of widening the scope of the Bill? The House needs to know that estimate if it is minded to accept it. It would be rather odd if a Treasury Minister, of all people, were not able to answer such a financial question, so I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to enlighten us on the matter in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para18">
Although I am requesting further financial information about the implications of such a change, fairness demands that I point out that the Paymaster General indicated a willingness to consider the matter further. She will recall that she told the Committee:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para19">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The new clause specifically considers volunteering and informal skills; there is a big issue about how to monitor those. In my opening remarks, I tried to make it clear that, in principle, certain types of volunteering could be considered. I have sympathy with the points made but the question is when and how.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para20">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">If the purpose of the new clause is to see whether our mind is closed on the question of volunteering, I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that it is not.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Standing Committee F</i>, 18&nbsp;January 2005; c. 36.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para21">
This Bill is essentially an enabling measure whose details will be fleshed out in subsequent regulations that can be updated from time to time. It is not inconceivable that, at some future date, the Treasury of the day could change those regulations, away from the draft that exists already, to facilitate such an expansion. The Paymaster General has indicated already that her mind is not closed on this subject, so does she have anything further to add this afternoon? Have the Government considered the matter further between Standing Committee and Report?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-22_para22">
We are unlikely to press new clause 2&nbsp;to a Division, as it is largely intended to air the issue on behalf of certain voluntary groups that have made representations to us, but we seek to ascertain specific figures for the likely costs of any such change, if any Government of whatever colour considered making it in future. I would therefore be pleased to learn of anything further on the subject that the Paymaster General can add, bearing in mind her intimations in Committee only a couple of weeks ago.

<p><a name="50203-23_spnew0"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham) (LD):</b> 
 I should like to say a few words in support of both new clauses. My hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) sends his apologies as he is unable to attend. He was immersed in the detail of the Bill and supported its broad outlines. I will deal with the Bill&#039;s final stages but, as a newcomer, I lack his depth of understanding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para0">
The new clauses deal with an issue that my hon. Friend raised on Second Reading in several interventions and in his speech. How do we define the boundary and the limits? Who should be included and who should be excluded? As the hon. Member for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1051</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) helpfully summarised, the Government had two broad choices. They could have opted for universal inclusion of everyone on unwaged training. The widest possible provision is very much in the spirit of Bill, but clearly there were problems with enforcement and cost, so the Government adopted a much narrower and specific definition based on Government-approved schemes. That enables the Government to give a precise figure&#151;80,000&#151;and, hopefully, to be reasonably precise about the cost of &#163;105&nbsp;million. I suppose that that is why they have chosen the narrower route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para1">
The hon. Member for Rayleigh made the case for breadth or inclusion. I saw some of the submissions from the voluntary organisations, particularly Barnado&#039;s, which stressed that many young people on training schemes&#151;presumably, the Bill is trying help them&#151;are difficult to reach as they are not on approved schemes, so they will be excluded. We should therefore try to find ways of including them as much as possible. As the hon. Gentleman has made the basic arguments, I shall try to anticipate the Government&#039;s objections to the widening of the measure. The first, presumably, is cost. Having read the debates, although I did not attend them, I found it unsatisfactory that I could not gain any handle on the total number of people who are included or excluded. A rough approximation would help us to understand the parameters of the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para2">
The Bill is bound to change behaviour so, in any event, there will be a migration from unapproved schemes to approved ones as people take advantage of the benefits that become available. The costs will probably be larger than the Government estimate, and some of the people whom the new clauses are designed to include will be paid for as a result of that migration. As for enforcement, I understand the Government&#039;s nervousness. After the problem with individual learning accounts, we know how easy it is for fraud to proliferate on the fringes of the training industry. I therefore understand why the Government do not want to get their fingers burned again by using loose definitions. The authors of the new clause have thought about the problem and have tried to devise sensible mechanisms that provide standards.

To be slightly mischievous, the hon. Member for Rayleigh rested his case rather heavily on the ability to promote the schemes through advertising. I do not know whether he has read the James report&#151;it has kept me busy for many evenings&#151;but the section on advertising is particularly enlightening, because most of that budget would disappear and the scope for the activities that he described would be circumscribed. Fundamentally, however, that mischievous point aside, his remarks were helpful. He could have pointed out that it would be useful for the Government to make more use of trade associations of electrical contractors, plumbers, builders and so on, as they are active and effective in many areas and could help to identify acceptable, quality training schemes that are not necessarily supported by the Government. In general, we should be moving in the direction of statutory self-regulation, rather like the medical profession, whereby professions and trades set their own training standards and identify acceptable schemes in their remit. Much

<br>&nbsp;<br>could be done at that level without direct Government involvement. None the less, if the Government were proactive and talked to the trade associations, they could identify a wide range of schemes that, while not necessarily Government supported, were reputable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para4">
On the point about volunteering raised under new clause 2, we all know as MPs that volunteering and work placements are an important entry route into employment for young people who are learning our trade. The practice is common outside this place and we hope that it is supported in much the same way. I acknowledge, however, that there is a problem, which has been pointed out to me by people in my constituency. There is an underground world in which some disreputable companies hire a growing number of volunteers, keep them on for one or two years, encouraging them to believe that there will be a job, but then lay them off and start again with a new round of volunteers. In effect, such employers are getting labour without paying for it. It is not at all clear how that practice could be policed or stopped, but exclusion from the current schemes means that such young people are doubly disadvantaged: not only do they have no job security and employment, they have no access to the child benefit provisions either. New clause 2&nbsp;would be helpful in bringing those young people within the remit of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para5">
The new clauses are constructive and well worth supporting. There are some practical difficulties with them, but if the Government were constructive they could help to find a way through those difficulties. I happily support the new clauses, especially if they are pushed to a vote.

<a name="50203-23_para6">
The Government consulted on a number of issues in the review on financial independence for 16&nbsp;to 19-year-olds. Some were short term, and some were for long- term solution and consultation, precisely for the reason given by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). It is one thing to want to achieve an objective, but quite another to find the route that delivers it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para7">
The first set of consultations, which deals with the proposals in new clause 1, was specifically with regard to defining the courses that would be covered and the training for unwaged trainees. To pick up the point made by the hon. Gentleman in his closing remarks, two real issues emerged from the consultation. The first was the complete lack of proper information about the number or type of so-called unwaged trainees who were outside the Government schemes. That has real dangers, on which the hon. Gentleman touched. Unwaged training should be properly accredited; that is, it should be training with a result&#151;a skill.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-23_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I am attracted by the apparent intent of both new clauses. Will my right hon. Friend address directly the point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) in relation to the parallels with the ILAs? That was a sad and sorry saga that I am sure we shall not repeat.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-23_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I was coming to that point; my hon. Friend anticipates me. If the Government are to sponsor 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1053</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>schemes and allocate entitlement on the basis of training, we have to be sure that the training is delivered to the standard required. Indeed, the consultation process made it clear that the Government could have approached unwaged, approved training in two ways. The first approach would involve trying to articulate in legislation the principles that must be followed. People would then measure their training to find out whether it met that standard. Of course, that would require regulation and enforcement, and all that goes with that.

<a name="50203-23_time0"><h5>4&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para8">
The second approach, which was favoured during the consultation, was that the Government should clearly define the approved training and education. In fact, regulation 2&nbsp;includes a complete list at paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of those unwaged training courses that the Government consider fall within the meaning of &quot;approved training&quot; in the Bill, thus ensuing a quality-controlled outcome. On that basis, following the consultation I decided to define unwaged training in the regulations by reference to a list of named courses, precisely to satisfy the second point that the hon. Member for Twickenham raised in respect of transparency and clarity, to ensure that people do not have to make a judgment against principles; such things would be specified by their inclusion in the list.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-23_para9">
Of course, a wider issue remains to be settled in relation to unwaged trainees who may be elsewhere in the labour market. They may be called unwaged trainees, but they may be young people who are being exploited for a number of reasons. They may not be receiving any recompense and certainly not any training, and a great deal of work still needs to be done on that.

<p><a name="50203-23_spnew3"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 I am most grateful to the Paymaster General for being so generous in giving way. Is she certain that the Bill, when implemented, will reduce to an absolute minimum the chance that the collusion and coercion of young people on low wages will decant them into unpaid work, so that the value of that work must be met directly by the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue? Can she reassure the House on that point?

 I assure my hon. Friend that provision has been made to stop that happening, but I also assure him that the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)&#151;who will follow up a number of other issues that relate to 16&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;skills&#151;and I intend to monitor the wider issues. This is the first step that the Government have taken in this area, but it needs to be monitored and that is a high priority. I am certainly satisfied that that is the best that we can do. Unfortunately, I cannot say that unscrupulous people will not seek ways to exploit the system, but we will do our best to combat that and to try to ensure that it does not happen, and monitoring is one way to do so.

On how to ensure that young people are properly informed, I will not be as mischievous as the hon. Member for Twickenham with regard to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1054</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Conservative party&#039;s future plans about publicity and how it would make cuts in that respect. A much more important point needs to be made about the March 2004&nbsp;report, &quot;Supporting young people to achieve&quot;. Again, as I pointed out to the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), that report commits the Government to ensuring that information about the financial support available for post-16&nbsp;choices is given at the same time as general advice about post-16&nbsp;choices. The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions are working on that and will ensure that such proper advice is available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para2">
New clause 1&nbsp;is, frankly, not necessary because it would duplicate work of the Government that is already under way. I hope that the hon. Member for Rayleigh will not press it to a Division.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para3">
New clause 2&nbsp;relates to volunteering. I wondered whether I needed to speak about it because the hon. Gentleman made my points for me by quoting my comments from the Committee. I fully support the principle that he is putting forward, as did many members of the Committee. In &quot;Supporting young people to achieve&quot;, which was published last March, we recognised that volunteering and informal training could provide an effective means of re-engaging young people, especially those who are marginalised. Indeed, during my consultation with young people they flagged up not only the benefits of volunteering, but the problems involved in providing volunteering that is recognised as being relevant experience and part of a qualification while preventing young people from being exploited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para4">
It was concluded that we should take the consultation a step further. As I explained to the hon. Gentleman in Committee, this will be the second stage of the consultation. We will report the results of our consultation on volunteering, and the question of whether it could be accredited through such bodies as the Prince&#039;s Trust, in the forthcoming Budget. The Government will respond to what has been said and explain how they can take things forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para5">
The Government, however, have done more than just that. They have set up the Russell commission. Additionally, a conference on volunteering was held in the Treasury on 31&nbsp;January, which was announced as part of the pre-Budget report, to examine specifically with the sector how volunteering and mentoring could be taken forward to provide an additional avenue of experience for young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para6">
For the reasons identified by the hon. Members for Twickenham and for Rayleigh, it would be dangerous to introduce such a measure at this early stage. We would not be able to quantify it, or know whether it would work. We would not know the benefits that young people would receive, and we could inadvertently provide for their exploitation. The question of extending such financial support has thus been left to one side although, as I explained in Committee, the door has not closed. We are waiting for the Russell commission&#039;s report and want to conclude the consultation in which we are engaged. We will report back on the consultation and the next steps to be taken at the time of the Budget. The Home Secretary and the Chancellor led the conference in the Treasury on 31&nbsp;January, so they are keen to take the process forward.

I hope that the hon. Member for Rayleigh will agree that he has pushed far enough to make it clear that volunteering will be addressed. After taking account of the responses that we receive, we will try to find a way of updating things. I am happy to ensure that he and other hon. Members are kept fully informed of developments. On that basis, I hope that he will not press new clause 2&nbsp;to a Division. If he does, I shall reluctantly have to oppose it&#151;not on principle, but because such a mechanism could not be introduced practically or sensibly at this stage.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I have listened carefully to the remarks offered by the Paymaster General. In responding, I shall take the new clauses in reverse order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para8">
The right hon. Lady rightly points out that we must await the conclusions of the Russell commission, which has been looking into volunteering in the broader sense. The type of voluntary activity that we are discussing this afternoon clearly comes within the bailiwick of that commission and, like the Government, we await its report with interest. She intimated that more would be said about volunteering in the Budget. We await the specific detail of that, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para9">
At this stage, however, our aim in new clause 2&nbsp;was first, to keep the subject alive for debate. I believe that we have succeeded in doing that and the Paymaster General responded in the right spirit. Secondly, our aim was to get at least an outline financial estimate of how much expanding the Bill&#039;s provisions to cover the larger categories would cost. She rightly points out that there are issues of definition to be dealt with; none the less, some outline figure should have been available when the policy decision was taken. I find it difficult to believe that, of all Departments, the Treasury had to choose between two policy options, only one of which was costed.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-24_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 It is simply not possible to put a cost on such provision for volunteering. We need more information and the results of the consultation to do so. Similarly, costing the inclusion of unwaged trainees outside the identified schemes is not possible because the data do not exist in a form that would enable a secure and proper estimate to be made and given to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para10">
I know that the hon. Gentleman is sometimes sceptical about some of the Government&#039;s estimates, even when I assert them forcefully from the Dispatch Box, but I assure him that if I had a figure, I would prefer to give it to him. I am not concealing anything. We are dealing with a difficult and uncharted area and part of the work that we have to do is to get information so that we can produce proper costings and answer the sort of questions that he is raising, and which I, too, want to be answered.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I thank the Paymaster General for that detailed intervention. I shall fully respect her right to be assertive&#151;I suspect that she probably never needed to go on an assertiveness training course, but that God gave her that talent&#151;as long as she respects my right to continue, on occasion, to be sceptical.

<a name="50203-24_para11">

<a name="50203-24_para12">
On new clause 1, however, we disagree. There is a lack of detail in the draft regulations. The Paymaster General intimated that the draft regulations lay out a list of all the courses; in fact, they do no such thing. Under the heading &quot;Interpretation&quot;, regulation 2&nbsp;starts &quot;In these Regulations&#151;&quot; and then simply lays out headings for the multifarious courses that will be covered. It does not specify the courses themselves, only the types of course, and there is no appendix that lists specific courses. That is not the comprehensive list that we have been trying to elicit from the Government. We argue that there should be a concise list of precisely what courses are covered, which should be publicised so that people will know whether they are likely to qualify for an extended child benefit payment if they take a certain course. A list of headings does not meet that requirement.

I shall deal with the point made from the Liberal Front Bench. I should mention as a matter of courtesy that the hon.

On publicity, the James review ascertained that a large amount of spending on advertising was wasteful. Having examined it in detail, we are convinced of that. However, there might be a practical purpose in using targeted Government money to advertise something specific. We are in no way arguing for an enlargement of the advertising budget&#151;quite the opposite. We want to spend the money far more effectively, and one way of doing that would be to advertise the list that we advocate in new clause 1. That might not please the advertising department of The<i> Guardian,</i> but it might help a large number of young people who are deciding on their career futures. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) suggests from a sedentary position that we should put the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-24_para15">
We propose publicising a specific list to assist people who might be in a position to take advantage of those courses, and those who advertise their ability to advise them on whether they could take advantage of the courses. We made that specific suggestion in Committee and gave the Government an opportunity to return to it on Report. Unfortunately, they have not listened to the point that we were trying to make, so we shall test the will of the House on the matter.

<p><a name="50203-26_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para0">
As has been said repeatedly, the Child Benefit Bill is a small but significant piece of the jigsaw to give all young people the means and opportunity to participate in education and training beyond the age of 16. It builds on the success of our economic reforms to date, which have provided macro-economic stability, low unemployment and record employment. We are determined to transform the United Kingdom into a high-skill economy, where everyone, regardless of background, can benefit from the opportunities that global change offers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para1">
As part of that overarching objective, we are committed to ensuring that all our young people reach the age of 19&nbsp;equipped with the skills and qualifications that they need to make the most of their talents and aspirations. Our long-term ambition is that, by 2015, UK staying-on rates after 16&nbsp;will move from one of the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to one of the highest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para2">
Our strategy for achieving that target has three complementary elements: making the education and training curriculum more attractive for 14&nbsp;to 19-year-

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1060</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>olds, improving the provision of information and guidance on the opportunities available, and reforming the financial support system to make it more coherent and accessible to young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para3">
The Bill is an important step, but not the only step, in delivering the last strand. It will enable us to remove the distinction between education and unwaged training in the financial support system, thus supporting young people to choose the learning route that is most appropriate for them, rather than basing their decision on financial considerations. The new entitlement will apply to all 80,000&nbsp;unwaged trainees on Government-arranged training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para4">
The Bill will also enable us to extend financial support to 19-year-olds who are completing a course of education or training that they started before their 19th birthday, thus ending wasted investment for young people who, because of financial pressures, drop out at 19&nbsp;before they have achieved their qualifications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para5">
For the long term, we have been consulting about the activities outside formal education and training that should be entitled to financial support. As we have discussed again today, volunteering and informal skills courses provided by the voluntary sector clearly need to be considered. I repeat that the Government will respond to a consultation on that specific subject in the forthcoming Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para6">
The Bill will provide us with the flexibility to extend entitlement to such activities in the future, once the necessary mechanisms are in place. It is clear from the Opposition amendments and the backing for the principle that I can look forward to their full support in taking forward the reforms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para7">
I want to put on record my gratitude to all the young people, parents, voluntary sector organisations, business and learning providers who have again contributed their time and valuable experience to our consultation. Their experience, views and opinions have played an invaluable role in informing the development of our proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para8">
Improving financial support for 16&nbsp;to 19-year-olds in education and training is an investment in the future and aspirations of our young people as well as in the long-term strength and stability of the United Kingdom economy. I have been pleased to hear Members on both sides of the House reaffirm that view and offer their support, in principle, to many of the points in the Bill. That consensus provides us with the foundation to take forward our plans to remove the remaining financial barriers to education and training after 16. I commend the Bill to the House.

</p>





<p><a name="50203-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester) (Con):</b> 
 We have managed to discuss this Bill, as we did the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill, with a reasonable amount of civility, and to avoid the brickbats that are often associated with the passing of legislation in this place. I would like to thank the Paymaster General for listening, on the whole, to the points that we made and for responding to many, if not all of them. In some cases, we still feel that we have not had an answer, as I have made clear. She has certainly tried, however, and she has done more than merely go through the ritual process that she could have fallen back on in this modern age of programmed legislation.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1061</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para9">
The Bill makes a number of simple changes to the eligibility rules for unwaged trainees and people aged 19. We have made it clear that we do not oppose those measures. However, we must bear in mind the fact that although this is a simple Bill, it forms part of a number of other proposals which, together, make it much more complicated. Whether the Bill turns out to be worth while will depend very much on the follow-up in the Budget and on the longer-term simplification proposals that have been set out&#151;albeit only in very sketchy form, which worries me, as the Paymaster General knows&#151;in &quot;Supporting young people to achieve&quot;, the consultation document published a while ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para10">
In Committee, the Government accepted that the current system was horrendously complex&#151;I will not list all the major changes that have taken place since 1997&#151;and that it needed radical simplification. They also accepted that there was something curious about giving child benefit to adults&#151;that is, to people who in every other respect are legally entitled to do all the things that adults can do in society, except one. I realised as I was writing my notes that they would not be eligible to be Members of Parliament. For that, they would have to wait until they were 21.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para11">
My second point is that even this simple measure will not come cheap. In Committee, we tried to find out whether it would provide value for money, and we were unable to get enough information to do so. I will not rehearse all the arguments that we had about the regulatory impact assessments, of which there have been two. Both of those rather curious documents were wholly inadequate, and neither amounted to very much at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para12">
We do have estimates of the cost of extending child benefit to unwaged trainees. That has been given as &#163;105&nbsp;million. We also have an estimate of the cost of extending it to students of 19. That cost is given as &#163;65&nbsp;million. However, when we look closer, we discover that those numbers do not mean very much, because the Government have made no estimate of the behavioural effects that the measures might have. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made that point earlier, as did the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and me, at length, on Second Reading. With this type of support, it is the behavioural effects that we are looking for. The Government are using public money calculatedly and deliberately&#151;and probably rightly&#151;to change behaviour. It was therefore not unreasonable of the Opposition to ask them for their estimates of what those changes in behaviour would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para13">
I agree that it is not easy for the Government. I sympathise with the Economic Secretary&#039;s comments on Second Reading:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para14">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we all share the problem that there is a sparsity of information available about unwaged trainees&#151;the group of people we are most concerned with in this context.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12&nbsp;January 2005; Vol. 429, c. 364.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para15">
All the same, bearing in mind the fact that this is the central issue, I was surprised that Ministers have not been prepared, since we first raised the point, even to have a stab at making an estimate based on some simple assumptions. I think that we will return to this issue after the Budget&#151;and in a few months&#039; time, when we are running policy&#151;and it is worth spelling out in a bit more detail the questions that ought to have been answered. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1062</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>They could even have been answered through sampling, for example, which would have given us some information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-26_para16">
First, what is the Government&#039;s overall estimate of the effect of extending child benefit to unwaged trainees&#151;we now know that it is only those who have become eligible, because they are already on Government supported schemes&#151;and on the overall number of unwaged trainees? We do not know the answer. There will be an Exchequer cost in terms of child benefit for young people who are encouraged to take up this form of training. Set against that, the Exchequer may save some money&#151;a point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and me on Second Reading. That will come to the extent that people are drawn into unwaged training from formal education. We are therefore looking for a net number, and we have not had it.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that with such difficulty of assessment, an alternative or perhaps additional way would be to ensure, in the formulation of the Bill, a specific opportunity to look back and see what has happened? One of my worries is that the House is increasingly asked to make such decisions, perfectly reasonably, as we do not know enough about the position, but we are not yet good enough at allowing ourselves to insist on the kind of independent outside assessment that a business would undertake in such circumstances? A business would take the risk, but be prepared to have a really independent look at it a reasonable time later.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050203/debtext/50203-27.htm"/>




<p><a name="50203-27_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tyrie: </b> 
 That is an extremely thoughtful intervention from a senior former Cabinet Minister. If he cares to look at the amendment paper, he will see that I tabled an amendment with that specific purpose in mind&#151;perhaps he already knows that. Unfortunately&#151;I am not sure how far I can stray down this path&#151;it was not called for debate this afternoon. But it goes to the heart of the matter: when such measures are introduced we need to be clear how we will assess whether the money is being spent usefully. If we have that clear in our minds, we can work out later what yardsticks we will watch to find out whether adjustment is needed. We have not had that from the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para0">
I am very surprised and disappointed that we have not had such estimates. Secondly, how many people will be encouraged by the extension of child benefit for 19-year-olds to stay in full time non-advanced education? As far as I can tell, the behavioural effects will only work one way: there will be costs and no savings for the Exchequer&#151;but I may be wrong, and I may have missed something. Again, I would have liked an estimate, and I have not had it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para1">
The Government could have provided that through sampling, as I have mentioned, or some kind of survey. We all understand that we will not get an exact figure&#151;I hope that we would be intelligent enough not to hold the Government to such a figure if it turned out to be something else. But we should have some indication that the Government have been thinking about the issue and trying to find the right yardstick by which to measure it. After all, we are talking about nearly &#163;200&nbsp;million in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1063</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expenditure, and it may be much more if the behavioural effects are considerable. We need to know what the deadweight cost is, but we do not know.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para2">
At the heart of all this is a very important group of people. The Government claim to have helped them through the new deal and other measures, but they have not really helped them as much as they say&#151;although we heard the customary noisy bluff and bluster from the Chancellor during Treasury Question Time today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para3">
Surely the group about whom we should be most worried consists of those who are not in employment, education or training. The latest figures show that far from diminishing, over the past seven years that group has grown larger. More than one million young people are now economically inactive and not in education. That is worrying, and it should be close to the heart of the Bill. Through various measures, the Government&#039;s support for this overall area runs into billions, but the policy does not seem to be delivering what we should expect of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para4">
I am by no means alone in being worried about the absence of proper cost estimates. I have taken soundings from a large number of people and groups, including the Prince&#039;s Trust, Cornwall and Devon Connexions, the Foyer Federation, Barnardo&#039;s and the Association of Colleges. Many of them allude to this issue in one way or another. They do not oppose the Government&#039;s intentions; they do not even oppose the principle behind the Government&#039;s approach. That is territory that we share. What worries them is that the Bill may not have the intended effects. The chief executive of the Association of Colleges says:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para5">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the limited information on the costs of the reforms during the consultation period and on the publication of the Bill make it difficult to assess the impact&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is surprising that the same government that spent 3&nbsp;years testing EMAs&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para6">

</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in more than 50&nbsp;local authority areas is introducing a reform&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para8">
also costing a lot of money, without testing it, and with only one year&#039;s implementation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para9">
That is very gently worded. The chief executive makes a number of other serious points about the risk of fraud and the need for good advice for young people, and the danger that the Bill could make obtaining such advice more difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para10">
I have raised all those points not because I want to oppose the Bill, but because I want to encourage the Government to think more clearly about the questions that they are asking civil servants in order to justify it here. I am sorry we have not been told enough to be able to make an informed judgment on whether the money involved will be used effectively. There is much in the Bill that gives us pause for thought, and much that may cause concern among those on the ground. There is a lack of clarity about the Government&#039;s destination. A page in one of their consultation documents refers to &quot;the long-term vision&quot;, and provides about 100&nbsp;words on the subject and a rather curious diagram. That does not constitute a long-term vision worthy of the name, and again there is a lack of clarity about the Bill&#039;s likely effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para11">
Let me end with a point which, although highly controversial, needs to be made time and again. How on earth can a Treasury Minister be presenting a spending 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1064</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>measure? It is extraordinary that the Treasury should be both gamekeeper and poacher, responsible for controlling public spending and at the same time arrogating to itself the power to write very large cheques.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para12">
It does not surprise me at all that the No. 10&nbsp;policy unit, and, we are told, the Prime Minister and John Birt, are working together vigorously to create an effective public expenditure control system for implementation in the event of Labour winning the election and the present Chancellor being moved to another job. Perhaps part of the reason for our inability to obtain clear answers to the questions I have asked this afternoon is the fact that we have a Department that is not suited to such tasks. An Inland Revenue Department is trying to run part of the benefits system. That inevitably leads to the question whether the right people are doing the right things in the Government. All sorts of problems concerning not only the implementation of policy, but whether policy is being devised intelligently and sensibly, will occur down the line.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Has my hon. Friend looked through the records to find the last time the Treasury produced a child benefit Bill? It would be more normal for another Department to perform that function&#151;or have I been here too long and missed something?
</p>





<p><a name="50203-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Tyrie: </b> 
 That question contains an element of elegant disingenuousness. My right hon. Friend knows that the existence of such a Bill is most unlikely.

</p>





<p><a name="50203-27_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may have been here when child benefit was transferred to the Treasury, and I do not remember the Conservative party opposing that legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Tyrie: </b> 
 I am certainly challenging that legislation now, and I have the strong support of the No. 10&nbsp;policy unit, John Birt and probably the Prime Minister. The Paymaster General will be pleased to hear that I am coming to the end of my remarks, because we have moved on to a sensitive subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para13">
I wonder whether we have succeeded in getting to the bottom of the exact effects of spending the &#163;200&nbsp;million. I have my doubts whether we even know within a factor of about 50&nbsp;per cent. how much the measure will cost, which should be a cause for concern. On this occasion, the concern is not sufficient to divide the House on Third Reading, but we will certainly keep a close eye on both costs and value for money.

<a name="50203-27_time0"><h5>4.51&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-27_spnew7"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 I reaffirm my hon. Friends&#039; broad support for the Bill, which, as the Paymaster General said, is &quot;small but useful&quot;. If my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) were here, I am sure that he would confirm what the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said about the civilised and thoughtful way in which the legislation has progressed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1065</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para14">
Having read <i>Hansard</i>, it seems to me that there are two underlying reasons why the Bill was introduced, and merits support. The first reason concerns broad grounds of equity and fairness. A group of people who are not in formal education have been arbitrarily excluded from child benefit, and the Bill rectifies that unjust situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para15">
The second reason concerns the promotion of training. In her speeches on Second and Third Reading, the Paymaster General relied heavily on that argument. Broad support clearly exists for the idea that we, as a country, should do more training, but it is not clear whether the Bill will encourage training in general. Most of the people who will receive those benefits would be in training anyway. As the hon. Member for Chichester said, a dead-weight cost problem exists, and we do not know the extent to which the Bill will incentivise training. If the Bill incentivises training, however, that is a desirable and positive outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para16">
I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Chichester said about the underlying weaknesses. We do not know the consequences of the proposed changes, and a great deal of uncertainty exists. The regulatory impact assessments were not massively helpful either on the facts or in analysing the economic consequences. We can probably isolate various behavioural changes that could take place, some of which are desirable and some of which are not. The desirable changes include the possibility that people will be encouraged to leave economic inactivity or unemployment and enter training or education as a result of the Bill, which would benefit everybody. As a result of removing the previous discrimination, people may be tempted to leave formal education and enter vocational training, which, given how the situation has been distorted in the past, is almost certainly desirable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para17">
Another change, which is neither necessarily good nor necessarily bad, is that people will be encouraged to move out of unapproved schemes into Government-approved ones, simply because of the definition issue, which we discussed earlier. Another possible and probably less desirable change is that some people might be encouraged to move out of work and into training. That could be a good thing if they were investing in their long-term knowledge capital; equally, there could be a loss to the economy and to the Treasury. So there is a mixture of gains and losses, and as the hon. Member for Chichester emphasised, we do not really know what the net effect will be. We will doubtless have to return to this issue in the next Parliament.

Finally, as has already been pointed out, the immense complexity of the benefit system is extremely intimidating, particularly for those of us who have come to the Bill rather late. The Bill touches on but one tiny corner of that complexity. The argument about the proliferation of benefits and tax credits has been well rehearsed in many quarters. There are many unforeseen

<br>&nbsp;<br>consequences of such proliferation, not all of which are desirable. On balance, this legislation probably helps, because child benefit is not means-tested and, unlike many selective measures, it does not have the perverse effect of providing disincentives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-27_para19">
In the next Parliament we will have to have a major look at the proliferation of tax credits and benefits, the unintended consequences of which are often severe and very negative. Ministers often plaintively ask why they do not get more credit for all the good things that they are doing in helping to tackle child poverty, for example. One reason is that many of our constituents simply cannot comprehend the complex system that they have to grapple with. They have to wander through a quagmire of complication, so the system will have to be simplified. The Bill deals with only one corner of that much bigger problem. That said, broadly speaking this is useful legislation. Unanswered questions remain, but I am happy to subscribe to the Bill and to support it.

<a name="50203-28_head1"><h3 align=center>Pyser SGI Ltd. (Export Licence)</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question put</i>, That this House do now adjourn<i>.&#151;[Mr. Ainger.]</i>

<a name="50203-28_time1"><h5>4.57&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-28_spnew1"><b> Sir John Stanley  (Tonbridge and Malling) (Con):</b> 
 The company Pyser SGI Ltd., which is in my constituency, is a truly remarkable success story. Although it employs fewer than 100&nbsp;people in Edenbridge and Tonbridge, it is not only the last remaining UK manufacturer of night vision equipment for police forces, but a world beater. It sold its night vision monocular not only to UK police forces but to forces around the world, including, most conspicuously, the Athens police force for their protection of last year&#039;s Olympic games. That was a very significant export achievement for a small British company.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para6">
Not surprisingly, and commendably, Pyser SGI, following its sales success during the Athens Olympics, wisely decided to see whether it could make its way into the market in China, in advance of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. In order to do so, the company decided to exhibit its night vision equipment in the China police exhibition that was held in Beijing in June last year. For that purpose, it needed an export licence; it applied to the Department of Trade and Industry and received one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para7">
At the exhibition in Beijing last year, the company received a number of orders, including one from the Shanghai police, who wanted to trial the night vision equipment with a view to placing a much larger follow-on order. That trial and order also required an export licence from the DTI for exactly the same piece of equipment that had been exhibited in the Beijing police exhibition in June last year. The company applied for an export licence, but was astounded to find that it was refused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para8">
The grounds for the refusal were that the night vision monocular fell within the EU arms embargo on China and that it might&#151;I stress the word &quot;might&quot;&#151;be used for internal repression. I shall come on later to whether the grounds for refusal were indeed valid. For the moment, I want to make two important, wider points that relate to the particular case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para9">
First, the company was meted out pretty poor treatment by the DTI when it granted export licences for equipment to be shown at an exhibition, without at the same time disclosing to the company that, if orders were obtained from buyers in the country where the exhibition was held, there was no possibility of a subsequent export licence being granted. That puts a British company in a false trading position. Pyser-SGI clearly feels&#151;I think reasonably&#151;that it was led up the garden path by the DTI. It expended a substantial sum by exhibiting at the Beijing police exhibition last year and now that it has secured orders in China for the very equipment that it exhibited, it has found that the export licence has been refused. At no previous point was that possibility disclosed by the DTI.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-28_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths) </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>





<p><a name="50203-28_spnew2"><b> Sir John Stanley: </b> 
 I will give way to the Minister in a moment. I believe that the DTI should seriously 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1068</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reconsider its policy because the present procedure is neither reasonable nor fair to British companies, particularly the smaller ones such as Pyser-SGI.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-28_spnew3"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 This particular company was not mislead. In common with many other companies, it is perfectly well aware that the export of products in their safe hands for demonstration purposes and their return to Britain does not guarantee that those products can be released subsequently elsewhere. That has been made perfectly clear to the industry. In my time as Minister, I have received no representations from the Defence Manufacturers Association about this particular issue, so there has been no doubt about the policy.
</p>





<p><a name="50203-28_spnew4"><b> Sir John Stanley: </b> 
 I am well aware of those points. I wholly accept that the DTI protects itself by saying that, just because it provides a licence for an exhibition, it does not mean that a further export licence will automatically follow. However, my point&#151;I hope that the Minister will, on reflection, consider it&#151;is that when the particular piece of equipment exhibited is equipment that his officials know perfectly well is unlikely to receive an export licence if orders are obtained, the Department has some responsibility at least to issue a warning of that likelihood to the company concerned. I hope that the Minister will reflect further on that important point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para10">
Secondly, I hope that the EU will not enter into arms embargoes that are defined as seriously inadequately as is the present embargo on China. I appreciate entirely that the present Government did not enter into that embargo. The previous Conservative Government did, along with EU member states, in the immediate aftermath of Tiananmen square. The embargo was declared at the Madrid European Council meeting of June 1989, and its wording is as follows:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para11">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In present circumstances, the European Council thinks it necessary to adopt the following measures&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para12">
Six measures are listed, of which the relevant one states:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para13">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Interruption by the member states of the Community of military cooperation and an embargo on trade in arms with China&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para14">
That is all that the embargo says. It contains no definition of what constitute &quot;arms&quot;. That interpretation was left entirely up to individual member states. Not surprisingly, that created a very unsatisfactory&#151;I would call it extremely unfair&#151;situation in the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para15">
Individual EU Governments apply wholly different interpretations of what constitute arms in terms of the EU&#039;s arms embargo on China. At one end of the scale, the French Government&#151;predictably&#151;interpret the embargo in a way that is extremely generous to French arms exporting companies. At the other end of the scale, the British Government interpret the embargo in a way that is extremely restrictive for our arms exporting companies. The result, of course, is that British firms lose out. As a general point, I hope that, in the future, the EU will not declare an arms embargo in terms that are so deeply unsatisfactory and highly generalised, and which are open to widely varying national interpretations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para16">
I turn now to the particular case of the Pyser SGI monocular equipment, export approval for which was refused on the grounds that it might be used for internal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1069</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>repression. I want to make clear where I stand on human rights and China. I regard that country as a highly repressive state, and a serious violator of human rights. It still persecutes people who offer political criticism or any form or political opposition, and those who are fighting to establish free trade unions there. It also persecutes people who have non-political beliefs, such as members of the Falun Gong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para17">
Both in this and the previous Parliament, I have strongly criticised this Government&#039;s policy, which I consider to be far too soft, in respect of China&#039;s human rights record. That remains my position, but in this case we are dealing not with that general issue but with the very specific question of whether it is sensible and reasonable to think that the Pyser SGI night vision monocular equipment might be used by the Shanghai police as a major instrument of internal repression. I shall turn my attention to that in the next section of my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para18">
To provide some perspective on the refusal decision, if we use some sadistic imagination, it is not, I am afraid, impossible to think of a huge number of items manufactured in the UK that could conceivably be used as instruments of internal repression. I could go round my constituency&#151;I am sure the Minister could do the same in his constituency&#151;and visit Homebase, B&Q and builders&#039; merchants in Tonbridge to buy nails, screws, hacksaws, power drills, chains and other goods that, in the wrong hands, could be used for internal repression. Such items are not covered by any form of export licensing procedure. Turning to the night vision monocular itself, I have brought one with me, and if the Minister is interested, I will give him a brief demonstration after our debate. He can see that it is an inoffensive piece of optical equipment. There are four key questions that the Government should ask before making a final decision about whether to grant an export licence to Pyser SGI so that it can export it to China.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para19">
First, is the piece of equipment meant for military use, and is it constructed to a military specification? The answer is no, it is not a military piece of equipment, and is not on the common military list of the European Union, which lists all the equipment covered by the European code of conduct on arms exports. The monocular is deemed to be of dual use, which is why it is caught up in the export licensing system. I stress, however, that it is not a military list item.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para20">
Secondly, the Government should ask whether the end user certificate provided by the Shanghai police on the purposes for which the night vision monocular is to be used is satisfactory. I have brought with me a copy of the end user certificate, signed by the chief inspector of the Shanghai police and the chief of the equipment department. The certificate asks:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para21">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Please set out the specific purposes for which the goods are to be used&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para22">
The chief inspector replied:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para23">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The goods are used in criminal investigation department of Shanghai public security bureau. They are in charge of drug enforcement and anti-terrorist operation. They are member of Interpol. They provide security support for Shanghai World Expo 2010.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para24">
We in Britain, including, I am sure, the British Government, are as much in favour of drug enforcement, for which the equipment is to be used, as 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1070</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Shanghai police. We in Britain conduct our own anti-terrorist operations, and have taken the most far-reaching powers for centuries to deal with terrorists, including imprisonment without trial and now, under the Government&#039;s proposals, a new system of house arrest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para25">
The police of this country, like the Shanghai police, are members of Interpol. We in this country, again like the Shanghai police, are very much in favour of there being proper security at Shanghai World Expo in 2010. I put it to the Minister that the purposes for which the equipment is to be used seem fully in line with Government policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para26">
My third question is: should the licence be refused simply because the piece of equipment is going to a Chinese police force? If the British Government&#039;s position was that Chinese police forces, wherever located in China, were, in human rights terms, wholly unacceptable organisations&#151;if they were some sort of latter-day Gestapo&#151;it would be perfectly reasonable to refuse them an export licence for any equipment. However, that is not the British Government&#039;s position. Indeed, their position is quite the reverse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para27">
I have been advised by Pyser SGI that the Metropolitan police are engaged in training, in Britain, police officers from China in drug enforcement. That training obviously has the approval of the British Government, including Foreign Office approval. It is funded by British taxpayers, and as I have already made clear, drug enforcement is one of the very purposes for which Pyser SGI is seeking an export licence for equipment for the Shanghai police. It seems extraordinarily perverse that, here in the UK, the Metropolitan police are training Chinese police in drug enforcement while the British Government are refusing a British company an export licence for equipment that would assist the Shanghai police in China in dealing with drug enforcement. Even more ironic is the fact that the Metropolitan police certainly include in their training some form of night training for the Chinese police in dealing with drug traffickers, and that will involve the use of night vision equipment&#151;possibly the very equipment for which the DTI is refusing Pyser SGI an export licence for the Shanghai police. There are no grounds to say that the export licence should be refused simply because the equipment is going to the Chinese police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para28">
My fourth and final question is the clincher. Is the UK, in refusing the export licence, following the same policy as other European Union member states on that item of equipment? If the British Government were following the same refusal policy as other EU member countries, I would have no difficulty in accepting that that was EU policy and that Britain should go along with it&#151;but that is not the case. In fact, the position is the reverse. If the UK was following the same policy on the equipment as that of other EU member states, the British Government should have given Pyser SGI an export licence on the nod, because companies in other EU member states have no difficulty whatever in obtaining approval for export licences for such equipment from their respective Governments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para29">
I now want to come to the detail of that key point. Three EU member states manufacture such night vision equipment for police forces: Britain, the Netherlands and France. Let me turn, then, to what is the practice in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1071</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Netherlands and France. The Dutch company involved is called Delft Electronic Products, and the key piece of equipment is called the image intensifier, which is fitted in the middle of the night vision monocular and is the key engine that drives the equipment. Delft Electronic Products has had no problem at all in getting export licences from the Dutch Government to export that item to China. Indeed, the Dutch company has gone even further than making simple, direct exports to China: it has entered into the joint licensed production of the image intensifier with a Chinese company&#151;North Night Vision Technology Co. Ltd. in Beijing. That company is now manufacturing under licence from the Dutch the image intensifiers for which the British Government are refusing to grant an export licence to Pyser SGI.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para30">
The situation is even more extraordinary in France, where Pyser SGI has two competitor companies, the first of which is called Photonis. Like Delft Electronic Products in the Netherlands, Photonis had no difficulty in getting export licences for its image intensifiers from the French Government. Even more extraordinary is the position of the second French company, Thales Angenieux. Again, with the approval of the French Government, that company has entered into another licensed production agreement with North Night Vision Technology Co. Ltd. in Beijing that involves an even more sophisticated piece of equipment&#151;a night vision goggle, called LUCIE&#151;than that for which Pyser SGI has been seeking export licence approval from the DTI.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para31">
Most significantly, that French item, which is now under joint production with the Chinese in Beijing, is specifically stated to be for not only civilian but military use. Indeed, I have with me a copy of the sales particulars issued by North Night Vision Technology Co. Ltd.&#151;they are partly in Chinese, but happily for me, partly in English as well&#151;and the relevant couple of sentences read:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para32">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This new concept of multi-purposes night vision goggles LUCIE-NVT has been developed by THALES ANGENIEUX, assembled and exclusively sales in China by North Night Vision Technology Co. Ltd (NVT)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. LUCIE-NVT offers, at the lowest price, 3&nbsp;magnifications (1x, 4x and 6x) and is fully in accordance with military & civilian specifications.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para33">
I stress to the Minister that our EU partners are following a totally different interpretation of the EU arms embargo on China and are selling competitive products with the full approval of their respective Governments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para34">
May I say to the Minister that although I am sure that he has on his knee a nice speech that has been dutifully drafted by his officials to justify the refusal decision that has been taken, I hope, having listened to my remarks, that he will on reflection put his prepared speech on hold, consider the points that I have made and perhaps discuss the matter with his colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para35">
The facts are these. First, if the decision stands, the UK&#039;s only manufacturer of night vision monoculars for police forces will be put out of business in the major export market of China, and perhaps other markets as well. Secondly, I must put it to the Minister that it will make not one jot or tittle of difference to internal repression in China if the Pyser SGI monocular is sold, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1072</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because if it is not sold by Pyser SGI, the Shanghai police will have no difficultly whatever buying it elsewhere. The third inescapable commercial reality is that if the British Government continue their present policy, Pyser SGI&#039;s Dutch and French competitors will simply be laughing all the way to the bank at the expense of a British company.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-28_para36">
This export licence decision is political correctness gone absolutely mad. It defies common sense and practicality on the ground, and it is directly contrary to British economic and employment interests. I am in no doubt that the refusal decision should be reversed, and I trust that the Minister will consider the case that I have made for that reversal and achieve just that.

<p><a name="50203-29_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) on securing the debate on my refusal to grant a licence for Pyser SGI to export a night vision monocular and a night intensification module to China. I have a reputation for putting prepared speeches on hold, so let me thank him for giving me the opportunity to explain to the House the steps that I have taken to ensure that we have one of the most robust export licence regimes anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para0">
Our export licensing commitments are clear. We assess each export licence application on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU export licensing criteria and our own national arms export licensing criteria. We take fully into consideration the circumstances prevailing at the time. In addition, we reserve the right to impose our own stricter criteria in line with Government policy. If it is judged that an export is inconsistent with any of the criteria, the application is refused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para1">
We take the criteria very seriously. The case was refused under criterion 1, which covers international embargos and, on appeal, also under criterion 2, which refers to the possibility of internal repression. There is an EU embargo on arms to China, which we in the UK interpret as including the export of any goods that might be used for internal repression.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para2">
The manufacturer made the following statement in its letter of 13&nbsp;September:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para3">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are wholly and totally unable to fathom how it might be in any way conceivable, practical or technically possible to make use of either of these items of equipment for &#039;internal repression&#039; purposes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para4">
Let me explain why that is, in fact, possible. The night vision monocular can be strapped to a helmet to free hands for other tasks, and the night intensification module can be fitted to a camera to provide night vision capabilities. Of course, as the right hon. Member said, the items can be used legitimately, but they can also be used to enhance significantly the capabilities of internal security forces to conduct repressive night raids on civilians. It is frankly disingenuous for anyone in the business to claim otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para5">
I am pleased that the world-class reputation of our police services ensures that they are training other police forces and achieving improvements in other countries. However, providing night vision equipment along with that is not the same as providing shirts, uniforms and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Feb 2005 : Column 1073</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>boots. Let me be clear: although the case was refused initially only under criterion 1, had the embargo not been in place the clear risk that the goods would be used for internal repression would have led me to refuse the export under criterion 2&nbsp;of the consolidated criteria, which also relates to internal repression.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para6">
I shall set out why the goods were refused an export licence, even though an export licence was given for the temporary export of a limited sample of the goods to accompany the exporter to an exhibition in China for demonstration purposes. The terms of a temporary export licence are strict: they usually require the goods to remain in the possession of the exporter at all times, and usually seek guarantees of their return to the UK For those reasons, temporary licences do not raise the same issues as permanent ones&#151;and exporters know that. We make it clear at all stages to all exporters, including the right hon. Member&#039;s constituents, that the granting of an export licence so that they can demonstrate their goods never guarantees that a permanent export licence will be granted. The exhibition in question was open to non-Chinese customers, so there was no reason to deny a licence to exhibit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para7">
Last year, the DTI&#039;s export control organisation held 14&nbsp;regional workshops and four seminars to raise exporters&#039; awareness of our controls. With permanent exports, as the goods will remain in the destination country unsupervised, the end use and end user of the goods must be carefully considered, together with the nature and capability of the goods and other relevant factors. Our foremost commitment is to ensure that exports are managed responsibly and in line with the UK&#039;s national and international commitments. I know that the right hon. Member shares that commitment and does not wish to advocate that trade interests should override matters of human rights and proliferation. The Government&#039;s serious concerns about the human rights situation in China have been made clear. When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary briefed Parliament&#039;s Quadripartite Committee on 12&nbsp;January, he stated that although the human rights situation in China has certainly eased, we are in no way satisfied that it is now fully acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50203-29_para8">
To assist exporters in assessing whether they should devote resources to securing overseas contracts, the Government openly provide as much information as possible to help them to undertake risk assessment on where to target their resources. The FCO website contains extensive detail on current policy restrictions and country-specific concerns, including the fact that the goods in question are contained on the EU list of dual-use equipment, which might be used for internal repression. The right hon. Member&#039;s constituents can have been in no doubt about the matter. I have ensured that the export control organisation&#039;s website now contains breakdowns of refusal rates and processing times by destination.

The right hon. Member has raised the case directly with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Foreign Secretary. He asks the valid question whether our regime is more strict than that of other countries. Let me tell the House that every

<br>&nbsp;<br>EU member state is committed to considering export licence applications against the binding EU code of conduct on arms exports or against any EU or UN embargoes. To ensure that no country grants a licence without realising that such a licence might have been refused by another member state, we have an EU-wide denial notification system, which ensures that refusal in one state is noted in every state. If the right hon. Member has further evidence about specific identical equipment having been supplied to the end user in China&#151;I understand that he might have more details&#151;that can be investigated.

 During my speech, I quoted from the sales literature that referred directly to sales of LUCIE-NVT night vision binoculars carried out with the approval of the French Government. I quoted the documentary evidence.

 The right hon. Member is right. He quoted the evidence. I asked whether we can have it, and I am sure he will supply it to us.

 The evidence from which I quoted has already been supplied to the Minister&#039;s Department and was in the appeal documentation submitted to his Department by Pyser SGI.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Member for mentioning that. The evidence was therefore taken fully into consideration. His letter to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary of 11&nbsp;January has helped to inform this debate. I have, however, made it clear where we stand. Our refusal must be noted by other states. If they have chosen to take a different course of action, they must answer for that, as I must answer to the House for our actions to date.

Since 1997, we have refused 58&nbsp;standard individual export licences to China. That figure does not include many more export requests that never reached the licensing stage because the advice would have been given that they would certainly be refused. The case raised by the right hon. Member is an important example that highlights the effectiveness of the UK&#039;s export licensing system. We are working with our EU partners to make the system even more effective because we see the code of conduct as a key element in controlling defence exports.

The right hon. Member told my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in the letter that I mentioned a moment ago:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have been critical in the House of both the British Government and the EU generally on not being sufficiently robust towards the Chinese on human rights&quot;.</p>

The Government do not entirely accept that judgment, and I make no apology for taking appropriate measures to prevent the supply of equipment which we judge may be used for human rights abuses. I hope that the right hon. Member shares my view.
