 Does the Secretary of State realise how offensive his remarks are to those of us who firmly believe in democracy?

 Those elected to this House are entitled to participate in all of its proceedings, debates and votes. On his website, the hon. Gentleman makes the point that we need to preserve the British constitution. Our constitutional settlement is currently asymmetrical, but the principle that there should be one class of MP that participates in all proceedings is sound.

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Scottish public have no interest in the West Lothian question, apart from remembering that English Tories imposed the poll tax on Scotland? The Tories object to Scottish MPs participating in English business, but Tory Members are participating in Scottish questions as usual. We do not object to that&#151;in fact, we welcome it&#151;because every time English Tories take part in Scottish questions, support for Labour in Scotland goes up.

 I agree with my hon. Friend. I have no objection to MPs participating in any proceedings. I see that the Conservative spokesman, the hon.

In June last year, he voted on special schools and special education, NHS dentistry, council tax and licensing, all of which affect England. I would be interested to know when he established his great principle of not voting on English matters.

 I think that my hon. Friend will find that the nationalists vote when it suits them&#151;there is no issue of principle at all. The big difference between us and them is that they want to break up the United Kingdom. The Conservatives should think very hard before they go down that road.

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am trying to work out which one of his leadership candidates he will be supporting, since I have not heard such a clear exposition of a principled position for some time. The key principle is that we are all elected to the House of Commons in the same way and are all entitled to take part in all the proceedings and Divisions. Once that changes and there are two classes of MPs, there are profound constitutional consequences. What we have from the Conservatives is sheer, naked opportunism. I do not know whether the hon.

Given that it took some time for that fund to get going, through no fault of the Government, will my hon.

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the progress that he is making with his private Member&#039;s Bill, which will make a considerable contribution to the debate. I understand that the Committee considering it has a further sitting this afternoon. He is right to highlight the Government&#039;s commitment to marine renewables. I welcome, as he does, the announcement on 8 February by the Minister for Energy of a &#163;50 million marine renewable development fund, building on the &#163;25 million that has already been made available. The company that my hon. Friend mentions, Ocean Power Delivery, has already benefited from some &#163;3.2 million of this development money.

<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="60228-04_spnew1"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. There are probably more than half a million Londoners who are eligible to vote at the forthcoming council elections, but who will be unable to do so because they are not on the electoral register. The important thing is for electoral administrators in all boroughs to find those hard-to-register voters. This is not, by and large, a problem associated with white home owners aged over 55; rather, it is associated more with young members of black and minority ethnic groups who live in private rented accommodation. That is the information given to us by the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Electoral Commission, and all electoral administrators in London need to work on this issue.

Those Opposition Members who do not represent inner-city areas, where there are very low levels of registration, might not understand the true position in the way that we do. The point is that our democracy is worth its name only if it is equal, and at the moment it is not equal.

There are 239 constituencies in this country that diverge by more than 10 per cent. from the national average.

 I should like to thank the boundary commission for the very difficult work that it does. It is not party political, and every hon.

The smallest UK constituency&#151;Na h-Eileanan an Iar, in Scotland, formerly the Western Isles&#151;has only 23,000 electors because it is an island. However, the largest has 107,000 electors, but that is also because it is an island. We must take account of geographical factors, and I hope that the hon.

That is a more important question. Merely to equalise the number of people registered would discriminate against people in the inner cities and those who live in private rented accommodation or houses of multiple occupation or belong to the black and ethnic minority communities. All of those people are less likely to register in practice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="60228-04_spnew10"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The boundary commission bases its estimate of a constituency&#039;s size on the number of registered electors. If 500,000 possible electors were missing from the register in London, for example, that total would amount to the number of voters in eight parliamentary constituencies. My hon.

However, a party that gains the majority of voters in England but ends up with 93 fewer seats cannot say that the system is fair. We need a system that is genuinely fair, so that first past the post works, rather than a flawed proportional representation system. Should not the boundary commission rules be changed so that there is a fixed electoral quota in constituencies across the UK? The Minister may say that the country has plenty of islands, but in reality there are not that many. An equal quota should be the general rule, and the boundary commission&#039;s rules need to be changed.

 Would my hon.

Health services, the police, the education services and many others are involved in that battle, so can we ensure that the criminal justice system also plays its full part?

 The House of Commons Accommodation and Works Committee approved the construction of the canopy in March 2004, after the estates directorates of the House had identified the need to cover the walkway along the east side of Star Chamber Court following the review of access and security arrangements for visitors to the Palace, which led to the plans for the new visitor reception area. The Parliamentary Works Services Directorate developed the brief and design for the canopy in consultation with English Heritage and Westminster city council under grade I listed building and world heritage site status. The requirements of those consultations led to the costs of the project working out at much more than originally anticipated.

 We have every intention of improving the scrutiny by the House. Indeed, the House has been divided on the issue. The European Scrutiny Committee, by the narrowest of margins, made a recommendation on which it changed its mind. That gave problems to the members of other Committees who were considering the issue. So it is not quite as simple as perhaps some hon. Members would make out, but there is the desire to ensure proper scrutiny. Many hon.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The House is familiar with the many issues surrounding the Traveller population and the local uproar that arises, particularly in rural areas, when a group of Travellers arrive with one or more caravans and set up home on land which they do not own. Such land may be owned by public authorities, most often the county council, or privately owned. Fences and gates can often be broken to gain access. While the Travellers remain, they frequently desecrate the surrounding area, cutting down fences and trees for fires and then leaving piles of rubbish and detritus, sometimes including human excrement. The costs of clearing it all up fall on the local taxpayer or the individual owner of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I am sure that I am not the only one to have had numerous cases of that in my constituency. Recently, in the small village of Swaffham Prior, Travellers camped on the village playing field, preventing the football club from using it and costing the parish council more than &#163;4,000 the first time to clear up and &#163;1,600 the second time in legal fees to get them evicted and to clear up. That is unacceptable. A direct consequence is that property owners, including local authorities, have to take action to prevent access. Large unsightly mounds of earth or rubble are put in gateways and farmers use redundant machinery to block access to their fields. Why should law-abiding people have to do those things?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The House will be well aware that Cambridgeshire is particularly affected by unauthorised encampments. Some say that that is for historical reasons deriving from casual labour for fruit and vegetable harvesting, but a minimal number of Travellers, if any, are engaged in such activities today. A far more likely reason for the large number of Travellers in the county is that successive Government policies have created a honeypot effect. While the Government use half-yearly counts of unauthorised sites to indicate demand, it is inevitable that it can never be satisfied. The Travellers know that and therefore go to the areas where the problem is greatest, in full knowledge that the Government will then put pressure on the local council to provide more sites. Nowhere is that more obvious than in south Cambridgeshire. In the past two years, the number of unauthorised sites has risen by 63 per cent., yet the number of authorised sites has also risen. Last July, at the time of the last count, in the whole of the eastern region there were 325 unauthorised sites on land not owned by Gypsies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Before I go any further I want to make two specific points. First, most Members of the House know that the village of Cottenham is my constituency. Unfortunately, it has received a considerable amount of unwelcome publicity over the past few years as the result of a substantial incursion by Irish Travellers. However, this Bill is not directed at that issue because those Travellers own the land, and the problems there are issues of planning and enforcement. The second point follows from that&#151;namely, that not all Travellers cause the problems that I have described. Inevitably, there are generalisations, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 131</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>illegal encampments, however tidy, must be stopped. In Cottenham, whatever the planning issues, the pitches are generally clean and tidy, although it has to be said that the surrounding area appears to suffer, and certainly a privately owned orchard has been destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">There have been a number of attempts by successive Governments to resolve those problems, some designed to help, some to hinder, but few, I am afraid, have made any difference. Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 makes it an offence to drive a vehicle more than 15 yd from the highway on to private land without consent, yet there have been few, if any, prosecutions. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gives police officers the power to move on Travellers if the landowner has asked them to leave, and the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 slightly strengthened that legislation as a result of amendments tabled by myself. Yet in the last three years there have been no prosecutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">It is clear to me that more must be done. In doing so, we should look at Ireland, which has addressed the problem robustly. In 2002, the Irish Government made trespass a criminal offence. The result for them was as expected: the problem reduced significantly. The result for us was unexpected&#151;it led to a significant increase in the number of Irish Travellers in Britain. I quote from a letter that I received only this morning from an individual who had seen the publicity surrounding my presentation of the Bill:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;My wife, who is of Irish descent, and myself often holiday in the Republic where the Irish people cannot believe their good fortune to be getting rid of their problem. There are thousands of these gypsies wanting to come to the UK&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Even allowing for a little exaggeration, that underlines the problem as seen from the Irish perspective.

 The purpose of the amendments is to ensure a consistent approach to the devolved Administrations of the United Kingdom. Such consistency has not been evident in much of the debate&#151;we seem to have moved away from the idea that there should be a coherent approach to the devolved Administrations. In Spain, there is something that is often called &quot;asymmetric devolution,&quot; whereby different parts of the country are governed in different ways, but I do not accept that difference is needed for difference&#039;s sake.

<a name="60228-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">In Scotland for the past six and a half years, the clear and accepted description of the Administration in the Scottish Parliament has been &quot;the Scottish Executive.&quot; Were the equivalent body in Northern Ireland fully functioning, it would be called &quot;the Northern Ireland Executive&quot;.

<a name="60228-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">To have a coherent system throughout the United Kingdom, with a Scottish Executive, a Northern Ireland Executive and a Welsh Executive, would allow and promote better understanding of what the Executives do, compared with the Assembly or Parliaments. Indeed, it would also assist debates in this House, because hon. Members&#039; references to &quot;the Executive&quot; would be clearer. A degree of coherence that has not previously been evident would be brought to the whole package if the amendments were made.

<a name="stpa_15">As I am sure the Minister knows, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs thought that &quot;Executive&quot; was a better term than &quot;Assembly Government&quot;.

 Briefly, the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) has made a coherent case for the amendment, but I counsel him against building up his hopes, as the hallmark of this Government on naming things is inconsistency. He will recall the debate in which the Government opposed a proposal to call the Welsh Assembly the Welsh Senedd, because they were worried that the public would mix up the political institution with the building. We now have the Welsh Assembly in a Welsh Senedd building, which is typical of the fuzzy logic that we have come to expect on naming. Here is my tuppenny-worth: consistency is needed, but we should also accept that we are aiming to establish a Welsh Government.

 My hon. Friend will agree that it is important that the people of Wales should be able to distinguish between the Government and the Welsh Assembly. Too often, the Assembly has taken the blame for poor action by the Government. That contrasts with the golden age of Welsh devolution, in which a Liberal Democrat-led coalition delivered for Wales. The Labour Government, however, do not deliver for Wales.

 My hon.

He makes an important point, too, about the need to differentiate between the Government of Wales and the Assembly as an institution.

Names are important&#151;we know that is the case in Wales, which has a logocentric culture&#151;because they are part of the means by which people understand their political institutions.

It is a misnomer and we should take the opportunity offered by the Bill to bury it. We do not have a United Kingdom Parliament Government. We do not have a Scottish Parliament Government.

One of the great challenges of the devolved arrangements is the attempt, particularly under Labour stewardship, to tie in the institution with the Government, and to channel towards the institution any form of public dissatisfaction with the Government.

The ability of Committees to function with a number of non-governmental or Presiding Officer&#039;s Members would leave in the mid-40s the number of Members who are available for Committee work.

 In proportional terms it is not very different from what happens here in Westminster, so I am not as concerned as the hon. Gentleman on that score. However, it is rather ridiculous for Deputy Ministers to be paid to be part of the payroll vote, while at the same being allowed to act as Back Benchers. If all those positions are taken up, we shall have an enormous, overbearing, burgeoning administrative, and rather centralist, Welsh Assembly. How can the Minister justify an arrangement that seems to muddy the waters between Back Benchers and payroll, which, as other Members have said, we would simply not tolerate in the House of Commons?

 I am conscious of your suggestion that we concentrate on the amendments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I will do so, but I want to say a little about Members&#039; comments on whether there will be enough Assembly Members to scrutinise and hold the Assembly Government to account. I also want to say something about the point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) about the role of Deputy Minister.

<a name="stpa_34">Welsh Members will know what the Presiding Officer, in particular, has said about what will happen after the enactment of part 3 and, possibly, part 4, and about the need for Assembly Members&#039; roles to take account of the additional work that they will be required to do. The Presiding Officer has said that the Assembly should sit for four days a week rather than two. I think that that will cover the extra work load, and will go a long way towards meeting the understandable concerns of many Members about whether 60 Assembly Members will be able to perform the scrutiny role.

 May I first answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire about the role of Deputy Ministers?

I would expect the definition in Standing Orders to apply to Deputy Ministers, and given that Deputy Ministers will clearly be part of the Executive, I would not expect them to have the same role as an ordinary Back-Bench Assembly Member; but that is a matter for the Standing Orders.

Is that not the case?
</p>





<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60228-10_spnew11"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Not necessarily. As I have said, if the Assembly sat for four days a week rather than two, that would probably take account of the fact that four additional Members would no longer be available to sit on Committees.

 As the Minister says, discussions have turned on the proposal for the Assembly to sit for four days a week rather than two.

 The Minister is talking a lot of sense in proposing to increase the time that the Assembly sits from seven hours a week to four full days, but as Assembly Members have repeatedly said, they already work very hard when they are not there.

<a name="stpa_36">Let us move on the amendments before us. It is important to the Assembly&#039;s effective functioning that there be a limit on the size of the &quot;payroll vote&quot;, so clause 51 sets a statutory limit on the size of the    Government within the Assembly. The limit prescribed&#151;a combined total of no more than 12 Welsh Ministers and Deputy Welsh Ministers&#151;is consistent with the current arrangement. It seems to work now and I see no reason why it should not work post-May 2007.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60228-10_spnew16"><b> Mr. David Jones: </b>

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60228-10_spnew17"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The issue is not what percentage of the governing party is in government, but what percentage of the whole Assembly is in government. A considerable percentage of the Labour party is in government in this place, but the issue is the proportion of Parliament that is in government. I shall return to this point in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_37">Currently, there are eight Cabinet Ministers in the Assembly, in addition to the First Minister, and four Deputy Ministers. On comparing that figure with the UK Parliament, it is clear that it is not disproportionate. There are 90 Ministers, including Whips, and

<br>&nbsp;<br>51 Parliamentary Private Secretaries in the House of Commons&#151;21.8 per cent. of its total membership. Our proposed limit for the Assembly, taken together with the First Minister and the Counsel General, represents 23.3 per cent. of total Assembly membership if the Counsel General is also an Assembly Member, or 21.7 per cent. if he or she is not. So the proportion is very similar to that in this place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_38">In the light of that and of the Presiding Officer&#039;s suggestion&#151;it is supported by the First Minister&#151;that the Assembly sit post-May 2007 for considerably longer, there should be no problem with scrutiny. However, it is not necessary to limit the First Minister&#039;s discretion concerning the balance of Ministers and Deputy Ministers, as the amendment proposes. Should the Assembly have any concerns about the size of the pay bill, it will have powers over Welsh Ministers&#039; and Deputy Welsh Ministers&#039; salaries by virtue of clause 53. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.

 As I made clear to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) during my initial remarks, our probing amendment is designed to allow the sort of discussion that has indeed taken place, and which has proved very helpful. Although we have strayed into discussing what constitutes the appropriate number of Assembly Members, that issue will require further consideration. However, I take on board the point, made by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), about the benefit of the Welsh Assembly&#039;s working longer hours. Inevitably, the range of Committee activities will put disproportionate work loads on particular Members, although a rough calculation suggests that they are more likely to be Labour Back Benchers at this stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">It is important that the Deputy Minister role is clarified in the Standing Order process. The Scottish Parliament has provided the model for much of the discussion on this Bill, and Deputy Ministers there are not able to serve on Committees or ask questions in the Chamber. People understand that Deputy Ministers are part of the Executive&#151;or, in the Wales context, of the Welsh Assembly Government. The debate has made it clear that combining the two roles is unsatisfactory, and I hope that the Standing Orders will deal with the problem and clarify the position of Deputy Ministers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) noted, the office attracts a payment. The duties and responsibilities that go with that should mean that office holders are not able to move from being a member of the Government to being a Back Bencher as and when required.

This section appears to give Ministers the power to do anything for anybody, anywhere, at any time, and the only people sitting in judgment on that are themselves.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60228-12_spnew0"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady. I will try to respond to all the points that she made, but first I should give a clear explanation of clauses 60, 70 and 71. Clause 60, on the promotion of well-being, has been included so that, together with clauses 70 and 71, Welsh Ministers will have available to them the wide general powers that UK Ministers have inherently as Ministers of the Crown. That is known as the Ram doctrine, which was established, if my memory serves me right, on 2 November 1945.

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">Given the nature of the Welsh devolution settlement, we believe that those clauses are the best way to give Welsh Ministers comparable general powers within their responsibilities. That will remove the uncertainty that relates to section 40 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. The provisions will empower the Welsh Assembly Government to pursue a range of actions for which there is no specific statutory power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_64">The hon. Lady asked for certain examples of how such powers will be exercised. They could include, for example, taking action to promote sustainable development and joint working with other public bodies to improve public services. She asked about the environment, and the powers could include taking action to promote energy efficiency in Wales. Another 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 147</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>example is collaborating with other bodies, especially in the public sector, whose functions are not devolved&#151;for example, supporting the police in tackling drug-related issues. Hon. Members have raised such issues on a number of occasions at Welsh questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">A further example is providing appropriate information to prosecutors&#151;this perhaps relates to the hon. Lady&#039;s question about the Counsel General&#151;and regulatory bodies to assist them in considering whether to bringing cases to court. Another example is disseminating information that is of benefit to the public sector or the wider public&#151;for example, joining in a recent campaign on responding to civil emergencies. Those are examples where Ministers do not have the power to intervene to take executive action, but those issues are in line with the responsibilities of UK Ministers. Section 40 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 gives Welsh Ministers certain powers, but these clauses will clarify their roles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">The hon. Lady asked about clause 70 and whether European law would apply to the issuing of grants, state aid and so on.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60228-12_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Minister has given some examples, but what limits will be placed on those powers?
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60228-12_spnew2"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 First, there is a limit in that every bit of expenditure will be subject to the Audit Committee. The hon. Lady suggested that Ministers could offer mortgages to members of staff. Clearly, they would not be allowed to do that: the Audit Committee would jump most heavily on a Minister if such action was considered.

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60228-12_spnew4"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I shall come to the limits of the word &quot;anything&quot;, but I was responding to the question that the hon. Lady asked about European law. Clause 70 is subject to Community law rules on non-discrimination and the free movement of goods and services, so any action by a Welsh Minister will be constrained by Community law in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_67">The hon. Lady asked about limitations on the power of well-being. Other limits are already set out in the Bill&#151;for example, on human rights in clause 80, on Community law in clause 79 and on international obligations in clause 81.
</p>





<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60228-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Jones: </b> 
 I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) was expressing the concern that, on the face of it, these powers could exceed the powers that are conferred in relation to matters and fields that are devolved to Assembly Ministers. The Minister has already said that the powers would enable Assembly Ministers to exercise such functions &quot;within the area of their responsibility&quot;. However, that phrase does not appear in the Bill. Could the matter not be simply resolved and clarified by adopting the wording that my hon. Friend suggests or that the Minister himself has just used?
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60228-12_spnew6"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I used that phrase because the Minister for Economic Development and Transport might, for example, want to start giving grant aid to a theatre 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 148</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>company that wanted to tour in Europe. That is certainly a distinct possibility and it would be good to promote Wales in that way. The Welsh National Opera already does that. That is the reason why I used the phrase &quot;within their responsibilities&quot;. However, as in the case of UK Ministers, Assembly Ministers are not necessarily creatures of statute. They occasionally have to take Executive action that is outwith any legislative provision that they have. That is why we need the clauses in relation to well-being. This is not an unusual way of doing things. The Local Government Act 2000 already gives powers to local authorities to take action and expend money for the benefit and well-being of the people they serve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60228-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 Does the Minister recognise that the clause could give Assembly Ministers powers to exceed the powers that they already have by virtue of the devolution settlement? My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) expressed that concern, but the Minister has not adequately addressed it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60228-12_spnew8"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman does not feel that I have responded to him. All that we are trying to do with the clauses is provide the same powers that already exist in this place. Members do not complain about the additional powers that UK Ministers can exercise, even though Ministers have not got the right, by statute, to exercise those powers. I referred to the Ram doctrine earlier and although I will not bore the House by going through it, it gives a Minister the ability to exercise power when he feels that it is necessary, as long as he remains accountable to Parliament for those actions. Ministers in the Welsh Assembly will remain fully accountable to the Assembly for all their actions and any money that they expend, in exactly the same way in which UK Ministers are accountable to Parliament now.
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60228-12_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 Will the Minister tell me whether the provisions were included in the original Government of Wales Act 1998 and, if so, whether they were in exactly this form?
</p>





<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60228-12_spnew10"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The provisions were not in exactly this form, but we are putting them in this form because we are trying to clarify exactly what Ministers can do and what the limits are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_68">The hon. Lady also asked about the ability for a Minister to act outside Wales. I touched on a good example. If the Welsh National Opera was doing a major tour of Europe that could be used to promote Wales and help economic development and tourism, the relevant Minister could subsidise part of that tour as a way of promoting well-being in Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60228-12_spnew11"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again; at least we are having a dialogue on the matter. If Ministers are going to act within the provisions of schedule 5 and the devolved powers, why does it not say that in the Bill? Why is the Minister, at this stage, giving Assembly Ministers the same level and breadth of powers as full Government Ministers in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 149</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60228-12_spnew12"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 No, to return to the point that I made earlier, section 40 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 already gives similar powers, but these clauses clarify the situation so that there is no confusion. Following advice, we believe that clarification in this form is necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_69">The hon. Lady was asking about Ministers&#039; ability to exercise powers. These are executive functions to be exercised by Ministers and they will be subject to the scrutiny of the Assembly and, certainly, if any funding is involved, to the scrutiny of the Audit Committee.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60228-12_spnew14"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The well-being power is there to assist the people of Wales. Clause 60(1) sets out the objects to which that power applies. The answer is yes, if it could be shown that an individual outside Wales could perform a duty that was to the benefit and for the well-being of people in Wales, that would not be outwith the clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_71">The power to promote well-being is closely modelled on similar powers given to local authorities in section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000. Local authorities, too, were given that power to reduce uncertainty over their powers to act where there was no specific power relevant to what they wanted to do even though it would benefit people in their area. A similar provision was included in section 30 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, for similar reasons. The power would not alter any existing function of Ministers of the Crown, and there are specific constraints on Welsh Ministers, such as the prohibition on doing anything incompatible with Community law, so those functions do not need to be restated. The power would not override the International Development Act 2002.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60228-13_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Minister appears to have made two conflicting statements. I think that I am correct in saying that, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), he said that under these clauses it will be possible for a Welsh Minister to exercise the functions of a UK Minister. However, he has just said that this provision does not alter the position of a Minister of the Crown. Perhaps I do not understand, but the two statements appear to be conflicting and I should be grateful for clarification.
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60228-13_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 To clarify the point, I am certainly not suggesting that a Minister would be able suddenly to take on the functions of a UK Minister. I am suggesting that, if a UK Minister were in a position to assist the

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">The amendments seek to remove or constrain the power to promote or improve the well-being of Wales to such an extent that it would become meaningless. It would create uncertainty over the powers of Welsh Ministers to act where there was no specific power relevant to what they wanted to do, even though it would be for the benefit of the people of their area. For the reasons that I have outlined, we believe that the power is necessary, as it has been for local government and the Greater London authority.

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_73">Amendment No. 65 would remove clause 70, which would make no sense. The power already exists for the Assembly in section 85 of the Government of Wales Act, and is being transferred to the Welsh Ministers by the Bill. The removal of the clause would restrict the ability of Welsh Ministers to carry out Executive functions.

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_74">Amendment No. 66 is unnecessary. The power in the clause is identical to one in section 40 of the Government of Wales Act. Although the provision is for the Assembly as a whole, the function in question is an Executive function, which is better carried out by Welsh Ministers. Welsh Ministers are accountable for their actions. If their actions were deemed unreasonable, they would be subject to action by the Assembly or by the Audit Committee, and potentially to judicial review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60228-13_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 Will the Minister deal with my question about the Counsel General, please?
</p>





<p><a name="st_86"><a name="60228-13_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I think that I touched on that. The Counsel General would be in a position to expend moneys to ensure that prosecutions took place, and I specifically mentioned that he could take action to assist other authorities in bringing prosecutions. Although he would not be given specific powers under schedule 5 or following the enactment of part 4, the Counsel General would be able to assist other authorities in bringing prosecutions; at present, no particular statute gives him the power to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_75">We have had a good explanation. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that the powers are not, as she suspects, huge and wide-ranging, unrestricted either by statute or by the Assembly. Far from it. We are making sensible arrangements so that Welsh Ministers can exercise Executive functions to benefit the people of Wales. I ask her to withdraw the amendment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60228-13_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I understand why, from time to time, Ministers&#151;whether in Westminster or in the Assembly&#151;need to exercise Executive powers, but I am not fully satisfied by the explanation that the Minister has given. A lot of points still need to be clarified, and it is unfortunate that we will not be able to do that at this stage. The fact that the clauses are closely modelled on provisions for the Greater London authority and local authorities has little bearing, because, as we have often heard, the Assembly in Wales is different from the Greater London authority and local authorities. If there are similarities, one would hope for consistency across

</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_76">The way in which the Minister has presented his explanation has led to confusion. I am not entirely convinced that under the clauses as drafted it would not be possible for a Minister to take on the functions of a Member of this House or a member of the Government on an agency basis. His assurance that the clauses clarify and limit what Ministers can and cannot do is as nothing, because there is nothing limiting in them. Ministers may well be subject to scrutiny by the Assembly&#151;so they should be&#151;and by the Audit Committee; none the less, the powers given under the two clauses remain unfettered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_77">I want Welsh Ministers and the Assembly always to do things that assist the people of Wales, but I do not want them to have powers that could be abused or are wider than they should have at this stage. To bring Welsh Ministers into line with UK Ministers is yet another way of devolving by the back door.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_78">Once again, the Government should have been honest about devolution, and perhaps they should have gone the whole hog and held a referendum. However, they have not done so&#151;they are salami-slicing, as the Father of the House has said. The provision is another slice of salami, and it is being made by stealth, rather than in an open fashion. Amendments Nos. 64 and 66 are small amendments, as I mentioned. They do not fundamentally alter Ministers&#039; ability to ensure the well-being of Wales, but they clarify the position and provide the limits that the Under-Secretary believes exist in clauses 60 and 70 as drafted.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The amendments do nothing but set fairly broad parameters.

That may be taken as read, but I would prefer to see such a limitation included in the Bill. Likewise, the insertion in clause 70 of the word &quot;reasonable&quot; would not undermine the spirit of the provision, and would ensure that a test of reasonableness can be applied to the broad powers of financial assistance in the clause.

The insertion of the words &quot;within their powers&quot; in clause 60 and the addition of the word &quot;reasonable&quot; to clause 70 do not wreck the existing provisions. I have gone a long way towards accepting the Minister&#039;s explanation, and the amendments have the best interests of the Welsh people and Wales at heart.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 157</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Newport, East (Jessica Morden) and I spoke for such a provision, the Under-Secretary appeared to respond favourably. Now that it has been drafted accurately&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60228-15_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. Will hon. Members who are leaving the Chamber or holding conversations in the Chamber please leave quickly and quietly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60228-15_spnew2"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I am especially pleased that business interests are recognised in the amendments as being those not solely of employers but of employees. They are tied together in new clause 12 so that the voice of the trade unions and employees is equally important to that of employers. When we talk about developing the economic, environmental and social well-being of Wales, as we did in our previous discussion, the business community should have a powerful say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">We tabled the amendments to ensure that the voice of the business sector&#151;employees and employers&#151;was recognised and included in the Bill in the same way as that of the voluntary sector and the public sector. Subsection (4) of new clause 12 refers to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;organisations representative of business (including trade unions) and such other organisations as they consider appropriate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">That is why the amendment and new clause have the support of not only the TUC in Wales but the Wales Trades Union Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">The amendments were tabled in the spirit of consensus. They have the backing of the people, business organisations and employee organisations in Wales. I hope that not only the House but the Under-Secretary will support them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">The new clause proposes that reports be made at intervals of no more than two years, rather than yearly, as will apply to the voluntary and public sector schemes. In defence of that slight deviation from the other two schemes, I would say that this is precisely what the unions and employers in the business community have asked for. They recognise the need for openness and transparency in reporting back, but they believe that it could be extremely cumbersome if that were to be an annual requirement. They would prefer the period to be up to two years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">I hope that amendment No. 62 and new clause 12 will garner the support of the House today.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60228-15_spnew3"><b> Adam Price </b> 
: I am happy to support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies). It was made clear by Ministers at the time of the passing of the Government of Wales Act 1998 that trade unions were meant to be included in the ambit of business organisations, but the amendment makes that absolutely explicit. It should be welcomed for that reason in particular, but also because it clearly sets out the requirement for consultation with social and economic organisations&#151;as I prefer to call them&#151;in a way that is consistent with the schemes that apply to other sectors. This would be widely welcomed by many including the Wales TUC, whose response to the consultation conducted by the Welsh Assembly Government on business consultation made it clear that the TUC wanted a formal basis for the inclusion of trade unions and a structured process to be put in place.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 158</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">That sentiment has been echoed by the main representatives of the private sector. The CBI has called for a scheme along similar lines to those proposed by the hon. Members for Ogmore and for Newport, East (Jessica Morden). Other business organisations, including the West Wales Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, have made a plea that the general duty to consult business organisations needs a proper structure in terms of its mechanism and its timetable, similar to that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that this will not have to be a Labour rebellion, and that the Minister will finally accept a substantial amendment, because it has garnered considered support on both sides of the House. I shall listen with optimism to the Minister&#039;s response in due course. Meanwhile, we are happy to offer our support for the proposals.
</p>





<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60228-15_spnew4"><b> Jessica Morden  (Newport, East) (Lab):</b> 
 In speaking to the amendment and the new clause, I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies). I also acknowledge that the Welsh Assembly Government has a good, constructive relationship with business and the trade unions in Wales, which is illustrated by the work that is being done through the Business Partnership Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">Clauses 72 and 73 provide that Welsh Ministers must establish the Business Partnership Council with local government and place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to consult and advise local government, and to set up and publish a local government scheme. Clause 74 provides that Welsh Ministers must set up a voluntary sector scheme to explain how they will work and consult with the voluntary sector in Wales. Yet clause 75 calls for Ministers only to carry out consultations with
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;such organisations representative of business and such other organisations as they consider appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">The obligation in the Bill to consult business is therefore considerably weaker than the obligations relating to local government and the voluntary sector, and it contains no reference to trade unions representing employees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_90">It is important to recognise that business and the trade unions play a key role in developing Wales. The new clause acknowledges that and proposes a similar arrangement for business and the unions, to be known as &quot;the business scheme&quot;. That would enable the public to see what Welsh Ministers are committed to do for business. Relations with business and trade unions are currently good, but future Administrations would have an obligation to ensure that that continued. The scheme would also ensure that the role of the trade unions was formally acknowledged. Welsh Ministers would have a duty to consult them, and the views of workers in Wales would be heard when decisions were made by the Welsh Assembly Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_91">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for considering opinions that have the support of the CBI and the TUC in Wales. I hope that the Minister will support the new clause.

 Clauses 92 to 101 make up part 3 of the Bill, which deals with Assembly measures. We debated these provisions in detail and at length in Committee, but I was left entirely unpersuaded by the Government&#039;s arguments about the proposals&#039; necessity or desirability.

<a name="stpa_101">The House must bear it in mind that these clauses would mean that primary legislation would cease to be the responsibility of this House&#151;or any Assembly or Parliament&#151;and be replaced by a system of government through Order in Council. It would be difficult to imagine a more fundamental shift from the normal convention and practice in our country&#039;s constitution, although the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill tries to extend the same principles to the entirety of the governance of this country, including England.

<a name="stpa_102">It became clear in the course of our Committee debates that the Government simply did not grasp the extent of the change that these proposals would introduce. We were told that the measures were perfectly reasonable, and that Orders in Council are commonly used. I accept the latter point, but they are not used for enacting measures that are normally the preserve of primary legislation. However, that is precisely the system that we will be introducing if we allow these clauses to go through.

<a name="stpa_103">Parliament gives power to the Executive. The Government have argued that they want to devolve power so that it is brought closer to the people, but where will that power be exercised? That is the important question, as clauses 92 to 101 make it glaringly apparent that the exercise of the power supposedly to be transferred to the Assembly will remain entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State.

However, it will not be able to determine whether the order in its final form, as put together by the Welsh Assembly, should be approved. That is because, at that stage, the Secretary of State is the only person with the power to intervene and prevent a measure from being enacted. If I have got any of that wrong, I shall be pleased to give way to the Minister so that he can correct me.

After that, the Assembly will consider any changes and introduce a draft Order in Council. That draft order will then be laid before the House by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and the normal affirmative procedure, both here and in the House of Lords, will apply. It is not the measures that will come before Parliament in any form, but the policy statement justifying why the Order in Council is required. There will be a substantial amount of information attached to that, and it will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman.

 Not at all; this highlights the nub of the issue. It is possible to have a perfectly reasoned debate about whether the Welsh Assembly should be granted more powers. I am aware that within Wales, and outside it, there will be people with different opinions on that subject. There are perfectly valid arguments that Wales should follow the pattern of Scotland and have primary legislative powers, and that the Welsh Assembly should acquire sovereign authority over areas of legislative competence, if that is what is desired.

There are arguments about whether we should have devolution at all, but now that it has been introduced, it ought to be effective. What is so dangerous is the fact that we are evolving a system in which the prime player is neither the Welsh people through their Assembly, nor the United Kingdom people though the United Kingdom Parliament, but the Government through executive action.

 I agree entirely. This is a creeping process, which has probably been going on for some time. This Parliament has been successively surrendering powers of legislative competence through the greater use of statutory instruments and Orders in Council for a long time. In 1966 there were, I think, 35 statutory instruments, whereas there are now some 3,000 to 4,000 a year. That is already a measure of the loss of

<br>&nbsp;<br>considering the Bill, did the leader of the Welsh Conservative party ask for more subject areas to be added to schedule 5?
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60228-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Schedule 5 defines the powers that could be given to the Welsh Assembly under part 3 or part 4. I do not see a problem with those of my colleagues in the Welsh Assembly who say that they would like more devolved powers for Wales. The question is how those powers should be devolved. It seems to me to be a fairly simple matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_172"><a name="60228-18_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 If I sat in the Welsh Assembly, I would want the schedule to include several powers that it does not include at present, but I would expect that&#151;in order to press for part 4 to be enacted&#151;the people of Wales could make that judgment. The argument advanced by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price), with whom I often agree, misses the point. If one wants greater devolved powers, this is the only way to achieve that under the format presented by the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60228-18_spnew9"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) about whether such powers could be used more extensively in England, the answer must be yes. Indeed, the whole constitutional trend since Labour came into power in 1997 is to minimise the use of Parliament for    governmental business. The Government go to considerable lengths to avoid having legislation scrutinised in this place. When it is scrutinised in this place, the guillotining of business means that we cannot give it adequate scrutiny. One of the real ironies&#151;I regard it as a disgrace&#151;is that the Government, having preventing us from scrutinising legislation properly, claim that as Parliament cannot do the job they might as well give it to someone else. That is a pattern of behaviour from this Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_112">The House should not subscribe to part 3, unless the Government choose to have a referendum on it and allow the Welsh people to understand what it is all about. That is what we try to achieve in new clause 1.

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="60228-18_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Jones </b> 
: If the Government were to be minded to offer such a referendum, would it not be just as easy for them to offer one on part 4 at this stage and forget part 3?
</p>





<p><a name="st_175"><a name="60228-18_spnew11"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 It would be and, from a constitutional point of view, part 4 would be a much better option than part 3. If someone offered me a choice between part 3 and part 4, I would choose part 4. Although it is a major constitutional change, part 4 at least has some internal coherence, which part 3 lacks. I accept that it is possible that the Welsh people, if they were to be consulted, might decide that they wished to be governed by Order in Council under the part 3 procedure. If that choice were put to them, I would enjoy campaigning in Wales and explaining to people what part 3 is all about. If the Government think that part 3 is such an attractive proposal, they should accept new clause 1, and I hope to hear the Minister say so before the end of the debate. If new clause 1 is accepted, we will see the same spirit of

<p>
<a name="60228-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_113">New clause 3 is a fall-back position. Inadequate as part 3 is, new clause 3 would provide a system for a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament and the Assembly to scrutinise draft orders. That would go some way to remedying the democratic deficit of part 3. Amendment No. 7 is consequential to amendment No. 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_114">Our view is straightforward. Further devolution can work only if it is honest in empowering the legislature rather than favouring the Executive. Part 3 is a bureaucrat&#039;s charter. It is also a charter that suits Government very well, and hundreds of years of acquired rights, which are enshrined in legislatures, are being systematically eroded by the drafting of part 3. The House should have nothing to do with it. It is unworthy of the Government to propose it. Despite having sat through Committee and debated the Bill extensively during its passage, I did not understand a point that the Minister made today. If, however, it is true that Parliament will have only the vaguest notion of the detail of what the Assembly will enact, that is an even more compelling reason why part 3 should be rejected. Part 3 is the creature of the Executive and I hope that the House will send out a signal that some of us, at least, will not accept that principle.
</p>





<p><a name="st_176"><a name="60228-18_spnew12"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 What we have just heard is a gross misrepresentation of the system that is proposed and betrays a profound lack of understanding of the legislative system that has been in operation, certainly since I came to this place in 2001. That is perhaps not surprising from the Conservatives, because they have limited experience of legislation affecting Wales during that period. In reality, that legislation has been subject to unprecedented scrutiny, because of the emergence of pre-legislative scrutiny. I suggested as much to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) during earlier proceedings on the Bill, but he does not seem to have taken it on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_115">Pre-legislative scrutiny was instituted under the Conservative Government before 1997 and has developed substantially since then, especially since 2001 in respect of Wales. Proposals from the Assembly have been scrutinised by Committees of the House, primarily the Welsh Affairs Committee. They have been almost scrutinised to death. In at least two cases, the Public Audit (Wales) Bill and the Transport (Wales) Bill, the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Welsh Affairs Committee&#151;often working with the Assembly&#151;meant that no substantial amendments were needed when the measures came before the House. Bills have avoided taking up unnecessary Chamber time due to the extent of the pre-legislative scrutiny. No amendments were tabled in the House and Bills went through without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_116">As pre-legislative scrutiny will apply to the process outlined in the Bill, I cannot for the life of me understand why it is regarded as so heinous. The Conservatives often seem to believe in a Whig concept of constitutional history whereby legislative processes in the Chamber reached a state of grace in 1997, such that no constitutional improvement could be possible after that date and that any proposal made since then has

 I certainly do not suggest that the problems date only from 1997&#151;some of them predate 1997. I want to pick the hon. Gentleman up on one point. He talks about pre-legislative scrutiny, but of what&#151;the Order in Council or the draft measure? That was the point I made to the Minister, who in Committee made a considerable error that he subsequently had to correct by writing to people. He said:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">He had to withdraw those comments, but I did not understand from them that we would not see the preliminary draft measure; yet I understand from what he said earlier today that we shall not see it, so how can we even consider, in pre-legislative scrutiny terms, what the measure will be?
</p>





<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60228-19_spnew1"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the preliminary draft measure will be given pre-legislative scrutiny, which will be amendable. There is no suggestion that Members will not have the opportunity to consider proposals. They will be considered by the House and by Assembly Members, probably in a joint legislative Committee of the Assembly and Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_179"><a name="60228-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Jones: </b> 
 Is not the hon. Gentleman falling into the trap of thinking that each Order in Council is a one-off? In fact, each Order in Council will devolve primary competence, for a particular matter in a particular field, to the Assembly. The Assembly can then, if it wants, revisit that devolved competence and create further Assembly Measures, which will never be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_180"><a name="60228-19_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 That is devolution.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="60228-19_spnew5"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 Since the Government of Wales Act 1998, devolution of further powers has occurred regularly, as anyone familiar with the development of devolution must be aware, and we have not needed a referendum at every stage of that process. Indeed, until our debates on the Bill, I had never heard a suggestion that a referendum was needed every time a power was transferred to the Assembly. The process has been continuous, but the Conservatives do not seem to recognise the dynamic of devolution and the joint relationship that has developed between the Assembly and Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_183"><a name="60228-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 There is a slight difference between transferring further functions to the Assembly to operate under the existing devolution settlement and creating a new devolution settlement subject to the

<br>&nbsp;<br>powers in part 3. The hon. Gentleman has a legal background and I am sure that if he gave even a moment&#039;s thought to the difference between the procedures in part 3 and the existing situation, he would acknowledge that point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="60228-19_spnew7"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 Of course there will be a change in the process, but as I pointed out earlier the reason for it is that the existing process leads to the House considering legislation unnecessarily, because it has already been scrutinised. The Conservatives are grasping at straws when they suggest that we are engaged in some perverted constitutional exercise that undermines fundamental liberties. The Government have a proud record on developing pre-legislative scrutiny, recognising the existence of the Assembly and facilitating working relationships between it and the Westminster Parliament that have led to an improvement in the scrutiny of legislation affecting Wales. Far from undermining those relationships, the measure will improve them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60228-19_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 It would be foolish to ignore the background to this part of the Bill. Clearly, some Government Members want no further devolution. For them, even the description of continuing devolution given by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) would be anathema. It is pleasing that the Father of the House is not in the Chamber, for he would have been very unhappy had he heard that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">Other Labour Members want more devolution. Both views are perfectly reasonable. Indeed, one might find a range of views about devolution among Opposition Members&#151;whether there is enough or whether it should go further. What is unacceptable is to try to paper over those cracks in a way that strikes at the very heart of the activity of Parliament. That brings me to a direct argument with the hon. Member for Wrexham, but I hope that he will acquit me of anything other than real concern for parliamentary democracy.

<a name="stpa_119">I admit that I would have liked a different way of sharing power in the United Kingdom from that decided on in 1997 and thereafter. However, having undertaken it as we have, it is unacceptable that the people of Wales should have a form of devolution significantly different from that provided for the people of Scotland. Were there an opportunity for a referendum, I hope that the people of Wales would vote for greater devolution, much along the lines of that accorded to people in Scotland.

<a name="stpa_120">What seems unacceptable is to say that, because the majority party does not believe that it could achieve a common view, it will offer the people of Wales what is in part 3 instead of what is essentially in part 4, but that, of course, they must not have a vote on it, because if they did, they might recognise just how silly it is&#151;silly in the sense that this is a means whereby the future of the people of Wales is removed from the parliamentary hands in which it is now and from any referendum and placed in the hands of bureaucrats and Ministers.

I want to remove it so that we can move on to offer to the Welsh Assembly greater powers through the referendum, which would do so publicly and clearly, and I would be happy to debate with the Father of the House the advantages of going further, while he would no doubt explain the advantage of going backwards, which is, of course, the usual direction of his party.

If the Welsh nationalists were true to their principles, they would say, &quot;Look here, we are not going to provide the cover for this. We are not going to stand in front of the Government and pretend that this is another step on the way to devolution. Instead, we are going to stand up and tell the Government to give us part 4. We will fight them on the doorsteps and make sure that we win a referendum. Give us part 4 and do not palm us off with part 3.&quot; That is the heart of the opposition that is summed up in amendment No. 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_131">I, who have gone into the Lobbies with my Welsh nationalist friends, sometimes against a Whip, ask them to think seriously about what their position will do to them in the Principality. It will enable people to say very simply, &quot;These are people who are more interested in supporting a bureaucratic fudge than standing for the central issue of democratic control over the future of the people of Wales.&quot; In the past, there were better ways of doing things than the way that we ended up with, but, having got where we have, let us not allow ourselves to be led down the dangerous path that the Government have proposed.

<a name="60228-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_132">If we do not agree to the amendment, we will set a precedent that could be used much more widely. Mr. Deputy Speaker, you have not sat through every hour of the debate on the Bill&#151;although it may have seemed like it from time to time&#151;but it is right that the important subject of Welsh Government matters and the Principality should have occupied so much of our time. Those of us who live in the county of Suffolk&#151;one of the six counties that, for the purpose of administrative regions, the Government call the east of England&#151;note that we have not been given the equivalent time to discuss forced regionalisation, which we do not want and which involves the transfer of powers relating to our police, ambulances and hospitals to a central body in a region. We are concerned that the pattern evident here, a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) rightly raised, will enable the Government to say, &quot;If this is how we do it for Wales, why don&#039;t we do it for the non-existent region of the east of England? There is a lot of business in Parliament. Why don&#039;t we bypass the people of that region, just as we have bypassed the people of Wales?&quot;.

<a name="60228-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_134">As my hon. Friend says, we tabled the amendment because we need to stand against something that is at the heart of this Government&#039;s activity&#151;constantly emasculating the House of Commons, removing from us our powers of control and not allowing us to devolve those powers as we think fit subject to a referendum of the people of that area.

<br>&nbsp;<br>you that it would remove from the Bill the very trick that could be used to get round the problem that this Government cannot win a referendum in England either. Why on earth are they not offering a referendum to the people of Wales? I will tell you, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;it is because they know very well that they would lose it, and this Government have referendums only if they think that they can win them.

<a name="stpa_135">We want to get rid of part 3 altogether, but I would hope that the Government, in answering, would offer something in its place.

I suggest that it should be on part 4, and I hope in that case that I would find myself campaigning in the more pleasant company of the hon.

 I would like to speak to amendments Nos. 59 to 61. It seems a long time since we started debating this group of amendments and I shall endeavour to be brief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_137">The amendments would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to derail the Welsh Assembly&#039;s wishes. They would remove the power to refuse to lay a draft order before the House and prevent unnecessary delay by requiring the Secretary of State to act within 30 days, rather than the 60 days currently stated in the Bill. Given that any Assembly Measures or draft orders have already been debated and agreed in the Assembly, there appears to be no need for further delay at this end. Liberal Democrats believe that the whole point of devolution is to let the people of Wales have their views represented, and it would completely undermine that principle if the democratic will of the Assembly were allowed to be delayed or completely stymied by the will of one individual in the person of the Secretary of State for Wales.

 My hon. Friend will, like me, expect the right hon.

Obviously, then, he would agree with my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>her name and those of her hon. Friends. I am sympathetic to the idea of preventing the Secretary of State from derailing the process, but the impact of that amendment, if I understand it correctly, appears to be to remove the need for there to be a resolution of this House at all.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60228-21_spnew4"><b> Jenny Willott: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Liberal Democrats believe in a full Welsh Parliament, so ideally we would like the democratic will of the Welsh people to be expressed in such a Parliament. However, the amendments are about ensuring that, in the orders that come through this Parliament, the will of the Assembly cannot be derailed.

<a name="stpa_138">Unfortunately, we cannot support the Tory amendments in this group. Although we do not agree with all of the Bill, as we have made clear a number of times during the debates, we believe in devolution and would like the Assembly to have further powers.

 I rise to support wholeheartedly the amendment that stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Part 3 goes to the heart of what I consider to be a most reprehensible and devious piece of legislation proposed by this Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_140">The Government seek to portray part 3 as an innocuous measure aimed at modestly increasing or, if you like, streamlining the powers of the Assembly. Were that indeed the case I have no doubt that neither I nor my right hon. and hon. Friends would have any problems with it and we would not be taking up the time of the House. The Assembly is now a fact of life in Wales. It may not yet be working entirely satisfactorily but it is part of the fabric of government in Wales and we all have a duty to make it work as best it can. However, part 3 is not a modest measure. It is a measure aimed at conferring primary legislative competence on the Assembly on a piecemeal basis. It is therefore, by any measure, a major constitutional innovation which, if enacted, will transfer a significant degree of legislative competence from this place to another legislative body.

<a name="60228-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_141">That such transfer is, as I say, on a piecemeal basis through Orders in Council does not render it any less significant. The fact is that, over time, more and more primary powers will be ceded by Parliament to the Assembly, subject of course always to the executive filtration process of the Secretary of State, which, like my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) I find particularly repugnant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_142">It is generally agreed that the convention that has developed in this country is that if primary powers are ceded by Parliament to another body, a referendum should first take place in which the will of the people is consulted. That is what happened in Wales in 1997; that is what should happen now. The Government know that. Part 4 provides for such a referendum and that referendum must take place before Assembly Acts may be passed, but Assembly Measures will be no less primary legislation, so the question is: why will the Government not give the people of Wales the simple right to vote on the proposals in a referendum? The answer is simple: they know that they would lose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_143">The Secretary of State has already acknowledged that there is no consensus in Wales for more primary powers for the Assembly. On 15 June last year, he said:

<a name="60228-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_145">That is all well and good, but if the Secretary of State fears that the people of Wales would vote against the transfer of primary powers to the Assembly, why is he so insistent on inflicting those powers on the people of Wales, whether or not they want them?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_146">The suspicion must be&#151;I hope that it is not unfair&#151;that some internal Labour party tension is prompting the proposals in part 3, which enable the transfer of powers to the Assembly while preserving the illusion of power remaining at Westminster, whereas, in fact, the power remains in the hands of the Secretary of State for Wales. The fact that the proposals constitute such a device was acknowledged by Lord Richard when he gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee. What he said has been quoted before, but it deserves to be quoted again. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;Let&#039;s be frank about it, it is a device to avoid having to come to Westminster and ask for primary powers to be formally devolved. It is quite an interesting device. . . .

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_147">In fact, it is more than almost; it is the transfer of a direct legislative competence to Cardiff without first consulting the people of Wales in a referendum.

<a name="stpa_148">That is reprehensible, and made all the more so by the fact that control of the whole procedure resides in the Executive and not in this House.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_149">I say that we should proceed immediately to part 4 and consult the people of Wales now, through a referendum, on whether they do indeed want more legislative competence to be handed down to Cardiff. If so, we must abide by their decision and hand over that power. If not, we must equally respect their decision. The proposal is a three-card trick&#151;an absolute disgrace to the Labour party. Perhaps the absence of Labour Members indicates the shame that they feel. What is proposed is an illegitimate exercise&#151;an attempt to usurp the powers of this place. It is wholly reprehensible and the amendment should be supported.

 Well, we have gone over the same old ground as we did in Committee. Let me put on the record what is, in fact, proposed in part 3, and not the fantasy outlined by Conservative Members. The purpose of part 3 is to provide the Assembly with a streamlined procedure to achieve its legislative priorities. It builds on the existing devolution settlement, giving the Assembly greater scope to determine the detail of Welsh legislation, but with Parliament remaining in overall control through the Order in Council process. It will enable the Assembly to break free from the Westminster logjam without fundamentally altering the devolution settlement. That was approved by the referendum in 1997.

We have put part 4 in the Bill so that, in the future, when a two-thirds majority in the Assembly deem that the time is right for a referendum and that there is a consensus in Wales in favour of moving forward to full primary powers, a referendum will be held. At present, the judgment is that now is not the time.

Turning to Conservative new clause 1, which is the same as new clause 6, which was debated and rejected in Committee, the proposal to hold a referendum before the relevant part of the Bill can come into effect is unnecessary.

<a name="stpa_155">Part 3 does not give the Assembly any new powers to legislate on devolved subjects, but it provides a new procedure for Parliament to grant such powers. It is extraordinary that the Opposition should want Parliament to hold an expensive referendum to seek permission to change our own procedures. Parliament will be able to scrutinise and control on a case-by-case basis the draft Orders in Council that confer those legislative powers on the Assembly. It will rightly be for the Assembly to scrutinise the way in which its legislative competence is used to enact Assembly Measures that address the needs of Wales. Since 1999, Parliament has passed legislation that gives the Assembly powers to make its own provisions for Wales. Increasingly, Parliament has been willing to give the Assembly broad powers to legislate in Wales-only clauses in England and Wales Bills. The proposed system develops that approach. Parliament still has control of the process, as legislative competence cannot be conferred on the Assembly unless both Houses of Parliament have agreed to do so. It is essential that part 3 should be in place from the outset. It is essential, too, that the Assembly should have the ability to seek legislative competence on its own initiative.

<a name="stpa_156">Amendment No. 5, which was tabled by the Conservatives, deals with Assembly resolutions to ask Parliament to pass legislation on devolved matters, but it would not change the legal effect of the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Assembly from making such a resolution. While Parliament passes legislation, it is for Government to introduce it, so the Government&#039;s role could not be circumvented and the amendment is not required. In addition, I remind Members of the provision in clause 33 whereby the Secretary of State is required to consult the Assembly about the Government&#039;s legislative programme. The Assembly can use the consultation to ensure that the Secretary of State is aware of matters that it wishes to be dealt with in primary legislation affecting Wales, whether or not the Assembly has competence to make Assembly Measures on those matters. There is therefore no need for the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_157">Turning to new clause 3, I have made it clear throughout the progress of the Bill that pre-legislative scrutiny of proposed Orders in Council under clause 94 should be at the discretion of Members of Parliament and of Assembly Members. It is worth maintaining flexibility, rather than specifying requirements for joint scrutiny in the Bill. It is worth noting, too, that the House of Commons already makes provision for the Welsh Affairs Committee to undertake joint inquiries with Assembly Committees under Standing Orders Nos. 137A(1)(a) and 137A(3). That arrangement has led to successful pre-legislative scrutiny of a number of Wales-only Bills, so we do not require any further legislation. The right way forward is to allow Parliament to work

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the Assembly to develop that successful model further, rather than establish over-prescriptive requirements in legislation. The way in which pre-legislative scrutiny is carried out is usually left to Parliament to decide, rather than being specified in legislation. Standing Orders, not legislation, are the appropriate means of dealing with that.

<a name="60228-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_158">Amendment No. 7, which was tabled by the Conservatives, would prevent Orders in Council that amend schedule 5 from being made before the Assembly election in 2007. The Bill provides for the early commencement of clauses 94 and 95 so that clarifying amendments can be made to schedule 5 before general commencement, should that prove necessary. For example, if one of the descriptions of fields or matters in schedule 5 is found to be insufficiently clear, an Order in Council under clause 94 could be proposed to clarify the extent of the field or matter. I am quite happy to place on record the fact that it is not intended that such Orders in Council should be used to confer wholly new legislative competence on the Assembly in advance of general commencement of the Bill following the 2007 election. Although the Bill provides that sections 94 and 95 will come into force on the day on which it is enacted, in fact, we would not carry out any functions under those sections for a period of two months following Royal Assent.

Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) was quite right&#151;the amendments would mean that there would be no parliamentary scrutiny of Orders in Council. It is not acceptable for the Assembly to vote itself additional powers. It is for Parliament to decide whether it is appropriate to confer legislative competence on the Assembly. Parliament has the right to legislate in relation to Wales, so it has the right to decide whether to allow another legislature to do so.

<a name="60228-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_160">Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 would leave the Secretary of State with a vestigial role in the process. He or she would receive notice of a draft Order in Council approved by the Assembly, but he or she could do no more than sit on it for up to 30 days before having to return it to the Clerk of the Assembly, who would submit the draft Order for approval by Her Majesty in Council. There would not be any scrutiny by Parliament. The amendments illustrate the dangers of starting to unpick the Bill&#039;s provisions. If the Assembly could give itself legislative competence, what opportunity would there be to challenge it? I assume that the 30 day-provision is designed to cater for that, but it is a most unsatisfactory way of tackling the issue. I therefore urge hon.

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="60228-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I suspect that the Minister and I agree on one thing&#151;amendment No. 59 encapsulates the criticism that my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) made of the Liberal Democrats. When faced with a difficult choice, they decided that the best way to proceed was to eliminate all form of democratic scrutiny from the legislation to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 182</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>enable the Secretary of State to have a free hand with the Assembly without any intervention from Parliament in part 3. I do not know whether they intend to press their amendment to vote, but I wish to concentrate on amendment No. 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_161">The Minister has been wholly unpersuasive on the matter. One of the most telling comments that we have heard during the debate was the confession made for the first time by the Government that they considered that part 4 would not pass a referendum in Wales. Regrettable though that might be to my right hon. Friend and others, it highlights the absurdity of the Government proceeding by means of part 3. The justification offered to the House was that the Assembly would otherwise wither on the vine, whereas in fact it can have a perfectly respectable and separate existence implementing secondary legislation, if that is what the people of Wales want. There is no reason why the Executive cannot be split from the Legislature in order to improve that, which is why we supported the part of the Bill which does exactly that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">Our position is that in the absence of an assurance from the Government that there would be a referendum on the implementation of part 3, the only proper course of action is to remove part 3 from the Bill entirely. The people of Wales will lose nothing thereby. Part 4 offers them real change if they want it. The other parts of the Bill, particularly the splitting of the Assembly and the Legislature, offer them a new format for governance along current lines, if that is what they want. Part 3 should have no place in the Bill, and I urge every hon. Member in the House to support us in opposing it. If we do not succeed in removing part 3, I hope at the appropriate moment later this evening to press new clause 1 to the vote.

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60228-26_spnew1"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 During our debates on the preceding amendments, it was said that, if a referendum were held, it would be lost and that the Government therefore did not plan to hold one. However, the Bill places no time limit on holding such a referendum. Although the Secretary of State said that he intended the measure to settle the constitutional situation in Wales for a generation, it cannot be right that there is no end position about holding a referendum. Foresight in government and in legislation is always important, but we could be legislating for something that took place in 20 or 30 years, when it could not be described as depending on specific circumstances. That is inappropriate and it is why we have tabled the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_170">The new clause clearly provides that if a referendum on giving the National Assembly full law-making powers such as those set out in part 4 had not been held after 10 years, fresh legislation would be required. There is good reason for that. We are legislating on the basis of a referendum that we are already told would be lost. There is no logic in requiring that to happen in 15, 20 or more years.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 193</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_171">The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary conceded that a referendum would be lost. The Secretary of State said that he did not anticipate holding a referendum for the rest of the decade. We therefore propose 10 years as a reasonable period in which to allow a referendum to take place. It is not unreasonable to ask Parliament to reconsider the matter if a referendum has not happened in 10 years. If the Secretary of State and the Government are sincere about presenting the argument to persuade the people of Wales to take forward, through the Assembly, the powers in part 4, they could do that, by any reasonable reckoning, in 10 years.

<a name="time_15">
<a name="60228-26_time0"><h5>7.45 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="60228-26_spnew3"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 Unless I misunderstand the hon. Gentleman, his intervention is an argument for the new clause, which provides that a referendum should take place in a fixed time period to focus minds on the matter, rather than some nebulous, distant provision. As many speakers have said, there is a lack of clarity about the Government&#039;s intentions. Do they want to increase powers and put the Welsh Assembly on the same footing as the Scottish Parliament, or are they simply conducting a smoke-and-mirrors exercise? The fact that they do not have the confidence to hold a referendum now or in 10 years leads me to suspect that there is no will in the Government or the Labour party in Wales to campaign on the issues in part 4. Unless the Under-Secretary says something new and surprising, we are not minded to accept an open-ended provision and we shall press the new clause to a Division. He may surprise us with something that gives us comfort or hope&#151;we shall wait and see.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_172">New clause 13 is about the frequency of referendums and its purpose is clear. It would prevent a further referendum on part 4 powers from taking place for at least four years after the date of the first one. It would thus prevent the Assembly from simply holding repeat referendums at regular intervals until the desired result was achieved. We believe that if a referendum on part 4 powers is held and the vote is no, the result should trigger a period of reflection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_173">A minimum interval of four years means that only one referendum could be held during an Assembly term. Any further referendums would have to be endorsed by the people of Wales at an Assembly election. We have heard much during our proceedings about the importance of election results in ascertaining the views of the people of Wales. It is therefore appropriate that they should have a say about whether a further referendum should be conducted shortly after a previous one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_174">I am not fully au fait with the details of the repeat referendums in Quebec in the 1970s and 1980s, but asking the same question repeatedly until the public are ground down, through a war of attrition, either to vote 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 194</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in a particular way or to turn out in low numbers is unsatisfactory. It is possible to envisage repeat referendums being used for political purposes rather than for taking forward the constitutional arrangements for Wales or for the enhancement of the Welsh Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_175">Both the new clauses are fair and reasonable in the context of the Bill, and in the context of the debate about the appropriateness of holding referendums. As has been stated in the debates on previous amendments, the logic remains that a referendum should be held under the part 4 arrangements as soon as the legislation is passed, so that the people of Wales could give their view straight away. The matter would then be settled for a significant period. However, the Government are clearly not minded to do that and, in those circumstances, we would want to establish a process to ensure that there was a cap on the period in which a referendum had to be held. For the reasons that I have set out, we suggest a period of 10 years. In addition, new clause 13 would prevent the possibility of holding repeat referendums.
</p>





<p><a name="st_280"><a name="60228-26_spnew4"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The practical effect of new clause 2 would be to ensure that a referendum under the terms of the Bill could not be called by Order in Council more than 10 years after the Bill had received Royal Assent. It will come as no surprise to the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) that I cannot accept that such an arbitrary time limit on the possibility of enacting the part 4 provisions is necessary. Those provisions do not have a use-by date.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_176">Under the Bill, the timing of a referendum would have to be considered and agreed on by a two-thirds majority in the Assembly and by both Houses of Parliament. That consideration by democratically elected bodies, and not an arbitrary 10-year time limit in the Bill, will ensure that the referendum is held at an appropriate time. The Secretary of State has said that he cannot see a referendum happening before 2011, because it makes sense to see how the provisions enabling the Assembly to make measures bed down first. I cannot predict at this stage exactly when a referendum should be held, and it would be inappropriate for me to say that a referendum should be held within 10 years, or not at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_177">New clause 13 is aimed directly at ensuring that there would have to be a gap of four years between any referendum and an Order in Council calling for a further referendum. The fact that a referendum can be held only with the agreement of two thirds of the Assembly, the Secretary of State and both Houses of Parliament&#151;all of whom would be aware of the financial and political cost of frequent repeated referendums&#151;is safeguard enough in this respect. I fully agree that frequent referendums under the Bill would be counter-productive. However, the process for approving a call for a referendum that is built into the Bill will ensure that referendums are not called repeatedly for no good reason. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.

<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60228-27_spnew0"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 As we anticipated, the Minister&#039;s response contained no surprises. I hope that he is correct about the issues raised by new clause 13, and that fiscal prudence, if nothing else, will prevent the repeated use of referendums. However, given that referendums have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 195</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been called repeatedly in other jurisdictions when the political climate has been ripe for them, I do not believe that the possibility can be ruled out. I would have preferred to see the new clause being accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_178">I am not in the least satisfied by the Minister&#039;s response to my arguments on new clause 2. I do not believe that 10 years is an arbitrary period. I had understood that the Government were now going to promote the concept of sunset clauses in legislation. A period must necessarily be determined in which to hold the referendum, and 10 years is a fair period to choose. Circumstances could change significantly in that time, and if the Government and the Welsh Assembly were not confident that they could secure a majority in a referendum 10 years after the passage of the Bill, it would be appropriate to revisit the legislation and examine the issues relating to the powers involved. One reason for a lack of confidence in the result of a referendum might be to do with the nature and structure of the proposed legislation. On that basis, I intend to press new clause 2 to a vote.

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_182">New clause 11 deals with the allocation of funds. It returns us to the age-old debate, which I have initiated many times over the past nine years, about the principles of fairness, transparency and a needs-based formula for conveying money to the Welsh Assembly and thus to the Welsh people. Currently, as all Members know, we have the Barnett formula, which is so discredited that Barnett himself&#151;the inventor of the formula&#151;says that he is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 199</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ashamed to be associated with it. It was good for its time but its time has long gone, and for that reason we Liberal Democrats propose new clause 11, which would require the Secretary of State to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;appoint a panel of not less than four and not more than six experts to recommend the sums of money to be allocated to the Welsh Consolidated Fund.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_183">The Secretary of State would also be required to publish in full the terms of any funding recommendations made by the panel. Moreover, the panel would have specific regard to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;the principle of fairness . . . the principle of transparency . . . and . . . the particular needs of Wales.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_184">The problem is that the Barnett formula is not needs-based and does not take account of the social and economic conditions of Wales. Furthermore, it has random unintended consequences that create difficulties in allocating funds to Welsh expenditure. If we compare what Wales is given with what it needs, it is clear that it often loses out. The levels of deprivation in Wales and its economic circumstances are often quite different from those in the rest of the UK. So our request is very simple: that the Government take on board a recommendation that has come from all quarters, including from the inventor of the existing formula himself; and that, for once, they listen to recommendations&#151;made, on this occasion, by Opposition politicians&#151;based on common sense.
</p>





<p><a name="st_290"><a name="60228-28_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The other day, the First Minister said that Wales has 5 per cent. of the UK&#039;s population and makes 4 per cent. of its income but receives 6 per cent. of that income. Does the hon. Gentleman envisage improving those figures through his new clause, or worsening them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_291"><a name="60228-28_spnew2"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 We are not seeking to gerrymander the formula in favour of Wales; rather we are trying to ensure that it is fair to Wales&#151;and, for that matter, to Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;by it being needs-based. We have to take the chance that, as Wales prospers under a Liberal Democrat Administration, its funding will be less because its needs will be less. But so far as we are concerned, this is not about begging bowls and asking for more; rather, we are asking for fairness. As the new clause makes clear,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;fairness . . . transparency . . . and the particular needs of Wales&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_185">are the right bases on which to allocate funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_186">In conclusion, I look forward to hearing what the Minister and others have to say. I hope that he will say that he has been persuaded by the arguments&#151;arguments that have been made many times before&#151;and that he will incorporate the new clause. If he does, he will be a hero not just to the Liberal Democrats but to the people of Wales. If he does not, he will stand condemned alongside other Ministers who have shown a similar unwillingness to demonstrate the ability to listen that this &quot;listening&quot; Government so often claim for themselves.

<p><a name="st_292"><a name="60228-28_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I was not going to speak to this new clause&#151;until I heard what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) had to say, whereupon I was forced to my feet. I am sorry to say that if he presses it to a vote, I will be unable to recommend

Of course, much as that might appeal to people in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, I doubt whether the people of Wales would be very happy to discover such an attitude toward the support that they receive. As I pointed out earlier, the First Minister has said that he supports the current situation. I therefore doubt very much whether the Government will accept the new clause&#151;particularly given that it has not been planted and then moved by a Labour Back Bencher, but has genuinely come from the Liberal Democrats&#151;because doing so would put them directly at odds with the First Minister.

<a name="60228-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_189">Although the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has tabled the new clause with hope in his heart, to be fair to the people of Wales, he is probably doing them a great disservice in doing so. If he presses it to a vote, I will be unable to support it.

<p><a name="st_295"><a name="60228-28_spnew6"><b> Adam Price </b> 
: I am disappointed to hear the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)&#151;who has been gracious, as ever&#151;say that, unfortunately, the Conservatives will not support the new clause, despite the spirit of revisionism that seems to be blowing through their party as we speak. This is an opportunity for us to raise the hugely important question of the Barnett formula, which is a non-statutory formula. Indeed, this is one of the few opportunities that we have had in recent years to force a vote on this issue, which, notwithstanding law-making powers and the various other important matters that we have been discussing, is probably the single most important determinant of the Assembly&#039;s and the Assembly Government&#039;s ability to improve the lives of the people of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_190">The Barnett formula is a convergent formula: over time, it results in a fall in the relative position of public expenditure per capita in Wales, compared with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 201</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>England. For example, only six years ago&#151;in 1999&#150;2000&#151;the public expenditure per capita index figure for devolved services in Wales was 115. Now, it has fallen to 112, which is a very significant relative fall over that period. That process will continue until we reach the point at which Wales and England are exactly the same, even though there is no guarantee that the level of need in Wales and England&#151;the economic and social position&#151;will be identical. That is why we must support the principle of a needs-based formula.

<p><a name="st_296"><a name="60228-28_spnew7"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 This matter is far too important to be discussed in the dying minutes of consideration on Report.

Before I paint myself into a corner, let me reiterate that this issue needs discussion, but not at 19 minutes past 8 o&#039;clock, with a guillotine about to fall at 8.30.

 I accept that and look forward to the Conservative party devoting one of its Opposition days to a call for the revision of the Barnett formula. We would support such a motion, as we will support the Liberal Democrats in the Lobby tonight. This matter is far too important to be left to party politics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham mentioned the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, and said that he supported the Barnett formula. I am sure that he does now, but in 1997 he told the Treasury Committee that the formula was &quot;detrimental&quot; to Wales. Moreover, he said in an interview with John Humphrys that the formula was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;putting a lot of pressure on expenditure in Wales. We now cannot keep up with the percentage increases in health and education that the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Employment are doing in England.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_192">That shows that the First Minister at that time supported our proposals. As has happened all too often, however, he has failed to support our position now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">The Government claim that there is no evidence for the position adopted by my party and others, but there is plenty, and the amount is growing. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, even the formula&#039;s progenitor agrees that it is long overdue for revision. If we do not act now, we will continue to suffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_194">I appeal to Labour Members&#151;we must move away from the Barnett formula. It is detrimental to Wales, and Northern Ireland is also beginning to suffer from the effects of the Barnett squeeze. The problem will continue to get worse, unless and until we get a proper formula that is fair to the nations of these islands and to the regions of England. It is a matter of territorial justice; for example, per capital expenditure on public services in some parts of the south-west region of England is very low. We need a root and branch reform of the allocation of finances in these islands.

: The problem with new clause 11 is that it would set up a panel of so-called experts to make recommendations about the Welsh block grant. In other words, it would create another new quango to determine how much money would be devoted to public expenditure in Wales.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 202</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_195">The Barnett formula has been used for some time to determine public expenditure in Wales, and has produced significant increases in that expenditure, but the quango created by the new clause would make recommendations in isolation from the rest of the UK. It would not pay heed to fairness, transparency and the particular needs of Wales&#151;language that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) described as &quot;wishy-washy&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_196">Essentially, the new clause would adjust public expenditure in Wales according to the views of the panel of experts, but in isolation from what was happening with public expenditure in the rest of the UK. However, funding public expenditure in Wales cannot be separated from what happens in the UK as a whole. I think that hon. Members recognise that, although the new clause does not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_197">No rational system of resource allocation for public expenditure could ever consider funding the needs of one part of the UK in isolation from the whole, as that would make it impossible to manage any logical process for setting budgets. The Barnett formula is operated by the Treasury, and it determines the funding allocations for Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as for Wales. However, this Bill deals only with Wales, and so is inappropriate for the new clause&#039;s proposal to abandon the Barnett formula in respect of Wales alone and replace it with a new system for allocating public expenditure there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_198">The Barnett formula has been criticised by various hon. Members, but it has worked well in practice. It has provided a stable and secure financial context, and allowed the National Assembly to plan public expenditure with some confidence. The National Assembly has received financial settlements without the need for lengthy annual negotiations with the Treasury. The Barnett formula is a relatively simple mechanism, whereby money is allocated to the National Assembly in a way that is open, transparent and comprehensible to the people of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_199">The Barnett formula ensures that changes to planned public expenditure on comparable services in England are properly reflected in the budget in Wales. The formula will provide average growth of more than 4 per cent. each year in the period since the spending review of 2004. All public institutions must be realistic and work within a fixed budget. They have to concentrate on the outcomes of the use of public money, and not just on the quantum figure, important though that is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_200">The National Assembly Government are committed to providing quality public services, using the funding provided through the Barnett formula. As a result of that process, the Assembly budget has risen from less than &#163;8 billion in 1999 to more than &#163;14 billion in 2007&#150;08. That means that the budget has almost doubled in that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_201">I confirm that the Government have no plans to review the Barnett formula, which has served the UK very effectively. In practice, it has produced reasonably fair settlements, and we will continue to monitor its operation to ensure that it is being applied properly and rigorously. Clearly, the mechanism has some advantages in the context of devolved government, and indeed it was developed originally by Joel Barnett in the 1970s when the question of devolution was first visited.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_202">The Barnett formula is simple to understand, and provides the degree of stability that is essential in the consequential flow of resources to Wales. It also allows Administrations a considerable degree of freedom when it comes to making spending decisions. The Government have looked carefully at the matter, but we have concluded that there is no advantage in reopening the question of the Barnett formula at this time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_203">New clause 11 is well meaning, but would be unworkable in practice. It would create yet another quango, and mean that decisions about public expenditure in Wales would be made outside the context of such decisions in respect of the rest of the UK.

I must point out to the Minister that it is obvious that when we talk about the principle of fairness, that has to be seen in the context of the UK. When we talk about the principle of transparency, that has to be seen alongside the principle of collective decision making, not as some isolationist approach for Wales. And when we talk about the particular needs of Wales, of course we have to think about the needs of the rest of the UK as well. For those reasons, the Minister should recognise the strength of feeling that many of us have in favour of a change&#151;and that is why I need to press the new clause to a vote.

<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 207</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_212">Devolution and decentralisation of power have been watchwords of the Labour Government. Just as one of our first acts in 1997 was to bring forward proposals for an Assembly for Wales, so we have moved swiftly in our third term to build on the success of devolution. Once again, that destroys the myth that any party other than Labour is the true party of devolution. It was a Labour Government who appointed the first ever Secretary of State for Wales. It was a Labour Government who broadened and deepened the role of the then Welsh Office. It was a Labour Government who passed the first Welsh Language Act in 1967 and it was a Labour Government who called the 1997 referendum and then passed legislation for a democratically elected Assembly for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_213">No other party has come anywhere near to delivering so much for Wales. Indeed, no other party has ever delivered any devolution for Wales. So as we commemorate 100 years of the parliamentary Labour party, we can be truly proud that devolution, one of the ideals of our first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, has not only been achieved, but is being improved. Once again, it is Labour and only Labour that is delivering on devolution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_214">I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales for his sterling work on the Bill. After four years of silence in the confines of the Whips Office, his voice has been heard during the five days of consideration that the House has given to the Bill. He has dealt patiently and diligently with the issues that Members have raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_215">I should also like to express my appreciation of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan), who, notwithstanding his role as a Whip, has also been able to assist in the progress of the Bill from the Front Bench. Similarly, I thank my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane), who has supported me with his customary energy and enthusiasm&#151;the quietest man in the House. Above all, I thank my excellent team of hard-working officials, drawn from both the Welsh Assembly and our own Wales Office&#151;a partnership in action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_216">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis), who, with the members of his Select Committee, produced a report on the Bill that helped to inform our deliberations. As I have said previously, I envisage his Committee playing a very significant role in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Orders in Council that will come before the House by virtue of the proposals contained in part 3. Such pre-scrutiny is crucial, and it will be open to all Members to submit written evidence for consideration, or even to seek to give oral testimony if they so prefer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_217">I am glad that we have been able to subject the Bill to detailed scrutiny, through some 33 hours of debate on the Floor of the House. The House will be aware that the vast bulk of the Bill was either modelled closely on the Government of Wales Act 1998, or modelled on other statutory provisions that have worked effectively. The finance provisions, for example, draw heavily on those in the Scotland Act 1998. Those 141 clauses have broad cross-party support. I am therefore particularly pleased that the House was able to concentrate its scrutiny on those parts of the Bill that are genuinely new&#151;the 24 clauses on enhanced and primary powers and our 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 208</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposed electoral changes. Those are clearly the most significant parts of the Bill, and I am pleased that they have been given such thorough consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_218">One thing that has not survived the scrutiny of the House is the credibility of the Opposition and their new, supposedly more constructive stance on devolution. First, they tried to scupper the Bill at the outset by tabling a reasoned amendment on Second Reading, and I am told that they may even vote against the Bill on Third Reading. Then they attempted to construct a process of 16 locks to hamper the Assembly acquiring enhanced legislative powers. Then we saw them try to insist on a referendum before Parliament could grant the Assembly even a modest extension of its legislative powers through the Order-in-Council process. Then they tabled amendments that would have reduced the democratically elected Assembly to little more than a Committee of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_219">Finally, the Opposition tried to strike enhanced powers out of the Bill altogether, even though such powers were a clear Labour election manifesto commitment. It is hard to square that approach with the view of their leader, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), who says that he wants to make devolution work. It is even harder to reconcile that with his opinion that, on devolution, the Tories share the views of the Liberal Democrats. They called themselves liberal Conservatives in the recent Scottish by-election. Well, there is not much liberal about their attitude to Wales. I thought the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) would bring a new approach; instead, she has played the same old Tory gramophone record of suspicion and hostility to more powers for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_220">On dual candidacy, we have learned that the Opposition are against the ban because, as the shadow Attorney-General told us, they
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;wish to maximise the chance of getting their chosen people into the Assembly.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 January 2006; Vol. 442, c. 112.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_221">The hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) was worried that such a reform would make life tougher for weak Tory candidates. The Government&#039;s view remains that such matters are for the electorate, rather than the political parties, to determine, so we intend to put the voters back in charge by requiring candidates to choose between the constituency and the list seats and by removing the ability of candidates to guarantee election for themselves regardless of the voters&#039; verdict. There will be no more each-way bets at the voters&#039; expense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_222">We have made great progress in Wales since the establishment of the Assembly, through a strong partnership between our UK Government and Rhodri Morgan&#039;s Labour Welsh Assembly Government. Wales has a strong economy, more jobs, rising prosperity, better hospitals and better schools, but it still has huge challenges to face. Levels of economic inactivity are still far too high. Welsh industry is facing tough global economic competition. Although crime is falling compared with the situation under the Conservative Government, it must be reduced still further, and antisocial behaviour must be combated. We also face important decisions on energy policy to cut costs, guarantee security of supply and keep Wales clean and green. By giving the Assembly the means, through the

<a name="stpa_223">The Bill will settle the constitutional debate in Wales for a generation. For the first time ever, it places full law-making powers for Wales on the statute book. It also recognises the need to proceed by consensus, requiring a referendum while providing a path towards primary powers when that consensus emerges. Some argue that that does not go far enough and that we should move to a referendum immediately. All I say to them is: remember what happened in 1979. The defeat then set back the cause of devolution for a generation. Even in 1997, when all the parties except the Tories were united, we only just squeaked home. I have no doubt that if a referendum were held today, it would be lost. Indeed, I cannot see it happening before the end of this decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_224">I urge all supporters of primary powers, of whom I am one, to recognise the need for consensus. The Bill provides a route to primary powers, but places the responsibility on supporters of primary powers to go out there, build a consensus and win the argument. In the meantime, the Bill develops the existing devolution settlement by conferring enhanced legislative powers on the Assembly&#151;while ensuring that Parliament remains in overall control&#151;and giving it greater discretion to determine the detail of Welsh legislation. That streamlined procedure will enable the Assembly to break free from the Westminster logjam, while ensuring that the final say remains with Parliament just as it does today, as was endorsed in the 1997 referendum. The Bill also means that the Assembly will start to gain new powers from 2007&#151;four years earlier than the Richard commission recommended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_225">My right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), whom I commend for his insightful contributions during the course of our deliberations on the Bill, has referred to the views of the man in Splott market. I am sure that he would agree that the true test of devolution is whether it enables us to deliver positive benefits and lasting changes to the lives of our constituents, whether they be in Cardiff, Pontypool, Neath or Holyhead. The Bill will enable the Assembly to achieve exactly that. It is right at the political centre of gravity in Wales. It provides for better, more responsive, more accountable Welsh government and helps us to build a world-class Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_226">The Bill will provide a lasting constitutional settlement for Wales. It establishes a flexible constitutional architecture that will adapt to Wales&#039;s changing needs over the years to come. It is designed to endure. Whatever changing circumstances we face over the coming years, there will be no case for a successor Government of Wales Bill in the decades to come&#151;this really is it. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_318"><a name="60228-31_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I offer the Secretary of State and all Welsh Members my best wishes for St. David&#039;s day tomorrow. I was at a delightful service earlier today in St. Mary Undercroft with the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Together with the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott), we had the privilege of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 210</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contributing to the service to celebrate St. David&#039;s day. I was sporting a daffodil at that stage, but I am not now because I gave it to a little girl&#151;I think from the London Welsh school&#151;who was also performing at the service. I thought that that was rather nice because she was able to take it home to her mother. I notice that Members on the Labour Front Bench are already wearing their daffodils, but that the Secretary of State&#039;s daffodil is wilting rather badly. That, I hope, is a reflection on Labour&#039;s fortunes in Wales, particularly after this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_227">I pay tribute to my hon. Friends for their assistance on the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) argued with great erudition, particularly on using Orders in Council to delegate law making to secondary legislation. It is always a pleasure to listen to him. He is exact and precise, and he has not found his equal at the Dispatch Box in the Under-Secretary. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell), who I think is taking a well earned break, having been on the Bench alongside me for many hours, has argued from a position of great knowledge on devolution, particularly in Scotland. It is sad that the arguments made by Opposition Members have been swept aside by the Government and given little credence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_228">There have been valuable contributions from Opposition Members. I draw attention in particular to those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I am pleased to note that the three Conservative Members with Welsh seats have all participated in the proceedings on the Bill. I wish that the same could be said for Labour Members with Welsh seats, not all of whom, I am afraid, have taken an active part or interest in the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_229">I started on Second Reading with a positive attitude towards the Bill. There were some aspects on which we agreed with the Government and others that we drew to their attention in the hope that they would rethink their proposals. We purposely did not vote against Second Reading, but chose to highlight the problem areas of the legislation with a reasoned amendment, which we used expressly to launch our concerns about some of the matters in the Bill. With the new, strong intention of my party to try to make devolution work for the people of Wales, I had hoped that the Government would respond positively to our concerns, but that has not been the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_230">We see successful devolution depending not only on the support of the people but on some broad political consensus, requiring in turn constructive dialogue between the political parties. We have seen little or none of that during the Bill&#039;s passage, and I notice that the other Opposition parties also received scant responses to their points. They have been swept aside and ignored by the Labour machine, which cannot bear to be questioned on any part of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_231">In fact, the only amendments that have been accepted are those tabled by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies). I will examine carefully what the Minister said about that, but that appeared to be a Government-placed new clause and amendment because they came as very little surprise to the Minister. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, the new clause came from the CBI and the TUC, but it could just as easily been tabled by the Government as by the hon. Member for Ogmore. I

<br>&nbsp;<br>congratulate him on managing to at least produce some amendment to the Bill, which otherwise appears to be totally unamendable&#151;it has much in common with the Assembly Measures that it sets up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_232">As the Bill has progressed, more issues have emerged, and even the Father of the House has expressed disquiet at some of the provisions. Various claims of support put forward by the Government have not prospered under close scrutiny, and it has become apparent that Labour is putting party politics before the interests of people in Wales. If we are to have a devolution arrangement in Wales that is built to last, we will need more thought and consultation with the people of Wales than is evidenced by this Bill, and all-party support as far as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_233">Briefly, taking the parts in turn, on part 1 we agree with many of the provisions. However, the partisan way in which the Government have plucked out a change to the electoral arrangements to placate their own party members and against any clear advice from the Arbuthnott commission, the Electoral Commission, leading academics and even Labour-sponsored research projects, has made a mockery of their attitude toward the Assembly itself. Even there, a tied vote on that subject revealed that only Labour Assembly Members wanted the change, and in Divisions during our debates in this place, we have had the support of all the Opposition parties. A further change at this stage will undermine electoral confidence at a time when education of the electorate would seem to be the priority, in the interests of electors themselves. Furthermore, banning dual candidacy may impinge on candidates&#039; human rights. I hope that the Members of the other place will look closely at those provisions, coupled with those in clause 11.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_234">We support and agree with the separation of powers of the Assembly and the Executive in part 2. That, in itself, would have justified a Bill that would have received all-party support of the sort that the Government should have sought on changes in the constitutional position of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_235">Part 3 is fraught with problems. It introduces the Order-in-Council provisions, which amount to primary legislation by the back door, to cure an alleged legislative blockage, which has not been proved under questioning. I do not know who is the author of that tortuous legislative route, but it cannot be one who has the best interests of the Assembly in his heart. The procedure is devolution by statutory instrument&#151;or, as the Father of the House said, devolution by salami-slicing. It is a device for saying one thing to one audience and another thing to another, as was pointed out by Lord Richard, whose report has largely been pushed to one side. Lord Richard has expressed some major qualifications in respect of procedure, so I hope that he and his colleagues in the other House will examine the proposals, not least because, if viewed in conjunction with the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which moves the Executive away from traditional ways of legislating to Orders in Council, they lead me to believe that we need to exercise great caution about the ways in which we are changing our systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_236">We have argued that, if part 3 does indeed delegate the substantial powers to which the Secretary of State referred, that should be put to the people of Wales. Apparently, that is not a route that the Government are willing to take in respect of either the part 3 powers or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 212</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the part 4 powers, unless and until they can win any referendum put to the electors. The Bill is not about consulting the people of Wales but about achieving a Labour agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_237">The Secretary of State said that part 4 will settle the constitutional issue for a generation&#151;a claim that he repeated this evening. How can that be, when part 4 leaves the question of additional powers wide open? How can it be, when not even the number of MPs has been discussed, or the number of AMs that might be required if the Assembly takes on the full law-making powers set out in part 4? Some Labour Members have suggested that the whole electoral system should be reviewed; perhaps it would have been better to reflect on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_238">The Bill leaves the House with a lot of unfinished business and with a Government who are trying to create the impression that they are pro-Wales but, after scrutiny by Opposition parties, it has emerged that they are, in fact, purely pro-Labour. Claims have crumbled under scrutiny. The Secretary of State prayed in aid Lord Dahrendorf, Lord Holme and Sir John Arbuthnott, but his claims proved to be not strictly accurate. His claim that there is a legislative blockage hardly stood up to scrutiny, and his claim of abuse by AMs of the electoral system has not been substantiated. He has ignored the Richard commission, Assembly Members, the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Reform Society and leading academics to go his own way and produce legislation that means that the people of Wales will not be consulted at the right time and that will give more responsibility to the Labour Assembly Government before they have even got to grips with the responsibilities that they already have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_239">The Assembly Government have not yet grasped the new local democracy with efficiency or effectiveness. They have broken promises to the electorate&#151;for example, on free care for the disabled and free breakfasts for all primary school kids. They have ditched targets on economic matters, truancy rates and GCSE pass rates, and they have presided over huge increases in waiting lists for operations. That is to name only a few areas in which the performance of the Welsh Assembly Labour Government needs to be improved. To give the Labour Assembly Government more powers before they have flourished and got to grips with the difficult business of governing in areas already under their control is like suffocating the institution before it has embarked on its democratic journey. Faith in the Labour Assembly Government is fragile. Turnout fell at the last Assembly elections by 8 per cent. to 36 per cent., and the Electoral Commission said that that was the result of a lack of awareness of the role of the Assembly and a growing disconnection between the politicians and parts of the electorate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_240">The Secretary of State said at the time that the low turnout was dreadful and that politicians were &quot;talking past the people&quot;. I agree, but it is the Secretary of State who is talking past the people in the Bill. I want the Assembly and the Assembly Government to do a good job for the people of Wales, and my party wants them to succeed. The Bill includes some good proposals, but the Government could not resist the chance to play party politics with it. It is therefore with a heavy and a disappointed heart that, to support the Assembly and to give the people of Wales a voice, I urge my colleagues to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 213</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>vote against the Bill. I regret that we were unable to have a better dialogue with the Government during its passage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_241">I want no nonsense from the Secretary of State and I do not want to hear his usual track of alleging that Conservatives are against devolution. He knows that that is not true. We want to make devolution work and we want it to secure substantial cross-party agreement on many matters. Ours is not an anti-devolution vote, nor is it an anti-Assembly vote. It is a vote against a Government who put party before people. That is not good for the House, and it is not good for Wales. The Opposition will do everything they can to explain to the people of Wales that the Labour Government are trying to manipulate their future for 10 or 15 years on the basis of a Labour fix while they remain in power. I sincerely hope that they will lose that power at the next Assembly election in 2007. In the meantime, to protect the health of the Assembly, its effectiveness and efficiency, and in the interests of the people of Wales, the Opposition have been forced by the intransigence of the Secretary of State and the Government to vote against the Bill.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Wales, which was set out by the Richard commission. The Richard commission proposed an 80-Member Senedd with primary law-making powers elected by a single transferable vote system, and the Bill delivers some of that. The Bill provides two pathways for the Assembly to gain primary legislative powers, which are otherwise known as Assembly Measures, namely the Order-in-Council procedure and a referendum in Wales. It also creates a strong and clear basis for the Assembly to exercise greater powers more efficiently by separating the Assembly&#039;s Executive and legislative elements. That change was so desperately needed that the Assembly was heading that way itself through various ad hoc measures, and it is to the Government&#039;s credit that they have formalised that distinction. The Bill is a step away from the Conservative anti-devolution strategy, which would significantly dilute the potential for Wales to gain primary legislative powers by putting a whole series of restrictions and conditions between where the Liberal Democrats would like the Welsh Assembly to be and where it actually is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_250">So much more could have been done in the Bill, which is the product of compromise not with other parties or pro-devolution organisations in Wales, but with Labour Back Benchers. By caving in to internal pressure, the Government have missed an opportunity, and a number of points will need to be reconsidered in a future reworking of the devolution argument. In fairness, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham has highlighted concerns that we share. The extreme concentration of power in the hands of the Secretary of State is not appropriate.

What matters now is that we understand the way in which the new system will work. In particular, I hope that the Secretary of State will apply his mind to the many criticisms of the Orders-in-Council process that he envisages.

That is what my Conservative colleagues in the Welsh Assembly have done, and I am very proud of them. It is partly because we have worked extremely hard to make devolution work for the people in Wales that Labour Members have become frustrated and have had to use their strength in Parliament to change the voting system in a way that they know will hinder the Opposition parties.

There is a contradiction and a tension there, and that is why I think that, in his heart of hearts, the Secretary of State does not believe his own assertion that the Bill, shot through with contradictions as it is, can resolve the national question that we in Wales have debated for so many generations.

The Secretary of State will find that in years to come the people of Wales will grow to resent that. They will demand the right to state their position in a referendum, and I hope that they do it sooner rather than later. I also hope that at that stage the Secretary of State will listen to what they have to say and abide by their decision.

<a name="60228-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_284">The Bill is flawed. As a matter of principle, I cannot possibly support it. Frankly, I find the position of Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats accommodating in the extreme. They have compromised their principles, but the occupants of the Conservative Benches will not. For that reason, I shall vote against the Bill.

<p><a name="st_361"><a name="60228-35_spnew1"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> 
: I am pleased to speak towards the end of the very long process of our dealings with the Bill. I spoke on Second Reading, I spoke in Committee, and I am pleased to be here at the denouement. I am also pleased to see that at the end of the long process of Welsh debate on what will become the Government of Wales Act, many English Members are gathering on the Benches here to see it through&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> And Scottish and Northern Ireland Members, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_285">I begin by congratulating fellow Members on the arduous journey of these debates, and on bringing the Bill to what I hope will be a successful conclusion, which we shall see in a few moments. I also thank the Chairman and the members of the Welsh Affairs Committee, who have contributed so strongly to the development of the Bill with their ideas. I want to mention the members of the Wales TUC and the CBI, whose support has undoubtedly&#151;albeit on one small part in one clause&#151;contributed significantly to ensuring that the voices not only of employers, but of employees 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 225</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and unions are more firmly represented in the Bill than has previously been the case in legislation. That recognises the good work that the Welsh Assembly has already done in dealing with the affairs of business, and also puts it there right in front of us so that there can be no retreat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_286">The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) mentioned that we now have half a loaf&#151;but my reading of the situation is that at the moment, half a loaf is what is being demanded. There is no stomach for anything more than what is on offer. However, this is a still a process, and there are still questions. Devolution was never a moment in time, or a definitive statement followed by a stop.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_287">What is in the Bill undoubtedly will not satisfy some Members here because it does not go far enough for them. For others, it goes much too far, and they would like us to roll back the whole thing. I have been speaking to my constituents since the start of the process, at the time of Second Reading and all the way through. I have to say that there are not many people knocking on my surgery door to ask about the Bill&#151;and when we do get into discussion about it, there is no great appetite for running headlong into further referendums and transfers of primary powers. However, what there is&#151;and what the Bill in its present form recognises&#151;is the fact that the Welsh Assembly Government are starting to deliver well. They are starting to be recognised more and more by the Welsh people for the way in which they connect with communities, consult and, at a very local level, do far more than the old Welsh Office used to do. That is good, but there is no appetite to rush headlong any further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_288">The three main components of the Bill, and the split between the Executive and legislative powers, seem to have caused no great difficulty for most people. By and large, that was one of the easiest areas to take through. I think that all of us, or at least many of us&#151;everyone apart from the Conservatives&#151;are looking forward to maximum use of the Orders in Council, and to seeing that system working. It is a good stage development of the devolution process. Labour Members recognise that the Bill does not go as far as some people want, but we think that what we now have with the Orders in Council, and what we will be voting on in a few minutes, is exactly what the Welsh people are now willing to accept.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_289">The most contentious area of all is the idea of standing as a first-past-the-post candidate in one seat, losing and then, the following morning, being resurrected as a regional Member. We will never agree on that across these Benches, but&#151;as we have said throughout progress on the Bill&#151;it does not seem right, in terms of natural justice, that there should be a Lazarus-like resurrection of candidates the morning after they have been soundly defeated. We will not agree on that, but we think that the changes are appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_290">I also wish to put firmly to bed the idea, which has been frequently thrown at us, that the most contentious proposal has anything to do with gerrymandering. We have shown time and again that&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> As has just been said from a sedentary position, it is not partisan, because Labour Members will be as likely to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 226</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>lose out as Opposition Members. I do not wish to regurgitate the arguments from Committee, but the changes are to no one party&#039;s particular advantage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_291">I welcome the approach being taken by the Liberal Democrats and Plaid, because even though they are not happy with everything in the Bill, they have said that they will go out and try and make it work. Regrettably, that is in stark contrast to the major Opposition party. At the beginning of this process, we hoped that the Conservatives would say that although they had difficulties with some of the details, they supported in principle the idea of staged devolution at a pace suitable to the Welsh people. Unless Opposition Members change their views in the next few minutes, it seems that only one party in Wales will, once again, nail its colours firmly to the anti-devolution mast. That is a matter for great regret because, regardless of the difficulties with the Bill, it would be great to be able to say with one voice that we were all united.
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="60228-35_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I reiterate that it is with heavy hearts that we will vote against the Bill. We are not prepared to support devolution by taking scraps that fall from the Labour table, as the Liberal Democrats and Plaid are obviously satisfied with doing. In voting in that way, we will vote in the interests of the Assembly, the people of Wales and Wales itself. To represent our position in any other way would be dishonest.
</p>





<p><a name="st_363"><a name="60228-35_spnew3"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I have been called worse things in my time and probably will be again. However, whether the Bill is scraps from the table or half or loaf, what is on offer tonight is exactly what the Welsh people are demanding. It is a huge regret that at the last minute of the eleventh hour the Conservative party&#151;the main Opposition&#151;should set its face firmly against devolution. The Conservatives cannot seriously hold their heads up high tomorrow. They cannot ever again say that they support devolution. They would be   laughing stocks if they tried to maintain that position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_292">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden), I take particular pride in and satisfaction from the fact that new clause 12&#151;which is unique to this Bill and has been incorporated into it through the Government&#039;s acceptance and with cross-party support&#151;will strengthen the links not only with employers&#039; federations and small and large businesses, but with our union colleagues. That will be a major advance in the Assembly&#039;s existing arrangements. In major decisions on environmental, social and economic well-being, there will be a duty for the Assembly to consult with employers and employees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_293">That is a huge move forward and I regret that this evening the Conservatives will be voting not only against devolution and the principles of devolution, but against new clause 12 which gives a voice to employers and employees. Alone in the House, the Conservative party is setting its face against the CBI, the TUC and devolution in Wales. That is remarkable and I look forward to Conservative Members justifying it not only to their constituents but to the head of the CBI in Wales and the head of the TUC.

<p><a name="st_371"><a name="60228-37_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset) (Con):</b> 
 This debate concerns a serious situation in my constituency with regard to the future provision of housing. It exemplifies a conflict between existing structure plans and the yet-to-be-determined regional spatial strategy. It also exemplifies a dilemma because in the north and west of my constituency, which is part of the North Dorset district, the policies seem to be different from those in the eastern part of my constituency, in the East Dorset district.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_297">In the east, the debate on the proposed regional spatial strategy seems to centre on eating up more of the green belt, whereas it appears that the existing policy framework in the north, and the development of what is today a series of vibrant market towns, is being frustrated by the Government office for the south-west and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_298">Planning, and the calling in of planning applications by the Secretary of State, is obviously a serious matter. It is not my purpose to discuss the merits of these particular applications. That has been according to the due democratic process, and if there is a public inquiry, they will be examined there. I want to examine what is behind the decisions to call in the applications, and more particularly the effect that that is having in my constituency and the implications for the future of housing provision there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_299">The Government office for the south-west has called in two planning applications that were submitted to North Dorset district council for the Secretary of State&#039;s own determination, which would follow a public local inquiry. The main reason given is that the proposal may conflict with national policies on important matters. The planning applications that I refer to are in the town of Shaftesbury, which was recently described by one property magazine as one of the 10 most desirable places to live in England. I do not know whether that was because the local Member of Parliament lives in the town, but I suspect that other factors were involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_300">In that call-in, the inspector will consider the extent to which the proposed developments accord with RPG10, the regional planning guidance for the south-west; the extent to which they are consistent with the adopted Dorset, Poole and Bournemouth joint structure plan and the adopted North Dorset-wide local plan; and the extent to which the applications may prejudice the emerging regional spatial strategy and the consequences for the appropriate scale and distribution of housing development in North Dorset, including in Shaftesbury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_301">The two applications are for outline planning permission to develop land for residential and mixed-use purposes. A total of 190 units of affordable housing would be offered in these schemes. They will also offer many community and transport facilities, a cycle-way, pedestrian infrastructure and the expansion of education facilities. The schemes are consistent with the existing local plan and the structure plan and have already been tested by public inquiry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_302">North Dorset faces serious problems with the decline in its traditional farming economy. Younger people are leaving the area and there is a growing and large 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 232</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>affordability gap for the indigenous population who want to live locally. House prices are rising fast and all the market towns in North Dorset require regeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_303">The call-in raises important questions and serious matters of principle. The case has been called in ahead of the regional spatial strategy&#151;in other words, in advance of any approved regional policy. The regional economic strategy, which has been approved, states that affordable housing is one of the key elements in building the local economy. The provisions made by the Housing Corporation and the district&#039;s own housing needs survey show that the applications are consistent with the predictions of need&#151;in fact, they fall far short of the needs identified for affordable housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_304">The policy of the regional spatial strategy and Government policy in RPG10 are clear that the main focus of development should be on the principal urban areas, with some growth in other designated centres for growth. Development outside those areas should be smaller scale to meet local needs. Unfortunately, market towns in North Dorset have not been designated as areas for growth; it is self-evident, however, that the market towns need a certain amount of growth to remain sustainable. In the rural White Paper, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acknowledges that towns in rural, coastal and coalfield regions have serious economic difficulties with the loss of younger people, low wages and heavy dependency on primary industries such as agriculture, which causes social and economic difficulties where there is a large change in those industries. The White Paper sees market towns as a focus for growth in areas that need regeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_305">North Dorset district council has successfully set up community planning partnerships to assist the regeneration of the market towns. The partnerships have ensured a high degree of local involvement with and support for the development schemes. The White Paper states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;We want people to be able to live in the communities where they grew up. In the South West there is a severe shortage of affordable housing for local people. We are doubling the Housing Corporation rural programme to provide 3,000 homes a year nationally in small rural settlements and we will provide more affordable homes as part of mixed developments in market towns and villages.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_306">The district council estimates that about 600 affordable homes are needed each year to meet the needs of the area and wants to focus development in its market towns. That is in line with the spirit of Government policy, but the current mismatch of the regional spatial strategy, the rural White Paper and the regional economic strategy leave Dorset people the losers.

Does that mean that we have to stop? In my constituency, these towns need development. We are not talking about areas that have been ignored. The South West of England Regional Development Agency published a document entitled &quot;Raising the Game&quot; in which it looked at key economic performance indicators for those areas, including the market towns in my constituency. The percentage of the working-age population with NVQ level 4 qualifications and above is

<br>&nbsp;<br>the highest in the south-west region at 30.5 per cent. The percentage of people with NVQ level 3 qualifications and above is 54.7 per cent.&#151;more than half the population&#151;compared with the national average of 45 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_314">The average employment rate in my constituency is one of the highest in the area at 82.5 per cent., compared with the national average of less than 75.5 per cent. It is a vibrant economic area, but it desperately needs affordable housing. The provision of such housing is the highest propriety in the Dorset community strategy, which has been endorsed by the Dorset strategic partnership that brings together all the local authorities in the country. The sustainability of the market towns is dependent on a certain amount of development through which districts can lever in affordable housing and economic development. The Government are calling for a concerted effort from local authorities to boost the development of housing to meet the urgent need for more dwellings, so it is ironic that the Secretary of State, via the Government office, has called in those planning applications in North Dorset that, together, would provide about 670 dwellings, of which 180 would be affordable homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_315">The sites in question provide the bulk of a major allocation for the town of Shaftesbury, as proposed in the North Dorset local plan, which was adopted in 2003. The strategy behind that plan and the reason for the allocation were scrutinised in the local plan inquiry in 1999. In reaching his conclusions, the local plan inspector noted that he had considered the objections made in the light of PPG3 on housing, which was published in March 2000 while he was writing his report on the objections to the local plan. The plan conformed with the adopted structure plan and regional planning guidance to 2011. Although the Government office raised concerns about the allocation at the modification stage, it did not pursue them or prevent adoption of the plan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_316">In accordance with Government guidance, the prospective developers of the Shaftesbury site undertook a major consultation using resources provided by the Prince&#039;s Foundation to hold a three stage &quot;Enquiry by Design&quot; event, which involved the local community and a wide range of stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para23">
<a name="stpa_317">Planning applications were submitted alongside a detailed environmental impact assessment, and the applications were again subject to major public consultation and detailed scrutiny. The applications were supported by the town council, the local community partnership and, most importantly, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, as the site is surrounded by the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire area of outstanding natural beauty and is clearly visible from a significant National Trust property at Melbury Beacon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-37_para24">
<a name="stpa_318">Together, the applications will contribute not only the 180 new affordable dwellings, but a new bus service to the development, new community facilities in the form of a community hall, open space and more allotments, and major financial contributions to a number of other facilities in the town that were required under the council&#039;s planning obligations. Without the contributions that the development will make, many of

<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 236</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Deputy Prime Minister has as its key objective sustainable communities in all regions of the country, and this debate is an excellent opportunity to reinforce that commitment. The current regional spatial strategy for the south-west, RPG10, focuses development on the region&#039;s principal urban areas with some growth at other designated centres for growth, which includes the region&#039;s main towns and cities. RPG10 advises that development outside those areas should be on a smaller scale to meet local needs. The emerging review of the regional spatial strategy, which the South West regional assembly is considering, seeks to continue and reinforce this direction while increasing overall levels of housing delivery across the region in order to meet growth needs and address the affordability problems that I have described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_325">I know that there is an important question about what rate of housing development is appropriate in North Dorset to meet local needs. The Dorset structure plan set a rate some time ago of approximately 335 dwellings a year and that requirement is long overdue for review, and I understand that the emerging regional spatial strategy currently anticipates a much lower rate of 220 dwellings a year by 2026. Some say that that represents a major slow-down of development, limits the scope for affordable housing and threatens to put market towns in the district into recession. Others say that maintaining such high rates of housing development only sustains high rates of car commuting and provides limited benefits to local people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_326">What are the possible solutions to that dilemma? I believe it important to look at bespoke solutions to issues and problems in rural communities rather than treating growth as a one-size-fits-all solution be it North Dorset or North Cornwall. The issue is about understanding our communities&#039; needs and how our communities work. As the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, inward migration is a main component of population growth in North Dorset, as it is in the south-west as a whole. Gathering evidence and understanding local housing markets is a key step in ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of housing to meet local needs, including the important issue of affordable housing. As far as rates of housing development are concerned, there clearly needs to be a proper judgment in relation to demand and supply within the housing market area consistent with our desire to promote a sustainable pattern development for the region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60228-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_327">The regional spatial strategy will set that balance with a planning framework for a sustainable pattern of development for the south-west, and in so doing it will set rates of housing development for North Dorset looking forward to 2026. The Government&#039;s commitment to tackling housing supply, to the provision of more affordable housing and to reforms to the planning system equips local communities with the tools to focus on solutions tailored to local needs.

<a name="stpa_328">What are the Government doing? We are keen to increase the supply of housing and to address the problems of affordability. It is clear that there still needs to be substantial housing in the small towns and villages of the region with a focus on delivering more affordable housing. However, it is also important that the south-west owns the agenda&#151;if I can put it that way, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;and seeks its own solutions.

<a name="stpa_331">Draft PPS3 suggests how local planning authorities might use their local development frameworks to set the balance of different household types to be provided across the plan area. Those measures, along with others, are intended to strengthen the ability of North Dorset, and of every local community, better to meet its housing needs.

<a name="stpa_332">Turning to our package of investment in housing, I am extremely proud of the increased resources that the Government have provided for more affordable housing. We have increased spending on new affordable homes to &#163;2 billion in 2007&#150;08&#151;more than double the 1997 level. The region&#039;s No. 1 priority is the provision of more affordable housing to help to improve the balance of its housing markets.

<a name="stpa_333">I look forward to the report this spring by the affordable rural housing commission, which the Government have set up to investigate the issues surrounding the provision of affordable housing in rural areas. However, in recognition of the increasingly acute affordable housing issues in the south-west following the 2004 spending review, we have already allocated the south-west the largest increase of the English regions&#151;up from &#163;137 million in 2005&#150;06 to &#163;203 million in 2007&#150;08. That is a 48 per cent. increase.

<a name="stpa_334">Final details of the Housing Corporation&#039;s 2006 to 2008 programme will be announced shortly, but I can say that in the market area that includes the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, it proposes to allocate more than &#163;30 million in 2006 to 2008. Moreover, the south-west housing body has set a target to provide at least 800 homes in the smallest rural settlements, taking an estimated 11 per cent. of the total programme, with a further &#163;85 million intended to be invested in other settlements in rural areas such as market and county towns.

<a name="stpa_335">My Department has as its key objective sustainable communities in all regions. The hon. Gentleman, with obvious commitment to his constituency, has rightly provided an opportunity to reinforce the Government&#039;s commitment to a better future for the south-west. I recognise the problem that he describes and hope that I have been able to explain the Government&#039;s policy, which recognises the dilemma that exists. I commend that policy to the House and look forward to further debates on the important issues that the hon. Gentleman raised.
