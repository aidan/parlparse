We are quite clear that those who have a past can explain for themselves.

Will he also make it clear that any resources that the Historical Enquiries Team needs to pursue these particular allegations will be forthcoming, and that the community in Northern Ireland can be assured of an equality of pursuit of allegations in Northern Ireland against dissident republicans and mainstream republicans if they were involved in terrorist activities, such as have been alleged not just by WikiLeaks but by the former Irish Prime Minister?</p>

 We are strong supporters of the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, who are looking at every one of the 3,268 deaths over the course of the troubles, and we are satisfied that they are absolutely colour-blind in approaching every one of these dreadful incidents. They have also been accredited with neutrality by European institutions, and we are happy that they should pursue their work, which is in the hands of the devolved Administration and financed locally. The Prime Minister and I have been on the record on many occasions, supporting the neutral work of the HET, because we know it does bring significant satisfaction to the families who have so far received reports.</p>

What discussions has the Minister had with the POA to bring the service forward and to get a balance, which is clearly what we need?</p>

 I have, of course, followed those comments and seen the various interviews with the Justice Minister, David Ford. These are devolved matters: prisons are the responsibility of the Department of Justice. We follow these matters closely, but they are best left to those properly in charge of them.</p>

With the Work programme we will be launching the biggest back-to-work programme in this country for 70 years. To be accurate, although part of the figures are disappointing, they are mixed because we see that the claimant count has come down in the unemployment figures and we are also seeing an increase in the number of vacancies in our economy-every day there are another 10,000 vacancies. So, yes, we have to get the private sector going and increase the number of jobs available. Over the past six months, we have seen 300,000 new private sector jobs.

Yes, we have responsibility, as a Government and as a House of Commons, to deliver on the military covenant for our personnel in the armed services, but there is a broader responsibility on businesses, on the media, on us as individuals and on the whole country to work out what more we can do to recognise the bravery of these people who do so much on our behalf.</p>

 I can do that. Auschwitz-Birkenau is a very powerful reminder of the ultimate consequences of intolerance, and it is only right that it should be preserved to bear witness to the deaths of the millions of victims who perished there and to act as a stark reminder of man's inhumanity to man. The director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation has recently visited the UK to discuss funding with a number of Government Departments, and we are also involved in EU discussions. I think everyone in this House knows how important it is to maintain these memorials.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para18"><a name="10121530000189">In all three primary party manifestos, we vowed to promote national integration. One of the most effective ways of achieving that is to make the saints' days of St George and St David bank holidays in England and Wales respectively. This is a subject that means a lot to me and to many of my constituents in Stratford-on-Avon. I stood up and promised the people of Stratford-on-Avon that I would not add to the legislative burden that they already face and that I would take away from it. I promised that if I had the chance, I would introduce this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para19"><a name="10121530000190">Unlike our neighbours in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, England and Wales do not currently celebrate our saints' days as bank holidays, which is something that I wish to change. It is quite right that in 2011 there should be a special one-off bank holiday to celebrate the royal wedding, but from 2012 onwards, the royal wedding bank holiday should be replaced by bank holidays that celebrate our two countries' patron saints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para20"><a name="10121530000191">We all know St George as the famous dragon slayer whose bravery freed a town from the tyranny of a vicious dragon and eventually led the townsfolk to Christianity. I have to point out, however, that St George was an immigrant to this country. St George is widely believed to have been born in Turkey and served in the Roman army before being taken into English hearts. My hon. Friend the Father of the House, who is an expert on that region, tells me that he may even have been of Kurdish origin-I speculate further that his skin may have been my shade of tan. St David is remembered not only for his miracles and for his close affinity to nature, but as a great unifying force for Christianity and for Wales. Both saints had a huge impact on the culture of their respective countries. What they stood for is just as relevant today as it was way back then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para21"><a name="10121530000192">We all know our patron saints, but why is it important to celebrate them? The best answer is simple: it is through national days that we can celebrate what makes our nation so great. On such days, we can be yet more proud of the best aspects of English and Welsh culture and society, such as our history of tolerance, acceptance and scientific innovation, and the huge impact that we have had on the history of the world. There is so much to be proud of in our past and so much that our children can learn from, both in our successes and our mistakes.</p>

together and celebrate all that makes Britain great. I am a firm believer in the supreme value of our culture and history, and we should never let anyone tell us not to celebrate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para23"><a name="10121530000194">I will now put to bed the one argument against such a change, which I have heard time and again, that an extra bank holiday would be bad for our economy. As a businessman and entrepreneur who has built strong and enduring businesses, I reject the idea that one extra bank holiday will affect productivity. The working people of this country will do the work that they need to do regardless of a new bank holiday. We must remember that the whole concept of work has changed. Work is no longer just about turning up at a particular place at a particular time and then leaving at a fixed time. One beneficiary of the proposal would be small shops and businesses in our town centres, which would benefit from extra custom during the holiday. Our local pubs will undoubtedly attract many people who wish to toast St George or St David. Through the creation of special events for those days, our leisure and tourism industries will do well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para24"><a name="10121530000195">To further put the proposal in context, we should consider the relatively few bank holidays that we receive compared with our European and north American neighbours. We are 16th in Europe with only eight bank holidays, whereas France has 11, Sweden has 11 and Germany has 12. Even our notoriously hard-working American friends have 13 bank holidays a year, although I accept that they take less vacation time overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para25"><a name="10121530000196">Interestingly, and by a strange coincidence, YouGov recently commissioned a survey into the British public's attitude on this issue. It discovered strong public support for an increase in the number of bank holidays. More than two thirds of adults-68%-think that it would be appropriate for Great Britain to have at least nine days of public holiday a year. Of the calendar occasions that are candidates for the extra bank holiday, YouGov found that St George's day is the most popular with 22% of support. That is just ahead of Remembrance day on 21%, which is the other clear favourite. The battle of Trafalgar and the summer solstice came third and fourth respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para26"><a name="10121530000197">I am delighted that the Prime Minister heard my call for the flag of St George to be flown over Downing street in the summer. It is high time that the flag was taken back from those groups that are not worthy of it. Today could be a huge step in the right direction. If passed, the Bill could be of real benefit to social cohesion in England and Wales, and I hope that colleagues will join me in supporting it and making it a reality. It would be a very fine wedding present to both nations. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

House to say to the Executive, "It will be jolly nice to get the Bill through quickly." We are here to scrutinise the Bill. It matters not what team Back Benchers are on: they are here to hold the Government to account. I said that as an Opposition Member and I shall say it as a Government Member. The Minister remarked that the longer he spoke, the more he would eat into time on Second Reading, but the Government designed the allocation of time motion in that way. When we were in opposition, we said that that such remarks were appalling, and they are also appalling in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para36"><a name="10121530000220">This motion contains one of the most draconian guillotines we have ever seen in Parliament. It contains 16 separate restrictions on debate, it is longer and has more words than the Bill itself, and it is designed purely to restrict debate and to remove the right to vote on amendments in Committee. I am afraid that it is as bad as those we used to see under the previous Government. It is rubber-stamping at its finest. The motion proposes to rush through legislation at a speed that would win approval in North Korea and to take Parliament for granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para37"><a name="10121530000221">This is not my first time scrutinising a Government who are trying to rush a Bill through Parliament. Coincidentally, the circumstances of a debate on a Northern Ireland Bill on 4 March 2009 were very much the same, in so far as the Government tried to rush through a Bill in one day when, as now, it was not necessary to do so. Therefore, I feel that we have come full circle. Here we are with a different Government-a coalition Government-who are trying to rush through another Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para38"><a name="10121530000222">As a trained chartered accountant, I am rather partial to my numbers. Therefore, I would like to read out a few. Three and a half hours is the amount of time that Parliament is being given for the Second Reading debate of the Bill; £3.25 billion is the minimum amount that the Bill proposes to give the Republic of Ireland; and zero is the probable chance that the House of Lords will be able to scrutinise it, because it will most likely be certified as a money Bill. Let me expand on those three figures. Three and a half hours for Parliament to debate a Bill on Second Reading-actually, I should have said that three and a half hours is the maximum time that we are being given, because the time starts from the moment that the allocation of time debate starts. If the allocation of time debate runs its full course and there is a Division, the time for a Second Reading debate on a Bill that proposes spending £3.25 billion will be a maximum of 15 minutes. The Chancellor will not have cleared his throat in 15 minutes. In other words, we will be spending £216 million a minute during that debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para39"><a name="10121530000223">One could argue that none of these things matters-we saw it all the time in the previous Parliament-because we have the backstop of the other place, which cannot limit debates, and Members can scrutinise the Bill clause by clause and vote on amendments. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this Bill: because it will be certified as a money Bill, there will be limited time for debate in the other place. We therefore do not have the backstop, so it is up to this House to scrutinise the Bill properly. This is a most draconian guillotine motion and is entirely unnecessary, and I intend to try to divide the House on this most important matter. Whether one is for or  <br>

against the principle of the Bill-or, indeed, whether one is indifferent to it-we as parliamentarians must demand proper time for debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para40"><a name="10121530000224">It is important to set out the reasons why all stages of the Loans to Ireland Bill should not take place on one day. Let us consider the circumstances under which the Government can legitimately push their legislation through all its stages in one day. I understand that in national emergencies, such as those relating to terrorism, the swift progression of a Bill through Parliament is needed. However, the Loans to Ireland Bill is not one of those Bills. Since 1997, only a handful of Bills have been pushed through the Commons in one day alone. The last one was the Northern Ireland Bill in 2009, which I referred to a few moments ago, but let us look at the typical Bill that has gone through in one day and the precedents that this motion creates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para41"><a name="10121530000225">On 4 April 2001, the Elections Bill went through all its stages in one day, owing to the national crisis caused by the foot and mouth epidemic. Clearly that is not a reason for the Loans to Ireland Bill to go through in one day. On 2 September 1998, Parliament was recalled from its summer recess to pass all stages of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Bill, as an urgent response to the terrible Omagh bombing. Again, that does not apply to today's Bill. On 19 February 2008, the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill was passed in relation to Northern Rock, and therefore needed to be rushed through the Commons. The House sat until midnight on that day, which I understand was because of market sensitivity. Again, that does not apply to today's Bill. None of those exceptional circumstances applies to the Loans to Ireland Bill. If this guillotine motion goes through, the Government will have set a dangerous precedent for curtailing debate and excluding proper parliamentary scrutiny on controversial issues.</p>

That means that all these people on the Government Benches want me to shut up, so that we can get on with Second Reading. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Well, my colleagues behind me are going to be disappointed. The newer Members of this Parliament are going to learn-I know that they are keen on this, because they want parliamentary scrutiny, not rubber-stamping-that there is a simple way for all my colleagues on the Government Benches and for Opposition Members to get into the debate, which is to defeat the guillotine motion in a vote.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. If we do not get it right today, this coalition Government and future Governments will use the same trick again and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para42"><a name="10121530000230">What I am doing is not a wrecking manoeuvre; nor is it about stopping the Bill from making progress. All we need to do is defeat the guillotine motion now, and then there will be a full Second Reading debate, followed by the Committee stage and Third Reading. The current situation is an abuse of Parliament and its democracy. Normal rules are being abandoned so that the Government can get things through on the nod. Surely I am not mistaken that the only possible reason for proceeding today would be if the Minister had written a cheque for £3.25 billion last night and handed it to the Irish Government. Then I might be inclined to agree that we should get on with things today. However, the Minister does not seem to be leaping to the Dispatch Box to confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para43"><a name="10121530000231">One argument for pushing the Bill through could be the lack of space in the parliamentary calendar and an inability to spare any more time to debate it, but we all know that that is not true. Even with recess upon us, we could have abandoned the Backbench Business Committee debate tomorrow-Thursday-and had the Committee stage and Third Reading instead. However, if that was not the flavour of the will of the House, we could have used Monday, for which a general debate is listed. If the general debate were abandoned, Government business would not be lost, and the debate could be rescheduled for another time. Alternatively, if there really is an emergency and the Bill really does need to be progressed now, let the House sit this Friday until the business is complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para44"><a name="10121530000232">Parliament could be allowed a full day on Second Reading, which would occur after the allocation of time motion were defeated, and the Government could then choose Thursday, Friday or Monday for Committee and Third Reading. That would in no way hold up progress; nor could it be interpreted as letting our friends in Europe down. Indeed, the idea that they do not take our word for it that the Government are serious is also, I have to say, not believable. If the Government say that they are going to give £3.25 billion to Ireland in a loan, they know that that is what will happen, so that argument is just an excuse to push the Bill through in one day.</p>

 Mr Speaker, you would rightly tick me off if I answered that question. That is a matter for the Second Reading debate, because it is to do with the issues in the Bill.

The advantage of splitting the debate over two days is that it would allow a proper debate on Second Reading today. I believe that many Members would like to take part in such a debate. It would also allow amendments to be tabled in the normal way, and enable us to have a proper debate in Committee, with time for a debate and votes on each of the amendments. There would also be time for a Third Reading debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para46"><a name="10121530000236">I understand that the Government have tabled a manuscript amendment today, although I have not seen it. That amendment has been tabled without allowing Members the time to consider it. That just shows the weakness of this procedure. If the allocation of time motion were defeated, we would have a full Second Reading debate and the Government would have to rearrange their business to provide for the Committee stage and Third Reading. The loan would still go through, but the Bill would have been properly debated and, if necessary, amended. Defeating the allocation of time motion would not wreck the Bill; it would simply give more time for proper scrutiny so that the Bill could be improved. We have already seen that the Government have tabled a manuscript amendment. What will happen if, during the 15 minutes of the Second Reading debate, a Member decides that they want to table an amendment? They just will not have time to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para47"><a name="10121530000237">How does the motion fit in with the principles behind parliamentary sittings? The present timetabling of our sittings is broadly based on the Jopling reforms and encompasses three principles. It is against those three principles that we should judge the Bill today. The first is that the Government must be able to get their business through, and, within that principle, ultimately control the time of the House. Secondly, the Opposition must have the opportunity to scrutinise the actions of the Government and to improve or oppose legislation as they think fit. Thirdly-this is of more interest to me-Back-Bench Members on both sides of the Chamber should have reasonable opportunities to raise matters of concern from their constituents. A number of my constituents have contacted me with concerns about this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para48"><a name="10121530000238">A major role of Members of Parliament is to scrutinise and review legislation. It is a well-known fact-I doubt that anyone in the House would disagree with this-that the better the scrutiny, the better the Bill. It is also a major role of Members of Parliament who are not members of the Executive to hold the Executive to account, whichever party or parties make up that Executive. That is one the most important roles we have as Members of Parliament. This motion removes that role. It is appalling that the coalition Government should try to stifle that essential function. I have long campaigned for more transparency and debate in Parliament. I strongly believe in strengthening the role of the Back Bencher. The erosion of parliamentary power to scrutinise legislation has been a long-adopted approach by successive Governments. This motion, I am afraid, is a step too far. Individual Members of Parliament attach a great deal of importance to scrutiny and accountability, and problems arise when the Executive try to deny us that right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para49"><a name="10121530000239">The Government have declared that amendments must be tabled before Second Reading, which is ludicrous. They ask MPs to table amendments before we have had  <br>

a chance to hear what the Minister has to say. How can MPs properly table amendments when they have not heard the details and the arguments? Despite that difficulty, 11 amendments have already been tabled. The Government were forced to produce a three-page document-I have it with me-of amendments, and another five-page document on their justification for rushing the Bill through. These documents were produced only in the last few days. How can they, and the amendments, realistically be scrutinised if the Bill goes through all its stages today? It is just not possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para50"><a name="10121530000240">The House of Lords got rather fed up with the Commons bouncing it, so it has now come up with a procedure whereby the Government have to answer a number of questions-I think it is eight-before they can get a Bill such as this through. Those questions are printed in the explanatory notes to the Bill. Let us look at some of them for a minute, and see whether the answers hold up to scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para51"><a name="10121530000241">The first question is: "Why is fast-tracking necessary?" The notes go on to explain that the proposal is for a bilateral loan, and that the timing of the UK's proposed loan is currently unclear. They state:</p>
<a name="101215-0001.htm_brev46"><a name="10121530002173"><ul><p class="tabletext">"It is necessary to fast-track the Bill so that the UK's international partners can be confident that the bilateral loan will be implemented."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para52"><a name="10121530000242">That is an absolutely hopeless answer to the question. It does not tell us why the Bill is being fast-tracked. It is ridiculous to suggest that our international partners would think that, because we had not taken another day or two to debate the Bill, the Government were not going to proceed with the loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para53"><a name="10121530000243">The next question is:</p>
<a name="101215-0001.htm_brev47"><a name="10121530002174"><ul><p class="tabletext">"What is the justification for fast-tracking each element of the Bill?"</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para54"><a name="10121530000244">Again, there does not seem to be an answer. The notes state:</p>
<a name="101215-0001.htm_brev48"><a name="10121530002175"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Bill is a short Bill, with few substantive provisions other than to provide for sums required by the Treasury".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para55"><a name="10121530000245">Yes, the Bill is short because many of the provisions deal with statutory instruments and affirmative resolutions. It is an important Bill, but it is short because many of the provisions do not go into detail. That is exactly why we need a proper Second Reading debate. I do not think that the Government have answered that question either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para56"><a name="10121530000246">The next question is a good one:</p>
<a name="101215-0001.htm_brev49"><a name="10121530002176"><ul><p class="tabletext">"What efforts have been made to ensure the amount of time made available for parliamentary scrutiny has been maximised?"</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para57"><a name="10121530000247">The answer is:</p>
<a name="101215-0001.htm_brev50"><a name="10121530002177"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Bill is being published on the same day it is introduced and arrangements are being made for amendments to be accepted in advance of second reading in the House of Commons."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para58"><a name="10121530000248">How on earth does that answer the question about making time available for parliamentary scrutiny? It is like the Prime Minister being asked a question at Prime Minister's questions and giving an answer to a completely different one. It might be a good answer, but it is not the answer to the question that was asked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para59"><a name="10121530000249">The next thing that the Lords want to know is this:</p>

The Government can argue, with some justification, that it does, because it stipulates a period of five years. It does not tell us when the loans are to be repaid, but it places a five-year limit on the period in which they can be made. That is not what is normally understood by a sunset clause, however. Sunset clauses normally stipulate that in, say, a year's time, Parliament will look again at the legislation to see whether it is correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para69"><a name="10121530000259">In concluding my opening remarks, I want to say a few words about what I think is wrong. Let me state to the House how this mother of Parliaments should work in relation to timings of debates. The driving principle of reform should be the redistribution of power-from the powerful to the powerless. That means boosting Parliament's power to hold the Government of the day to account. The House of Commons' historic functions were to vote money for Governments to spend, and to scrutinise laws. It now barely bothers with the first, and does the second extremely badly. There was a time when legislation that had been formulated after months of civil service and ministerial deliberation was sent to the House of Commons which would pore over it, shape it and send it back, get it back, look at it again and improve it some more-Bill by Bill, clause by clause, line by line. Every piece of legislation would be put under intense scrutiny. Is it legally sound? Will it be effective? Is it worth the cost?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para70"><a name="10121530000260">Let us compare that with today. Let me take Members on the journey of a piece of legislation as it passes through the modern House of Commons. It is likely to have been dreamt up on the sofa of No. 10. A Bill is drafted and it is sent to the House for a couple of hours of routine debate among a few MPs. Then the bells ring, the whips are cracked and suddenly, out of nowhere, all the Members turn up to vote. More often than not, they do not even know what they are voting for. The Bill  <br>

limps through. Then it goes into Committee. The Committee's duty is to look at the detail clause by clause, but it is packed full of people that the Whips have put there. So, surprise, surprise, the Government rarely lose a vote on any of the individual points of detailed scrutiny. Then it is back to the House to do it all again-debate, bell and then vote to wave the legislation through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para71"><a name="10121530000261">Every Bill now has a programme motion setting out how much time can be spent scrutinising and debating each part. There are automatic guillotines, and the time allowed for scrutiny is set in advance, before anyone can see whether or not a particular issue is contentious or complex. Watching a Minister in the Commons drawing out one point for an hour to fill the time, to an audience of dozing Back Benchers-that is not accountability. How can the mother of all Parliaments turn itself into such a pliant child?</p>

So they have an opportunity, before the conclusion of the debate, to say that they will withdraw the allocation of time motion, and that we will have proper debate.</p>

not take their seats continue to claim lots of money for parliamentary purposes-and we were told that time would be made available to debate that, and for the House to have its say. We were also told that legislation on the issue of dual mandates would appear. Yet I am now told that the Government cannot do any of that because "there isn't any time".</p>

The notion that "there isn't any time" to do the necessary things and important things that have been laid out by the Government in relation to Northern Ireland is simply not tenable, given the fact that here we are today, setting time aside to rush through all stages of a Bill-I will not get into the merits of it; we will come to those-in one day. I say to the Government, especially the senior Members on the Treasury Bench, that they should reflect on the fact that we are being told that other important things cannot be done. It is clear that they can be done and should be done, and I urge the Government to take action as soon as possible.</p>

 There is one element of the guillotine motion that I particularly resent. That is the provision that if a group of amendments is being discussed when the guillotine falls, it will not be possible to vote on any more than the question that was before the House at that time, whereas under a traditional programme motion it would be possible, with the leave of the Chair, to vote on more than one of the amendments in the group.</p>

In my submission, scrutiny includes having the opportunity to test the view of the House on amendments before the House. My concern is that if all the amendments are grouped together, and if the debate on that group carries on until the guillotine falls, it will only be possible to vote on one narrow amendment-amendment 3-although of course the guillotine motion allows the Government amendment to be voted on as well, because those are the biased terms in which the motion has been drafted.</p>

That is the sort of question that our constituents are asking, and I would have hoped that the Government would be more co-operative with the House by providing a bit more detail in the Bill.</p>

If the Government are really saying, "This is so desperately urgent that we need to do it straight away," why were they not prepared to co-operate with the House a bit more and give us the maximum amount of information to enable us to deal with it in a constructive way today?</p>

We know that the other place was very concerned about the fact that the Government were taking forward a lot of emergency measures without giving the opportunity for proper debate and consideration-and that applied not just to money Bills but to other Bills too.

If, for example, many of them were to say that they would not wish to repay the loan given to them by the United Kingdom, I would have thought that would be a very material consideration in our debate on the matter, but this motion denies us the opportunity to consider the implications of what transpires today in the Irish Parliament.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para86"><a name="10121530000607">Two weeks ago I told the House that it was my intention to ask for authority to make a bilateral loan to Ireland as part of the multinational assistance programme for that country. I said that I judged it to be in our national interest, given our country's close economic, financial and political connections to the Irish Republic, to be ready to help, and I want to thank all parts of this House for agreeing with that judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para87"><a name="10121530000608">Let me directly address the question of why we are taking this legislation through today, and why we are seeking to do it rapidly. The reason is that this week we expect the International Monetary Fund board to meet and agree the assistance package, the eurozone to sign off on its contribution, and the Irish Parliament to accept the international help that is offered. Let me say this to hon. Members in reference to the previous debate. I actually have the authority to make, under common law, a loan to Ireland and to seek at a much later date retrospective authority from Parliament. I decided-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Let me say that I decided that that was a wholly inappropriate thing to do, and that I should come to Parliament to seek its authority before signing the loan agreement. The loan agreement may be signed at any moment.</p>

 I am grateful to the Chancellor for giving way, but has he not let the cat out of the bag? He has just said that there is no urgency, because he had the power to do this anyway. If that had been said in the previous debate the result of the vote might been different.</p>

<p><a name="st_o138"><a name="10121530000610"><a name="101215-0001.htm_spnew95"><a name="10121530002742"><b>Mr Osborne:</b>
 From what I could tell from what my hon. Friend was saying in the previous debate, he thought it important to have parliamentary scrutiny. It is true that I could have issued the loan under the common-law powers available to me, and come back at a later point to seek parliamentary approval. I thought the House would prefer me to seek parliamentary approval first, before making the loan-but there we go; you can't please everyone.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way. Setting aside the technicalities of why we are debating this measure and how long we shall do so, and getting down to the substantive issue of the loan, can the Chancellor share with the House what the fees and the interest to the UK Government will be over the period of the loan if the Irish Government draw down the whole of the loan?</p>

 The second intervention draws me back into the rest of my speech, but in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell), I have common-law powers to issue the loan and sign the loan agreement. I then have to seek statutory authority, but that could be done retrospectively.

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. If the point that he is making is such a good one-it may well be-why did he not include it in paragraph 14 of the explanatory notes, making a virtue of the fact that he was bringing this matter before the House now rather than seeking retrospective approval?</p>

 I said in an earlier statement to the House that I was seeking to do that, and I had hoped that hon. Members were paying attention to what I said at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para89"><a name="10121530000623">The legislation that we shall pass today will allow the UK to be ready in the new year to meet its commitments to one of our closest international partners. As has been noted, the legislation before the House is narrow in scope-it is explicitly a Loans to Ireland Bill-but it is still enabling legislation. It sits alongside the actual loan agreement, which sets out in detail what we will offer Ireland. To ensure that Members have as much information as possible available to them for today's discussion, a summary of the key terms of the loan agreement, which was agreed with the Irish Government only this morning, has been available in the Vote Office for more than an hour now.</p>

unsustainable. Their sovereign debt markets had effectively closed and had little prospect of re-opening. Ireland's market interest rates had risen to record levels, and Irish banks had become almost wholly reliant on central bank funding to maintain their operations, with no obvious prospect that that was going to change. This situation simply could not go on. We had been monitoring the situation for many months and had engaged in confidential discussions with our partners in the G7 and at ECOFIN about possible solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="101215-0001.htm_para91"><a name="10121530000627">Over the weekend of 20 November, Ireland's Prime Minister made a formal request for international financial assistance. The UK, alongside the International Monetary Fund, the EU, the eurozone and some other member states-Sweden and Denmark-made an agreement in principle to take part in putting together an assistance package for Ireland. Since then, the various interested parties have been working round the clock with the Irish authorities to put together a package. Officials from the British Treasury have been in Dublin in recent days ensuring that our interests and concerns were represented, and I want to thank them for their hard work. At the end of November, Ireland agreed with the IMF and the EU a three-year financial assistance package worth €85 billion.</p>

<p><a name="st_o152"><a name="10121530000628"><a name="101215-0001.htm_spnew109"><a name="10121530002756"><b>Mr Cash:</b>
 The document to which my right hon. Friend just referred is "for information purposes only" and is clearly not intended to be construed as part and parcel of the Bill. So can he explain why in the document the "conditions precedent" to the arrangements interweave the so-called "bilateral loan" with the European financial stability mechanism, and why an attempt is then made to bypass that by referring to the "Governing law" as "English law"?</p>

<p><a name="st_o153"><a name="10121530000629"><a name="101215-0001.htm_spnew110"><a name="10121530002757"><b>Mr Osborne:</b>
 I am going to discuss some of the conditions attached to the loan. The particular condition that my hon. Friend refers to ensures that the UK is protected if other parties to this international agreement change their arrangement with Ireland in some way that materially affects our ability to be repaid. That condition gives us an ability at that point to step in.</p>

<p><a name="st_o154"><a name="10121530000630"><a name="101215-0001.htm_spnew111"><a name="10121530002758"><b>Mr Cash:</b>
 My right hon. Friend is perhaps confirming my concern, which is that the interweaving of the conditions between the so-called "bilateral loan" and the mechanism is such that they are, in effect, inseparable, so European Community law could well apply.</p>

<p><a name="st_o155"><a name="10121530000631"><a name="101215-0001.htm_spnew112"><a name="10121530002759"><b>Mr Osborne:</b>
 I know that my hon. Friend is assiduous on these points, but I think that on this occasion he is not correct. This is simply a fall-back mechanism for us to say that if Ireland in some way renegotiates its loan from the eurozone, from the EU or from the IMF, it is a condition of our loan to Ireland that we can step in at that point and examine our situation. That protects the British taxpayer and has absolutely nothing to do with European law or anything else; it is simply there to make sure that other parties to this international agreement must have due regard to what they are doing, and how that might have an impact on the ability of the British taxpayer to be repaid.</p>

daily basis. The second is that a whiff of elections is in the air. The right hon. Gentleman talks of renegotiation, but is it not a fact that renegotiation of a new Government in Ireland is very much on the cards?</p>

<p><a name="st_o157"><a name="10121530000633"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="10121530002761"><b>Mr Osborne:</b>
 Obviously we are not going to prejudge the outcome of any Irish general election. Of course we-not just us, but the IMF and others-negotiate with the Government of the day. Although the principal Opposition parties in Ireland have concerns about the Irish budget and the like, I understand that they have accepted the principle of international assistance, and the IMF has been in direct contact, and has engaged in discussions with them. The international community, including the UK, is satisfied that we are in a position to make this offer to the Irish Government, which is why I am bringing the Bill to the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para0"><a name="10121530000634">As I was saying, Ireland agreed to seek IMF and other support worth €85 billion, and the money will be used as follows: €35 billion will be used to support Ireland's banking sector, with €10 billion going towards immediate bank recapitalisation; and the remaining €50 billion will be used for sovereign debt support. In terms of contributions to the cost of the package, Ireland itself will provide €17.5 billion towards the total. The remaining €67.5 billion will be split, with one third coming from the IMF, one third from the European financial stability mechanism, and one third from the eurozone facility and bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark. I have agreed that our contribution should amount to €3.8 billion, or £3.25 billion at today's exchange rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para1"><a name="10121530000635">This significant package will help Ireland to deal decisively with its problems. It will help it to recapitalise its banks and set up a contingency reserve for future problems. It will also help the Irish authorities to cover the shortfall in their budget, which was passed by the Irish Parliament earlier this month. Their budget will see a fiscal consolidation of €15 billion by 2014, of which €6 billion will be implemented next year, as part of their strategy leading to a target budget deficit of 3% of gross domestic product in four years' time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para2"><a name="10121530000636">Of course people ask why we are extending the loan to Ireland. We are doing so because it is overwhelmingly in our national interest to have a strong Irish economy and a stable banking system. This is not just about the Irish economy and Irish jobs; it is about the British economy and British jobs. A loan does not add to our deficit, and any increase in borrowing is matched, of course, by the commitment of the Irish to repay with interest. The answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon earlier is that if Ireland takes out all the loan that is being made available to it and pays it back with the interest that has been forecast, it would pay us £440 million in fees and interest over this period.</p>

Just as our two economies are linked, our businesses and banking sectors are also interconnected. More Irish companies are listed on London exchanges than companies from any other foreign country. The two main Irish-owned banks have an important presence in the UK, holding between them about £30 billion of customer deposits.

 May I confirm what the Chancellor has just said?

 It is a reasonable summary. Of course we stand behind the International Monetary Fund as a shareholder of it, as are most countries in the world. I shall come on to the European financial stability mechanism, which I have already talked to the House about on a number of occasions. Like other contributors to the EU budget, we stand behind it. In a sense, the loan that we are proposing today is the direct British taxpayer contribution-or rather, the money that is borrowed on behalf of the British taxpayer.

 As I explained to the House previously-my predecessor, the right hon.

The decision on the use of that mechanism is taken by qualified majority voting, so although we could vote against its use in this situation, I did not think that that would achieve anything. I am focused, in a way that I shall describe, on trying to extricate the UK from the EU-27 mechanisms that stand behind eurozone countries. If hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para8"><a name="10121530000650">One thing is clear. It is undoubtedly in Britain's national interest to have a growing Irish economy and a stable Irish banking system. In the judgment of both the Irish Government and the international community that was not going to come about without the assistance package we debate today. I would now like to explain to Members the principles of the Bill, and then take them through the heads of terms of the loan agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para9"><a name="10121530000651">The Bill has two substantive clauses. Clause 1 sets out the parameters under which the Treasury may make payments under UK loans to Ireland. As I explained earlier, the total international assistance package, including our contribution, is denominated in euros. However, we are making a bilateral loan in sterling so that Ireland bears the exchange rate risk over the coming years. Subsection (3) of the clause includes a cap on the total size of our bilateral loan. It is written on the face of the Bill that</p>
<a name="101215-0002.htm_brev1"><a name="10121530002186"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the aggregate amount of payments made by the Treasury by way of Irish loans...must not exceed £3,250 million".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para10"><a name="10121530000652">In other words, the £3.25 billion we originally agreed will be the maximum total size of our bilateral loan to Ireland. A sunset clause is also, in effect, built into the legislation. The period over which the loans may be offered begins on 9 December 2010, when the Bill was published, and ends on 8 December 2015.</p>

<p><a name="st_o166"><a name="10121530000653"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew10"><a name="10121530002770"><b>Mr Bone:</b>
 Subsections (4) and (5) seem to say the opposite. They seem to say that the maximum amount may increase because of differences in the exchange rate. Is that not what they mean?</p>

<p><a name="st_o167"><a name="10121530000654"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew11"><a name="10121530002771"><b>Mr Osborne:</b>
 My hon. Friend is pre-empting my speech. I shall get on and explain exactly what those two subsections mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para11"><a name="10121530000655">As I said, there is no expectation that we will have to make further loans to Ireland in the future. Subsection (4) is intended to prevent an increase in the size of the loan, unless an order is made by statutory instrument, but because the loan is denominated in sterling, a mechanism is needed to accommodate potential changes in the exchange rate in the period between the publication of the Bill and the signing of the loan agreement-that answers my hon. Friend's point-which could happen in a matter of days. This is not about the exchange rate risk over the coming years-that risk is borne by Ireland-but merely a mechanism to deal with the fact that we are publishing the Bill before we sign the loan agreement, for the reasons that I set out earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para12"><a name="10121530000656">The Bill allows the Treasury, under subsections (5) to (7), to make an order once the Bill is in force to increase the limit, as long as that is done solely to take account of exchange rate fluctuations between now and 30 days after Royal Assent, without further Parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p><a name="st_o168"><a name="10121530000657"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew12"><a name="10121530002772"><b>Mr Cash:</b>
 I am sure that my right hon. Friend will understand my saying that it would have been so much simpler if what he has just said had been specified in the Bill, instead of a blanket wording referring to substituting a greater amount. We would have then known that that was only intended to allow a margin of error depending on currency fluctuations. Subsection (4) is absolutely clear that there is no restriction.</p>

 No, let me explain. There are two separate subsections. Subsection (4) allows the loan to be increased substantively, but only with the authority and vote of this Parliament. If I were ever to seek a larger loan to Ireland, I would have to come here and get the vote of the House of Commons. That is what subsection (4) is about. I am making it clear that I have no intention at the moment of doing that, but subsection (4) provides for it, and would prevent us from having to pass further primary legislation. The protection for Members of Parliament is the same-they can keep a check on the Executive-because I would be required to get that affirmative resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para13"><a name="10121530000659">Subsections (5) and (6) refer to something different, which is the gap between the passage of the Bill and the signing of the loan agreement. There might be small movements in the exchange rate. We have signed up to this package of a contribution in euros, but we are making a sterling loan. As I explained earlier, I had the opportunity to sign the loan agreement and come retrospectively to seek parliamentary approval, but I am trying to do it the other way around because it gives Members of Parliament a much greater degree of control. That is why these two subsections are required.</p>

 My hon. Friend has a deep knowledge and experience of issues in Northern Ireland, and indeed the Republic, and I know that his Select Committee will be interested in what is happening with those economies. Let me reassure him that there would be a vote by all Members of the House if I, or any successor of mine-should there be one before 8 December 2015-ever sought to increase the loan. A vote in Parliament would be required, so the effect is exactly the same as asking Parliament to pass another piece of primary legislation. It would involve a vote of the House, which means the legislature exercising its control over and acting as a check on the Executive.</p>

 There is a convention that multilateral loans, such as those involving the mechanism and the IMF, rank senior in any loan agreement. Let me reassure my hon. Friend that I have examined this with great care and interest. The convention is pretty clear and long-established in international law that multilateral loans are senior. That means principally the loan from the IMF, but also the loan from the European mechanism, which we stand behind, so it is also in our interest that it is repaid. However, our loan will rank pari passu with the eurozone and the other bilateral loans. That has partly shaped our judgment about the interest rate we will charge and the point at which we will start to disburse our loan. I shall come back to that.</p>

I therefore propose to accept in principle the Opposition's amendment 1, which would modify the Government's reporting requirements in relation to the bilateral loans. We have today tabled a more appropriately worded version of the amendment which achieves exactly the effect that the Opposition intended. May I explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) that this is why there is a manuscript amendment? I am trying not to tempt him, because I am sure that he could speak for even longer, but I want to explain this point because he has raised his concern about it. The manuscript amendment has been drafted by the Government's parliamentary draftsmen in relation to an Opposition amendment that we propose to accept and it has exactly the effect that the Opposition sought.</p>

I apologise that this information was not made available much further in advance, but the terms were agreed only this morning with the Irish Government and I wanted all Members of the House to have this information available to them. The loan will be drawn in eight tranches, each with a 7.5-year term. The length of the loan is in line with the terms of both the European and IMF loans. The first tranche of our loan will be available to be disbursed in September 2011, which is later than for some of the other tranches that are being drawn down from partners such as the IMF and the European Union.</p>

It will be set by adding a fixed margin of 2.29 percentage points to the appropriate market-determined interest rate-the sterling 7.5-year swap rate-at the time of disbursement. For example, at the present time, the estimated-I stress estimated-interest rate on the first tranche of the UK loan would be the sterling 7.5-year swap rate in September 2011, which on Monday stood at 3.65 percentage points, plus 2.29 percentage points. That would mean a hypothetical interest rate of 5.9% for the first tranche of the loan. The rate on our bilateral loan will be slightly higher than the estimated rate of 5.7% for the first tranche of the IMF and European mechanism funds, so we are charging a slightly higher rate of interest, but it is lower than the estimated 6.1% rate that the eurozone facility will charge on its first tranche of lending. That reflects the different costs of funding and is a measure of international confidence in the UK's public finances.</p>

The rate of interest we are charging is slightly higher than the Dutch, who have also entered into an agreement with the Icelandic Government, are seeking. People might remember the circumstances at the relevant time-there was a pretty acrimonious dispute between Iceland and the previous UK Government-and we have sought to repair broken bridges.

 Over the past few days we have seen substantial growth in the economy of the UK mainland, but that growth has not been reflected in Northern Ireland, as some of its financial institutions-notably Ulster bank-have indicated. What assurance can the Chancellor give the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Minister of Finance and Northern Ireland Members in the House that, at every stage, full consideration will be given to how loans to the Republic of Ireland will affect the economy in Northern Ireland?

 I completely understand the hon. Gentleman's apprehension, given the close connections between the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Let me make two points. First, as I said earlier, the loan has enabled us to be part of the international discussion about the restructuring of the Irish banks, some of which-as the hon.

I appreciate that he will not have had a chance to study the loan agreement, as I have laid it before the House only within the last couple of hours, but one of the conditions is that there should be</p>

A draft paper has been put to the Executive. I am very engaged in the process, as is my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

 As I said to the House on a previous occasion, I did not think it right-others may take a different view-for one sovereign nation to try to dictate the tax rates of another sovereign nation. I did not think that that was a precedent that we particularly wanted to set. I entirely understand the competitive pressure that the Irish corporation tax rate puts on Northern Ireland, but ultimately it must be for the Irish Parliament to determine its own tax rates.

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para30"><a name="10121530000701">First, there is the question of the terms on which the loan will be repaid.

The European Council this week is expected to discuss the matter. Both the Prime Minister and I are very clear that when it comes to putting in place a permanent mechanism, the UK is not part of the eurozone and so will not be part of that mechanism. The president of the euro group has accepted that the UK will not be part of the permanent stability mechanism, and that the European financial stability mechanism, which the previous Government agreed in May and of which we are part, will cease to exist when that permanent eurozone mechanism is put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para33"><a name="10121530000711">We will seek to bring to an end the use of the mechanism established in May for the resolution of sovereign debt problems. It was established under article 122 of the Lisbon treaty and originally intended to provide support for member states following natural disasters. European Finance Ministers, including my predecessor, chose to apply that article in May to deal with the eurozone crisis at that time, but that temporary solution should not become a permanent way of doing things, and the time has now come for the eurozone to put in place its own mechanism for dealing with the imbalances in the eurozone. That needs to be part of a comprehensive solution whereby countries address their own problems more decisively, including in their banking systems. We in Britain have shown the way.</p>

 The Chancellor speaks of a comprehensive solution. Does he recognise that we face not only a crisis of liquidity in Portugal, Greece and Ireland, which we are assisting bilaterally, but a crisis of solvency? The solvency crisis will require us to address not just Irish bank restructuring, but Ireland's sovereign debt-it is impossible to distinguish the two, given that the Irish state has guaranteed all the Irish banking system's liabilities-and the solvency of other peripheral eurozone economies. We are helping with financing, but we have not yet addressed the fundamental solvency of those peripheral countries.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very good point. There was a debate-it was pretty widely reported, so I am not betraying anything that was not read by everyone throughout the world-about whether to address the solvency issues, and whether there should be a contribution-or a haircut, to use the jargon-from senior debt holders in the banks or, indeed, sovereign debt holders. The international community's view, with which we absolutely agree, is that such a contribution risked a very serious contagion that might spread through many different banking systems, not just those of the countries to which my hon. Friend refers. So the decision was taken not to require a private sector bail-in from senior debt holders in the banks or, indeed, sovereign debt holders.</p>

Individual countries also need to address their problems. Portugal has a long-standing problem with its economic productivity, which the Portuguese Government are determined to address. The Irish banking system has caused enormous problems for the Irish Government, who are now addressing that. In a bipartisan debate, this is a slightly partisan point, but I think that the UK has demonstrated over the past six months that, by its own efforts, a country can earn market credibility, improve its credit rating and improve international confidence in its economy. We need the eurozone to sort out its mechanism, but individual countries in Europe also need to take decisive steps to deal with the particular problems that their economies face. Let me give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash), and then I must conclude to allow others to speak.</p>

 I have put a number of questions, as yet unanswered, to my right hon. Friend on that very issue, but I am glad that he has given, at any rate, a partial answer to one of them. The mechanism's transfer from what appears to be an unlawful basis in article 122 of the Lisbon treaty to the new proposals under article 136 will involve only the eurozone and represent an important step in the right direction. Does my right hon. Friend not accept, however, that much could happen over the next two or three years, between now and 2013, while the mechanism in which my right hon.

Friend ensured that none of the mechanism of which we were part was used to bail out Greece. That was a good deal all round, and a lesson for our inexperienced Chancellor in the art of negotiation. Indeed, the quip going round a couple of years ago, when the collapse of the banking industry in Iceland was closely followed by what happened in Ireland, was: what is the difference between Iceland and Ireland? Answer-one letter and six months. A modern variation could be to ask, what is the difference between Darling and Osborne? Answer-five letters, six months and £6.6 billion.</p>

 When the shadow Chancellor says, as the Chancellor said, that the process was triggered by a qualified majority vote, I am sure that he would agree that that is not strictly true, because it resulted from a request by a member state. The final solution or arrangements are made by virtue of a qualified majority vote at the end. That is a qualification, but it does not alter the fact that, on the basis it was explained to us, article 122 was almost certainly unlawful and the use of article 136 would have been a better route. However, we appear to be entrapped into article 122 for the current purposes.</p>

 I believe that the hon. Gentleman will seek to address that in his amendment to clause 3, which we will discuss later. On the specific issue, there is no doubt that the mechanism was decided by qualified majority voting. All 27 European member states were part of that. I know from experience of negotiating in Europe over many years that it is a pretty turgid process and one has to be on one's toes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West can speak for himself, but I think he got a very good deal for this country on Greece.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para39"><a name="10121530000732">The Chancellor must take responsibility for the deal that he has negotiated and not try spuriously to blame his predecessor, as he did again in his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee on 8 December. He had a choice about whether the UK should contribute to the Irish rescue plan. In principle, he has made the right choice, but before us today is a hastily drawn-up Bill that does not set out the terms of the loan, the interest rate or the repayment schedule. Colleagues from all parties will want to explore and probe those matters in Committee, and we particularly want to get to our amendments on clause 2, so a goodly proportion of the time available to us this afternoon may be better spent on that. It is therefore not my intention to detain the House for long on Second Reading.</p>

 Does the shadow Chancellor share my gratitude that the decision is being taken in this Chamber and not by a group of unelected bankers in Frankfurt? That is because we did not listen to Opposition Members-we have never supported joining the euro, which would have meant that the decision would not have been ours to make in the first place.</p>

 I always try to avoid sharing the hon. Gentleman's pleasure. I shall come to the nature of the deal, because in debating the Bill we are discussing one element that constitutes a little more than half of the money that the UK taxpayer is putting into the deal.</p>

I shall reiterate some of the points that the Chancellor made. Our two countries are intertwined in commerce, in trade, in banking, in culture and in sport. We share a language and a land border. Not only is Ireland one of our five largest export markets but, as the Chancellor said, one part of the United Kingdom-Northern Ireland-sends 40% of its exports across the border to the Republic. The situation in Ireland could cause significant damage to UK financial institutions and create instability in both sovereign and bank debt markets. The UK is Ireland's largest creditor-we are talking about almost €112 billion-and I understand  <br>

from a newspaper report last week that the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have Irish loan books worth 82% and 53% of net assets respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para41"><a name="10121530000736">In its report last month, the International Monetary Fund singled out Ireland to demonstrate what it called the "key underlying vulnerability" of UK banks' exposure to foreign banks. The support programme assures the protection of senior bond holders in Irish banks from any losses, thus affording a greater level of protection to UK banks. For all of those reasons and many more, it is in this country's interest to support this package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para42"><a name="10121530000737">I want to raise three concerns. The first, which was raised in a couple of interventions-including by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)-is the open-ended nature of the commitment. There is a distinct possibility of more money being required for Ireland after 2013, given the tendency of Irish banks to downplay the severity of their situation and the tough conditionality being applied alongside concerns about European growth. In those circumstances, should we not make it clear to our European partners that the EFSF must be used for any further financial support, rather than giving the impression that this is a well into which further buckets can be dipped?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para43"><a name="10121530000738">That is particularly relevant to my second concern about the balance between the contributions made by the various mechanisms. The €440 billion EFSF-the facility- for eurozone countries only is being tapped for 4% of the total resources that eurozone countries have agreed to make available for Ireland. The smaller EFSM-the mechanism-of which we are part and to which we contribute, was not used at all for the Greek bail-out. The EFSM is offering 37.5% of its available resources for the Irish bail-out. Why was that formulation chosen and why is the total amount we are contributing double the amount that we would have had to pay if we were a eurozone country?</p>

<p><a name="st_o219"><a name="10121530000739"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew63"><a name="10121530002823"><b>Mr George Osborne:</b>
 I am not sure that the shadow Chancellor is correct in that assertion. First, our contribution has been calculated on the basis of what we would have paid if we had been part of the facility. That is how the £3.25 billion figure was broadly arrived at. Secondly, the mechanism currently in use was created after the bilateral agreement was put together for the Greek bail-out. It was never available to be used for the Greek bail-out, which took place as a series of bilateral loans across Europe. As I understand it, over the May weekend the facility was put in place to address the crisis and article 122 was drawn upon to create the mechanism, so it could not have been used for Greece at that point.</p>

 I am grateful to the Chancellor for that intervention. However, it does not explain why the £3.25 billion he has just mentioned is the bilateral loan. That is the equivalent of what we would have put into the Irish bail-out had we been members of the eurozone. However, we are also putting in £2.6 billion through the EFSM and £800 million through the IMF. With the bilateral loan added to the other donations of British taxpayers' contributions that we are making through the mechanisms, we are putting in double the amount of money that other European Union countries are contributing.</p>

 This may be news to the hon. Gentleman, but his party is in government now. As I said, my party ensured that we contributed nothing-not a penny, not a euro, not a drachma-to the Greek bailout.

 The shadow Chancellor is on to something here. It is bizarre that less money is being taken from the €440 billion fund than from the €60 billion in the EFSM. Would he have encouraged the Government to vote against the use of that €60 billion?</p>

<p><a name="st_o224"><a name="10121530000744"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew68"><a name="10121530002828"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 We have the €60 billion fund, about which the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) intervened, and we have a second fund of €440 billion. I am simply pointing out-the public deserve to know this-that only 4% is coming from the larger amount and 37% from the smaller amount. I am curious about that, and we need to understand the logic of it.</p>

 I will try to make a more helpful point. Given that the Opposition are supporting this loan arrangement, does the shadow Chancellor think it desirable that part of it should be bilateral and therefore agree with the structure that the Chancellor has put in place?</p>

 I do agree that part of it should be bilateral, for all the reasons that I have mentioned. As various members have commented, however, we need to understand why the formulation has been made-because it could be setting precedents; because there is a larger pot of money out of which a lesser sum of money is being brought; and because the Chancellor can come back to this House, by virtue of a statutory instrument and seek further money for Ireland. We need to be clear what we are letting ourselves in for.</p>

and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett) raised this issue during the Chancellor's statement on 22 November. Why does the Chancellor agree a huge loan to Ireland on the basis he cited but reject a modest £80 million that would be paid back with interest and boost the opportunity of British manufacturers to have a substantial stake in the civil nuclear energy supply chain, which is currently dominated by overseas companies? At a time when we are looking for jobs and growth, the logic of that escapes me.</p>

 Yes, but that is a matter for the eurozone. If the Chancellor is right in his prediction that perhaps this can ensure that we come out of the €60 billion mechanism, the facility and the other moneys, then fine, but as we are making a big contribution-more than we would have done had we paid the amount that a eurozone country would have paid to rescue Ireland-we must be in a position to influence this debate.</p>

 I must correct this point. We are paying pretty much exactly what we would have paid if we had been a member of the euro; that is how the bilateral loan is being calculated. Germany is paying both through the facility and through the mechanism, and so are France and the other members of the euro. Other countries are paying twice. Ours is a bilateral loan like those of Sweden and Denmark, and they too have been calculated in a similar way.</p>

 I am grateful for that clarification; we will look at that very carefully. What the Chancellor is saying is that France and Germany, through their IMF contribution-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Financial Secretary says no. The point I am trying to get at-perhaps the hon. Gentleman can clear this up when he replies to the debate-is that if the UK is putting in a bilateral loan that is equal to the amount that we would have paid as a eurozone member, and we are putting in money through the IMF as well as £2.6 billion through the mechanism, how does that relate to the money that France and Germany are contributing? As far as I am aware, they have no bilateral arrangements, so the money is going through the IMF, or through the stability facility which accounts for only 4% of the resources. That is a point that we need to hear about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para48"><a name="10121530000763">Some Conservative Members think that the root cause is the single currency. I do not share that view. The euro had nothing to do with the property boom and bust, and a failed euro would be an economic and political disaster with repercussions well beyond our continent. Ireland needs a healthy eurozone, or it will end up with years of deflation and unemployment, and we will be less likely to have our loan repaid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para49"><a name="10121530000764">As the loan that we are being asked to approve is equal to the amount of money that we would have contributed had we been a member of the eurozone, surely that gives us the right to influence the necessary debate on what action is needed to address the underlying causes of this recurring crisis. This bail-out buys time, but there is no sign that Europe's leaders know how to put it to good use. In May, we had the Greek bail-out; six months later, we have to deal with Ireland. In neither case is there much sign that these countries have resolved the core dilemma, which is solvency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para50"><a name="10121530000765">Collective austerity across Europe offers countries with high debt burdens no way out. Cutting demand in Germany is the last thing that Ireland needs at the moment. What we are seeing in Europe bears out the IMF's conclusion that fiscal austerity does not boost short-term growth and that deficit cuts are more painful if they occur simultaneously across many countries. Ireland needs a healthy eurozone with markets such as Germany consuming Irish goods, or it will end up with years of deflation and unemployment. Having engaged in repeated rounds of austerity, with VAT rises, welfare cuts and redundancies, Ireland still finds growth elusive: it has been consistently poor for the past three years. Indeed, the economy has shrunk in 11 of the 14 quarters since the beginning of 2007, and sluggish growth has made getting the deficit down much harder.</p>

 When a country becomes over-indebted, it can either enslave itself to the debt or inflate and devalue. Is it not clear that the fundamental problem is that none of the countries in the euro can inflate and devalue to get out of their problems? That is why some Conservative Members are saying that it is only a matter of time before some of these countries fall out of the euro, and that we would be better off planning on that basis than pretending that we can hold back an unstoppable tide.</p>

a currency harmonisation needs to move to the next stage. I heard the president of the European Central Bank say on the radio last night that the next stage should be political integration. My party does not agree with that; nor I am sure does the hon. Gentleman's. Further integration is one extreme that we should not go to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para51"><a name="10121530000768">The second extreme says that if Ireland simply withdrew from the euro or the eurozone, its problems would be solved. I do not believe that to be the case. The eurozone has to recognise the problem that its countries cannot devalue and must find a mechanism that ensures that this problem does not keep happening to country after country. The hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) has a view, as do many of his colleagues, on the answer to this ongoing problem. I do not agree with him, but I believe that it is central to stop this happening to other countries, and to stop it being a regular event.

 Until the shadow Chancellor's last few words, I was looking forward to saying that I agree with just about everything that has been said from both Front Benches. None the less, there is a good deal of cross-party consensus about what is being discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para59"><a name="10121530000782">The Chancellor is faced with a difficult situation: a regional currency crisis that is largely not of his making, a close neighbour with strong historical ties in the eye of the storm and an inherited financial commitment to assistance at the European level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para60"><a name="10121530000783">The Treasury Committee took advantage of the Chancellor's appearance before us last week to cross-examine him on these matters in some detail. That appearance, his speech today and particularly the terms sheet, which we have just received, have given us a good deal of information, and I am grateful to him. I am relieved, according to that information, that any increase in the loan, which is permitted by the legislation, will be debated on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para61"><a name="10121530000784">We now know the price of the loan for the first time, broadly speaking. It looks sensible, although I notice that it can be varied under the enabling legislation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless) has pointed out, we have discovered from the terms sheet that the loan is junior in the debt hierarchy to support through the EU mechanism. It would be useful if the Minister, in the winding-up speech, told us whether the Irish can repay the loan early without penalty. I do not think that that is what is stated in paragraph 5(c) of "Other Terms" in the loan agreement-I have obviously had very little time to read it-but there is also a reference to "exceptions" in the bracketed part of the sentence.</p>

The UK has gone further than was needed to fulfil its legal obligations. The Chancellor made a strong and persuasive case, which was supported by the Opposition. However, I think that that decision needs close scrutiny, as does the decision, which straddled the previous Government's tenure, that left the UK with extra contingent liabilities as a result of the mechanism. We may have been put in the unsatisfactory position of making EU budget payments to bail out the eurozone, even though we are not a member of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para64"><a name="10121530000787">It is important to bear in mind that demand for a bail-out originated not with a request from Ireland, but from the fear among eurozone members of contagion spreading from Ireland to Portugal and Spain. Most hon. Members agree that bailing out the eurozone is primarily its business and not ours. It is true that the collapse of the zone would generate shockwaves throughout the region, and possibly the world. However, the eurozone does have the capacity to bail out weaker members and, to the extent that the stability of the whole financial system is at stake, our contribution should usually be made via the International Monetary Fund. It is for those reasons that I was relieved when the Chancellor confirmed before the Select Committee that the legislation will be unique to Ireland and does not contain enabling powers for further bilateral eurozone bail-outs.</p>

 My hon. Friend says that he was reassured by the Chancellor, but does he appreciate that until 2013, we will be trapped into that mechanism, unlawful as some of us believe it to be?</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="10121530000789"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew92"><a name="10121530002852"><b>Mr Tyrie:</b>
 I appreciate that. The Chancellor has referred to 2013 on a number of occasions, and my hon. Friend has referred to the possible unlawfulness of the mechanism on a number of occasions, including in private discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para65"><a name="10121530000790">This is a crisis of the eurozone, for which UK taxpayers are footing part of the bill. The UK will have to engage with members of the eurozone to limit the damage now and to construct something better for the future. I will touch on a few of those points in the moments that remain. I recognise that the problems to which I refer may be intractable. First, as the Chancellor has said, the senior creditors have been exempted from a haircut. The Chancellor told us that this was because of the risk of contagion. He is probably right, but the resulting moral hazard is large and will have to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para66"><a name="10121530000791">The second issue that I wish to raise, which naturally none of the authorities wants to talk about, is the fact the even the measures for Ireland and for Greece may not prevent default. The crisis may be one of solvency, not liquidity. That has a bearing on the lender of last resort provisions for the eurozone. It is possible that a sovereign default could trigger a banking crisis and even failure in parts of the eurozone, because banks hold a large amount of sovereign debt on their balance sheets. Such a bank failure could be highly toxic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para67"><a name="10121530000792">It is worth bearing in mind that the great depression of the 1930s was triggered as much by bank failures after 1931 as it was by the stock market collapse of 1929. I do not want to play the role of Cassandra, but I plead that contingency planning at European level be done now for the risk of such a bank failure. On the basis of the eurozone's responses to the crisis so far, I am not optimistic that that planning is being done. The eurozone is fearful of leaks, and those doing the work would be terrified of that possibility. I have no doubt that that would inhibit their work. In addition, pessimism on such issues in European circles does not exactly make such work a career-enhancing prospect for the eurocrats who would have to do it. Let us just hope that they are doing that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para68"><a name="10121530000793">The third problem that I wish to refer to-I shall leave it at that given the time available-is the long-term future of the eurozone itself in a world in which the bond markets have discovered that the no bail-out  <br>

clause is toothless. I should say at this point that I have never opposed the eurozone on ideological grounds or on grounds of principle, but I have been wary on practical grounds, particularly the ground that the no bail-out clause may turn out to have no clothes. That is exactly what has happened.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share the concern that because we are taking part in the Irish bail-out on equal terms with the euro members, we are setting a precedent that will put political pressure on the Government to take part in other bail-outs?

 I agree with the hon.

which we ultimately guarantee, and through a direct loan from the United Kingdom. We obviously hope that that money will be repaid in full, but there is a contingent liability. We are not part of the eurozone fund, and on the weekend of 9 May I spent many hours resisting every attempt from just about every quarter to get us to stand behind the euro. I did not think that was right for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para74"><a name="10121530000804">We are also making a contribution, of course, through the European financial stability mechanism. That was the subject of a lot of discussion at the meeting of 9 May. I went to Brussels that weekend with no enthusiasm whatever. We had lost the election, but this country was in the unusual position that there was not a Government in place by the Friday, which was the normal situation over the past few decades. Frankly, I had no option but to go, because not to have done so would have been to empty-chair the UK, which would have been quite wrong. I spoke to the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable) and the Chancellor, because I felt it appropriate to do so. I thought that in all probability they would both be in office within a couple of days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para75"><a name="10121530000805">I have to remind the House of the circumstances of that weekend. We were meeting at a time of crisis. There was a real sense that the markets were about to have a go at Portugal and Spain, and there is a sense of déjà vu about that, because we are back in that position now. In all probability, the IMF was going to make a loan. There had been a lot of discussions, prompted by the United States, urging Europe to do something about the growing crisis, yet nothing had happened throughout January, February, March and April. It took that emergency meeting in May, when we had to put together a rescue package to persuade the European Central Bank to start buying bonds. That was the critical decision taken that weekend. If it had not bought bonds, there would have been a real problem. That was why we were faced with the situation that we were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para76"><a name="10121530000806">I discussed with the Chancellor what we should do about the financial stability mechanism. He had his reservations and stated very clearly that he was against deploying it, and he asked me whether I should abstain, recognising that the decision was to be taken by qualified majority voting. Both of us recognised, I think, that if we had abstained the proposal would still have gone through, because everybody else in the room wanted the mechanism to be deployed. I found myself in exactly the same position that he did just a few weeks ago when he was being asked to contribute. He made it clear in a statement to the House on 22 November that he did not believe we should make that commitment, but said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para78"><a name="10121530000808">However, I have to say that that fund was not used at all when it came to the bail-out of Greece. That was entirely from the eurozone fund that was set up. Obviously I had left office by then and was not part of the discussions, but that is the simple fact of the matter. Once again, Europe was meeting in crisis, and we had to get a package of £500 billion together to get the ECB to meet. Otherwise, it would have done absolutely nothing.</p>

However, the approach that has been taken so far, which fails to recognise that the single currency involves 16 member states and 16 Treasuries, will inherently be under stress in times such as these.

Interestingly, the Chancellor says that the proposed interest rate will probably be slightly less than that of the eurozone facility, and that that demonstrates the competitiveness of our economy. I see things differently. If we have such a competitive economy, why not make a profit on the interest rate and charge the same rate as the eurozone and get the benefit for the British taxpayer?</p>

 All we are doing is passing on to Ireland the quarter per cent. or so of benefit that we gain by being a better creditor than the eurozone. Most hon.

When we had problems with Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock, and our Government limited the deposit guarantee to £50,000, the Irish increased their guarantee to all deposits.

have been unable to meet their financial obligations and are desperate for additional loans. I am not convinced that we should be getting involved with British taxpayers' money. It would be different if we did not have an awful national debt crisis, but we do. One consequence of the Bill, if it goes through today, may be to send out a signal to our constituents that says, "Don't worry, the debt crisis is not as bad as we've been telling you," because we can afford to add to that debt further by giving a soft loan to the Irish. At the same time, we are having to argue to our constituents that we cannot put pressure on the banks to give more soft loans to businesses, even if those businesses go bust or cannot expand as a result, with all the damaging consequences for employment that that would have in our country, so I am not convinced.</p>

 Of course I acknowledge that, because it is a fact. However, my hon.

We could have linked those things, if that was what was needed.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope). He mentioned corporation tax, which I shall come to shortly. However, it is worth saying first that what is proposed is a generous act on the part of the Government and the people of the United Kingdom. Of course there are good, economic reasons why what is proposed should be considered in the national interest. As has been pointed out, there are strong arguments about Northern Ireland's position, the involvement of banks from the Irish Republic in Northern Ireland's economy, the exposure of British banks to Irish banks, and so on, which are reasons why we should engage in the loan.</p>

For probably the vast majority of that time, and certainly in the past 30 or 40 years, politicians and others in the Irish Republic have spent most of their time denying the relationship between southern Ireland and the United Kingdom. However, the loan and all that has been said prove the interdependence of the Irish economy and the Irish Republic with-and, to a large degree, their dependence on-the United Kingdom. There are those who go around saying that the United Kingdom should keep out of their affairs and all that, but I think they now realise that in many ways the dependence is very great, and not just on Europe, but on the United Kingdom in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para92"><a name="10121530000840">It is also worth spending a minute or two recapping how we came to this position. For many years, people referred to the great Celtic tiger that was the Irish Republic's economy, and that includes those now in government, as has been pointed out. Those who raised issues about the way in which that economy was lauded were criticised as being driven by petty political considerations and told that their criticisms were not justified. There were those of us who pointed out that there were domestic issues to do with the great concentration on property. However, a recent editorial in <i> The Guardian</i> summed up the position well:</p>
<a name="101215-0002.htm_brev12"><a name="10121530002197"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Politicians kept consumer demand buoyant with generous public spending, while rewarding developer friends with public works contracts. Ireland's narrow elite ran the economy like a casino and awarded itself free chips. No one, save a few lonely economists, had much incentive to call time on the party. By 2007, around one in five Irish jobs depended in some way on the property market."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para93"><a name="10121530000841">The international mistake was to join the euro. Of course the problems are not entirely down to that, but the economic tools that could have helped to control some of the economic excesses, and some of the issues that arose as a result of the bursting of the property bubble, were not available to the Irish Republic as a result of its membership of the euro. Those tools include devaluation and the ability to cut interest rates. So when the crisis came, the Republic was virtually powerless to do anything in that context. That is well known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para94"><a name="10121530000842">We in Northern Ireland have had our disputes with the Irish Republic, but relations are now much better than they used to be, and we do not take any satisfaction from the crisis that has enveloped it. Someone asked where the Irish Republic stood in relation to recent debates on Europe. People will remind us in this House of the Irish Republic's attitude during the long years of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, when the Republic became a safe haven for terrorists and refused to extradite wanted criminals to Northern Ireland for justice. Some of our constituents are now saying, "Why should we help them, now that they are in this situation?" They also remember the Irish Republic's role in the formation of the IRA, back in 1969. They say, "We see all these inquiries, but what are we doing about that?" That is understandable, because lives were lost and families were bereaved as a result of the activities of Governments of all shades and opinions in the Irish Republic. All of them played a role, whether Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or all the rest of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para95"><a name="10121530000843">Having said all that, we recognise that the Irish Republic needs to receive this loan at this critical time, for the reasons that have been set out. Two of the banks are owned by the Irish Republic and are active in Northern Ireland, and a quarter of all the personal accounts of people in Northern Ireland are in those banks. We have also heard about the exposure of British banks to Irish Banks, as well as the wider trade issues, given that 40% of trade in Northern Ireland is carried out with the Irish Republic. All of that means that, if the situation were to deteriorate even further, we would be in a very difficult situation in Northern Ireland. On balance, therefore, we will not vote against the Government, and we have made it clear that we support the Bill.</p>

that is not the argument. The argument is that Northern Ireland is at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the lower rate in the Republic, because of the land border. The Irish Republic is our greatest competitor for foreign direct investment. For us to get the equivalent benefit, we are told that we would have to take a further cut in public expenditure of £310 million. In these circumstances, when a subsidy loan is being provided to the Irish Republic, the case for Northern Ireland should be looked at. Why should we be hit immediately with that cut when the Republic will be given years to pay back its loan, giving it a competitive advantage?</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds). He made many powerful points, especially his last one. I note that the Bill is called the Loans to Ireland Bill, not the Loans to the Irish Republic Bill. I wonder whether the Government have had some foresight, and whether some of the loans will actually be provided to Northern Ireland, to help to reduce corporation tax there. Perhaps there is some hope in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para97"><a name="10121530000846">I want to start by saying that we have an excellent Chancellor of the Exchequer and a first-class Treasury team, including my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who has the misfortune to be at the Dispatch Box to listen to my remarks. On this particular issue, however, I think that they have got it wrong for a number of reasons. Everyone in the House wants to see the Irish Republic prosper, but the question is: which is the best way to help it? Its problem is that it is part of the euro. Government Members have always argued that the United Kingdom should not be part of the euro, because it cannot possibly work. It is not possible to have one fixed interest rate and one fixed currency covering a number of different countries. What we are witnessing is a crisis in which that problem has come to light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para98"><a name="10121530000847">If Ireland were not part of the eurozone-if it had its own currency-it could change its interest rate, but more importantly, its currency could depreciate, which would make it more expensive for exports to come into Ireland and cheaper for exports to go out. It is a market mechanism for self-righting an economic collapse, and because Ireland is part of the eurozone, it cannot do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para99"><a name="10121530000848">I take the view that in the next few months the euro will collapse. It will not just be Ireland and Greece; it will be Spain, Portugal and possibly Italy. At that stage, it will be necessary to abandon the euro entirely or have two eurozones. If I am right in that assumption, it is a mistake to give £3.25 billion to the Irish at a time when it will do no good at all and that money will never be repaid. If we were paving the way for the Irish to have their own currency again, which would be part of the sterling area, we would be more of a help to Ireland. My argument is that we are sending the money in the wrong direction.</p>

One was to have a unified eurozone with central controls over taxation and spending. It is one option, and I accept that such a model would work, but I reject it completely. However, no one can pretend that the current system will ever work. We would just end up putting billions and billions more pounds into a system that will eventually collapse, and, in my view, that will happen earlier rather than later.</p>

We have €17.7 billion from the facility and €22.5 billion from the mechanism. The mechanism was designed for natural emergencies; it was never designed for this purpose, and yet we are taking more out of the mechanism, which has a total pot of €60 billion, than out of the one that has €440 billion. Why? The simple answer is that the United Kingdom has to contribute to the mechanism, but we do not contribute to the facility because it is all eurozone money. In my view we do not need to make this £3.25 billion loan; it should come entirely from the €440 billion that is available for exactly this reason. That is why the facility was set up.</p>

 I congratulate the Chancellor on the proposal, which I fully support. It is my understanding that this step is being taken because there was a potential domino effect, in that any damage in the Irish Republic could have led to further damage to British banks that operate there and to damage to the Northern Ireland economy, and that in turn would have had a very significant effect on the British economy and British interests. I therefore see this as a generous move, but also a move of enlightened self-interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para106"><a name="10121530000858">The Irish economy is in its current situation because it had a banking crisis, not an economic crisis. The underlying economy is sound; the potential for growth exists, and that growth will come forward. The pharmaceuticals and other major industries in the south of Ireland are thriving. The economy is expected to stabilise this year and to begin to expand at between 2.5 and 3% in the period 2011-14. The package of measures that is in place is required in order to restore the public finances and banking liquidity by 2014. The Irish Government have rapidly moved to curtail expenditure dramatically and to raise revenue themselves. The adjustment is expected to bring the economy back into balance within four or five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para107"><a name="10121530000859">Ireland is a small open economy in which long-term sustainable growth depends on healthy international trading, and the conditions for export-led growth are in place: good infrastructure, high-quality human capital, a favourable taxation environment and available credit for viable businesses. The national recovery plan has been put in place, and it is tough and will be difficult. Export-led growth will foster recovery in domestic trading sectors. The growth in GDP is expected to bring unemployment down fairly rapidly, and certainly well below 10% within two to three years. The balance of payments will return to surplus in 2011, so Ireland will be earning its way out of the difficulty that it is in within the next 12 months.</p>

It is a handicap, but it is not as massive a disadvantage as some claim. Ireland's membership of the eurozone obliges it to adhere to stability and growth rules and to bring the general Government deficit to below 3%. The Irish Budget contained a very tough package. Initially, the 2010 Budget presumed an adjustment of about €7.5 billion over a four-year period. With hindsight, we know that the figure proved to be almost double that-some €15 billion-as we crept towards the year end. Two thirds of that is coming out of budgetary adjustment achieved through reduced expenditure, and a third out of taxation. However, by 2014 Irish expenditure will be back to 2007 levels. Total Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP will be reduced from 49% to 36% in the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para109"><a name="10121530000863">The point I am trying to make is that Ireland's underlying economy is healthy. Its membership of and involvement in the eurozone is healthy, and in the long-term it will come round and sort itself out. Ireland has a financial crisis-a banking crisis-that was brought about largely by a property bubble and a lack of liquidity, rather than a flaw in the underlying economy. I want to assure people that the money will be paid, in my opinion and assessment, and that in due course-</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Lessons will have to be learned, not so much about the euro per se but about the performance of the European Central Bank. There is a serious question to be asked about its insistence on low interest rates for a sustained period. That helped to feed the property bubble in Ireland, despite the valiant efforts of the then Finance Minister to find other ways of getting out of the economy the money that was fuelling the property bubble, such as paying off the national debt, putting big money into the national pensions reserve fund and introducing special savings investment accounts.</p>

It is a small country in a very tough global marketplace, and it did its best to resolve both the banking and the deficit situations internally. However, the interdependence of the modern world, Ireland's membership of the eurozone and large market movements put some of the solutions beyond internal domestic management. Indeed, as we all know, both the European Union and the eurozone are themselves facing fundamental challenges in devising a fair and equitable response to the financial crisis in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para111"><a name="10121530000867">However, although the domestic measures in Ireland did not prove sufficient, that does not mean they were not necessary. Ireland did its best to solve the situation internally, and only in the end, when nothing more could be done internally, did it resort to international help.</p>

All of us in the island of Ireland remain convinced that north-south co-operation is a central element of the push for economic recovery-not just within the Irish Republic but within the north. Indeed, the Prime Minister referred to such matters at Question Time. Despite the difficulties, the Irish Government have maintained some €110 million of investment in the north in various things, including major infrastructure projects of importance to both the  <br>

The UK is strong and robust, as we have discussed in relation to trade and all the rest. Ireland, a small country, accounts for 5% of Britain's total exports. We are told that the UK exports more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China put together. Allowing that to collapse would have an immediate impact on this country. The two economies are particularly linked in Northern Ireland, with two fifths of Northern Ireland's economy dependent on the Irish Republic. Just as the two economies are linked, the two banking sectors are linked. As other hon. Members have said, the two main southern Irish banks are very active in the north, and to some extent in Britain; they also issue sterling banknotes, so that all has an implication for the whole banking sector. If this banking liquidity crisis had not been sorted out, we could have ended up with 25% or 30% unemployment, not just in southern Ireland, but in the north.</p>

 As I watched a few minutes of the film "The Perfect Storm" recently, I could not help but reflect on the economic challenges encircling Ireland. The film buffs in the House today will recall how George Clooney tried his best to get his fishermen back to base through a once-in-a-generation storm, created by the coming together of three much smaller but still deadly storms. Just as in that story, we are seeing a clear convergence, and it is of economic crises engulfing the emerald isle. As we have heard, that confluence has far-reaching economic implications, not only for Ireland but for our trading partners in the eurozone and, as a result and most importantly, for the UK economy. That is why the Government are absolutely right to take this specific action in this specific situation to help steer us to a departure from that film's finale and underpin a much more sustainable future for the Irish economy.</p>

the complicating factor of Ireland's membership of the euro is exacerbating those issues. The credit crunch cruelly revealed the extent to which the Irish banks had overextended themselves, and the fact that they were no longer able to access funding on the open market. As a result, the European Central Bank had to step in. The Irish Government had sought to guarantee all the bank liabilities, and the €440 billion promise that they had put in place was twice the size of the Irish gross domestic product. Those losses brought about a complete loss of confidence in the markets, and finally the Government had no choice but to face up to a looming sovereign debt crisis and seek international assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para117"><a name="10121530000876">Joining the euro did not, in itself, cause the challenges that Ireland faces, but it exacerbated them; that is where I disagree with the hon. Member for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell). When the banks binge-borrowed on the back of lower interest rates, it created all sorts of problems that could not have arisen had the punt still been in place. Now, sadly, Ireland's euro membership is acting as a straitjacket. Independent monetary policy and exchange rate flexibility are not an option; they are not available to help Ireland navigate its way out of this terrible crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para118"><a name="10121530000877">I am a confirmed Eurosceptic, and my mother happens to be Danish, so I am proud that when this country worked hard to save sterling, others with more Viking blood than me stepped forward to ensure that they kept their kroner-and quite right too. It is also important to note that both Denmark and Sweden will join the UK in offering loans to Ireland in this unique situation-loans of, I think, €1 billion, or £850 million in proper money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para119"><a name="10121530000878">Despite Ireland's recent history and my views on the euro, I believe that in these unique circumstances the Chancellor is right to extend the bilateral loan to Ireland. The reason is simple: if the Irish storm gathers more momentum it will have major implications not just for the people of Ireland but for all of us in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para120"><a name="10121530000879">We should help our neighbour in need, and it is in our national interest to do so. The recent Office for Budget Responsibility report underlined the strong contribution that will be required from net trade to help get us out of the crisis that we ourselves face. We have talked about the size of the UK's exports to Ireland, but the report goes on to say:</p>
<a name="101215-0002.htm_brev13"><a name="10121530002198"><ul><p class="tabletext">"If recent events significantly reduced Irish demand for UK exports there would be a material impact on UK export growth."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para121"><a name="10121530000880">There is no question about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para122"><a name="10121530000881">Furthermore, we must take the steps to protect UK banks. Again, the OBR estimates that the exposure runs at £82 billion, £4.6 billion of which is exposed in the Irish sovereign debt. In its November report, it states that its estimate of the direct net cost or benefit to the taxpayer of the Government's interventions in the UK banking sector may be affected by the exposure of UK banks to Irish liabilities. There is a clear and important reason for us to take this step forward and mitigate the risk, as well as mitigating the risk of contagion. Given the lack of time available, I simply want to stress my belief that it is vital to support the Government in taking these steps.</p>

 The package is described as a bail-out of Ireland, but it is important that we recognise that Ireland has not asked for the bail-out and that it is not the package that the Irish would have wished. Ireland and the IMF proposed to write down bank senior debt-that is, default on an element of that debt-because they recognised that it would be very difficult, although not impossible, for Ireland to pay back its vast amount of debt. It is not clear to me that adding another €67.5 billion to those debts and subordinating the previous debts to that will help Ireland out of this crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para123"><a name="10121530000883">Let us consider why Ireland was pushed into the crisis. The European Central Bank threatened to withdraw finance for the Irish banks. The ECB had extended €130 billion at a 1% interest rate in temporary liquidity support to the Irish banking sector-a courageous and rather risky thing for it to have done. It would prefer that credit to be refinanced on a longer term basis and at a higher interest rate. If the eurozone wishes to do that, that is a matter for it to agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para124"><a name="10121530000884">What is not clear is what interest we, or indeed Ireland, have in refinancing that eurozone debt into an EU-wide debt. We must consider the funding costs. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has the proud achievement, for which he deserves significant credit, of reducing the long-term costs of borrowing in the UK. Unfortunately, that has gone into reverse over the last three weeks or so. When he came in, we did not give money to the Greek bail-out. We had a rescue package with €440 billion loans and only €60 billion of the dubious EU facility. Unfortunately, that is now being confused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para125"><a name="10121530000885">My hon. Friend the Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell) recognised back in May that this was the beginning of a European debt union, but it was only when I saw how the package was denominated that I began to share that view. Unfortunately, it is rebounding on our credit. The EU puts in €22.5 billion, the eurozone puts in €17 billion and we put in €3.5 billion or so. Rather than this appearing to be a bilateral arrangement that we have properly agreed, because it is in the interests of these islands, and that has been negotiated between the UK and the Republic, we give the markets the impression that we are being sucked into a wider EU package and those markets worry that we will do the same for Portugal or Spain. We have seen the back-up in interest rates in the past few weeks, but I ask the Treasury Front-Bench team to make it as clear as they can that this is a one-off involving Ireland. By doing that, we could at least potentially protect our credit from some of the assumptions that the market has built up in the past few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para126"><a name="10121530000886">On Europe, I commissioned an opinion poll last month of 1,000 representative people in the Republic, and more than a third of that sample said that they would like to leave the euro and return to sterling. The Chancellor says that "I told you so" is not a policy and of course he is right, but he needs to recognise that there is a policy implication that we should not make the same mistake again. I shared with my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary, back in 1998, analysis of what had been happening in Ireland-how bank lending was out of control and how there was going to be a most extraordinary boom and bust that would serve as a vivid lesson to this country.

shared that analysis with Bertie Ahern, prior to his becoming Taoiseach. Like the Chancellor, he said he understood the analysis and that we might be right, but he wanted to join the euro for political reasons. We saw the impact of that decision in Donegal three weeks ago, where the successor seat of my grandfather, who was the Fianna Fail Member for that area, has now been taken by Sinn Fein.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para127"><a name="10121530000887">This is Ireland's decision, but I hope, in its interests and ours, that we will work together much more closely than we have been. There have been improvements in relations since the Prime Minister's comments about the Bloody Sunday inquiry and, given what the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) has said and given his very positive and supportive attitude, I believe we should work with Ireland on a bilateral basis to try to put things right and get a long-term sustainable solution for it and us that is better than the Carolingian settlement that is being imposed by the eurozone and the European Union on an Ireland that deserves better.</p>

My constituents in Kettering are saying to me, "Philip, we are having all these public sector cuts and despite the Government's best efforts the national debt is going to double over the term of the coalition Government; what on earth are you doing lending money to the Irish Republic?", and I share their view. Yes, we should play our part in the loans through the IMF, but we should not be entering into a secondary bilateral arrangement because the truth is not so much that we are lending money to the Irish Republic as that we are lending money to the European Central Bank. We are increasing our exposure to the eurozone at a time when it is in increasing crisis. Given that we decided a long time ago that we wanted nothing to do with the euro, that is a backward step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para131"><a name="10121530000898">The events in Ireland remind us starkly of the principal facts that Ministers have, I am afraid, preferred to hide hitherto. First, the credit crunch was a worldwide, international crisis, not simply something in the United Kingdom. Secondly, the failures of banks that gambled excessively not just with our money but with the money of the Irish people and others are at the root of our present predicament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para132"><a name="10121530000899">The Chancellor of the Exchequer has done well in spinning the line that it was all the fault of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), the former Prime Minister-that he was somehow personally responsible for single-handedly causing the credit crunch in the UK before jetting off to Washington and starting the banking collapse there, then flying to Ireland via Spain, Portugal, Greece and the rest of the developed world, spreading banking catastrophe from continent to continent. However, the Bill-perhaps uncomfortably for the Chancellor-reminds us of the ridiculousness of the coalition's revisionism, and reminds us that the rewriting of history can occur only if we believe in the gullibility of the public, as I suspect the Chancellor does. Although the Government think that may be able to fool all of the people all of the time, the truth is now overwhelmingly obvious, and proves beyond doubt that the greed of profiteering bankers has required the poor, beleaguered taxpayer, here as well as across Ireland and Europe, to bail them out of the mess that they created.</p>

Perhaps that was an error, but sadly he did not acknowledge it. We are not convinced, either, that the Chancellor stands chastened or reflective in regard to his ill-judged comments about the Irish economic miracle". Perhaps  <br>

even we could have expected him to have some conception of the risks posed by the simple "austerity at all costs" principle underpinning his economic policies, but that was not there either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para134"><a name="10121530000901">Fundamentally, the problem is this: if the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not understand the causes of the deficit, he is certainly not the right person to fix it. My constituents, like those of the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone), find it difficult to understand how, given that we were supposedly on the brink of bankruptcy, we can find £3.2 billion for the Irish loan, but nothing for Sheffield Forgemasters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para135"><a name="10121530000902">Sadly, however, we must recognise that the measures before us today are a result of the fragility of the worldwide economy. We hope that, eventually, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister will step up and show a little more leadership, especially in Europe, rather than using bail-outs and loans as sticking plaster. We hope that they will pay more attention to the root causes of what is happening to the economy, and will recognise that we cannot just cross our fingers and pretend that collective austerity will do the trick in all cases. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West is absolutely spot on when he talks about the inadequacy of that proposition. How will the European Union regain the market's confidence in a longer-term trajectory back to stronger revenues and economies? Where are the growth strategies to build longer-term prosperity?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para136"><a name="10121530000903">We have to accept, however, that the case for the loan to Ireland outweighs the case against it. There are risks that need dealing with, including the risk of contagion throughout the eurozone bond market. The ongoing crisis risks shrinking our export market potential in the long run, and as a consequence that risks creating losses for banks in the UK-banks of course that we own. So on balance and for those reasons, we do not oppose the Bill at this time, but in the time remaining we hope to scrutinise the detail in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para140"><a name="10121530000908">It struck me as remarkable, however, that the shadow Chancellor did not understand the mechanisms being used to support the Irish economy. He seemed to think that the UK would bear a higher share of the bail-out costs than other European Union members, such as France and Germany, and that they do not contribute to the IMF or to the stability mechanism. Let me make it absolutely clear to the House that the UK is contributing through the IMF, the stability mechanism and a bilateral loan. Other European countries are contributing through the IMF, the stability mechanism and, if they are members of the eurozone, the stabilisation facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para141"><a name="10121530000909">Owing to their share of the contribution to European Union funds, Germany and France are contributing more than the UK: some 27% of the contribution is through the facility. France contributes 20% through the facility, compared with our 14%. And through the mechanism, the UK's contribution is 14%, Germany's 20% and France's 17%. It is a pity that the shadow Chancellor does not understand how the package actually works. The right hon. Gentleman also seemed to deny that the euro made any contribution to the crisis facing Ireland. However, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), who made a very thoughtful speech about the challenges facing the European Union, punctured his view that the euro had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para142"><a name="10121530000910">My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) asked whether we considered buying bank assets. We have in place an agreement by the Irish Government to repay our loan in full, but that could not have been guaranteed if we had sought to buy individual assets of Irish banks. He also asked whether Ireland could repay early without a penalty, and the answer is yes, but the Irish Government would have to make break payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para143"><a name="10121530000911">The right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) and the hon. Member for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) talked about the impact on the Northern Ireland economy of what is happening south of the border, and we recognise that. We recognise also that more work needs to be done to strengthen the Northern Irish economy, which is why we are in discussions with the Northern Ireland office about the issues to do with enabling the Executive to set their own corporation tax rate. There is another part to that deal, however, because, if they have that power, they will need to bear the risk with the revenue and see a reduction in their block grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para144"><a name="10121530000912">A number of hon. Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) and for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) and the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie), asked how we can afford to do this, given the fiscal position that we are in. Let me make it clear that we are not paying for the loan out of revenue or capital expenditure; we are going to borrow the money. The measure will not lead to a reduction in the money we can spend in my constituency or theirs. In fact, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said, we will end up making a small profit on the loan because of interest rate differentials. The loan will not affect how much can be spent in our constituencies, and if that is the only reason hon. Members are opposing the measure I ask them to think again.</p>

<p><a name="st_o292"><a name="10121530000913"><a name="101215-0002.htm_spnew135"><a name="10121530002896"><b>Mr Bone:</b>
 I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. However, the measure will increase our debt, which is something we are trying to get down. In addition, his comments are based on the assumption that the loan will eventually be repaid.</p>

 The debt is matched by an asset, which is the amount we expect to get from Ireland, and it does not impact on our deficit. We will actually make a return on the interest that will be paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="101215-0002.htm_para145"><a name="10121530000915">Let me deal with three very brief points. First, there is no expectation that we will have to make further loans to Ireland in the future. Secondly, there is no reason to presume that full repayment will not be met over the term of the loan. Thirdly, ensuring Ireland's stability is overwhelmingly in our national interest. That is why we are making the loan and this exception for Ireland. It is in our economy's interests to ensure that the Irish economy is stable and we need to do all that we can to deliver that.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

 I have just abstained on Second Reading for one simple reason. I had intended to vote for it, but I remain gravely dissatisfied by the answer that I received from the Chancellor regarding the increase in the amount specified in clause 1. I do not want in any way to misrepresent what he said, but as I understood it, it was that that was all right because it was about exchange rates. However, anybody who examines clause 1 carefully will notice that subsection (4) states:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev3"><a name="10121530002204"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Treasury may by order made by statutory instrument substitute a greater amount for the amount for the time being specified in subsection (3)",</p>

An order would be made under the negative resolution only if the increase is to do with exchange rates, but I can see nothing to say that an increase under subsection (4) would be affected by subsequent provisions. I was bound to take great exception to that. It is a serious matter, because we simply do not know what the greater amount  <br>

would be. We are totally exposed, subject only to affirmative resolution, which cannot be amended. Such a measure would simply go through on a whipped vote, just as the rest of the Bill doubtless will. That is why I abstained on Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para15"><a name="10121530001476">Amendment 3 addresses the definition of "Irish loan". I was staggered when I looked carefully at the Bill, because clause 1(2) states that "Irish loan" means simply</p>

I believe very strongly that the technique that is consistently employed in all spheres of activity is to say, "We don't like what goes on in the EU, but we can just go along with it. Alternatively, to satisfy the Eurosceptics or Eurorealists, as they prefer to be called, we can make parallel arrangements along the lines of what we would have done if we were in the eurozone."</p>

 A portion of the total loan package is contingent money for Irish banks-they may or may not need it. Is my hon. Friend worried that they could come back for even more, and that clause 1(4) could allow an extension of our loan for Irish banks?</p>

 Yes I am. Treasury civil servants are exceedingly clever and may know of pitfalls, but they might not fully explain them to Ministers. Of course, the Minister takes ultimate responsibility, but the question is: what is the effect on the daily lives of the people whom we represent? That is the issue on which we have to concentrate.</p>

In particular, I would mention what I will call the mechanism, as compared with the facility. I had an exchange earlier about the mechanism with the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), who said, "This is all going to be done by qualified majority voting." However, that is not the case. Within the mechanism as it is set out, the request comes from the member state; it is only the final arrangement that requires  <br>

qualified majority voting. Indeed, the EU sent in the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund in flagrant contradiction of the provisions of article 3 of the regulation in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para22"><a name="10121530001485">In fact, the EU was operating the provision as if it were already law, when it was not. That it is typical of the European Union. It keeps on telling us about the rule of law, but when it suits, it completely ignores the law. What happened was unlawful. I also believe that it was unlawful in respect of article 122, which was the legal basis used to create the mechanism. I do not need to go into detail, but article 122 concerns natural disasters, energy supply and things of that kind. Anyone who looks at article 3, article 122 and the others provisions that they mention would reasonably conclude that they should not be used for the purposes of sorting out an unmitigated mess that was created by banks, as well as by the Government of Ireland and other parts of the European Union. Therefore, I am afraid that the answer that I received from the former Chancellor-that there really was no alternative to what was done, because such decisions are reached by qualified majority voting-does not stack up. If what happened was unlawful, it should have been resisted and, because of the consequences, it should, if necessary, have been taken to the European Court.</p>

 My hon. Friend has great legal expertise. I understand that the European Union is trying to negotiate an amendment to article 122 of the treaty in order to put the matter beyond doubt. Would that be retrospective, or could that undermine the current position?</p>

 That is a very good question. I doubt very much whether an attempt to make the provision retrospective would remedy the mischief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para23"><a name="10121530001488">I am afraid that the question of illegality taints the Government's position as well, and I shall explain why-the Minister will know all the detail, because I think that he was the Minister responsible. There is provision for the European Scrutiny Committee under Standing Order No. 143 regarding scrutiny and scrutiny reserves. It so happens that the European Scrutiny Committee was not set up until November, a few weeks ago. However, I have here a table setting out the dates that shows that the date of deposit was 25 May 2010. The decision was taken on 9 May at ECOFIN, which happened to be 48 hours before the coalition was pushed through. In the case of ECOFIN's decision on the financial stability mechanism, the table states unequivocally that there was an override of both the European Scrutiny Committee and the Lords. On both counts, the then Government and the current Government breached the scrutiny arrangements. Indeed, it is quite extraordinary that the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the documents in question, and which should have been presented much earlier, was presented on 15 July. I know that the Minister will not dispute that, because it comes from Government documents. There is a serious worry about the manner in which this matter has been manipulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para24"><a name="10121530001489">Just before the proceedings began, we were presented with another document, which reinforces my concern.

Act 1972." I am very familiar with the way in which interweaving goes on, not only as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee but because, for the past 26 years, I have watched this process of integration and the manner in which, by extremely clever and adroit manoeuvring, we get further and further integrated into these arrangements. The mechanism is an open-ended invitation until 2013, as I ascertained during an exchange with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Until 2013, we are stuck with the present arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para25"><a name="10121530001490">I am sometimes a bit of a Cassandra, in that I make prophecies-more like predictions-about certain events, find out that I was right and then find out that nobody took any notice until they had happened. On this occasion, I am going to say that it is extremely likely that, if Portugal gets into really deep trouble-and perhaps Spain, too-that will happen before 2013. If this greater amount is interwoven into the stabilisation mechanism, or even if it is not, the mechanism itself will entrap us in the arrangements which, although not yet permanent, will go on until 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para26"><a name="10121530001491">I also think that the Government are struggling a bit in relation to article 122, under which this measure was introduced-unlawfully, in my opinion-because the Commissioner responsible, a Mr Sefcovic, has stated that the Commission is still considering whether to use article 136 or article 122. Against that background, the Van Rompuy Committee is sitting and might already have concluded that it would be appropriate to have a permanent mechanism in place only under article 136, and therefore only by reference to the eurozone. That would be a plus, but it would not alter the fact that, between now and 2013, we are at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para27"><a name="10121530001492">I am concerned about the deficient wording in clause 1(2), because not excluding what might be done under the European Union effectively leaves it open to the European Union's continuing to weave its way into the arrangements, despite the fact that they are described as a bilateral loan. Some people might say, "Ah, but you have to understand that when the explanatory notes talk about a bilateral loan, they mean that." It does not say that in the Bill, however. Furthermore, we have had some unpleasant experiences with explanatory notes in the European Scrutiny Committee recently, as anyone who wants to read the report that we have just issued will see. The explanatory notes in question were positively misleading, and distorted the legal position. That is a matter that we will be pursuing in Committee, when we ask whether parliamentary sovereignty or judicial supremacy should prevail. I do not need to go into the detail of that now, but the fact that a bilateral loan is mentioned in the explanatory notes has been severely vitiated by our experience of the explanatory notes to the European Union Bill.</p>

 I happen to agree with that, which is why I did not vote against the Bill, but I must say that this is not a matter of merely academic interest, because the consequence that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, which led me to abstain, is that there is no restriction on the greater amount. I wait with enormous interest to hear whether the Minister will differ from the Chancellor of the Exchequer on that, but when it is an open-ended provision for a greater amount, I would like to know what that greater amount's limit would be.</p>

I remain worried about the direction in which we seem to be going, therefore. It would be so simple for the Government to give me either a direct assurance, which I would regard as a second-tier response, or a specific agreement to accept my amendment just to get me off their back.

 We will listen with interest to what the Minister has to say, but, just to be clear, is the hon.

Even deconstructing it through country-by-country removals will cause problems, because many other countries have money in Irish and Greek banks, so it will be devalued and people will lose.

Benches that we can see, and I hope that we will have a chance to divide the House on it. It is right that we should be looking to help Ireland and debating how to do so, not simply because of this country's economic self-interest, but because of the close cultural ties between Britain and Ireland. It is fair to say that there is not a street in any town in this country where there are not close kith and kin connections between our two countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para60"><a name="10121530001533">The question is whether the Bill helps us to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless) spoke eloquently, making the point that this deal is not tailored to help the Republic of Ireland, but has been imposed on it. It is not a case of our passing this to bail out Ireland, so much as our passing it to bail out the euro. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) has said that, and he has blogged eloquently about how the European Central Bank triggered this crisis. It began when the ECB called into question Ireland's ability to finance loans. Why did it do so? It did so because the ECB sacrificed Ireland to staunch the haemorrhaging of confidence in the euro and deal with the growing storm around it. The ECB put preserving a paper currency without a state ahead of the well-being of millions of Irish households.</p>

How does extending a debt as overdraft help that debtor to repay their debts? That will dig Ireland deeper into debt. Each of the eight tranches of this loan is yet another step towards debt. It is time that we stopped digging Ireland into deeper debt. The bail-out will not reduce the debt. People sometimes talk about the bail-out as though it were a solution to debt, but it is a deepening of debt. We need to make certain that the rate of interest and the terms of this extension of Ireland's overdraft are in her interests and those of her people. To do that, we need to make sure that we in this House have the final say over the terms of the small print.</p>

not formalise the arrangements? Why not require the approval of an order under the affirmative procedure in the House? We have only the explanatory notes to go on-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am delighted that those on the Front Bench are paying such attention. We only have the explanatory notes to go on, so why not enshrine these arrangements by order? The last time that we left EU matters to Sir Humphrey's explanatory notes, we were, bluntly, mugged. The explanatory notes to the Bill on sovereignty-the European Union Bill-were not even defended by the Minister in Committee. It is a cause of concern that we have only the explanatory notes.

That is the price we pay as a House for taking our eyes off the small print. It would be quite wrong, incidentally, to blame the previous Government for that.

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para71"><a name="10121530001547">Given that the purpose of the loan arrangement is to make sure that Ireland can go to the bond markets on its own as soon as possible and get money at competitive rates, it is clearly in the House's interests, as the UK will be providing this loan, to make sure that the loan terms are protected against any undue terms coming from the other loans being made available in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para72"><a name="10121530001548">Several hon. Members have mentioned the role of the European Central Bank. We can look at the history to this situation and question the role of the ECB on a number of occasions. First, it kept interest rates very low-at times against the express wish and request of the Irish Finance Minister-which helped to contribute to the problem. Secondly, as many hon. Members have mentioned, there is the open-ended nature of the Irish Government's guarantee to the banks. Again, the ECB seems to have been the primary body urging a guarantee of that extent. Thirdly, there is the whole issue of the need for the bail-out and the creation of circumstances in which the Irish Government have had to seek it. Again, many people have questions about the precise role and performance of the European Central Bank in all that. Hon. Members have asked serious questions about the ECB, and we know that a much bigger loan facility is being granted through the EU and the IMF, so surely the House will want to know that the terms of the bilateral loan and its operation will not jeopardise the interests or purposes for which it is being made available. It therefore makes sense for the key terms that are summarised in the document to refer to the restructuring plan that is to be undertaken in relation to the banks.</p>

have an opportunity to debate the interest rate question in particular because it has such an important bearing not only on the British taxpayer, as the organisation making the loan, but on the Irish people themselves. There are a number of circumstances that can change from time to time. What we have before us is a summary of key terms of the credit facility, which does not necessarily give us the full picture. Although we support the principle of the loan, I am slightly uncomfortable about nodding through quite technical terms without our having had even a retrospective opportunity to air the details properly. That, I think, is essentially what amendment 6 is trying to rectify. I shall say more about that shortly, but let me first deal with amendment 3, because it makes an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para81"><a name="10121530001558">I entirely understand the attempt by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash) to limit the way in which the current drafting of the Bill might affect all sorts of other unforeseen loan opportunities. He spoke of the European Union's inveigling its way into other loan arrangements. In particular, he is worried about whether the Bill excludes what might be done under European law, because, as he sees it, this legislation leaves open opportunities for the EU to enlarge and change the mechanism, and to build on what we, at face value, know about the dimensions of the loan under discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para82"><a name="10121530001559">There are some interesting points about the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the case of a default, and some questions probably merit further scrutiny, but I am not entirely convinced of the hon. Gentleman's arguments or of whether his amendment to clause 1(2) would necessarily achieve much of great use. I am grateful to him, however, for at least tabling it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para83"><a name="10121530001560">We have not touched on some of the other amendments in the group. The Chancellor addressed the denomination in sterling issue in his opening comments, but the question about whether the loan should be repaid over a particular length of time is quite interesting, and the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) tabled a useful amendment involving the 30-year period. The Opposition have also tabled amendments on those matters, in our case to clause 2, but our proposals are about the reports having to comment on the duration of the loan. Amendment 10, on the terms of the credit facility being open to greater debate, is quite interesting, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para84"><a name="10121530001561">Amendment 6 looks most interesting, however. Given the drafting of this quite hurried legislation, and the unusually conspicuous absence of certain dimensions of the loan, we have a duty to pay attention to what the hon. Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell) suggests. When one thinks about a loan, one should think about not just the sum of money, but the duration and the interest rate. The rate of return on the British loan is a fundamentally important fact that cannot be simply skimmed over by references in documents that are not currently official documents before the House. The Chancellor said that the Swedish and Danish bilateral loan arrangements have not yet been completed, so it is difficult for us to determine whether our prospective interest rate is more or less favourable than theirs. What would happen if there were a sudden spike in global interest rates? Where in the Bill is there any protection for the British taxpayer?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para85"><a name="10121530001562">Conversely, where in the legislation is there any protection for the Irish if the current or any future Government decide to chop and change the rate from time to time,  <br>

perhaps making a unilateral, Executive decision to raise the interest rate in future tranches of the loan arrangement? The Chancellor said that the interest rate will be fixed for the duration of each tranche, but there is no assurance of that in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para86"><a name="10121530001563">There is no harm in allowing the House the opportunity to debate and approve, by the affirmative procedure, a statutory instrument on the interest to be charged following the recommendation of Ministers. Our parliamentary democracy is often disregarded as some kind of rubber-stamping device, but perhaps these are good times to take back some of those safeguards, given the serious issues at hand. While Parliament votes on those moneys tonight, it must also consider taking greater ownership of the process, rather than delegating absolutely everything in absolutely every arrangement to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am certainly interested in amendment 6, and I commend the hon. Gentleman for his prescience in tabling it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="10121530001564"><a name="101215-0003.htm_spnew20"><a name="10121530003453"><b>Mr Hoban:</b>
 Amendment 3, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash) has moved, would ensure that the Bill did not apply to any loan made by the United Kingdom to Ireland under the European Communities Act 1972. Let me give him a second-tier assurance that the Bill applies only to the UK's bilateral loan to Ireland. Any EU loan made to Ireland through the financial stability mechanism would not be a loan from the UK to Ireland and would not be subject to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para87"><a name="10121530001565">There is no interweaving or interlocking, and therefore the amendment is unnecessary. My hon. Friend referred to paragraph 6(h) of the loan agreement. I am sure he will understand that the funding Ireland gets is dependent on it being a member of both the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. If it were no longer a member, it would no longer receive the funding and therefore there would be a problem. Amendment 4 would remove the power to increase the cap on the loan and adjust the cap for exchange rate fluctuations. I hope that the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor remove the need for anyone to push that amendment further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para88"><a name="10121530001566">Amendment 6 would require the interest rate on the loan to be approved by Parliament. That is not appropriate. The interest rate for each tranche of the lending to Ireland will be a fixed rate that is set by adding a margin of 2.29% to the sterling seven-and-a-half-year swap rate at the time that the disbursement is made. That is set out in the loan agreement and gives certainty to us and to the Irish Government, who would want to have certainty when accepting and voting on this package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para89"><a name="10121530001567">My hon. Friend the Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell) said that the amendment would enable the loan interest rate to be reduced. It could also lead to the loan interest rate being increased to the detriment of the Irish Government and their economic recovery. It is important that there is a clear, definitive statement about what the rate is. We have published the summary of key terms of the loan agreement to help colleagues understand what the rate is and how it will be set. The rate is set with the Republic and within the range of interest rates agreed with other multilateral bodies. It would be a big mistake and irresponsible of the Labour party to vote for  <br>

amendment 6, because it would create uncertainty and instability where we want certainty and stability for the Irish Government. I question whether what the amendment proposes is the right thing to do. The loan rate is agreed and clear, and it is in the summary of key credit terms. The Irish Government have signed off on those key terms. That is the rate they are expecting to get. Amendment 6 would create unnecessary uncertainty and I therefore ask my hon.

 In dealing with the issues emerging in Ireland, we have sought to keep the House informed as much as possible about the progress that was being made as the crisis emerged, and the role that the UK Government felt they should play in helping to resolve it and responding to the Irish Government's request for help at the end of last month. We have done that through statements to the House and the publication of the Bill last week, and to aid debate, we ensured that before today's debate started a copy of the loan agreement was placed in the Vote Office.

How are you going to keep the House informed of what's happening, whether the Irish Government are drawing down each of the eight tranches, how far they've got with repayments, and so on?"

We accept the principle, but as I know from my experience as an Opposition spokesperson, Opposition Members do not have access to the full array of drafting skills that Governments have.

 I am pleased that my hon. Friend recognises the spirit of the new politics, but I am not quite sure where he will take the debate from there. I welcome his recognition of the Government's flexibility. I do not know what his experience is, but my experience of opposition was that it was rare for a Government to accept an Opposition amendment even in principle. So this perhaps shows that the spirit of the new politics is now coursing through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para107"><a name="10121539000026">I should make some holding remarks on amendment 5, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash) tabled. I am pleased to see him in the Chamber, because he may be able to be clearer about the thinking behind his proposal than I could.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para108"><a name="10121539000027">Subsections (4) and (5) are there to ensure that the duty to report does not continue indefinitely once all loans made under the Bill have been repaid and the authority to make further loans has lapsed. The way in which my hon. Friend has drafted amendment 5 would turn the requirement to report on the loan while sums are outstanding into an open-ended requirement to report every six months ad infinitum, even once all the loans had been fully repaid. I hope that the Committee will agree that this would be unnecessary and undesirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para109"><a name="10121539000028">Amendment 2, tabled by Her Majesty's Opposition, would do something slightly different. Whereas my hon. Friend seeks to amend clause 2 to ensure that reports appear ad infinitum, the Opposition seek to bring forward the date on which the duty to report would end, by removing the requirement to report where there were no outstanding liabilities, but where there had been repayments or payments of interest in the preceding reporting period. In effect, amendment 2 says that there should not be a report where there is no balance to be repaid at the end of the period, although payments have been received in those six months. It would seem odd to remove the need for a report on the period during which the last part of the loan was paid off. Clearly the Government should be required to report that that has happened, and that is what the Bill as drafted requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para110"><a name="10121539000029">I hope that the Committee will accept amendment (a), and that the proposers of amendments 1, 2 and 5 will not press them to a vote.</p>

 I do not necessarily wish to pour more congratulations on to the shoulders of the Minister-that would not be doing my job correctly-but in the spirit of Christmas I have to acknowledge, albeit begrudgingly, my appreciation of manuscript amendment (a), which the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself has tabled. I like to imagine him poring over the Order Paper, happening upon my amendment 1 and immediately thinking, "I must accept that amendment, but the drafting is not quite right," and therefore rewriting it in his own fair hand. However, I suspect that several dozen parliamentary draftsmen and women were involved in the process. As the Minister said, the intention was indeed to ensure that when we report every six months on what is happening with the loans, we are talking not just about the aggregate amount of the payments made and the interest, or about the sums that are returned, but about some of the other dimensions.</p>

at this stage that we would appreciate as much data being contained in them as possible. One piece of information that I would have found useful is the remaining term of the loan, although that is a small point; given how small it is, I am grateful that the Government have conceded it.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman. Just at what I thought was my moment of great glee, he took it away from me. Nevertheless, I will take some satisfaction from what the Government have decided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para112"><a name="10121539000034">I was trying to listen carefully to the Minister's statement on amendment 2. As a lone traveller trying to amend the legislation, I might have misread the wording of clause 2, but I still do not quite understand the sequences of subsection (4), which states:</p>

<p><a name="101215-0003.htm_amdt12">"No report is required to be prepared or laid in relation to a period if-</p>

<p><a name="101215-0003.htm_amdt13">(a) no payments...are made...</p>

<p><a name="101215-0003.htm_amdt14">(b) no sums...are received in the period, and</p>

<p><a name="101215-0003.htm_amdt15">(c) no amount of principal or interest in respect of an Irish loan is outstanding at the end".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para113"><a name="10121539000035">I could not see any circumstances where paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would simultaneously apply. For example, if no amount of principal or interest were outstanding, how could there be any circumstances where, under paragraph (a), payments had been made or, under paragraph (b), sums had been received? Surely if no report is required when no amounts are outstanding, the conditions under subsections (4)(a) and (b) are redundant. Looking at the drafting of subsection (4), it would be easy to imagine the parliamentary counsel becoming entangled in an arcane discourse on ontological logic. There are several twists to the double negatives set out in the drafting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para114"><a name="10121539000036">As a layman reading subsection (4), I could not see why paragraphs (a) and (b) were necessary, when they must be concurrent with subsection (4)(c), given that (4)(c) states that there is nothing left owing, according to my reading of it. If each of the three paragraphs were alternatives, or contrasting, perhaps using the words "either" or "or", that might make sense. They are conjoined, however, by the non-contrasting linkage "and", suggesting that each of the three conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously, and I am not quite sure that I follow that. Perhaps the Minister needs to walk me through it one more time. I do not wish to press this matter to a vote, because I am sure that there is a higher drafting power at work here, but as I read it, I could not see any circumstances in which paragraph (c) would be true simultaneously with paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para115"><a name="10121539000037">In general terms the reports will be important, not least because we need to see the terms of the loan that the people of Ireland will have to repay, as well as the amounts of money that the British people will have in return for adding to our national debt. There is a whole series of other questions to which I would eventually like answers. For example, what is the aggregate amount of interest that we expect to be paid by the Irish Government, and what is the impact for us in this country?</p>

 I have much the same curiosity as the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie). I was a bit puzzled by the drafting of this provision, and I wanted to find out what the Minister had in mind.

Subsections (1), (2) and (3) will be necessary. It is possible that, in due course, the concerns that I raised on an earlier amendment might need to be included in the report. That was the case, for example, in relation to the reports on the Maastricht convergence criteria, despite all the footling remarks that were made during the debate on Maastricht, when we were assured that this, that and the other would not happen. When we came to the convergence reports, and got into the whole business of the golden rule, the stability and growth pact and all the other shenanigans and wriggling, we were proved right over and over again.</p>

 I just want to pick up the hon. Gentleman's point that if there is nothing to report there is no need to have any reports. I believe that it would be of interest to the House if, even when no payments were made, a report were still produced to set out that fact. That might seem a small point but, for example, in the unlikely event that default became an eventuality, the lack of a payment being received might be of interest. That was also part of the rationale behind deleting subsection 4(a) and (b).</p>

Ireland's stability is very much in our interests. A final written agreement on the various terms of the loans will be forthcoming in the next few weeks, but we have sought to provide a summary of the key terms that have been agreed with the Irish Government, in order to help to inform today's debate. It is clear from the way in which the Committee stage of the Bill proceeded that the provision of that information was helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para136"><a name="10121539000069">I note the point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie). I, too, wish that we could have supplied this information sooner, but when one is negotiating a deal with another Government, one cannot always deliver information as timeously as one would perhaps like. However, we are committed to keeping the House informed about the progress of those negotiations, and clause 2 will enable us to do so-rather, it will require us; we could have been enabled to do so anyway, through our own desire-through six-monthly reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para137"><a name="10121539000070">It is clear from the debate, particularly on Second Reading, that Ireland is a friend in need. Our economy is currently in a stronger position than theirs, which is why we are able to offer our support. It is clearly in our interests, because of the strong links we have with the Irish economy. Ireland is one of our key trading partners, and a strong Ireland will help to support growth, jobs and investment in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para138"><a name="10121539000071">The Bill is straightforward: it gives the Treasury the power to make disbursements to the Irish Government. There is a mechanism in place to take into account any adjustments in exchange rates that emerge between 9 December and the signing of the agreement, which we expect to be within the next 30 days. We do not expect to increase our contribution beyond the €3.8 billion agreed with our international partners and the Irish Government, but there is a mechanism to do so if it is required. Again, that would be through the affirmative resolution procedure and would be voted on by all Members of Parliament. So the right safeguards are in place, and the use to which the facility will be put will also be subject to regular reporting under clause 2.</p>

Relying on exports alone delivering them is a risky economic strategy. However, going forward, Europe needs to get ahead of this crisis and the bail-out does buy time, but it does not offer a fundamental solution to the fundamental problem. In Greece, we saw markets calm temporarily, but six months later the Irish problem came to a head.</p>

Although we of course support the Bill, we are therefore particularly anxious that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister show greater leadership in tackling the root causes of the lack of confidence, and argue more fervently for a plan for growth and jobs across Europe and across the eurozone. We believe that that has to be the fundamental objective for the Government at this time; but we are of course happy to support Third Reading.</p>

 I, too, hope that this Bill succeeds, because it is important to help Ireland. I would like to see Ireland as part of a new configuration of the European Union, rejoining this country on a different footing from the arrangements that currently prevail in the European Union. The European Union is increasingly in its death throes and I hope that this does not lead to an implosion. We have seen riots in the streets here in the United Kingdom, in Greece, in Portugal and in Italy-there were riots in Rome only yesterday. The situation is extremely grave and a lot of it results from the very point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) about growth. The plain fact is that under the current arrangements there is no growth. Until powers are repatriated we will not get the sort of oxygen into the small business community that will be able to fill the gap between the requirements of the Irish economy and those of the UK economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para143"><a name="10121539000078">In the meantime, we are considerably exposed to the indebtedness of the Irish banks. The amount that we have made available, small as it is comparatively but great as it is from the point of view of the British taxpayer, has been justified, but that is without prejudice to my concerns. They are that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer's explanation of how the financial stability mechanism came to be put through remains unsatisfactory. He could have referred the whole question to the European Court, because this was unlawful and remains so. I sent a note to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this very question as he was going off to an ECOFIN meeting. I regret to say that the explanatory memorandum produced by the Government on 27 July-perhaps it was 25 July -endorsed the decision taken by the former Government, and that speaks for itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para144"><a name="10121539000079">I am also deeply worried about this business of the "greater amount" under the provisions that we have already discussed because, irrespective of what the Chancellor said about the exchange rate, the reality is that the amount of the increase is simply a matter of whether or not it is carried by the affirmative resolution.  <br>

<notus-date day="15" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>15 Dec 2010 : Column 1003</b><br>
It is only when the exchange rate issue comes into play and we are therefore just dealing with a fluctuation in the amounts to be made available that we revert to using the negative resolution. Therefore, the Bill still provides that this "greater amount" is an open-ended commitment, and I hope that the Government will keep this closely under surveillance. I have heard nothing from the Front Benchers to dissuade me from that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para145"><a name="10121539000080">Finally, we need to deal with the question of the Euro-ectoplasm and the way in which the kaleidoscope of European legislation in conjunction with all the other arrangements that have been made parallel to this so-called "bilateral loan" weave together, because there is a serious risk that the European jurisdiction applies here. I did not press my amendment to a Division for reasons relating to another vote that did not, in fact, transpire along the lines anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para146"><a name="10121539000081">Be that as it may, the Bill is understandable from the point of view of the Irish economy. However, the Irish Government and the Irish banking system have to take the blame for allowing their economy to get so far out of kilter, and that point needs to be made on the Floor of this House. We are helping them, but we are doing so without prejudice to the fact that they got themselves into the same kind of mess as the Labour Government did on our economy. This is not a day for excuses or congratulation; it is a day for a bit of sober reflection. If people spend what they have not got, they end up with it catching up with them. There is a great deal to be said for prudence, but not of the former Prime Minister's kind.</p>

For those reasons, this Bill and the debate about it reflect-to use an old phrase that was coined by Charlie Haughey in the days when he was creating Anglo-Irish engagement with Margaret Thatcher-the totality of relationships. In many ways, today's debates and the arguments, justifications and explanations that have been given by the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers in recent weeks reflect the modern reality of the totality of relationships between these islands in economic and banking terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para151"><a name="10121539000087">I understand the question asked earlier by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) about the Bill's title. As an Irish nationalist, I regard Ireland as the island of Ireland. My constituency of Foyle demonstrates another naming issue. It is the city of Derry or Londonderry, and so it is instead called Foyle, after the river. The issues are similar with the title "Ireland". When I was Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland, I had to present statements and agreements on EU funds that were agreements between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Those terms struck me as odd and I could not get away with saying "between Northern Ireland and the south" because the proper title of the Irish state is Ireland. I assume that that is the explanation for the title of the Bill, uncomfortable though some of us, as profound Irish nationalists, might be with that.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). The Bill has, as he said, been microwaved through the House today, but the trouble with microwaved meals is that although they are quick and do a job, they are not healthy and are not of good quality. That is how I regard the Bill, but I certainly do not seek to divide the House on Third Reading. I have made it clear that I am against the Bill, but it would be wrong to claim any victory today. My remarks and those of some of my colleagues resulted in at least seven Members going through the same Lobby as me, but the Chancellor's remarks got several hundred Members to go through the same Lobby as him, so it probably is not a good idea to divide on Third Reading.</p>

 Before I turn to the three former Members who are the subject of the motion, I wish to make a few remarks about the behaviour of the people who duped them. They would no doubt argue that they have served the public interest, but they were also taking advantage of the need of retiring MPs in the run-up to a general election to provide for their future employment. They dangled the bait in front of our former colleagues and unfortunately some of them took it. If that was not entrapment, it was something close to it, and although I do not seek to excuse the conduct of those three former Members, I think the whole House will feel some sympathy for them because of the way they were deceived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para157"><a name="10121539000095">Three former Members-Sir John Butterfill, Patricia Hewitt and Adam Ingram-were cleared by the commissioner and the Committee that I chair of any breach of the rules. Whatever we may feel about the poor judgment they showed in agreeing to take part in the bogus interviews, and however ill-judged some of the remarks made in the interviews may have been, they did not break the rules and the Committee has therefore made no recommendations about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para158"><a name="10121539000096">The remaining three former Members did break the rules, and the Committee has recommended sanctions accordingly. I will deal with each of them in turn, because although they were all part of the same deception practised by the media, their cases are different in important respects. Stephen Byers has made a full and I would say gracious apology. He recognises that he made claims to the bogus interviewer that were untrue, and it is evident that he deeply regrets the damage he has caused not only to his reputation but to the reputation of the House. I do not dispute the genuineness of his apology, but unfortunately the seriousness of his offence means that saying sorry is not enough. That is why the Committee has recommended that Mr Byers's entitlement to a parliamentary pass should be suspended for two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para159"><a name="10121539000097">The Committee also found that Geoff Hoon committed a particularly serious breach of the code which, like that of Mr Byers, brought the House and its Members generally into disrepute. As those who have read the Committee's report and the evidence will know, Mr Hoon has not accepted this conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para160"><a name="10121539000098">He argued that the code of conduct should not apply because he was discussing his private life and what he might do after he had left the House. The Committee did not accept that argument. Mr Hoon was a Member of Parliament when he attended the bogus interview, and he talked in the interview about information that he had been given while he was he was a Member of Parliament, so the code applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para161"><a name="10121539000099">Secondly, Mr Hoon suggested that the meaning of what he had said to the bogus interviewer had been misinterpreted. It seemed to come down to whether he had said "this" or "it", or perhaps neither. Some of us refreshed our memory of what he said by watching a recording of the "Dispatches" programme, and he clearly said "this". Ultimately, however, it is not so much about the exact words that he used as about the impression that he was giving. The Committee concluded that Mr Hoon was giving the clear impression that he could brief paying clients about defence policy on the basis of his inside knowledge. That is, as we said in our report, a particularly serious breach of the code, because it brings the House and its Members into disrepute. Unlike Mr Byers, Mr Hoon has neither accepted that he breached the code nor apologised. The Committee has therefore recommended that Mr Hoon's entitlement to a parliamentary pass should be suspended for five years. Hopefully, the apology will ensue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para162"><a name="10121539000100">The Committee found that in Richard Caborn's case there were several minor breaches of the rules in relation to his failure to declare an interest when arranging or taking part in functions in the House. They were most likely due to carelessness on Mr Caborn's part; there is no evidence that he deliberately set out to break the rules. Mr Caborn accepts that that was the case, and he has apologised unreservedly for those breaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para163"><a name="10121539000101">The Committee found that Mr Caborn committed a further breach when he failed to declare a financial interest in the course of a meeting with a senior NHS official at which a proposal was raised which might have benefited the members of an organisation for which he was a paid consultant. In our judgment and that of the commissioner, that breach was also due to carelessness. There is no evidence of intent on Mr Caborn's part. The commissioner therefore described it in his memorandum to us as "less serious" than the breaches committed by Mr Byers and Mr Hoon, but that does not mean that it was not a serious breach. It was a breach both of the rules on declaration of interests and of paragraph 12 of the code of conduct, which covers all members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para164"><a name="10121539000102">The Committee took the view that, because that was a less serious breach than those committed by the other former Members, a less severe sanction was appropriate. We could have recommended just an apology, but Mr Caborn had written to us stating that he did not accept that he should have declared his interest and did not accept that he had breached the rules. As we pointed out in our report, we could have invited the House to summon Mr Caborn to the Bar to apologise in person, but if he did not accept that he had breached the rules, it was not clear what that would achieve. We therefore agreed that Mr Caborn should also lose his privileged rights of access, and, because his was a less serious case than the others, we set the tariff at six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para165"><a name="10121539000103">Mr Caborn wrote to me on 12 December seeking a meeting with the Committee. I consulted my colleagues on the Committee, who agreed to offer him an opportunity  <br>

to give oral evidence at its meeting on 14 December. We had, of course, invited Mr Caborn and the others to give oral evidence before we produced our report, but he had declined that initial invitation. We would not normally agree to a request to give evidence after the publication of a report, but in this case we felt that it was right to grant Mr Caborn's request to have his say, because, as a former Member, he was unable to speak in today's debate. The transcript of his evidence, and his letter to me of 12 December, are in the Vote Office, and I hope that Members have had an opportunity to read them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para166"><a name="10121539000104">I do not propose to go through Mr Caborn's evidence in detail, but this is the nub of it. First, we are finding against him on the basis of a rule that we ourselves say is insufficiently clear and needs reviewing. Secondly, he is being treated in the same way as those who have committed particularly serious breaches of the code of conduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para167"><a name="10121539000105">The Committee says that the rules on lobbying need to be reviewed. The 1974 resolution refers to</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para170"><a name="10121539000109">That all needs to be brought together and tidied up, but, as the Committee's report states:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev44"><a name="10121539000110"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Mr Caborn should have had greater regard to the purpose of the rule".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para171"><a name="10121539000111">The purpose of the rule is quite clear: it is to ensure that Members are transparent in their dealings with people who might be in a position to influence public policy or the spending of public money. Mr Caborn tried in his evidence to tie the rule very tightly to people who are in a position to influence legislation, but such a narrow interpretation is not one that most of us would recognise. To sum up: yes, the rules need reviewing and clarifying, but the purpose of the rules is clear and the evidence that Mr Caborn breached the rules is, in my Committee's view, also clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para172"><a name="10121539000112">Turning to the Committee's recommendation, I have already explained that we felt that a sanction was appropriate. If Mr Caborn had apologised up front, that might have been enough, depending on what he said, but the fact is that, until I received a letter from him this morning, Mr Caborn did not accept that he had breached the code and had not apologised. In his letter today, Mr Caborn writes that the Committee has "given a new interpretation" of the rules and set a new precedent. I do not accept that, but in his letter he continues:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev45"><a name="10121539000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Your Committee have come to its conclusion which I accept and in respect to the House, apologise."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para173"><a name="10121539000113">I welcome this apology, although I am disappointed that it has come so late in the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para174"><a name="10121539000114">An apology was sought and has been given, but that still leaves the House with a decision to take on what sanction should apply. We could, as I said earlier, have recommended that Mr Caborn be summoned to the Bar of the House for a formal reprimand. That would have been humiliating for him, and I am not sure that it  <br>

would have been all that great for the House. The media would have loved it, and the pictures no doubt would have been broadcast around the world, but it would have been a bit like a public flogging, and we did not think that right or appropriate, so we did not go there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para175"><a name="10121539000115">Given that Mr Caborn is a former Member, the only real option that the House is left with is to take away his pass. He told us that losing his former Member's pass is just like being suspended from the service of the House. With respect, it is not. A serving Member who is suspended loses his or her pay and expenses for the period of suspension and is excluded from the precincts of Parliament. All that Mr Caborn will lose is his ability to enter the building without going through the visitors' entrance and his access to certain facilities, such as the Strangers Bar. He can still come here as a member of the public. Some might say that losing those privileges for a period of just six months is a very light punishment. Well, it is intended to be light, because we recognised that Mr Caborn did not intend to breach the rules or to bring the House or its Members generally into disrepute. In that respect, his case is different from the other two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para176"><a name="10121539000116">In the view of the Committee, its recommendations in respect of those three former Members are regrettable but necessary. They are also proportionate. Once the period of suspension of the former Members' privileged rights of access is over, and assuming an apology has been made, they will be free to re-apply for their passes. It is painful to have to take such action against former colleagues, but by agreeing to the Committee's proposals today, the House will send an important signal that it does not tolerate breaches of its rules.</p>

 The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron) has clearly set out the basis for the complaints, the commissioner's findings of fact and the Committee's recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para177"><a name="10121539000118">These debates are never easy. The House can take no pleasure in imposing sanctions on Members and former Members who have breached the code of conduct, but it is something that we must do if we are to have any hope of restoring and maintaining public faith in the House. For those former Members who have breached the code, the Committee recommends suspending their entitlement to a parliamentary photo pass for a period ranging from six months to five years. There are those outside this place who might argue that such a sanction is not tough enough. As the Committee has noted, however, the power of the House to discipline former Members once they have left this place is severely limited. In fact, the Committee is not aware of any disciplinary action having been taken against a former Member in modern times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para178"><a name="10121539000119">As these cases do not relate to the misuse of allowances, there is no money to repay and the removal of access is, in effect, the only sanction open to the House to impose. Such a sanction sends a clear message about the strength with which the House deprecates the breaches carried out in these cases. We should not lose sight of the damage that this episode has done to the reputations of the former Members who have breached the code, as they seek to establish new lives and new careers outside this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para179"><a name="10121539000120">As the right hon. Member for Rother Valley has said, I emphasise that three of the six former Members about whom complaints were made following the clandestine recordings by <i> T</i><i> he Sunday Times</i> and "Dispatches" were cleared of any breach of the code by the commissioner. The motion makes no reference to those Members, because no sanction is required in their cases, but it is important that the record shows that not every Member who is subject to media criticism has, in fact, breached the code of conduct for MPs, however unwise their actions may have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para180"><a name="10121539000121">In the course of these investigations, the commissioner identified three areas where he felt that the code of conduct should be reviewed. First, the paid advocacy rule prohibits a Member from being paid for participating in any proceeding or from lobbying Ministers or officials, if in doing so they would be seeking to confer an exclusive benefit on the organisation that is paying them. However, the commissioner is not confident that the rule as currently expressed has the effect of ruling out lobbying on behalf of a wider business sector of which the organisation paying the Member forms a part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para181"><a name="10121539000122">Secondly, the code of conduct does not apply to former Members, although it does apply to discussions Members have while serving in the House about what they might do after they leave. The commissioner is concerned about contacts between former Members and serving Members, Ministers and officials based on previous working relationships. An issue arose in the case of Mr Richard Caborn about the scope of the rules relating to contact with public officials. Although the rule itself refers to "Ministers and crown servants," the guidance refers to "public officials." That is another area the commissioner feels should be clarified. The Committee proposes that the rules regarding lobbying should be reviewed as soon as time permits. I understand that that will be a wide-ranging review conducted by the commissioner, who will report to the Committee. The Committee will, in turn, make a report to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para182"><a name="10121539000123">I remind the House of the measures that the Government have taken and will take to raise standards in public life. The coalition agreement sets out the Government's commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists. We intend to take as many views as possible of those who are interested through a broad consultation on the introduction of a statutory register of lobbyists, before publishing a draft Bill before the end of this Session. We will introduce legislation in the next parliamentary Session. When Ministers leave office, they will be prohibited from lobbying Government for a period of two years. They must also seek advice from the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about any proposed appointments or employment they wish to take up within two years of leaving office. The ministerial code is also clear that former Ministers must abide by the advice of the advisory committee. In conclusion, on behalf of the House, I thank the right hon.

investigating these matters. These were very difficult issues to get to grips with. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron) has said, they have arisen from the contact that former Members had with a fictitious company set up by journalists. It is worth noting that the commissioner obtained full certified transcripts of those meetings before making his report, and that he did not rely simply on the parts that had been broadcast or that had appeared in the media. I think we are all grateful for the thoroughness of the investigations that have been carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para183"><a name="10121539000125">It is important to put on the record the fact that the report is not concerned with whether former Members were unwise in their dealings, with whether they exaggerated their claims, or even with what they planned to do when they had left the House; it is concerned solely with whether they breached the rules while they were Members of this House. That is the only question before us. Indeed, in some cases the Committee found that Members who had been reported to the commissioner for investigation had not breached those rules, and they were exonerated through the investigation. In three cases, as we have heard, they upheld the complaints and have recommended that parliamentary passes be withdrawn for different periods.</p>

As the Deputy Leader of the House has said, this case raises some important issues. First, the rules need to be clarified. Members need clear rules that they can obey, in which case there is no dispute about whether they have been breached. Secondly, the definition of "a public official" needs to be the same as that in the rules, in the code and anywhere else that it is mentioned. Thirdly, there is the whole problem of what Members who are planning to leave the House may and may not do when they are planning their future careers. Again, clear guidelines are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para186"><a name="10121539000128">We also need to consider whether former Members should have a right of appeal. Any existing Member of this House who is subject to a report by the Standards and Privileges Committee can stand up in this Chamber and make their case; clearly, that is not possible for former Members. I welcome the fact that the Committee decided today to hear evidence from Richard Caborn, but that is something that we will perhaps need to consider formalising in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para187"><a name="10121539000129">I, too, hope that the House will support this motion, and I look forward to a proper debate on the issues that have arisen during the investigation of these cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para188"><a name="10121539000131">As the Deputy Leader of House has said, it is never easy for the House to discuss such matters. It is even less easy for someone to stand up and say that they do not agree with parts of a report such as this, because inevitably those comments will be picked up by whoever is out there and played against them. However, I feel absolutely obliged to do so in respect of the case of Richard Caborn. Richard Caborn is a person who gave 27 years of honourable service in this place. In the past few weeks, people from both sides of the House have told me that what he and other colleagues are going through is absolutely appalling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para189"><a name="10121539000132">What about the three former Members who were exonerated entirely? We must, as a House, look to see what they have been put through over the past few weeks and months by people outside this place. Perhaps, as the Chair intimated at the beginning of his address, we need to look at how people treat this place and how they portray it to the general populace, as that is not in the interests of the democratic process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para190"><a name="10121539000133">I turn to what the Chair of the Select Committee said in respect of Richard Caborn. The Committee's recommendation states:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev47"><a name="10121539000184"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Like the Commissioner, we accept that there is no evidence to suggest that any of these breaches were intentional. Mr Caborn did not bring the House or its Members generally into disrepute."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para191"><a name="10121539000134">As its Chair said, the Committee accepts in its conclusions that the rules and associated guidance need to be clarified and amended, and that the rules relating to lobbying must be reviewed as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para192"><a name="10121539000135">I conclude as I started by reminding the House of Richard Caborn's long years of honourable service in this place. He served at all levels of Government and served the House well-as did Sir John Butterfill, who was exonerated in this examination. Richard Caborn spent most of his working life in this place, serving the people of this country and the people of Sheffield, only to be admonished at the end of it by this place because of our lack of rules, the sting that was referred to by the Chair of the Select Committee, and that Committee's findings, which state that he brought neither the House nor Members into disrepute. The six-month suspension that he has been given is, frankly, disproportionate to his so-called crimes. It would have been enough to say that it was unsatisfactory that he did not make a full apology to this House at an earlier stage. If we are going into the business of bringing stings performed by people outside this place to the Floor of the House and of purging our own Members, something wrong is happening.</p>

 After many years of campaigning on water, sanitation and hygiene, I am grateful for this opportunity to debate the topic. Far too many people in the world lack safe clean water. Globally, just short of a billion people struggle without access to it. That is more than the population of Europe. In places such as Zambia, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Mozambique, I have seen personally that when clean water is not available there are minimal opportunities for good health, gaining an education, looking after crops or animals, or developing a business. If a major part of the day is taken up with walking many miles to collect water, there is no time for a child to get an education, and no time for a parent to earn a living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para195"><a name="10121539000140">Similarly, far too many people do not have decent sanitation or hygiene provision. The figures are frightening. Whereas the number of those who lack safe water is dreadful, 2.6 billion people go without access to decent sanitation. That is twice the population of China. Without decent sanitation or hygiene, the chances of a healthy life are minimal. Diarrhoea is the biggest child killer in Africa. On that continent alone, almost a million children aged under five died from diarrhoea in 2008. Worldwide, some 1.3 million infants die as a result of diarrhoea every year. Ninety per cent. of those diarrhoea cases are down to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water or poor hygiene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para196"><a name="10121539000141">It is clear to me that one of the most important ways in which we can help the poorest people in the world is by providing support in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, collectively referred to as WASH. Many of the other targets of our aid provision-education, agriculture, business development and health-need, as a starting point, people to have access to decent water, sanitation and hygiene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para197"><a name="10121539000142">I have seen at first hand the impact that help with those facilities can make. I have seen, for example, a health clinic in the bush in Ethiopia that was almost deserted because of the improvements in the health of local people following the installation of water pumps in local villages. In many other places I have seen the impact of the excellent work done by the UK-based charity WaterAid. I have even done a bit of well building for it in Zambia.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for introducing a debate on this important subject, on which I support him. I have to declare an interest: my father spent his entire professional career as a water engineer, building and maintaining water and sanitation projects both in the UK and in many countries abroad. Does the hon.

Within 24 hours nobody could use the fire engine, because its engine was designed to use a fuel that was not available in Zambia. I have seen video recorders provided by other countries with videotapes in a language that was not understood by the population. She is right: there is no point in installing a water pump without involving the villagers in learning how to maintain it and ensuring that they will be able to get parts for it. They can possibly even go further by making a small charge for the water from the pump, so that there can be paid attendants to ensure that it is well looked after and serviced, and the project is sustainable. I agree that involving local people is critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para198"><a name="10121539000145">As I said, I have seen some excellent work by WaterAid, but many other charities such as Tearfund and Pump Aid work in the field and deserve our praise. Given the importance of that aspect of the UK's aid work, I was pleased by the Government's promise in the coalition agreement, which stated:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev48"><a name="10121539000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">"A key aim of our aid is to make sure everyone gets access to the basics: clean water, sanitation, healthcare and education."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para199"><a name="10121539000146">Those words are encouraging, but delivering that aim will not be easy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para200"><a name="10121539000147">One of the United Nations millennium development goals is to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world's population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Sadly, that goal is not going to be met. According to a UN report this year, the number missing out on proper sanitation will actually grow to 2.7 billion by 2015, if current trends continue. Although the safe water target is on track globally, there are parts of the world where it will be missed by miles, not least in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is predicted that 350 million people will remain without access to safe water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para201"><a name="10121539000148">The UN report says:</p>
<a name="101215-0003.htm_brev49"><a name="10121539000186"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the safety of water supplies remains a challenge and urgently needs to be addressed."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para202"><a name="10121539000149">That warning becomes even more pressing in the context of climate change. The problem is not just hotter weather, causing more frequent droughts that in turn limit access to water. Climate change also disrupts weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and powerful floods. Flooding leads to overflowing latrines, contaminated drinking water, waterborne diseases such as cholera and all kinds of other sanitation problems. The problem is extremes of water shortage and water excess, and that problem will intensify as climate change continues to progress. That is part of the reason why we need to do even more.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and his Department, however, I wish to concentrate on what I believe the Department for International Development can do. In recent years water and sanitation have not been given the priority that I would wish them to have. As a proportion of the UK's aid budget, spending on water and sanitation has dwindled to just 2.2%, yet if I am right, and if water and sanitation are a vital plank in delivering all our aid goals, increasing the proportion of aid money dedicated to them would be money well spent. WaterAid made that argument powerfully in its recent submission to the Department-</p>

 The argument was well made by WaterAid, and I hope the Minister has had a chance to read its submission. It considers each of the millennium development goals in turn in the context of WASH.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para206"><a name="10121539000154">The first goal is to eradicate poverty. The World Health Organisation estimates that for every £1 invested in WASH, £8 is generated. That is because people save time on water collection, so they can be more productive, and WASH provision limits the number of days lost to illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para207"><a name="10121539000155">The second goal is universal primary education, but children who are busy fetching water do not have time to go to school. The education of young girls ends up suffering the most, as that task more often than not falls to them. Sanitation also has a role to play in education. Dedicated girls' toilets and menstrual hygiene facilities are important in making schools accessible for older girls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="101215-0003.htm_para208"><a name="10121539000156">DFID already knows that. It published a girls' education strategy in January 2005, which prioritised</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para0"><a name="10121539000157">There were two updates on implementing this strategy-the first in December 2006 and the second in July 2009-but when I asked the Library for further reports, I came away empty-handed. I therefore hope that the Minister can tell us what progress has been made in the year and a half since the second report was published, and that he confirms that the education of girls still an important part of his Department's programme-which brings me neatly to MDG 3, which is to promote gender equality and empowerment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para1"><a name="10121539000158">Seventy-two per cent. of water fetching is done by women and girls. The task takes up an average of 14 hours a week-I have seen it take very much longer-and distracts girls and women from education and other potentially productive activity, such as building their economic independence. That is a significant barrier to gender equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10121539000159">The fourth goal is to reduce child mortality rates. As I have already said, diarrhoea is the biggest child killer in Africa, and 90% of cases are caused by inadequate sanitation, unsafe water and poor hygiene. Poor water quality will always undermine our investment in health. We would be horrified if our own local clinics had only dirty water coming out of the taps, or if the only water available for swallowing medication was contaminated.</p>

WASH poverty causes the most significant health risks for women. A hygienic environment for childbirth and post-natal care will increase the survival chances of mothers and newborns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10121539000161">Finally, MDG 6 is to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases.

should be prioritised at the expense of all the others. Rather, I believe that prioritising WASH will increase our chances of delivering on both the UK's aid pledges and the MDGs. Until we fund WASH better, our investment in health and education will be less effective: the money will only ever achieve a part of what it could otherwise achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10121539000162">Some progress has been made. Spending on WASH has gone up slightly in recent times, and we recently became part of the Sanitation and Water for All international global partnership. I look forward to a progress report. However, that will not be enough without more UK investment, so I am calling for two things. First, by reordering or rebalancing priorities, the Department should increase the sum spent on water, sanitation and hygiene to £600 million per annum. That would lift 100 million people out of water, sanitation and hygiene poverty.</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="10121539000163"><a name="101215-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="10121539000233"><b>Fiona Bruce:</b>
 When Governments are looking to make a real difference, they invest in huge infrastructure projects. One of the challenges that they face in doing that-as opposed to what happens when charities invest smaller amounts in, say, village wells-is to ensure that the governance of those involved in partnering in those projects is sound. I would be interested in hearing the Minister's response to that point, but does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="10121539000164"><a name="101215-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="10121539000234"><b>Mr Foster:</b>
 I entirely agree. Indeed, with the work that I have seen, particularly in Africa, I have been incredibly impressed by the way in which the various charities involved work with local communities, empowering and involving them, before ultimately moving away and leaving those local community organisations to run by themselves what has been put in place. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10121539000165">The hon. Lady talks about large sums, and that is the crucial point that I am trying to make. We welcome the increase in the aid budget-I will mention that briefly in my summation-but I am talking about reprioritising that money. For example, we have just increased the amount of money used to tackle malaria by £500 million. That may seem like an enormous sum going to do something important, but we know that diarrhoea causes more deaths than malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined, and as I said earlier, 90% of cases are caused by poor water, sanitation and hygiene. Therefore, the £600 million that I am arguing for to lift 100 million people out of that situation would be money well spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10121539000166">Secondly, water, sanitation and hygiene issues need to be mainstreamed into our wider development, public health and poverty reduction efforts. Again, that will require a big shift in thinking. We are still trying to break down the divide between sanitation and water, which is hard enough. For instance, DFID's business plan promises that regular reports will be published on the number of sanitary facilities built or upgraded with DFID funding. Those extra data will no doubt be useful, but that promise indicates something of a silo mentality. We should not be thinking in terms of either water or sanitation. That is why I am asking for enough money to bring those things together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10121539000167">However, I also think that we should go further.

water and sanitation should be properly linked to colleagues working on health or poverty reduction. We should be breaking down the sectoral divides that still exist in the aid world. In all, we need a truly integrated approach-for instance, by ensuring that new schools are always built with suitable hygiene and sanitation facilities; or, as the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) suggested, by recognising the importance of transparency and accountability when a Government make decisions about major capital projects and services, such as their water systems. All that depends on facilitating and encouraging better co-operation between those in different sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10121539000168">All of us in this House should be proud of the way in which our country contributes directly, and through international organisations, to help alleviate poverty and ill health in some of the poorest countries in the world. We should be proud of our commitment to increase further the money spent on aid. However, we need to ensure that we get the best possible value for that money. We need to ensure that the way in which it is spent provides the best possible route towards the reduction of poverty and ill health. That can best be done by rebalancing our aid budget in favour of water, sanitation and hygiene. A modest change in that area would reap huge rewards. I hope that my right hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr Foster) for raising this topic. Achieving the millennium development goals, including the two vital targets on clean water and improved sanitation, is at the very heart of the coalition's agenda on international development. I recognise and respect his interest in water and sanitation, and in particular his high regard for WaterAid, which we, too, consider a valued partner in our work.</p>

In Hoa Binh province in Vietnam, I have seen how these simple interventions can make a remarkable difference to people's health and opportunities. One local woman showed me the new latrine in her garden that had vastly improved her life, and told me that she had pinned up a hygiene advice sheet in her house to educate her whole family. I have also inspected at close quarters some latrines-of variable quality, I have to say-in rural Bangladesh. Indeed, I am proud to say that I am fast becoming something of a ministerial latrine expert. I commend to the House the UNICEF booklet entitled "Low-cost latrine options", which contains an encyclopaedic list of various designs, including the Blair pit latrine. Known as a VIP latrine, it is a ventilated, improved pit, designed and used, as it happens, in Zimbabwe.</p>

This also places a serious responsibility on us to use the money well, and water, sanitation and hygiene fit squarely within that agenda. Each pound of taxpayers' money in this area can bring direct, tangible benefits for poor people. As many will know, we are currently reviewing all our bilateral and multilateral aid. I cannot therefore make any detailed announcements on numbers today, but we have a high  <br>

level of ambition in this area and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already stated in the House that we know we will support tens of millions of people in gaining access to sanitation over the next four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10121541000006">Today I can outline seven principles of how we, the British Government, will respond to this global crisis. First, we will ensure excellence in our Department for International Development country office programming. A vital part of our efforts will be through our bilateral programmes. Our current programmes in Bangladesh will affect up to 30 million people by 2011. Our current programmes in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria will provide up to 17 million people with access. We will also be making new commitments under the bilateral aid review. We will of course ensure that there are sufficient and qualified staff in DFID country offices to deliver our programmes. There will be close co-ordination with our climate change work, including work on water management, and we will continue to ensure an excellent humanitarian response, dealing with issues of water storage, water supply, health care in emergencies and cholera pandemics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10121541000007">Secondly, we will link our work on water, sanitation and hygiene especially closely with our work on health. We cannot achieve other key millennium development goal targets in the absence of action on something as fundamental as basic water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion. Recent articles in the Public Library of Science medical journal, launched last month by the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr O'Brien), conclude that 2.4 million deaths each year could be prevented if people had adequate access to hygiene, sanitation and drinking water. They emphasised, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Bath, that diarrhoea is the biggest killer of children in Africa, with about 4,000 under-5s dying every single day. Yet simply washing hands with soap can reduce the risk of diarrhoeal diseases by 42% to 47%.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10121541000008">This issue was once much closer to home. It was John Snow who, in London in 1854, first traced a cholera outbreak to a contaminated water source in Broad street in Soho. This very institution of Parliament was brought to a standstill in 1858 by the "great stink" of inadequate sanitation. In 1862, Florence Nightingale, through her meticulous statistical analysis, showed that high death rates in the British Army in India were actually due to poor water, sanitation and hygiene. Today, globally, we must follow in the great British tradition of investing strongly in water, sanitation and hygiene to deliver the health gains that we need. Clearly, as diarrhoea is today the main killer of children in Africa, we cannot achieve the MDG on child mortality without that, and the evidence shows it will also play a major role in improved nutritional status, as well as reductions in pneumonia, maternal and neonatal infections and preventable blindness. So we will complement and co-ordinate our direct actions on health, and our sizeable new commitments on malaria, reproductive and maternal health, with substantial and closely linked actions on water, sanitation and hygiene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10121541000009">Thirdly, we will increase our focus on gender and disability. Currently in the developing world, too much time is wasted, day in and day out, collecting water.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Dec 2010">

<notus-date day="15" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>15 Dec 2010 : Column 1018</b><br>
That time could be spent in other productive, caring or educational activities. Women lose out most, as they are twice as likely to fetch water and they also face indignity, and often the risk of violence, because of a lack of sanitation facilities. Clean toilets in schools can contribute to keeping girls in school, and that alone is a reason to take action. Standard designs for water and sanitation may be inaccessible for people with disabilities, but simple modifications can solve that. They can reduce stigma and the burden of care, and increase dignity and social integration. So we will support innovation and scaling up of what works, to benefit women, girls and people with disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para16"><a name="10121541000010">I have already alluded to the fourth principle: ensuring cost-effectiveness and value for money. Water, sanitation and hygiene are among the most cost-effective health interventions, according to the World Bank and the World Health Organisation. Hygiene promotion comes out as just $5 per disability-adjusted life year, known as DALY, averted-a measure of the impact of the intervention on reducing sickness and death. Sanitation promotion is also within the top 10 interventions, at $10 per DALY. We will work to ensure that whether we are working through multilateral, non-government or government partners, we further improve the value for money we are achieving with UK taxpayers' money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para17"><a name="10121541000011">Fifthly, we will directly empower communities and help them to hold their Governments to account. The community-led sanitation programmes which the UK and others have supported, first in Bangladesh and now spreading rapidly in Asia and Africa, have shown the powerful influence of shared action. Once communities start to work together on ensuring latrines and hand-washing for all, not just the few, experience shows that they go on to work together in addressing other problems. Natural community leaders emerge and they gain confidence to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para18"><a name="10121541000012">We have also been supporting citizens to hold their own Governments to account. We fund a global network of southern civil society organisations, the Freshwater Action Network, in south Asia and Africa. Local groups, for example, are carrying out citizen audits to investigate whether there are latrines in schools and presenting the findings to their local Governments. Lessons on what works are being shared via the global network. The network is also taking part in regional intergovernmental conferences, bringing the views of poor people who are demanding water and sanitation directly to the decision makers, and we will continue to support and develop such innovative and empowering approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para19"><a name="10121541000013">The sixth principle is that we will build further evidence and test innovative approaches. We will keep building evidence regarding both the cost-effectiveness of our interventions and what really works at scale. The British Government are funding the largest research programme in the world on sanitation and hygiene in the developing countries-the SHARE consortium-bringing together leading researchers and practitioners. We are supporting a major trial in Zimbabwe, examining the link between sanitation and nutrition. Not having latrines and not washing hands can cause intestinal infections and long-term malabsorption of nutrients, and so damage the long-term growth and development of children. This research is potentially vital to achieving global targets on nutrition. We will also investigate how we can use the entrepreneurship of the local private sector for providing and maintaining  <br>

water supplies. The results from these will not just inform our programming but that of other donors too and, most importantly, the investments and policies of developing countries themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para20"><a name="10121541000014">Finally, we will work with others in the sector to ensure a collective response to this global crisis. We know it is possible to achieve results at scale: 1.3 billion people have gained access to sanitation since 1990, but particularly in Africa our collective efforts and resources have still not been enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para21"><a name="10121541000015">The sanitation MDG target is likely to be missed by 1 billion people, and Africa is off-track for both water and sanitation. The UK is already the largest donor to basic water and sanitation systems in low-income countries. These simple systems reach people in rural and peri-urban areas where there are the lowest levels of coverage, and so are targeted well to the poorest people. Globally however, aid to basic systems has declined from 27% to just 16% of aid in the sector over the last five years, and only 42% of the sector's aid goes to low-income countries. I am pleased that DFID supports an annual report, known as the GLAAS report and produced by UN-Water and the World Health Organisation, giving a global picture of how aid to water and sanitation is allocated. That will help us to hold each other to account, and assist better targeting in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para22"><a name="10121541000016">We must be realistic. We alone cannot solve all the problems. We also need others to play their part in focusing aid resources on the people who need them most, and this is not just about aid. Developing country Governments have the leading role to play in ensuring action on water and sanitation, backing it with their own policies, programmes and resources. In this way, donors can support countries to achieve their own targets in the way that they want.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="15" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>15 Dec 2010 : Column 1020</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para23"><a name="10121541000017">Sometimes, however, there is not the political will or capacity to develop credible investment plans. We will therefore work closely with all our partners in the sector to solve this global crisis together, including through the UK leadership role in the sanitation and water for all initiative, where we are at the forefront of helping to address some of these wider issues. This global partnership of 31 developing countries, six donor countries, nine multilaterals and development banks and countless southern and northern civil society networks has come together with the common goal of ensuring both results on the ground and accountability in respect of them. The sanitation and water for all initiative has already achieved changes that should lead to improved results in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Senegal and other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para24"><a name="10121541000018">We will find new ways to work jointly with other donors. Specifically, we are looking for ways to enable fragile states, and those that are most off-track on the targets, to develop the capacity and plans to ensure access to water, sanitation and hygiene. It is imperative that we find ways for these countries to attract and use the finance for achieving results at scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="101215-0004.htm_para25"><a name="10121541000019">The British Government know how important this agenda is, and we have a clear picture of the needs. We are ready to play our role in a global effort, complementing our leading role on health. In the coming weeks, we will finalise our commitments across the board and our policy support to this vital area. I can already confirm, however, that the Government have great ambition in water, sanitation and hygiene, and that that will continue to be an important part of DFID's business.</p>
