delivering a range of recording, training, rehearsal and performing
opportunities, while giving local people access to internationally
recognised musicians. Despite making cutbacks, including redundancies,
it is forecast that, by the end of the year, The Studio will run out of
money, although it requires only an additional &#163;20,000 per annum

Hartlepool local authority is looking at that issue very closely. It
was keen to ensure that the services offered met its strategic
priorities for the coming period, as it is an important funder. I hope
that we can achieve that, and the Arts Council advises that it is keen
to look into how arts provision is met at The Studio. It is important
that the local authority and the Arts Council can work together on that
over the coming months. I will keep a close eye on the matter but, as
my hon. Friend knows, there is an arm&#146;s length relationship

What would the Minister say to Steve Dickinson, the

anybody else, but we do have licensing provisions. It is clear that
small venues have been able to apply for licensing, and that music is
going on. We set up, and specifically tasked, the Live Music Forum,
which has representatives from the unions and the industry, to look
closely at the issue. It will report to us in the autumn so that we can

If everything is so rosy in the field of live music,
why do the results of a recent survey by the Musicians Union reveal
that there has been a marked drop in live music in smaller venues,
particularly those previously benefiting from the two-in-a-bar rule? If
Ministers think that the Licensing Act 2003 is encouraging live music,
why are they issuing new guidelines to local authorities? It is not the
local authorities&#146; fault; no, it was the Government who passed
the inadequate Licensing Act, and the Government who wrote the
guidelines, and arrogant and incompetent Ministers who are only now
waking up to the situation that we and thousands of musicians predicted

years.</p><p><a name="06070310000051">There is no
dedicated funding stream for sports villages, but between 2001 and

be a good geographical spread across the country, but I can think of
nowhere better for one than in Chorley, because we are a former new

Friend had a chance to talk to the Secretary of State for Education and
Skills? We have hundreds and hundreds of specialist computer and
technology schools, and one of the cheapest ways in which we could
carry out the switchover would be to charge those schools with the task
of being the local hub for switchover&#151;to go into old
people&#146;s homes, to liaise and so on. That would save us millions
of pounds and generate great community spirit in those
centres.</p><p><a name="06070310000060"><b><a name="06070310000475">Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that

with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, but I will, of
course, now initiate discussions with Education Ministers and
officials. We are actively engaged in discussions with charities and
public bodies, particularly those that represent older people and those
who are disabled, because we believe that those are the individuals who
will face the greatest difficulties in the switchover. We are
absolutely confident that we have a very good plan in place, but we

present a particular problem, of which the hon. Gentleman has made
particular efforts to make the House and departmental officials aware.
There are especial problems associated with MDUs and we must adopt a
sophisticated approach to them. We are in active discussion with all
the relevant bodies and we believe that we are on course 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 501</b><br>to solve most of the problems. I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is

Don Foster (Bath) (LD):</b> The Government already recognise
rightly the impact of energy costs on the households of older people.
Is the Minister aware that only today the Energy Savings Trust produced
a report that showed that the additional energy costs of digital
set-top boxes could add &#163;30 a year to household budgets for
older people, and an even greater cost with certain new digital
television sets? Will the Minister agree to work with manufacturers to
find ways of reducing those costs, not least by putting off buttons on
digital set-top boxes, and also to ensure that there is energy-use
labelling on new equipment, along the lines of that provided on white
goods?</p><p><a name="06070310000064"><b><a name="06070310000479">Mr.

Yes, we are aware of the report. Yes, we are in discussion with
manufacturers about it and yes, it is our intention, when switchover
takes place, for special codes to be introduced. It is not a problem
that applies only to digital switchover; it applies to all digital
equipment&#151;mobile phone recharger units and just about everything
in the house that uses the digital system. The Government are aware of

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa
Jowell):</b> There have been two sets of
relevant pilot schemes. The first of those examined the process of
switchover in Llansteffan and Ferryside, and the second considered the
needs of vulnerable groups in Bolton. Both pilots provided valuable
real-time information. Above all, they confirmed people&#146;s
enthusiasm, and that, with support, digital television is popular. We
will, of course, take those specific lessons into account in future
planning. The results of both pilot studies are available in the
Libraries of both Houses.</p><p><a name="06070310000067"><b><a name="06070310000482">Mr.
Mackay:</b> Is not the Secretary of State concerned that there
is a lack of public awareness and that there are still people buying
analogue televisions? Is there not much more that the right hon.
Lady&#146;s Department needs to do so that when switchover takes
place in18 months&#146; time it is not another Government
failure?</p><p><a name="06070310000068"><b><a name="06070310000483">Tessa
Jowell:</b> There have been many Government
successes. The process of digital switchover, commended by the Select
Committee as a bold step and a bold decision, will be one of them. The
right hon. Gentleman is right that people need to be properly informed,
because, then, their apprehension about switchover&#151;apprehension
that tends to be higher among elderly and isolated people&#151;falls.
There is encouraging information from Digital UK. A &#163;200 million
public information campaign is now under way and in May, the first
month of that 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 502</b><br>campaign, the awareness in the borders&#151;the right hon. Gentleman
knows that that will be the first region to switch over&#151;rose
from 39 to 57 per cent. In Wales, awareness across the country rose
from 3 to 22 per cent., as a result of targeted promotion and
information. We will ensure that that is available consistently in the
years up to
switchover.</p><p><a name="06070310000069"><b><a name="06070310000484">Hywel
Williams (Caernarfon) (PC):</b> The Llansteffan pilot was a
notable success. I am sure that the Secretary of State welcomes the
fact that there is a significantly greater take up of digital
television in Wales than elsewhere. Does the right hon. Lady agree that
the real challenge for future policies is to ensure that all people in
Wales have access to television that is produced in Wales for them? At
present, 2 to 3 per cent. of people are unable to see Welsh
television.</p><p><a name="06070310000070"><b><a name="06070310000485">Tessa
Jowell:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The
key answer is the maintenance of platform choice. For example, in the
case of the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay), only 9 per
cent. of his constituents can get a decent signal through digital
terrestrial television, and so they rely on satellite. There are other
parts of the country, however, where satellite may be a more difficult
option. The maintenance of platform choice is one of the ways in which
the constituents of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)
will receive the service to which I believe many of them will be
looking forward. </p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070310000022">Gambling

royal parks has slipped by more than 20 per cent. since 1993? Will he
further tell us why he is allowing these fragile environmental fabrics

Gentleman&#146;s tastes may well not be the same as those of
Londoners and much of the country, but the Prince&#146;s Trust
concert and the success of Live8 indicate that the Royal Parks Agency
has been very successful at some of the events that it has put on.
However, he is right that there is a balance to be struck between those
events and the more reflective enjoyment of those in the parks. That is
why this year there have been fewer events in Hyde park. We keep those
things under review, working with the Royal Parks Agency and, as I
said, I shall be meeting the chief executive shortly.</p><p><a name="06070310000084">As to the money, the hon.

people&#151;visitors to London, those who work in the city and
tourists&#151;make intensive use of the royal parks such as Hyde
park, Richmond park,St. James&#146;s park and so on. Would
the Minister care to pay tribute to the work of the Royal Parks
constabulary, which is responsible for the safety, enjoyment and
relaxation of those many people in the parks, and will he lay to rest
the rumour that it may fall victim to the merger mania of forces and be
absorbed by the Metropolitan police? That would be a dreadful step,
would it not?</p><p><a name="06070310000087"><b><a name="06070310000499">Mr.

constabulary. Two of our parks have been awarded the green flag for
2005, and five are being put forward for a green flag for this year. A
key criterion of that is that people who enter the parks feel safe, and
that is largely down to the work of the constabulary. We ought to
remember when thinking and talking about these issues that on Friday in

aware of that fact.</p><p><a name="06070310000089">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex(Mr. Soames) rightly
pointed out, our royal parks should be an oasis of calm and quiet

that in summer 2012 they should become one huge campsite to house those
in London for the Olympic games, as suggested by the Under-Secretary of
State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member forSt.
Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), is barmy. It is also in direct breach of
the assurances given by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in
this House in a debate initiated by me on 24 May 2004. Moneys can be
raised to preserve the royal parks by other means, as my hon. Friend
the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) will point out&#151;he was
acting as an auctioneer at one such event last week. Will the Minister
assure us that he will keep the Treasury at bay and his

an agency of the Government. The idea that the Government could keep
their hands off is ridiculous given that we are funding it to the tune
of &#163;25.6 million. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s tastes may not be
the tastes of ordinary Londoners, but the Royal Parks always consults
on its strategy for events, as he would expect, and it is right that we
support it on the events taking place this year and in coming

constituencies of many hon. Members have benefited. Funding for the
royal parks is increasing this year to &#163;26.1 million. The hon.
Gentleman knows that we are in the middle of the spending review, and
it is right and proper that we consider the PAC&#146;s comment that
there is &#147;untapped potential&#148; to raise even more revenue
from our parks. That is the position, and it is one that the Government
have maintained for many

will have the opportunity to examine the NAO&#146;s performance on
the House&#146;s behalf when it meets to consider the NAO&#146;s
corporate plan
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="06070310000131"><b><a name="06070310000539">Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I congratulate the NAO on last week&#146;s
report into the failure that is the Child Support Agency. Is it not an
absolute scandal that it costs the CSA 70p to collect each &#163;1 of
child support, and that 60 per cent. of outstanding child support
payments totalling &#163;3.5 billion are deemed
uncollectable?</p><p><a name="06070310000132"><b><a name="06070310000540">Mr.
Williams:</b> That is really a matter for the Public Accounts
Committee, rather than the Public Accounts Commission, but one is bound
to feel that what we have read about is the latest in a series of
disastrous performances by the CSA, which reflect what I suspect is the
unpleasant experience of too many of our constituents. Our first
inquiry, which was conducted a long time ago, discovered
that&#151;unbelievably&#151;the CSA was set up with just one
quarter of the staff that it required. Ever since then, it has never
recovered.</p><p><a name="06070310000133"><b><a name="06070310000541">Mr.
Bone:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the
National Audit Office is saving this country a lot of money and is he
concerned that its expansion is being resisted by the Executive,
because they are worried that it would expose their incompetence and
weaknesses?</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 512</b><br><p><a name="06070310000134"><b><a name="06070310000542">Mr.
Williams:</b> On the latter point, I do not know what the
Executive&#146;s aspirations might be, but if there is any such
aspiration, it is having no effect. The Public Accounts
Commission&#146;s role is to ensure that the NAO has the money that
it requires and, so far, there has been no serious attempt by the
Treasury to curtail the grants that we were considering making to the
NAO. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. Furthermore,
because it has been so successful, we asked the NAO to consider
whether, instead of achieving an &#163;8:&#163;1 rate of return for
the taxpayer, it could do better. To our surprise, the NAO has said
that in 2007 it hopes to increase that ratio from the present &#163;8
to &#163;9 for every &#163;1 that it
costs.</p><p><a name="06070310000135"><b><a name="06070310000543">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Does the
Chairman of the Public Accounts Commission agree that, if the NAO is to
maintain and preserve its reputation for professionalism and
independence, it would do well to resist the well-known pressure from
Government for it to soft pedal its criticism of private finance
initiative projects? He speaks of the savings that the NAO has
achieved. If he were to press the Government to abandon PFI, which is
prohibitive in cost, flawed in concept and intolerable in consequences
for taxpayers, citizens and public sector workers, the savings would be
vastly greater than the sum that he
quoted.</p><p><a name="06070310000136"><b><a name="06070310000544">Mr.
Williams:</b> Again, that is a matter for the Public Accounts
Committee. If the Government have been trying get the National Audit
Office to curb criticism of PFI, they have been singularly
unsuccessful, and they certainly have not managed to limit the
activities of the Public Accounts Committee, on which I
sit.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070310000010">Church

not built up a sufficient pension fund to give them the income that
they need to live off. When they retire, they also have to buy a
property. I know they get a mortgage at 0 per cent. interest, but if
they have a low pension to start with and have to pay a mortgage, it
leaves those who have come late to the service at a great disadvantage.

investment policy which is appropriate for the Church. In my time as a

spiritual centres of worship, but as community centres where people
gather for live music, as we discussed in the Chamber earlier, and
where other non-religious community groups meet in cathedrals. Is it
not time that the Government recognised the wider role that our

often involves VAT on building works and grants that are available to
cathedrals for work. He cannot operate in isolation on these matters.

ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on
the position of British forces in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06070310000166"><b><a name="06070310000572">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> Before I answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, I am sure that the whole House will join me in offering our
condolences to the families of Corporal Thorpe and Lance Corporal
Hashmi, the two soldiers killed on Saturday in Helmand province along
with their interpreter. I have no doubt either that I speak for the
House in wishing a speedy recovery to the five soldiers injured in the
same attack. Our thoughts and prayers are with them
all.</p><p><a name="06070310000167">I should also
explain that, given the time when you decided to take the urgent
question, Mr. Speaker, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has
been unable to return to the House in time from his constituency. I
apologise on his behalf.</p><p><a name="06070310000168">The losses of
life that our forces have suffered over the past few weeks are a
tragedy. However, they do not mean that our mission in Afghanistan is
somehow confused. The position of our armed forces in Afghanistan is
clear. First and foremost, our troops are in Afghanistan to ensure that
never again is it is a safe haven for the likes of al-Qaeda and the
Taliban. Quite simply, the risks are too great to us, our allies, and
the Afghan people for us to stand aside and allow the terrorists to
return. That overriding aim was clear when my right hon. Friend the
Home Secretary announced our deployment to Helmand last January, and it
is clear today.</p><p><a name="06070310000170">Our
forces are our contribution to the expansion of the UN-authorised and
NATO-led international security assistance force&#151;ISAF. It is not
only a British mission. Danish and Estonian troops are embedded into
our forces in Helmand. Overall, 36 nations provide troops for ISAF.
They, too, have had their casualties. A Romanian soldier was killed
last month and Canadian and US troops have also died.</p><p><a name="06070310000171">Our troops are there to help
foster the environment in which the Afghans, with the support of the
wider international community, can develop sustainable governing
institutions and spread the authority of central Government across the
country. They are there to help build up the Afghan security forces.
They are there to help set the conditions for developing the Afghan
economy and infrastructure. That means that we also help put in place
the sort of environment in which the Afghans, again with international
support, can make an impact on the narcotics trade.</p><p><a name="06070310000172">Yes, our
armed forces have been in action against the Taliban. That was only to
be expected. That was why we sent an air-mobile battlegroup, artillery
and Apache attack helicopters. Let me be candid. We would not have
deployed such a formidable package if we did not think that there was a
genuine threat to the safety of our armed forces. It was not pulled
together on a whim. We did not pick and choose. We sent what the top
military advice in the country&#151;the chiefs of staff&#151;said
that we 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 518</b><br>should send. So I want to make it absolutely plain that there has never
been a sense that our aims and objectives were
unfocused.</p><p><a name="06070310000173">Of course,
as with any operation, we keep our forces under review. The House will
know that we regularly announce force changes for Iraq, as various
formations are deployed in and out of that theatre. Afghanistan is no
different, and we are working through such a process now. The hon.
Gentleman will know that it is the intention of my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State to make an announcement on the roulement of 16
Air Assault Brigade before the recess, but he will not do so until he
has received the advice of the chiefs of staff on the precise details
of the roulement. That will form part of a much wider NATO process that
will be under way in
July.</p><p><a name="06070310000174">The House will
understand that I cannot go into more detail now. However, right hon.
and hon. Members can be assured that, despite press reports today,
commanders have not asked for extra infantry or air cover. We do not go
into matters such as these in detail, for reasons that the House will
understand, but I can go as far as to say that the latest requests to
the chiefs of staff, which are part of the planned ongoing analysis,
include requests for enablers and engineering equipment. I want to make
it clear that these requests were expected from the outset and that we
expect more requests from theatre as the campaign continues. If they
include &#147;combat&#148; elements, we will consider them
seriously and immediately, as we always
do.</p><p><a name="06070310000175">I must stress,
however, that we are only at the start of our three-year operation. Our
forces in Helmand only reached their full operating capability this
weekend, and there is still much to do. We all know that the
democratically elected Afghan Government have had little sway in
Helmand. It is inevitable that the earliest stages of such an operation
will focus heavily on helping the Afghans to create security and
stability. Only then can our wider aid and development programmes go
forward unimpeded. They have already begun, and once they are fully
under way, they will in turn reinforce security and stability as
Helmand&#146;s legitimate economy grows and the rule of law expands,
and as we curb the influence of the Taliban and the drugs
traffickers.</p><p><a name="06070310000176">I shall
say one final thing. We are committed to the success of the wider
international project to help to rebuild Afghanistan, and we can best
do that by making a real contribution&#151;political, developmental
and military&#151;to the stabilisation of Helmand. Our armed forces
are doing a magnificent job in making that happen, and they should
continue to receive the full support of all of us in the
House.</p><p><a name="06070310000177"><b><a name="06070310000573">Dr.
Fox:</b> You will be aware, Mr. Speaker, that there has been
much speculation over the weekend about the unease of British
commanders in Afghanistan regarding their ability to carry out the
mission defined by the Government. I believe that it is absolutely
vital that we succeed in Afghanistan for three reasons. First, failure
would be a catastrophic blow to the cohesion and reputation of NATO,
and it would embolden our enemies rather than weakening them. Secondly,
it would provide a victory for the forces of terror which oppose not
only our troops on the ground but our entire value system and way of
life, and give them 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 519</b><br>encouragement to further their campaign of terror here at home. Thirdly,
such a failure would betray the ordinary people of Afghanistan, to whom
we have promised so much.</p><p><a name="06070310000178">The Government have two basic
duties: to maximise our chance of success in the mission and to
minimise the risk to our troops. We intend to hold the Government to
account in that regard, as is our duty in a parliamentary democracy. I
must add that the tone in which the House conducts this process is also
extremely important, because those who wish us harm will be listening
intently for any sign of weakening in our resolve.</p><p><a name="06070310000179">The Government&#146;s
presentation of the likely path of events in Afghanistan has been at
the most optimistic end of the spectrum from the outset. The belief
that the anti-terrorist operation, Operation Enduring Freedom, and the
NATO reconstruction mission carried out by ISAF could in practice be
separated for long has always been naive at best. Those who defend and
promote the forces of terrorism, and who attack our troops or deny us
the territory that we need to provide a stable future for the people of
Afghanistan, are our enemies. The Government must therefore give our
commanders on the ground everything that they need to carry out their
mission successfully.</p><p><a name="06070310000180">If our military chiefs have
asked for more equipment and personnel, when did they start to do so?
What specific plans do the Government have to increase the number of
fixed-wing aircraft available to our troops in Afghanistan? What will
they do to improve the helicopter capacity currently compromised by
lack of numbers and difficulty operating in the severe heat? What do
the Government intend to do about increasing the proportion of infantry
in relation to support troops? What approaches have been made by the
Prime Minister and his Ministers to their NATO and EU counterparts
about ensuring that all countries pull their weight in this combined
NATO struggle? What representations have they made about the
appointment of an international co-ordinator to ensure that the funds
for reconstruction are not squandered, which is an issue that my right
hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary has championed?</p><p><a name="06070310000181">I accept that winning the
battle against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and
reconstructing that country may require a long deployment and
significantly higher numbers of troops and equipment. I doubt very much
that it is likely to be, as the Minister said, a three-year operation.
I say to those on both sides of the House who have reservations about
our involvement in Afghanistan&#151;I know that there are
some&#151;that the costs of succeeding in Afghanistan may be very
high, but the cost of failure would be
intolerable.</p><p><a name="06070310000182"><b><a name="06070310000574">Mr.
Watson:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
support. His three points about NATO, terrorists and ordinary Afghans
were well made.</p><p><a name="06070310000183">On
the point about the request for specific military hardware, the hon.
Gentleman will understand that I cannot comment on that publicly yet,
except to say that when our commanders ask our chiefs of staff for 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 520</b><br>equipment, if those requests are put to Ministers, we will consider them
in the usual way. I said in my statement that if such requests were for
combat equipment, we would consider them seriously and
immediately.</p><p><a name="06070310000184">On the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about countries pulling their weight
within NATO, of course, it is important in an alliance with 34
countries that all countries contribute their fair share. I will make
sure that his points resonate in the appropriate corridors.</p><p><a name="06070310000185">On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about a three-year operation, of course, the Afghanistan of 2009
will still need different agencies of the UK, but our key goal is to
build a security capacity for the Afghan Government where it does not
exist now. My comments about some of the requests from theatre allude
to the need to do that capacity building in the short and medium term.
If he has any other fears, he should contact us about those. There has
been some misinformed or ill-informed speculation in the press, and I
am grateful that he has given me the opportunity to rebut some of the
comments made at the weekend.</p><p><a name="06070310000186"><b><a name="06070310000575">Mr.
Tom Harris (Glasgow, South) (Lab):</b> May I remind my hon.
Friend that many Members of the House are justly proud of the role that
British troops played in 2001 in removing an oppressive and fascistic
Government? Will he reassure the House, however, that our troops are
properly resourced for their continuing campaign against
Afghanistan&#146;s poppy trade, whose product causes untold misery in
my constituency and the constituencies of almost every other Member of

to the point that we are in Afghanistan to make sure that it never
again has the terrorist training capacity that created such a threat to
the world a few years ago. The activity of poppy growers is one of the
reasons why Afghanistan is such an unstable narco-state. As we try to
create a secure economy in some of Afghanistan&#146;s provinces, it
is important to wean people off the poppy economy. Doing that too early
and too soon, however, could create insecurity. We need triangulation
between civic buy-in from ordinary Afghans on the ground, our
military&#146;s role and the way in which poppy traders are dealt
with. However, his point is well
made.</p><p><a name="06070310000188"><b><a name="06070310000577">Mr.

First, will the Minister expand on how much clarity there is in the
NATO mission, and what proportion of time our troops spend on force
protection? Secondly, will he comment on how forces can achieve
security objectives with counter-narcotics work, given the connections
of insurgents, warlords and indeed Government officials with the drugs
trade? Finally, will he comment on the declining security situation? In
2005, 1,600 people were killed by fighting in Afghanistan. So far, more
than 1,100 have been killed this year, and there are increasing
incidences of kidnappings and roadside and suicide bombings. Does the
Minister share my concern and that of many other Members that the
tactics used in Afghanistan increasingly resemble those being used in
Iraq?</p><p><a name="06070310000192"><b><a name="06070310000578">Mr.
Watson:</b> Counter-narcotics work is vital to our efforts to
promote long-term stability and security in Afghanistan. The drugs
trade feeds on and contributes to insecurity in Afghanistan and the
surrounding region. However, it is important for our troops to build a
security capacity so that the Afghans themselves can fight the drugs
traffickers. That will be our key goal over the next three
years.</p><p><a name="06070310000193">The hon.

co-operation with Pakistan, which works with us in the fight against

Flynn (Newport, West) (Lab):</b> After five years of attempts
to destroy the poppy trade, this year&#146;s harvest will be the
highest ever and the price of heroin on the streets of Britain will be
the lowest ever. The last Secretary of State for Defence said that the
Helmand venture would end in three years without a shot being fired.
What we are now seeing in the formerly peaceful area of Helmand is
bitter resentment, not among the Taliban but among the ordinary people:
murderous resentment of our troops. If we are sucked into a war in
Afghanistan, it could deteriorate into a British Vietnam and provoke
Afghani terrorism on the streets of Britain. When will we explain to
our American friends and to our Government that it is not possible to
win hearts and minds by using bombs and
bullets?</p><p><a name="06070310000196"><b><a name="06070310000580">Mr.

about winning hearts and minds is not lost on our forces on the ground.
They understand that the way in which to deal with a narcotics
economy&#151;and in some areas of Helmand, the only economy is based
on narcotics&#151;is to build a security capacity in which the
Afghans themselves can deal with the narcotics trade, and also to
construct long-term development plans so that the economy of Helmand,
apart from the drugs trade, can grow.</p><p><a name="06070310000198">I do not recognise my hon.

Will the Minister, so far as current policy is concerned, not only
ensure that British capability is enhanced, but resist pressure from
the Pentagon to use the presence of ISAF in the south as an excuse to

When the former Secretary of State for Defence, now Home Secretary,
made the original statement about deployment, many of us warned him
that the capacity of the force is driven by the definition of the
mission, and that this mission was ill-defined from the word go. I am
supportive of what our forces are trying to do, but I have always
felt&#151;and now feel even more strongly&#151;that until we look
again at the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 524</b><br>mission and decide that it does not cover the reality on the ground, and
try to see it through the eyes of the Taliban, we will continue to
underperform in the sense of not giving our forces the right equipment
and support. If the Minister does not wish to be accused of
complacency, he should do two things. First, he should not wait for the
Chiefs of Staff to come to him, but go to them and demand to know what
the forces need to deliver the mission. Secondly, he should then give
it to them.</p><p><a name="06070310000213"><b><a name="06070310000594">Mr.

makes an important point. I reread the debate in January when my right
hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced our deployment. He said that
the mission was clear and that there could be no security and stability
if insurgents, illegal armed groups and the drugs trade were not
tackled. Our role is to help the Afghans to do just that. Only then
will the Afghan Government, with support from the international
community, be able to set about the long and difficult task of

things that they are understandably anxious about at the moment are the
recent deaths. It would relieve their anxiety if they were absolutely
certain that the methods of communication between them and their loved

pm</h5><p><a name="06070310000246"><b><a name="06070310000621">Mr.
Phil Willis (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD):</b> I welcome
the opportunity to debate this important and topical issue on the Floor
of the House. I once again pay tribute to the former Chairman of the
Science and Technology Committee, the hon. Member for Norwich, North
(Dr. Gibson), and members of the previous Committee on producing an
extremely thorough and thoughtful report shortly before the 2005
general election.</p><p><a name="06070310000247">Few
areas of medical and social policy command greater interest or promote
greater controversy than research and clinical practice in the area of
human reproductive technologies. Producing the report was in itself a
considerable challenge. It is no secret that at least half the
membership of the Committee disagreed with the report. Well, some
people disagreed with it, and it was a real challenge to agree on a
final report to bring before the House. That reflects the divisions not
only in the Committee but in society on these issues. There would have
been something strange about an all-party Committee that did not have
significant disagreements on this subject.</p><p><a name="06070310000248">In spite of the difficulties in
arriving at a consensus, the Committee was right to tackle the
question. It is surely the job of Parliament to lead debate and not to
shy away from key issues of public concern, however divisive they may
prove to be. I would argue that this is a good example of the Select
Committee system in operation: not simply scrutinising but helping to
influence
policy.</p><p><a name="06070310000249">The
Committee&#146;s inquiry began in late 2003. They began because the
Committee had serious concerns about the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority. The Government said that they would keep the HFEA

<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 529</b><br>under review. The Science and Technology Committee thought that that was
not good enough. The Chairman said that the HFEA should be reconnected
with the 1990 legislation. That was one of the reasons behind the
inquiry. A year later, in 2004, the Department of Health announced its
own review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The
Department sensibly waited for the Committee to produce its report
before issuing a consultation alongside its response in August
2005.</p><p><a name="06070310000250">The results
of the consultation were published in March of this year, and further
announcements are promised for the summer. The Government should be
commended for the way in which they have responded to the
Committee&#146;s work. However, after a lengthy period of
consultation&#151;it is well over a year now&#151;I think that the
time has come for the Government to come forward with firm proposals,
and, I hope, to produce a Bill in draft form.</p><p><a name="06070310000251">A Bill is
required anyhow to facilitate the creation of the new regulatory
authority for tissue and embryos&#151;RATE&#151;from the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue Authority,
which the Government have pledged to do by 2008. I commend to the
Minister a draft Bill which would give the House an opportunity to
debate and scrutinise some of the recommendations that will emerge from
the Government&#146;s consultation. I hope that today&#146;s
debate, and the Minister&#146;s appearance before the Science and
Technology Committee next week, will stimulate some decision making on
the role of the new authority and related issues.</p><p><a name="06070310000252">Before
tackling some of the more controversial aspects of the
Committee&#146;s report, I shall outline the boundaries of the
debate. I shall do so by stressing areas of agreement on the
fundamental issues, which are unlikely to change. Both the Government
and the Committee agreed with the gradualist approach to the status of
the embryo adopted by the original Warnock Committee. I acknowledge
that there are those who may disagree with this approach. However, I do
not think that there is any realistic chance of it being dropped now
for the purpose of legislation&#151;so I think that we must start
with the premise of the gradualist
approach.</p><p><a name="06070310000253">I
think that there is general agreement that assisted reproduction is a
legitimate area of interest for the state. It is only the extent of
that interest that is in question. That in vitro fertilisation is now a
common clinical procedure is not in question. The Government agree that
legislation should take account of consequent changes in public
perception, and that is what the debate is all about. The question is:
how far are we prepared to accept assisted reproduction being regulated
like other medical procedures, and what additional safeguards are
required to protect the human embryo and the future child?</p><p><a name="06070310000254">Other points on which the
Government agree with the Committee are that there is a need for
greater clarity in the policy-making functions of HFEA, and that
legislation covering abortion should be removed from the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act. I will return to that point later.
The Government also agree with the Committee that there is a need for
some rationalisation of existing bodies. These areas of broad agreement
provide a solid foundation for debate on other matters of principle,
such as the extent and nature of Government intervention in
reproductive health.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 530</b><br><p><a name="06070310000255">There are, of
course, areas of disagreement. That is not surprising. The Committee
made 104 recommendations. It is interesting that the Government
rejected very few of them outright. Indeed, rather than do so, the
Government chose instead to consult more widely to gauge professional
and public opinion. Not surprisingly, there was disagreement over the
Government&#146;s use of the precautionary principle. I am rather
pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
(Dr. Harris) is not here to make a speech. He is delayed and has sent
his apologies to the House. We have just spent a considerable amount of
time discussing the precautionary principle in a new inquiry, and we
have not come to any sensible conclusion. The hon. Member for Braintree
(Mr. Newmark) nods from a sedentary position. The Committee&#146;s
recommendation to include the Human Genetics Commission in the new
regulatory body was a rationalisation too far for the Government, but I
am sure that the hon. Member for Norwich, North would like to take up
that issue later, because it was a fundamental proposal in the
Committee&#146;s report.</p><p><a name="06070310000256">My hon. Friend the Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon is in Committee at the moment and there was a
vote at 4 o&#146;clock, which is why he is delayed. I know that he
has given his apologies to Members&#151;in case there was some
concern over his health.</p><p><a name="06070310000257">The Government disagreed with
the Committee&#146;s argument that there was a mismatch between the
protection afforded by legislation to an embryo created in vitro before
implantation and one at a later stage of development. The Committee was
pointing out that allowing the greater use of pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, or PGD, may mean that the demand for abortions
falls&#151;particularly in the case of abortion on the grounds of
foetal sex, which is technically illegal but difficult to police.
Perhaps the greatest area of disagreement was over the future role of
Parliament in regulation. I will return to that a little
later.</p><p><a name="06070310000258"><b><a name="06070310000622">Andrew
Selous (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that Parliament should not do anything to deny any
child the possibility at birth of growing up with both a mother and a
father?</p><p><a name="06070310000259"><b><a name="06070310000623">Mr.
Willis:</b> The Committee made it absolutely clear that it is
important for children to be brought up in a loving environment. A
significant number of children are brought up in incredibly abusive and
unhappy environments. I would not wish to speculate on a child being
brought up in a single household, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman
in that, where possible, my personal view is that I would like there to
be two parents&#151;a male and female&#151;within the household
bringing a child up. That does not preclude other methods of rearing,
which are perfectly satisfactory and which have proved to be helpful in
terms of developing good human beings as far as society is concerned. I
will return to that issue
later.</p><p><a name="06070310000260">On many of the
key issues, the Government agreed to consult further. The results of
that exercise were published in March 2006 as a summary of the views
expressed, with no accompanying explanation of lessons drawn. I am
looking forward to hearing from the Minister how helpful the exercise
was, although if my interpretation of the volume of the published
responses&#151;there were 535&#151;is correct, it would be fair 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 531</b><br>to say that a variety of views were expressed. It was very difficult to
draw firm conclusions, but perhaps the Minister will add her comments
later.</p><p><a name="06070310000261">Judging
from the views expressed in Committee, I suggest that the extent of
disagreement was never in doubt. However, disagreement should not be an
excuse for inaction. Sooner or later the Government must take a view
and convince Parliament and the public of the merits of their
proposals. There were issues of concern to members of the Committee,
and I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members will highlight their
own, so I will not attempt to raise anything other than what I consider
to be one or two crucial areas, for which Government proposals must be
forthcoming.</p><p><a name="06070310000262">First is
the issue of sex selection for social reasons, which is highly
contentious. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House
will have different views about it. The Committee could find no
adequate justification for prohibiting the use of sex selection for
family balancing, but sensibly called for further work to establish the
demographic input of such a policy. The HFEA has also consulted on the
issue and advised against it. The Government invited views but
announced no plans to change their
position.</p><p><a name="06070310000263">I
confess that the Government might be right on this occasion, and that
such a policy might well give rise to unforeseen difficulties, so I
would want to see convincing evidence of the potential impact before
being convinced of the need for change. I suspect that the demand for
sex selection is actually quite low&#151;much lower than many hon.
Members believe. We should not forget that it currently requires people
to go through incredibly difficult and costly treatments to get a
child. However, we have to plan for a time when there is a pill that
destroys male sperm or ensures that a male embryo could not implant, so
the Government need to be clear about how they would prevent sex
selection, and they cannot dodge the issue in any draft Bill, or when
they bring their conclusions from the consultation before the
House.</p><p><a name="06070310000264">A second area
of contention between the Committee and the Government surrounds the
welfare of the child provision in the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990. The Committee argued that the requirement for
those providing fertility treatment to have regard for the welfare of
the child, including the need for a father, was unjustified. It held
that the provision was not only discriminatory towards the infertile
and some sections of society, but that it was</p><a name="06070310000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;impossible to implement
and...of questionable practical value in protecting the interests
of children born as a result of assisted
reproduction.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000265">Quite
apart from the difficulty of interpreting what the welfare of the child
means in practice, I cannot see a case for the state interfering in the
reproductive decisions of parents because they happen to be infertile,
when it makes no such attempt in respect of anyone else. For example,
there is no welfare of the child provision for other fertility
treatment such as vasectomy reversal. So, if the Government are
committed to maintaining a welfare of the child provision, I hope that
they are prepared to spell out exactly how it should be applied in
practice. I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s latest
thinking on what is, admittedly, a very difficult issue.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 532</b><br><p><a name="06070310000266">A third area is the allowable
use of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis&#151;PGD&#151;and this
needs serious clarification. At present, it is the responsibility of
the HFEA, but paragraph 251 of the Committee&#146;s report describes
the authority&#146;s policies and licensing decisions on
pre-implantation tissue typing as &#147;highly
unsatisfactory&#148;. Lord Winston, I suspect, used more graphic
language. Certainly, no evidence was produced by the HFEA to support
its claim that PGD would be used for &#147;trivial&#148; purposes,
and the fact that the Government have agreed that it would be
preferable if the parameters for PGD were more clearly set out in law
is a tacit admission that the Committee was right.</p><p><a name="06070310000267">For many, PGD provides a
welcome opportunity for parents to reduce or eliminate the risks of
passing on hereditary conditions and diseases such as Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, Huntington&#146;s and cystic fibrosis. The Committee
argued in line with the gradualist approach that if an embryo is to be
destroyed because it may carry a serious disease, it is better to do so
when it is just a few days old than at 24 weeks. However, I fully
accept that those who believe that all abortion is illegal and wrong
would not subscribe to that view.</p><p><a name="06070310000268">The crucial point to emphasise
is that new technologies are developing quickly and, as a consequence,
the HFEA is being required to take decisions with an ethnical dimension
and with serious consequences. For example, the HFEA recently ruled
that PGD could be extended to testing for certain types of cancer, and
only last month we heard about a new technique developed at
Guy&#146;s and St. Thomas&#146; hospital in London that may enable
thousands of diseases to be screened for as existing tests are improved
significantly. The key change is that whereas the original PGD
screening was for known diseases or hereditary conditions, the new
screening is for possible development of conditions later in life, and
that requires a substantially different approach from the present
one.</p><p><a name="06070310000269"><b><a name="06070310000624">Geraldine
Smith (Morecambe and Lunesdale) (Lab):</b> If we are not
careful, could not such screening become the ultimate form of
discrimination against people with disabilities&#151;denying them the
chance to be born?</p><p><a name="06070310000270"><b><a name="06070310000625">Mr.
Willis:</b> I have enormous sympathy with that point. I spent
much of my professional life working with children who had sensory
impairment and physical disabilities. All of them were precious to
their parents, despite the fact that many had huge problems in managing
their condition. However, I suspect that many of those parents, if they
had had the opportunity to screen out some of those difficulties, would
have done so. The question that the Committee rightly asked, and that
the Government have to answer, is: should parents in that situation
have the choice? We hope that the Government will adopt a fair position
on that question.</p><p><a name="06070310000271"><b><a name="06070310000626">Geraldine
Smith:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned? Once we start
down that slippery slope, where does it all end? I am sure that parents
would much rather have a very intelligent child. Many would hate to
have a child who grows up to be a politician. They might want a child
with blue eyes. That is getting into the realm of
eugenics&#151;producing the perfect child 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 533</b><br>that the parent wants. I do not want a world that has no one with any
sort of disability, because such people have all been screened out and
denied the chance to live.</p><p><a name="06070310000272"><b><a name="06070310000627">Mr.
Willis:</b> Few hon. Members would disagree with the hon.
Lady. I would go further and say that what we have seen in parts of the
United States, where deformities, in particular deafness, have been
screened in because the parents want their child to mirror their own
condition, is absolutely horrendous.</p><p><a name="06070310000273">Science is getting to the point
where we have an amazing number of techniques and can do amazing
things, but at that point we have to stop and to ask, &#147;Is this
what we want?&#148; The Committee was right to ask some of the
questions and it was right to say to the Government that we simply
cannot let such matters drift on. The Government are there to make some
of those decisions. The Committee&#146;s recommendation about a
bioethics committee is relevant. The hon. Lady is correct: not everyone
is comfortable with the new possibilities or with the fact that it is
the HFEA, which has only limited input from professional ethicists,
that is taking those decisions. That worries me. In my view that is the
job of Parliament&#151;but I know that many people would
disagree.</p><p><a name="06070310000274">The new
treatments bring their own ethical dilemmas. The value or rights of an
embryo have to be weighed against the potential benefits of avoiding
certain conditions; equally, the impact of such activity on existing
people with such conditions must be taken into account. Although there
are arguments over what diseases and conditions are serious enough to
warrant screening, there is a more fundamental argument about who
should make those decisions. The Committee argued that Parliament
should set the ethical parameters for the use of PGD and other such
procedures, and that regulators should then be responsible for ensuring
the highest possible clinical standards.</p><p><a name="06070310000275">I
fundamentally agree with that position. Parliament, rather than
unelected regulators, should have responsibility for establishing the
ethical framework for the use of PGD and other procedures and for
endorsing guidelines as necessary. The Committee proposes a new
parliamentary Standing Committee on bioethics that would make
recommendations on the need for legislative changes and scrutinise any
secondary legislation in the field. Such a system has been adopted
throughout Europe and I commend the principle to the Minister for
serious
consideration.</p><p><a name="06070310000276">Of
course, such an approach to bioethics would necessitate changes to the
existing regulatory framework, which is a fourth area of contention
between the Committee and the Government. The Committee recommended a
three-pronged approach on a new regulatory framework to give greater
clarity to existing legislation and thus allow medical professionals to
get on with their jobs without the bureaucratic burden of frequent
applications to the
regulators.</p><p><a name="06070310000277">The
Committee&#146;s call for a new human genetics, fertility and human
tissue commission to replace the HFEA, the Human Tissue Authority and
the Human Genetics Commission appears to have been rejected in favour
of a model that combines the HFEA with the HTA. That body will retain
the HFEA&#146;s licensing 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 534</b><br>responsibility, although that is a matter about which the Committee was
critical. I hope that the House will debate the two sides of that
argument today.</p><p><a name="06070310000278">My
final point is about abortion time limits. Paragraph 308 of the
Committee&#146;s report recommended that a Joint Committee of both
Houses should be
established</p><a name="06070310000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to consider
the scientific, medical and social changes in relation to abortion that
have taken place since 1967, with a view to presenting options for new
legislation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000279">It is more
than 15 years since the legislation was last reviewed by Parliament. We
now know a lot more about the foetus and have gained more evidence
about the factors underpinning the 24-week limit. There is growing
pressure from those on both sides of the abortion debate to look again
at developments since 1990 to determine whether a change to the
existing legislation is warranted.</p><p><a name="06070310000280">Early-day motion 2379 was
tabled by the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)
in support of that, and it had been signed by59 Members at the
last count. Its signatories have all viewpoints; indeed, I signed it
myself. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Cormac
Murphy-O&#146;Connor, has recently called for the time limit to be
reviewed. All that shows that there is a feeling in the House and the
country that we should at least review the scientific evidence and put
it before the House, rather than simply pretending that things are as
they were in 1990&#151;or, indeed,
1967.</p><p><a name="06070310000281"><b><a name="06070310000628">Geraldine
Smith:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the matter goes
much wider than just the Catholic Church? There is a feeling among
people in the country and MPs that a debate should take place. The
Government should be leading the debate and putting legislation before
us.</p><p><a name="06070310000282"><b><a name="06070310000629">Mr.
Willis:</b> I agree that the matter goes much further than the
Catholic Church. I am not a practising Catholic and do not come from
that particular lobby, although I have a strong Christian background.
However, this is not about religion. When I become Chairman of the
Science and Technology Committee, one of the first things that we did
was to ask the House of Lords to fulfil the recommendation of the
former Committee by setting up a Joint Committee to review the science
and determine where we were on
that.</p><p><a name="06070310000283"><b><a name="06070310000630">Dr.
Brian Iddon (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):</b> Does the hon.
Gentleman think that there is any new science&#151;and science
alone&#151;that would require the issue to be brought back to the
House?</p><p><a name="06070310000284"><b><a name="06070310000631">Mr.
Willis:</b> With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, I
do not know the answer to that. Does the fact that we now have better
imaging of the foetus at24 weeks represent a substantial
change from the situation 10 or 20 years ago? Of course, people
such as Lord Winston claim that the foetus is exactly the same at 24
weeks as it was 20, 30, or 40 years ago. However, medical technology,
and our ability to maintain life at 24 weeks, have changed. The purpose
of having an inquiry was to examine such matters and to try to ensure
that we put on the table the question of where 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 535</b><br>the science and technology were, and how we could tackle the key ethical
questions so that Parliament could debate and discuss that and the
Government could take action, if necessary. That is what Parliament
should be
doing.</p>

views.</p><p><a name="06070310000287"><b><a name="06070310000634">Dr.
Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
consider that, along with the science and the medical advances, there
is also the issue of the woman&#146;s right to choose? That is rather
important, too, is it
not?</p><p><a name="06070310000288"><b><a name="06070310000635">Mr.
Willis:</b> I fundamentally agree. At the end of the day, it
is certainly not for white, middle-class males in Parliament to tell a
lady in Birmingham, Brighton or Newcastle what she should do in such
difficult circumstances. What the Committee and I are saying is that,
given that this issue has not been examined for16 years, is it
not time to examine the science and the technology and put it in an
objective way before Parliament? This issue may well be dealt with
through a private Member&#146;s Bill, but I point out, with the
greatest respect, that it commands huge interest in the country, so it
is up to the Government to take a lead on it, rather than an individual
Member. Such a Member might introduce an ill-considered Bill that is
purely emotive and does not deal with
facts.</p><p><a name="06070310000289"><b><a name="06070310000636">Mr.
Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b> But does the hon.
Gentleman not agree that the unborn life has an equal right to that of
the mother, and that that must therefore be taken into consideration?
However, it is important that we focus on the technology. Technology
has improved in the past 16 years, which is why the House should
consider reducing the age of termination from 24 weeks to 20 or 18
weeks. We should investigate this issue through technology and
science.</p><p><a name="06070310000290"><b><a name="06070310000637">Mr.
Willis:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention, and I hope that he will forgive me if I do not stray into
a debate on ethics with him. One wise Committee recommendation was that
the House should have a bioethics Committee. We are moving 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 536</b><br>into territory that, even five years ago, we did not believe we would
enter. It is important that some of these issues be discussed within
that framework.</p><p><a name="06070310000291">Our
Committee suggested to the House of Lords that we examine the science.
It said &#147;no&#148;, and that it would prefer to have the matter
dealt with by an ad hoc Committee of the whole House. I approached the
then Leader of the House to ask for such a Committee, but was refused.
This issue will not go away. It is important that the Government think
again and at least set up an ad hoc Committee of the whole House to
look at the facts and put them before Parliament. At that point, we can
bring in the ethical, as well as the scientific, debate in an effort to
resolve these issues.</p><p><a name="06070310000292">I commend this excellent report
to the House, and I look forward to the remainder of the

Smith (Morecambe and Lunesdale) (Lab):</b> I welcome this
extremely important debate. The matters before us are complex and they
raise numerous deep moral and ethical principles that are highly
emotive, as we have already seen, controversial and often
divisive&#151;so much so that the Science and Technology Committee
was split down the middle when it discussed the report. Five members
were for the report and five were against. I was unable to support many
of the report&#146;s recommendations. In their response, the
Government adopted a much more measured and cautious approach, which I
welcome.</p><p><a name="06070310000294">I find the
attitude adopted by some representatives of the scientific community
quite chilling. They appear to believe that the only restrictions that
should be placed on their activities are the limitations imposed by
their own scientific capabilities. They display a total lack of concern
for the moral, ethical, religious and social issues involved, and view
those who seek to restrict their activities as modern-day luddites out
to wreck their scientific looms. In return, I view those people as 21st
century Dr. Frankensteins. They reaffirm my conviction that we must
have a strict regulatory regime in place to govern their
activities.</p><p><a name="06070310000295">I said
earlier that this is an important debate. We are discussing the
creation, the scientific manipulation and the taking of human life, and
the laws applicable to those activities. I shall restrict my remarks to
one aspect of the report, which I feel has not been adequately dealt
with by the Select Committee or the Government in their response. There
is so much in the report that I could speak for three hours on the
various recommendations, but I choose to restrict my comments to one
area about which I have concerns&#151;the destruction of human life
by means of
abortion.</p><p><a name="06070310000296">Let me make
my personal position clear. I would never have an abortion, or I hope I
never would, but I do not want to drive women back to back-street
abortions. I realise that one cannot have simplistic views; the issue
can be complex. Women can be under huge pressures to have abortions.
Sometimes it is not an informed choice. It is not the woman&#146;s
right to choose. She is often under pressure to have an abortion.
</p><p><a name="06070310000297">As has been said,
there is growing concern about the abortion law in the UK. Our current
law is out of date and is in urgent need of reform. I know that there

Recommendation 77 of the Select Committee, on which my hon. Friend
served,
states:</p><a name="06070310000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
call on both Houses in the new Parliament to set up a joint committee
to consider the scientific, medical and social changes . . . that have
taken place since 1967, with a view to presenting options for new
legislation. This committee should be broadly based and should include
nominees from the Commons Select Committees for Science and Technology
and Health and the Lords Science and Technology
Committee.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000303">Recommendation
78 states:</p><a name="06070310000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
recommend that any new legislation introduced to amend the HFE Act
should not include abortion, which should be dealt with by a separate
Bill.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000304">I have no problem
with that. However, I think it fair that I should comment, given that
we mentioned abortion and the need for a Joint Committee in our
report.</p><p><a name="06070310000305">The
Government say in paragraph 106 of their response that they accept
recommendation 78, but their response to recommendation 77 is
unsatisfactory. Paragraph 105
states:</p><a name="06070310000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government has no plans to change the law on abortion. If a joint
committee is set up to look at this issue, the Government will consider
its recommendations. However, it is accepted Parliamentary practice
that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have to come from
back bench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free
votes, with members and peers voting according to their beliefs and
values.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000306"><b><a name="06070310000643">Ann
Winterton (Congleton) (Con):</b> The hon. Lady might remember
that the initial legislation, the Abortion Act 1967, was introduced as
a private Member&#146;s Bill, but the Government of the day gave it
time in order that it could be enacted. Does she accept that during the
passage of that Bill and of the Human

on both sides to come to a certain
conclusion?</p><p><a name="06070310000307"><b><a name="06070310000644">Geraldine
Smith:</b> I think that the Government should be leading this
debate, because there is concern across the country. It is not just
about allowing parliamentary time if a private Member&#146;s Bill
comes up&#151;they should be making time properly to discuss the
issue. Before doing so, they should of course have all the available
scientific and medical evidence on the changes that have taken place in
society since the Abortion Act 1967 and the most recent amendment to
the legislation in 1990.</p><p><a name="06070310000308">The current law on abortions
was established in the Abortion Act, with a time limit for abortion set
at the 28th week of pregnancy. That was reduced to the24th
week by amendment to section 37 of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act. The central criterion underpinning the time span was
that the foetus would not be able to survive outside the
mother&#146;s womb at that stage of its development. Following
advances in technology and medical care, there is now strong evidence
that foetuses are far more developed at a much earlier stage than was
previously thought, so that they are able to survive outside their
mother&#146;s womb as early as 18 weeks. That undermines the key
principle in relation to the formulation of the time limits. When life
can be carried on independently of the mother, surely the foetus, or
baby, has human rights of its own.</p><p><a name="06070310000309">The Government state in their
response, however, that they have</p><a name="06070310000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no plans to change the law on
abortion.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000310">Does that mean they
have already considered the available evidence and concluded that they
are perfectly happy with the current legislation and see no need for
change? If so, they should be honest and say so, giving their reasons
for reaching such a conclusion. Or do they believe that all the issues
surrounding this matter need to be more fully examined? If so, why have
not they supported the Committee&#146;s recommendation on the
establishment of a Joint Committee? Or do they believe, as they seem to
suggest at the end of paragraph 105 of their response, that this is
nothing to do with them and that it is up to Back Benchers to sort it
out because that is what happened in the past? If so, I would accuse
them of abrogating their responsibilities on this issue. While they are
correct in their judgment that it is a matter of personal belief and
conscience, and must therefore be decided by a free vote in both
Houses, that does not absolve them of their responsibilities and
prevent them from leading the debate.</p><p><a name="06070310000311">I am sure that Ministers and
Back Benchers are well aware that this issue will not go away and that
pressure for a review of the law on abortion will continue to grow. I
would welcome the Minister&#146;s response to the points that I have
outlined.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070310000452">4.49
pm</h5><p><a name="06070310000312"><b><a name="06070310000645">Ann
Winterton (Congleton) (Con):</b> I am grateful to be called in
the debate, which takes me back to 1990 and all the issues that were
debated then. I went underground for the next 10 years, having had
rather too much of them because they were exceptionally 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 539</b><br>difficult and took a lot out of one as well as much time. However, they
are exceptionally important and evergreen.</p><p><a name="06070310000313">I want to focus on two issues
in relation to the Science and Technology Committee&#146;s
consultation and report. I begin by commending the fact that the
consultation&#146;s terms of reference were comprehensive and
rigorous. The Committee consulted extensively&#151;online, through
oral submissions and by encouraging written submissions. It was a truly
committed initiative, which extended far beyond the usual time
schedules involved in such consultation exercises. A little bird told
me that the Committee even went to Rome to consult the Vatican. I
thought that that was a good move, and I do not speak as a Roman
Catholic. It must have been the first time in history that a Select
Committee took evidence from the
Vatican.</p><p><a name="06070310000314">The report
is, sadly, not to be universally celebrated and it is worth remembering
from the start the amount of internal and public disquiet that
surrounded its publication. The Committee was split down the middle, as
the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) said. I
commend her bravery in raising an issue that perhaps other hon. Members
would have preferred her not to raise. It was right and proper that she
did so. Only the vote of the distinguished Chairman, the hon. Member
for Norwich, North (Dr.
Gibson)&#151;</p><p><a name="06070310000315"><b><a name="06070310000646">Dr.
Gibson:</b> The Chairman would have loved to vote but he did
not need to do that. The majority of Committee members voted for the
report.</p><p><a name="06070310000316"><b><a name="06070310000647">Ann
Winterton:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making
his position clear.</p><p><a name="06070310000317"><b><a name="06070310000648">Geraldine
Smith:</b> To add further clarification, the vote on the
report took place in the last days of the previous Parliament, in the
run-up to the general election. Many of the members who opposed the
report could not be present at the vote. I am sure that the Chairman
accepts that five members supported the report and five opposed
it.</p><p><a name="06070310000318"><b><a name="06070310000649">Ann
Winterton:</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Lady. We all
know what pressures are on Committees to reach a conclusion, and the
period just before a general election is perhaps not the best time to
do so. The hon. Lady has made what happened clear.</p><p><a name="06070310000319">The formal
minutes of the meetings that cover the approval of the report are a
record of the dissent. In the days that followed its publication, the
nation and media were almost unanimously up in arms over issues such as
animal-human hybrids, germ-line manipulation, reproductive cloning,
social sex selection and other hugely controversial proposals, which
form part of the report&#146;s recommendations.</p><p><a name="06070310000320">Further to the validity of the
recommendations&#151;104 in all&#151;the next point to consider is
the extent to which they reflected the thrust of the evidence that the
Committee received during its year&#146;s extended consultation. For
those who attended the oral evidence sessions&#151;I am the first to
admit that I did not&#151;read 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 540</b><br>the written evidence and followed the online consultation, it is
impossible to accept that the Committee&#146;s controversial
recommendations relate in any way to the evidence that it received from
the vast majority of participants.</p><p><a name="06070310000321">A trio of postgraduate students
took time to analyse the material and concluded that the weight of
evidence was, for the greater part, conservative in its content and in
favour of maintaining the status quo, not deviating significantly from
the consensus reached in 1990 on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Act. The rationale behind the report was the intention to bring the Act
up to date in the light of scientific advances. Technology might move
fast, but that does not mean that our ethical concerns or the
philosophical underpinnings of society and the law have altered
radically&#151;as the report would have us believe&#151;if, indeed,
they have altered at all. The Act needs to be reconnected not with
modern science but with the interests and values of society at large.
Some would even argue that those values have become more restrictive
than they were at the time of the Warnock report, not least because
many developments that were not anticipated at the time have been
received with huge distaste by the public. Social sex selection is a
classic example. While it attracts support in the maverick Science and
Technology Committee report, 85 per cent. of public opinion polls
register total opposition to such a proposal.</p><p><a name="06070310000322">Warnock is cited by the report,
but defended on a cherry-picking basis. The protection for the embryo
enshrined in the original Act, for example, has been completely
bypassed. On what justification? It is on the opinion of five Members
of Parliament. Cherry-picking is applied even more openly to ethical
opinions and citations. The continued references to John Harris, Julian
Savulescu, Emily Jackson and others who hold similar beliefs are
nothing more than a blatant endorsement of libertarian minority
opinions.</p><p><a name="06070310000323">The
philosophical basis of the report is a selective mixture of some rights
and harm principles. The rights, however, are limited to the
reproductive rights of the adult, and leave little space for the rights
of children, let alone the broader rights of society as a whole. The
harm principle is limited exclusively to physical harms, and there is
no wish to engage with broader, deeper concerns. That is to be
regretted.</p><p><a name="06070310000324">I wish to
speak about the rights and welfare of children, not least because the
matter has been in the news recently, perhaps because of the publicity
given to the statements made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who is now in his place, having not been present
earlier in the debate. I understand that he wishes to remove from the
Act part of section 13(5), which refers to the welfare of the child. I
have to admit that I was one of those responsible for the inclusion in
the original Act of the need of a child for a father, and I shall read
that subsection to the
House:</p><a name="06070310000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A woman
shall not be provided with treatment services unless account has been
taken of the welfare of any child who may be born as a result of the
treatment (including the need of that child for a father), and of any
other child who may be affected by the
birth.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 541</b><br><p><a name="06070310000325">It was I who encouraged my hon.
Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) to table a very small
amendment on that issue. It was the only one that we on this side of
the argument managed to get accepted by the House on that occasion. I
might add that that was the only time that I have been a Teller and
been on the winning side. In fact, from that point of view, the whole
of my parliamentary career has been an absolute disaster. However, I
was very proud of that one small amendment, because it meant a great
deal.</p><p><a name="06070310000326">Perhaps that is
why the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is now trying to get
the provision removed. He is, in effect, recommending the deliberate
creation of fatherless children, whether to single or lesbian women, on
the basis that</p><a name="06070310000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;including the need of that child
for a father&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000327">is a
discriminatory phrase that should not have been included in the Act in
the first place. However, it was obvious, when the Act was passed, that
the wise intention of Parliament was to place the welfare of the child
at the centre of our focus. The welfare of the child obviously extended
to his or her right to a father. That is what the House voted on and
for in those days.</p><p><a name="06070310000328"><b><a name="06070310000650">Dr.
Evan Harris (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD):</b> I am sure
that the hon. Lady was not chastising me for not being present in the
Chamber, as I had told both Front Benches and the Speaker&#146;s
office that I was voting in a Select Committee. What evidence does she
have that the welfare of the child is protected by this measure? Can
she cite studies that show that children of lesbian couples, conceived
by donor insemination, or of solo parents&#151;women who specifically
seek pregnancy when they do not have a partner&#151;are damaged in
that way? The Select Committee found that the evidence was on the other
side, and that the provision was therefore
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06070310000329"><b><a name="06070310000651">Ann

that the hon. Gentleman has made his position clear. I could produce
evidence, and evidence has been provided, but I do not have it with me
this afternoon. As a mother of three and grandmother of seven, I, like
most of my constituents and the majority of people in the United
Kingdom, believe that it is better and right that a child has a mother
and a father wherever possible, and that it is wrong to create a new
life artificially without a mother and a father who will be in that
child&#146;s life from the very beginning. We all know of examples of
children who have been brought up by single parents, either male or
female, who have done a splendid job, and I do not knock that in any
way. However, the artificial creation of such a situation is wrong. As
we are allowed to express our view in the House, I hope that I have
done so clearly.</p><p><a name="06070310000332">I believe
that the child is discriminated against by writing out the need for a
father. Were we to take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position to its
extreme, it could be argued that a preference for a mother is also
discriminatory.

mother from the Act? Will we next ask for the reproductive rights of

children, without the need for a mother? I ask all those questions with
my tongue in cheek.</p><p><a name="06070310000333"><b><a name="06070310000654">Geraldine
Smith:</b> Does the hon. Lady agree that it is not just a
question of evidence but of common sense? Most people in the country
would think that it makes sense to start a child&#146;s life with a
mother and a father. Of course, there are terrific single parents who
do a wonderful job. If we are looking for a basis to create a child,
however, surely it should start with two parents&#151;a mother and a
father.</p><p><a name="06070310000334"><b><a name="06070310000655">Ann

the Government Benches? When we debated the Children and Adoption Bill
some weeks ago, the Government set their face completely against the
principle of co-parenting, even when we argued strongly for the
paramountcy of the welfare of the child. From birth through to
adulthood, co-parenting is being opposed by the Liberal Democrats and

the parameters of absurd political correctness and gratuitous gender

Winterton:</b> Of course that is true, but people who do not
believe in what I am saying usually go on to say that if those
conditions are not in place, it is better for children to be aborted:
that they are better off dead. I would say that not all those
conditions can be in place in every single case. We know of
children&#151;in our own family circles and in wider
circles&#151;who have had unhappy childhoods, but have grown up to be
excellent adults and have played their part in society. We cannot
guarantee those elements in anyone&#146;s life, because life is not
perfect, but if they are there, that is a tremendous bonus.</p><p><a name="06070310000342">As I was saying, the original
Act enshrined many concerns about the welfare of children. Many of the
recommendations of the Science and Technology Committee attempt to
lessen the impact of those concerns. I believe that we should resist
those recommendations, and insist that the provisions in the Act are
reinforced.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070310000453">5.6
pm</h5><p><a name="06070310000343"><b><a name="06070310000662">Dr.
Brian Iddon (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):</b> It is important
that we are having this debate on an Estimates day. The subject is
complex. The report from the Science and Technology Committee contains
many chapters and much material that needs to be debated, and in the
short time available today we shall not be able to do it justice. Let
me say to the Minister that I hope this will be the first of many
debates on the subject before we change the legislation, as we
must.</p><p><a name="06070310000344">When we
embarked on the debate, I hoped that it would not be hijacked by the
abortion issue. That is not because I do not consider the issue
important. The Committee deliberately avoided debating it, however,
because it had been debated so often in Government time on the Floor of
the House and elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster. I rather hoped
that today we would concentrate on other issues, which are not aired as
frequently as they should
be.</p><p><a name="06070310000345">I regard my
membership of the Select Committee as one of the most important duties
that I perform in this place on behalf of my constituents. The
Committee&#146;s members believe that they have influenced Government
thinking in a number of policy areas, and have also influenced
organisations outside the House. A number of debates are taking place
at present, of which this is only one.</p><p><a name="06070310000346">During my time in the Committee
disagreement has been rare, but the fifth report of the 2004-05 Session
was an exception. It resulted in the eighth special report of that
Session, which makes it clear that five of the 11 Committee members
disagreed with the publication of the fifth report. That probably
reflects the divided views of Members across the House, which is why we
are given free votes on most of these difficult issues.</p><p><a name="06070310000347">After a lengthy inquiry and
prolonged discussions, the Committee met again on 14 March last year,
faced with 130 further amendments to an already amended report. It was
clear to me then that the report would not see the light of day,
especially as we knew that Parliament was shortly to be dissolved. A
great deal of effort had gone into compiling the report. It had also
cost a lot of money, particularly because of visits to Stockholm and
Rome&#151;including a visit to the health 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 544</b><br>ministry at the Vatican&#151;and to clinics in various parts of this
country. We collected a large amount of evidence, and the inquiry
lasted for an entire year. If the report had dropped out of sight, it
would have been costly for Parliament, and it would have been a shame
in the context of today&#146;s debate. Therefore, I did an unusual
thing in a Select Committee: I moved a guillotine. That caused quite a
rumpus. On that day, the meeting began at 3.30 in the afternoon and the
guillotine was for 8.30 in the evening. Even though it upset some of my
colleagues on the Committee, I do not regret taking that action,
because if we had not taken it, we would not be having the debate on
this important report this afternoon.</p><p><a name="06070310000348">Our report states:</p><a name="06070310000437"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the evidence suggests that the
scale of intrusion into the private choices of individuals seeking to
have a family can no longer be justified. We do, however, accept that
the research uses of the embryo of the human species remain a
legitimate interest of the State.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000349">Other members of the Committee felt that
that was too liberal a statement and they moved an amendment against
the libertarian approach of certain members of the Committee, but the
majority prevailed and the report was published.</p><p><a name="06070310000350">I accept that these issues are
difficult to grasp and even more difficult to legislate for, but it is
now generally accepted that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act
1990 is in need of review and I believe that our report forms an
excellent platform for that review to take place. As in many other
areas, advances in technology in this field are racing ahead of our
ability to consider reform of existing legislation.</p><p><a name="06070310000351">As I have said, the Committee
deliberately excluded abortion from its inquiry and it excluded
surrogacy, too. I want to touch on one or two aspects in the report. On
the status of the embryo, we agreed with the Warnock view that embryos
should have special status. As the present Chairman of the Committee
has pointed out, we took the &#147;gradualist approach&#148; that a
human being is not created at the point of natural fertilisation but
emerges gradually towards birth. However, we respect the 14-day rule
that allows research to be carried out on an embryo during the period
before the primitive streak emerges, which is the first sign that the
nervous system, the spinal cord and the brain are beginning to develop.
It is my personal view that no change to the law should be made in that
respect, although there are arguments being advanced both to reduce
that 14-day limit and to increase it to20 days, or even beyond
that. Baroness Warnock has admitted that that time scale of 14 days is
&#147;arbitrary&#148; and it is based on the reasoning that I have
already given.</p><p><a name="06070310000352">The
1990 Act defines an embryo in section 1(1)
as:</p><a name="06070310000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a live human embryo
where fertilisation is
complete&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000353">which
includes</p><a name="06070310000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an egg in the
process of fertilisation&#148;.</p></ul>

<p><a name="06070310000354">The term &#147;gamete&#148; covers
live human eggs or sperm, but not eggs in the process of
fertilisation.</p><p><a name="06070310000355">Today,
that definition is inadequate because artificially created gametes can
be produced and embryos can be created through the process of cell
nuclear replacement, or cloning, the process used to give birth to
Dolly the sheep at the Roslin institute 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 545</b><br>nearly 10 years ago. Our Committee believes that attempts to define an
embryo in any new Act would be counter-productive because it would lead
to legal challenges, as the definition of the embryo in the present Act
has led to legal challenges.</p><p><a name="06070310000356">On sex selection, I agree with
the majority of our report&#146;s recommendations, but not all. I
spoke against sex selection for nonmedical reasons&#151;Members have
used the phrase &#147;for social reasons&#148;&#151;either by
sperm sorting or by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. However, for
the avoidance of sex-related disorders, I do support sex
selection.</p><p><a name="06070310000357">Some
communities value boys more than girls; India and China are examples. I
believe sex selection to be discriminatory and that it should not be
sanctioned in this country. The policy of the two countries that I
mentioned has serious demographic consequences. However, I recognise
that there are arguments for family balancing, especially when a mother
has given birth to a significant number of children of the same sex.
Alan and Louise Masterton, who have four sons, lost their
three-year-old daughter Nicole in 1999 in a domestic accident and
campaigned for the right to rebuild their family with a daughter. If
families cannot achieve what they want in this country, they will
probably go abroad to achieve their ends. That applies to other areas
of this debate as well as sex selection, but I have no ready answers to
&#147;reproductive tourism&#148;. We have to face the fact that if
people cannot get what they want in this country and it is legally
available in other countries, they will go there to have that
treatment, possibly under less safe conditions than would apply in this
country.</p><p><a name="06070310000358"><b><a name="06070310000663">Mr.
Newmark: </b>Just because another country may have lower
ethical or moral standards, does the hon. Gentleman think that we
should introduce them
here?</p><p><a name="06070310000359"><b><a name="06070310000664">Dr.
Iddon:</b> No, I did not say that. We want high moral
standards in this country. We do not want to force people to go to
other countries with lower moral and ethical standards. For example,
the Mastertons had to go to Italy for treatment. Tragically, that
resulted in only one male embryo, which was donated to an infertile
couple.</p><p><a name="06070310000360">Sex selection
by PGD or sperm sorting is far preferable to sex selection by selective
termination of pregnancy or by infanticide. Sex selection by sperm
sorting is not covered by the human fertilisation and embryology
legislation and, in my view, it should
be.</p><p><a name="06070310000361"><b><a name="06070310000665">Mr.
Walker: </b>Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that if
we do not allow people to select the sex of their children, we will
have parents committing
infanticide?</p><p><a name="06070310000362"><b><a name="06070310000666">Dr.
Iddon:</b> No, I am saying that in some other countries
infanticide is used to achieve what people want. I have mentioned two
countries in which it might happen.</p><p><a name="06070310000363">The Committee
found</p><a name="06070310000440"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no adequate
justification for prohibiting the use of sex selection for family
balancing&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 546</b><br><p><a name="06070310000364">Sex selection in the UK would probably
work both ways and the demographic impact would, therefore, probably be
imperceptible.</p><p><a name="06070310000365">The
concept of selection is one on which we need a full
debate&#151;fuller than we can have this afternoon&#151;especially
if we want to allow selection as a means of achieving greater
intelligence or beauty, a certain hair or eye colour, increased memory
capacity, or other factors. Science will make all those choices
available. I do not say that I am in favour of them, but I am saying
that we will have to debate the issue in this House at some
point.</p><p><a name="06070310000366">The birth of
Louise Brown in 1976 at Oldham and district hospital as a result of in
vitro fertilisation was a milestone in medical history. Unfortunately,
today, only 1.5 per cent. of all live births in the UK are a result of
IVF treatment and, considering that the UK gave birth to IVF treatment,
it is not pleasing that we were ranked 12th out of 15 countries in
Europe that offer IVF treatment in a report published a few days ago by
the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. Denmark
offers 2,031 cycles per million population, but the UK figure is only
633. In Israel, where there is an active policy to encourage
childbirth, the figure is 3,000 and 7 per cent. of treatments lead to a
live birth. In comparison, the figure in Denmark is 3.9 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06070310000367">The Committee
formed the view that IVF treatment has become such a routine medical
procedure that its regulation can become part of mainstream clinical
regulation. That is not to say, however, that there should not be
continued inspection of clinics offering the treatment, both in the
public and private
sectors.</p><p><a name="06070310000368">I represent a
constituency with some of the poorest estates in Britain and it
concerns me that my constituents have such poor access to IVF
treatment. Indeed, only a few years ago, our local NHS would not fund
IVF treatment. Nationally, only 25 per cent. of IVF treatments are
obtained in the NHS. The rich get the most treatment, because they can
afford to go to the private clinics. Unless we make IVF treatment more
readily available on the NHS, my constituents&#151;poor as many of
them are&#151;will continue to be discriminated against because they
live in the wrong
place.</p><p><a name="06070310000369">However, the
question is not just the availability of IVF, but the quality of the
services on offer. I believe that the success rates of public and
private-sector clinics offering that treatment should be published,
although clinicians are sceptical about doing so, because their success
rates depend on a number of factors; the main one, incidentally, is the
age of the woman presenting herself for IVF treatment. However, it is
important that people can judge the success rates of clinics, and in
taking evidence our Committee found that those rates differed
spectacularly.</p><p><a name="06070310000370">In
February 2004, the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence published guidelines on IVF treatment. It recommended the
implantation of only two embryos per cycle to avoid the risks that we
know are associated with multiple pregnancies. It also recommended that
three cycles be offered to infertile women, which would have a
considerable cost implication for the NHS. The Government, of course,
have asked primary care trusts to offer only one cycle. Again, the
House needs to have a proper debate on the NICE proposals. In Italy,
the position is different; the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 547</b><br>Italian Government have insisted that three embryos be implanted per
cycle. There was considerable opposition to that proposal, as the
Committee found when we visited Rome.</p><p><a name="06070310000371">There is a rising trend of
infertility in the richer nations. One in seven couples now experience
problems with infertility; we need to invest far more in research to
find out why. Some blame pollution of our environment by certain
chemicals&#151;so-called endocrine disruptors&#151;but that is by
no means proven. We should all remember that that trend comes at a time
when the demographic make-up of our population is skewed towards the
older end. We need more live births to make our demographic spectrum as
it was in previous years. It costs an estimated &#163;13,000 for
every baby born by NHS IVF treatment, but we should remember that that
baby will contribute an estimated &#163;147,138 to the Exchequer
throughout its lifetime, so it makes economic sense to support IVF
treatment.</p><p><a name="06070310000372">Spare
embryos can be destroyed, donated, stored for future use by the woman
or others, or donated for research. Many people believe that, once
created, embryos should never be destroyed, despite the fact that 70
per cent. of embryos fail to implant and are merely washed down the
loo. Is it not preferable to use spare embryos for important medical
research? I was pleased when Parliament decided to debate stem cell
research a few years ago, and to allow it to proceed in this country,
admittedly under tight regulation. There is now a reverse brain drain
in this country; people are actually coming from the United States of
America to conduct much-needed stem cell research in
Britain.</p><p><a name="06070310000373">There are
widespread concerns&#151;shared by me, incidentally&#151;about the
principles and practicality of the welfare-of-the-child provision in
the 1990 Act. Section 13(5) requires
that</p><a name="06070310000441"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A woman
shall not be provided with treatment services unless account has been
taken of the welfare of any child who may be born as a result of the
treatment (including the need of that child for a father), and of any
other child who may be affected by the
birth.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000374">Although most of
us have freedom of sexual reproduction, less fortunate individuals who
need assisted reproduction actually have to be judged by others, mainly
from the middle classes&#151;general practitioners and people on
various ethics committees. That is not right. Those people are not in
touch, in my opinion, with some of the people on poorer estates in my
constituency who are desperate to have children but who are infertile.
I do not believe that they should be judged in the pursuit of having a
child, and that is one of the reasons why I am against that
welfare-of-the-child provision. It is highly discriminatory, especially
to people who are leading non-conventional lives.</p><p><a name="06070310000375">Our committee heard lots of
evidence from professionals, such as GPs and clinicians, who are
expected to implement that procedure, but they find it almost
impossible to do so. How well does a GP know all the women who are on
his or her books? Can they judge? The evidence that we took was that
they cannot judge in the majority of cases. The medical profession
wants the welfare-of-the-child provision in the 1990 Act to be
abandoned. Our Committee also felt that adequate mechanisms are already
in place to ensure 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 548</b><br>that any child born in an assisted manner will be protected. Of course
we must remember that, since that legislation was passed, we have
passed the Children and Adoption Act 2006, which also gives the born
child a great deal of
protection.</p><p><a name="06070310000376">I wish to
mention just one more thing: the insemination of single women. It seems
ironic that, when we produced the report, the people in the media who
wanted to do radio and television interviews with me&#151;I think
that it was the same for other members of the Committee&#151;focused
on one thing: sex selection, not on IVF, PGD or many of the other
things in the report, not all bad and mostly good. Today, with me, they
have been focusing on the insemination of single women. Why do not the
media get real, look at the whole report and judge it across the
spectrum?</p><p><a name="06070310000377">During
our inquiry we visited the Harley street office of a business called
Man Not Included, which offers an internet service to collect and
deliver fresh sperm to single women, including lesbians. As it deals in
fresh sperm, its services are not covered by the 1990 Act. In my
opinion, those internet services need regulating. I have two concerns,
one of which is on grounds of safety? How can we be sure that sexually
transmitted diseases are not being transmitted from the donor of the
sperm to the recipient woman? That needs regulating.</p><p><a name="06070310000378">I am also concerned that,
whereas the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has a register
that lists all the donors of gametes and all the recipients of gametes,
those internet services do not have to register donors or recipients on
the central register. We are very keen for that to happen now that
children, some time in their future, can find out exactly where their
parentage is based, but those services will not allow any of the
children born as a result of using their services to trace their
parentage.</p><p><a name="06070310000379">I am in
favour of PGD because it will eliminate some of the most difficult
diseases that we are facing. I am also in favour of the creation of a
parliamentary bioethical committee, on which lay members and
professionals from the industry could serve&#151;it need not be made
up only of parliamentarians&#151;but what really gets to me is the
fact that a quango, the HFEA, is making important decisions without
reference to elected Members of Parliament, and it is about time that
those important decisions were brought into the Chamber and our
Committees, so that we can debate them properly.</p><p><a name="06070310000380">It would be a
brave person who could predict where these areas of research will take
us next, but one thing is sure, they will always be controversial and
we will always need to debate them in parliamentary time. I have many
other comments to make, but in fairness to other hon. Members, I will
sit down soon. Let me finish by saying that our report contains 104
recommendations and, alas, it impossible to touch on most of them this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06070310000381"><b><a name="06070310000667">Several

apart from the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris),
who served on the Committee. I have a few things to say, but what I say
will be much shorter because I can simply say that I agree with all 104

Members in the Chamber today who served on the Committee that
considered what became the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.
I think it is true to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton

almost 23 years, except on this issue. We have disagreed with each
other for 23 years about some of the important issues that are now
before us. I strongly respect her views although I disagree with
them.</p><p><a name="06070310000386">We are dealing
with a report that was produced in the previous Parliament. It was
undoubtedly the most interesting and significant Select Committee that
I served on for 23 years, despite my having served on five Select
Committees. I thank the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough
(Mr. Willis), who is the current Chairman of the Committee, for his
thoughtful contribution to the debate. I thank particularly the hon.
Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), who throughout all the trials
and tribulations of a remarkable Committee managed to lead us to a
conclusion and to get a report published when it was the wish of some
that that should not happen. It would have done a great disservice to
the House if a report had not been published.</p><p><a name="06070310000387">We are dealing with some of the
last great taboos. That is why it is important to tackle them head on.
To know what we should do about human reproductive technology, we
should start by understanding and appreciating the widely differing
views that people hold about the nature of the human embryo.</p><p><a name="06070310000388">A young man living in a Jewish
community about 2,000 years ago would probably have
acceptedthe traditional Jewish position on the status of the
embryo&#151;it is not a person but must be treated with the respect
due to a form of human life. That is surely something with which most
of us could agree.</p><p><a name="06070310000389">In
the fourth century, teaching in Roman north Africa, St. Augustine of
Hippo believed that the human embryo did not have a soul because it was
not sentient. Writing in 13th century Naples, St. Thomas Aquinas
rekindled Aristotlean philosophy and decided that humanity began with
ensoulment at 40 days for a male foetus and 90 days for a female
foetus. Was not that progress?</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 550</b><br><p><a name="06070310000390">The Bishop of Rochester advised
our Committee last year that the gradual emergence of a person was the
usual approach in the Christian tradition until 1869, when Pope Pius XI
abolished the distinction between early and late abortions. By 1984 the
Warnock committee had concluded, rather in the Christian tradition,
that a human embryo develops over time. It said that a human embryo
cannot be thought of as a person or even as a potential person; it is
simply a collection of cells which, unless it implants in a human
uterine environment, has no potential for development.
</p><p><a name="06070310000391">I
do not think that a human being is created at the moment of conception.
That is the moment that takes the egg and the sperm a step nearer to
implantation, with humanity commencing at 14 days with the appearance
of the primitive streak, the precursor to the spinal chord, signifying
cell differentiation and the beginning of sentience. I believe that
life is a continuum with a genetic line moving ever onwards, unless it
dies out through lack of procreation. That, surely, is why we humans
are so interested in our ancestors and, indeed, the fortunes of our
children.</p><p><a name="06070310000392">There is a
huge problem now. Only 30 per cent. of fertilised eggs of embryos
implant. What about the rest: the spare embryos? The Church of England
Mission and Public Affairs Council said in its report on embryo
research:</p><a name="06070310000442"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
superabundance of embryos, seventy per cent of which do not implant in
the womb, is echoed throughout nature... Seed or eggs which do not
reproduce are frequently sources of food for other
creatures.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000393">The former
Bishops of Oxford and Salisbury, in the other place, have in the past
both talked of the problems that arise if all human embryos are
regarded as having full human status from the moment of conception. If
70 per cent. of embryos are destroyed, do we believe that they are
ensouled human beings and does that mean that heaven is largely
populated by embryos? I do not know. I look forward to someone helping
with that problem.</p><p><a name="06070310000394">Research on human embryos can
be undertaken without compromising their special status, but the
research must have proper legal and ethical oversight. I also believe
that it is right to create embryos for research purposes, always
insisting on the 14-day rule. The hon. Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough said that Parliament sometimes had to tell scientists to
stop that process. We cannot stop science or prevent progress. Science
is moving onwards at a fast pace all the time. The report suggests that
both Houses of Parliament should have a role in listening to all the
arguments, in representing the different views in the legislative
process and in deciding what should be legal for the time
being&#151;because what is legal now was not legal 20 years
ago.</p><p><a name="06070310000395"><b><a name="06070310000670">Mr.

&#147;They will be back.&#148; I am quite surprised that it has
taken the scientific community and the Government so long to come back
to the House. I support the Select Committee&#146;s call for
parliamentary oversight and a new parliamentary Standing Committee on
bioethics. Only then will all sides have the chance to be heard and
will there be an opportunity for the evidence to be weighed.</p><p><a name="06070310000397">I wonder how
many Members and how many of our constituents are familiar with the
complexities of reproductive cloning, hybrids and chimeras,
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, embryo splitting, parthenogenesis,
cell nuclear transplants, sperm sorting and haploidisation. Those
things are happening around us, for our constituents, in our
constituencies, every day of the year. They are real. They are
happening today. We cannot ignore them. We cannot say that we wish that
they did not happen, because they are happening.</p><p><a name="06070310000398">For that reason, I was
surprised by the announcement from the Vatican last week, as reported
in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>. The headline
was:</p><a name="06070310000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Vatican
vows to expel stem cell scientists from
Church&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000399">When the
Committee visited the Vatican, it was a huge privilege to be invited to
visit the archbishops and bishops and their medical advisers and
experts, who did us great courtesy and showed us great respect, as we
did them. They will be reading this debate&#151;if not watching it in
the Vatican. I would like, therefore, to put on record my thanks to
them for putting up with us when we challenged them with some very
difficult ideas&#151;perhaps of a nature with which they were not
familiar. Perhaps they were not used to being confronted by
parliamentarians, because the politics of Italy are different and the
role of the Church in Italy is different.</p><p><a name="06070310000400">I am sorry that the Vatican
made that announcement last week and that Cardinal Alfonso Lopez
Trujillo said, in an interview with <i> Famiglia Christiana</i>, an
official Vatican
magazine:</p><a name="06070310000444"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Excommunication
will be applied to the women, doctors and researchers who eliminate

therefore commend the courage of the Italian senator, Paola Binetti, a

said:</p><a name="06070310000446"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am

is a mistake to give out the idea that God is angry with Man because he
is not in agreement with
him.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000404">I agree with that.
The Vatican&#146;s reaction looks a bit like panic.</p><p><a name="06070310000405">I want to make a few comments
about the question of so-called eugenics and designer babies. The whole
argument is tainted by our memory of the appalling atrocity of Nazism
and all that happened then. The word &#147;eugenics&#148; is Greek
and simply means well bred and well-being&#151;a good baby. Of
course, that is not how it is usually applied. Surely there is a great
difference between seeking to create a child with particular
characteristics such as blue eyes&#151;or a child 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 552</b><br>who is sporty or musical&#151;to make a master race, and trying to
filter out the damaging parts of this fragile human life where that is
humanly possible. I have wrestled with that problem for
years.</p><p><a name="06070310000406">I recall that
when the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill was going through the
House in 1989 and 1990, I asked my bishop, John Baker, whether he would
help. On 20 February 1990, he wrote this to
me:</p><a name="06070310000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where
nature itself spontaneously aborts a good many embryos in these very
early stages of life, it is hard to feel that to do so deliberately for
good reason is contrary to God&#146;s own mind, so far as that is
revealed in his created order. Moreover, if we are to be realistic, we
human beings are not spiritually, psychologically and socially all so
marvellous that we can promise the spina bifida or cystic fibrosis
sufferer a quality and fulfilment of life that will make the burden of
their sufferings worthwhile. On the whole if you can choose to launch
either a life without these such handicaps or one with them, it seems
morally better to choose the former. Many parents must pray for a
disease-free child; when we are given the power to bring that about
ourselves, what does it say about our prayer if we refuse to use that
power?&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070310000407">That puts that
argument rather powerfully, and it is as true now as it was.</p><p><a name="06070310000408">It is very important,
therefore, to be careful when we are talking about designer babies to
be clear that we are not talking about designing something to our own
wish or to our own vision of a perfect child, but using science, which
in my view is God-given, to enable us to use our brains to stop
suffering as far as we may. I also feel&#151;the hon. Member for
Bolton, South-East(Dr. Iddon) said this eloquently, and I
agree with everything that he said&#151;that within the law, families
should make decisions on their reproduction and not the state. The
state does have a role, but we need to rebalance the
arguments.</p><p><a name="06070310000409">Finally, I
want to say a quick word about abortion, because we cannot ignore it;
it is part of the issue, and our report said what we thought we should
be doing about it. If we want less abortion, we must look very
carefully at the figures. Of the 185,000 abortions a year, just 124
occur after 24 weeks. If we are seeking to reduce the quantity of
abortions in this country, does it make sense to vilify the tiny number
of extremely vulnerable women in the most difficult and terrible
circumstances who are in that category, and to say that they are
somehow doing something unspeakable? I think not.</p><p><a name="06070310000410">Let us look
at the other end of the scale, too. Frequently we are told how awful it
is that there are so many teenage pregnancies. I asked the Office for
National Statistics for the figures, and in my constituency in the past
10 years the number of abortions among girls under 16 was 14. The ONS
refused to set the figures out by year because it said that that would
break confidentiality. We are talking very small numbers. The highest
proportion of abortions in this country are performed on single women
and those who have had abortions before. Perhaps that is where we
should be considering education; something is wrong there. The hon.
Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith), who, sadly, is no
longer present, used the word &#147;Frankensteins&#148;, but the
proportion of abortions on the grounds of chromosomal abnormality is
one third of 1 per cent.&#151;that is all. If we want fewer abortions
in our country&#151;and, God knows, I am sure we all do&#151;we
will need more human reproductive technology and much more
education.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 553</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06070310000455">5.43

Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> I quake a little when
somebody says that we should have these debates in Parliament, because
we will need about six weeks to go through the many issues that reflect
our consciences and beliefs. It was not easy chairing the
Committee&#151;delightful bunch of people as they are; men and women
united, just for a minute. I assure the House that I would much rather
take penalties in the last minute than have to chair a Committee that
was so severely divided. My attitude was, &#147;Let&#146;s just
stay here all night&#148;, and without my hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) moving a guillotine motion&#151;nasty
man&#151;we could have debated the issues for hours and hours. That
reflects the problems.</p><p><a name="06070310000412">We have come
a long way in science from the days when we believed that only one
parent was responsible for the creation of an individual. One was
either an ovist or a spermist&#151;there are pictures of sperm with
young people within them&#151;and that was how it all happened. It is
not so long ago that we believed that. It is not so long ago, too, that
we did not believe in genes and DNA&#151;in fact, science in the
Soviet Union was based on that for many years. In this area, knowledge
moves on and beliefs change, and they do so pretty fast.</p><p><a name="06070310000413">We as a
Parliament need to regulate and legislate in respect of many of the
processes that we have been discussing. However, we have to do more
than that: we have to think about why we are regulating or legislating.
In industry, there is continuous debate about whether legislation
inhibits productivity, industrial growth, and so on. Sometimes we do
nothing and sometimes we overreact, but I think that we in this country
do nothing rather well. We do not get caught up in regulation, yet the
world does not crumble about us. The same is true in the field that we
are debating now, and that was the spirit in our Committee: we wanted
to examine what was happening and make sure that we got legislation
where it is needed. We were told at the beginning of our inquiry that
nothing needed to happen&#151;that we should leave the subject alone.
Well, 104 recommendations suggest that something needs to
change.</p><p><a name="06070310000414">One has to
ask whether the purpose of regulation should be to provide legal
protection for the embryo, or to provide some regulation of assisted
reproduction, or both. In fact, a regulator is not needed to protect
the embryo. If the law says that a person cannot clone an embryo and
someone does, one just calls 999 and gets the police in. Regulating IVF
treatment is different, of course. IVF treatment is increasing and will
continue to do so. Endocrine disruptors, which we have heard about, and
many other factors are lowering sperm counts and otherwise making
people infertile, but the desire to have a baby is an innate human
characteristic, so there will be more pressure on IVF provision. The
hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) will remember that when IVF
was first introduced, people said that it was a pariah that would
destroy the world and that it must not happen, but now it is a standard
technique, even though there is not enough of it in the health service,
and it is improving all the time. Should the regulator regulate only
for technical standards, or do we want it to enforce directions on how
treatment is administered, or so on? The spirit of our recommendations
was not dogmatic: we were trying to help the new science to
develop.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 554</b><br><p><a name="06070310000415">The HFEA was an extremely
important addition under the 1990 Act. Regulation was extremely
important to building public confidence in that legislation. However,
events have moved on. We are not all old Labour&#151;despite what
some believe, we know that changes have to happen. We have to move on
and the HFEA and its functions need to be examined seriously. For
example, does it have the right people on it? It would not worry me at
all if pro-life people had places on the authority, which they have
been denied. We should get them in, have those arguments and not
restrict them, because that diminishes the authority and makes people
suspicious.</p><p><a name="06070310000416">Is the
HFEA rigorous enough about licensing and inspection? The HFEA has a
triple role&#151;regulator, policy maker and Government
adviser&#151;but it is not possible to fulfil all three functions.
That is why the Committee said that we should try to separate them and
why we said that Parliament&#146;s role was extremely important.
There is a plethora of knowledgeable, concerned people present in the
Chamber and many more outside. I believe that the public would welcome
involvement in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="06070310000417">The HFEA is to merge with the
Human Tissue Authority. We wonder whether that is a political move. The
virtues of such a merger have to be explained, because&#151;of
course&#151;the British Medical Association is none too happy at the
prospect. We could think about merging the HFEA and the Human Genetics
Commission&#151;Baroness Kennedy&#146;s group, which examines many
issues, such as the new genetic science and its effect on disabled
people. The bodies could all work together in harmony much better than
they do.</p><p><a name="06070310000418">We have heard
about the problems of reproductive tourism. I think that it will be
hard to stop both that and reproductive cloning, which someone will
carry out successfully some day. I remember when people said that we
could not clone a sheep or cat, but we have done that, so humans will
be in the wings. We thus need to think about the regulation that we
will need for inspecting
that.</p><p><a name="06070310000419">Do we need a
national bioethics committee? The public now want a consideration of
morality and their views to be put in the relevant arena. Everyone else
seems to have such a committee, but we do not. Is that because such
committees are perceived as expensive talking shops? Could we establish
a body that was really meaningful? Will Parliament really be the best
place to make the big decisions? Should we stop giving such issues to
quangos?</p><p><a name="06070310000420">Judgments
are also made by local ethical committees. Are the decisions that are
made at local level tough enough, or is it the case that just the great
and the good&#151;the local vicar and so on&#151;are appointed to
those committees and that they have a nice afternoon cup of tea and a
biscuit and then go home? The question of how we achieve localism in
such decisions is
serious.</p><p><a name="06070310000421">Things will
never stand still in this area because new, unforeseen possibilities
will arise and be combined with market forces and new dilemmas that
emerge. As many hon. Members have said, regulation must keep up with
that without inhibiting research&#151;even if one thinks that that
could be stopped. I accept that scientists can be arrogant and think
that they can rule the world, but that is why they must engage with the
political process and be brought into that arena. If they are kept out,

<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 555</b><br>they will have that opinion. We should not really start from where we
are now, but think about starting all over again, given all the new
developments that have taken
place.</p><p><a name="06070310000422">It is lovely if
there is a mum, dad and child. It is lovely when a man meets a girl and
they fall in love, before there is the question of having children, and
they then live happily ever after and everything is perfect in
God&#146;s perfect land, as Neil Young would say. However, sadly, it
does not always work like that for some people, and there are other
types of relationships. The world has moved on to accept such people
and be disciplined about them. We must incorporate that in our
thinking. The problem is not major, but we must take it seriously.
Nothing is really sacred, not even the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990&#151;but gosh, to hear some people talk, one
would think that it had to be protected at all
costs.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070315000156">5.52

growing concern with many of my constituents that children are often
seen as the ultimate accessory. People used to have Gucci handbags or
high-pedigree Dalmatians, but now it seems that people express their
individuality by going around having children. On that basis, the
child&#146;s welfare is important. Not everyone has the right to have
a child. I believe, although it might be unfashionable to do so, that
children are a gift. I have spoken to many people in the homosexual
community about the lifestyle that they choose to lead. Many of them
are perfectly comfortable with the idea that their lifestyle choice
excludes them from having children. Therefore, before we go down the
road of supporting the idea that same-sex couples should have access to
IVF, we should realise that it is the minority of such couples who are
looking to do that.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 556</b><br><p><a name="06070315000006"><b><a name="06070315000167">Dr.

Walker:</b> Not in the slightest. I made the lifestyle choice
of getting married and having children. People make such choices. If
one chooses to live in a same-sex relationship, it is difficult to have
children naturally. I have a good friend who is a homosexual. He and
his homosexual partner found a surrogate mother and had a child. Those
two men are excellent parents and I am fond of them both, but that does
not mean that I believe that children&#146;s best interests are
served, in the main, by having two fathers, or that I subscribe to the
idea that gay couples should automatically have the right to have
children.</p><p><a name="06070315000008">The
scientific community seems to have its own agenda. We read in the
newspapers today that Britain is about to have its oldest mother
because a woman of 60&#151;I believe&#151;is about to have a child.
Whose interests will that serve&#151;those of the child who is born,
the woman having the child, or the scientific community? What will
happen next year? Will a woman of 70 or 80 be Britain&#146;s oldest
mother? The House needs to exercise control over what the scientific
community is doing in this area, because the child&#146;s welfare
should be absolutely
paramount.</p><p><a name="06070315000009"><b><a name="06070315000169">Dr.

Walker:</b> Absolutely not, because as the hon. Gentleman
knows full well, men are biologically able to go on having children
into their 70s and 80s. However, what is proved by deliberately taking
a woman who is past her point of fertility&#151;perhaps 15 or 20
years past&#151;and impregnating
her?</p><p><a name="06070315000011"><b><a name="06070315000171">Dr.

Walker:</b> If the hon. Gentleman really believes that giving
60, 70 or 80-year-old women the choice of having children is a good
thing that will benefit the welfare of those children, I am afraid that
we will have to disagree. Where we will disagree, time and time again,
is about the idea that the welfare of the children should be paramount,
and the fact that it is probably not in the interests of a one or
two-year-old to have a 70 or 80-year-old
mother.</p><p><a name="06070315000013">When we have
debates on reproduction in the future, I hope that we will remember
that children live with the consequences of decisions made by adults.
They do not ask to be born, but they will be with us for a long time. I
also hope that we can have a bit of emotion in such debates, because
when we talk about human life and small people, it is perfectly
reasonable to get emotional about their future and their
welfare.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 557</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06070315000157">5.59

Desmond Turner (Brighton, Kemptown) (Lab):</b> I will try to
bring the debate back to the mainstream of the subject. We should
remember the context in which we start. On the whole, the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and the system of regulation have
served us well for the past 15 or 16 years. But time moves on, the
science has moved on at a great pace, and the time has naturally come
to start reviewing the situation. The Government had already decided
that it was an apt time to do that, and so had we, especially as
several controversial decisions were coming up. It was a natural time
to look into the
matter.</p><p><a name="06070315000015">We
need to continue our history over the past 16 years of having a
framework that provides good clinical services for those who need
infertility treatment, and a good research environment that is well
regulated so that researchers know clearly what they can and cannot do.
For that reason&#151;the fact that we have a working environment that
is safe and well controlled&#151;more than any other, we lead the
world in matters such as embryology research and embryological stem
cell research.</p><p><a name="06070315000016">In
other countries there is not necessarily such an environment. There
have been plenty of examples of that. Where have the threats to clone
human beings been coming from? They have come not from our own
regulated environment, but from countries where, for whatever reason,
the Government have not been able to get to grips with the
issues.</p><p><a name="06070315000017">Those issues
seem to come back to questions of religion and ethics. That was
apparent when the Committee went to Scandinavia and then to the
Vatican. The Scandinavian attitude was pragmatic. Basically, it boiled
down to this: if there is no demonstrable harm to the child, it must by
okay and things should be left alone. However, the Vatican had a very
different attitude. In his refreshingly sane contribution, the hon.
Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) described the theological progress on
this issue. The Vatican position is that human life starts at the
moment of fertilisation, and that even the zygote has the full rights
of a human being.</p><p><a name="06070315000018">That creates a great cultural
limitation on what can be done, and for a long time Italy was totally
unregulated and had no legislation on in vitro fertilisation. The
consequence of that was some awful practice. One man was threatening to
perform human cloning, and finally Italy legislated, but its
legislation in this area, which it introduced just a few months before
we did, was very imperfect. For instance, it demanded that all embryos
should be immediately implanted once they were produced, and that they
could not be stored frozen. That meant that there was a much greater
risk of harm, both to the child and the mother, because it was not
possible to screen out unhealthy embryos, to do pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis&#151;PGD&#151;or to eliminate the possibility of
implanting an embryo that was very genetically defective. The net
result is a higher incidence of multiple births and birth defects, and
greater harm, because the legislation is not sensible and has not
grasped the nettles that needed to be grasped. We in this country have
grasped them in the past, and we need to continue to do
so.</p><p><a name="06070315000019">Let us look at a
few examples of the problems that arise, which mean that we must
carefully re-examine the legislation. One problem is the PGD issue. At 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 558</b><br>present, that is strictly limited to serious life-terminating genetic
diseases, but the science has moved on so dramatically that a vast
range of diseases can now be diagnosed in the embryo&#151;and to a
far greater extent than it is currently licensable to use that
technique. We must take stock and ask, &#147;Is it reasonable to
avoid using the embryo that would produce a type 1 juvenile diabetic,
for instance, and to use the one that would not?&#148; There are many
such diseases, which are survivable but clearly undesirable. That
matter must be discussed sanely and rationally. Such borders need
constantly to be revisited.</p><p><a name="06070315000020">Let me give another example. In
the context of tissue typing, there was the Hashmi case: the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority licensed an application to
produce a baby who could be a tissue donor for its sibling, who already
existed but had thalassemia and did not have much of a life expectancy.
Tissue typing was essential; otherwise the stem cells would have been
rejected.</p><p><a name="06070315000021">That case
has led to a succession of legal challenges, because the HFEA was
working right at the policy limits of the legislation. Effectively, it
was almost making law. Was it within its statutory limits or not? The
High Court said no, but the Appeal Court overturned that judgment, and
the case went to the House of Lords; I do not know what its decision
was. We should not determine such issues through the courts. We need to
make sure that the regulations and laws that we set down in this place
are clear enough to keep lawyers out of this area, so that it can be
left to doctors and would-be parents.</p><p><a name="06070315000022">I have given two examples, but
there are others. I am thinking now of mitochondrial diseases. At
present, cell nuclear replacement can be used only for research
purposes, but the time will come when it will be technically possible
to use it therapeutically. That is not currently legal, but why should
it be illegal?</p><p><a name="06070315000023">As for
cloning, we as a society are totally opposed to human reproductive
cloning, and our report&#151;contrary to what some people might
suggest&#151;does not suggest for one moment that we should do
anything more. Therapeutic cloning is a totally different issue; that
is absolutely essential if we are to pursue the production of new
embryonic stem cell lines. But in 20 or 30 years, if techniques of
reproductive cloning have become demonstrably safe, it is perfectly
possible that Parliament and the public might want a different outcome.
That is certainly not true at present, but the question needs to be
revisited from time to time.</p><p><a name="06070315000024">This House should play a
central role in determining these issues. It should not be left to the
HFEA to make policy in these difficult areas. It has enough of a job to
do with its licensing and regulatory functions. I strongly subscribe to
our recommendation that there should be a House bioethics Committee
that should keep this area under constant review, make annual reports
to Parliament, recommend amendments to legislation when it feels them
to be appropriate, and conduct pre-legislative scrutiny of draft
legislation as it emerges. Such a body should be the key actor in the
future, but the whole of Parliament should have a vote on its
recommendations. That way, we will take full responsibility for
them.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 559</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06070315000158">6.10

Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b> As a society, we are
increasingly uncomfortable with the existence of received wisdom and
moral certainties. It is probably also true to say that we are becoming
uncomfortable even with the principles of secular morality&#151;be it
utilitarian or libertarian. Such secular morality is increasingly
branded as an extension of &#147;public interest&#148;, so that it
need not appear to be morality at all. The Warnock report proposed that
the putative regulatory body for biotechnology should not be</p><a name="06070315000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;exclusively, or even primarily, a
medical or scientific body. It is concerned essentially with broader
matters and the protection of the public
interest.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000026">It is perhaps
fitting that a body that exists to deal with, among other things, the
ethical dilemmas posed by genetic hybrids and chimeras, should be
similarly heterogeneous. But it is true that scientific evidence and
more traditional moral yardsticks must continue to complement one
another. The ascendancy of science untrammelled by other concerns leads
us into dark
places.</p><p><a name="06070315000027">The
Committee&#146;s investigation of eugenics and pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis, for example, touched on the potential disaster of
social objectives triumphing over ethical objections. Perhaps that is
the danger implicit in conflating ethical, clinical and political
judgments, which is why I believe that the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority might no longer be fit for purpose. There must now
be a solid case for reconsidering its remit&#151;and, consequently,
its composition&#151;from the ground up.</p><p><a name="06070315000028">The intention
to merge the HFEA and the Human Tissue Authority into a new regulatory
authority provides an important opportunity to address the fundamental
concerns about the biotechnology regulatory regime that the Committee
expressed. The fact that the new authority will no longer be called the
regulatory authority for fertility and tissue does not mean that it
cannot become a &#147;RAFT&#148; in troubled ethical waters. The
HFEA&#146;s most important failings are not those related to the
practical problems that, to some extent, afflict all Government
organisations. It is no surprise that the Committee&#146;s
recommendation 66 highlights critical failings in the agency&#146;s
data management policies. Nor is it a surprise, for example, that the
Government&#146;s response lays the blame on the goose that has so
often failed to lay a golden egg: IT
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06070315000029">I was,
however, more struck by the Committee&#146;s findings on the
HFEA&#146;s inadequate expertise. I want to focus my remarks on
recommendation 47, and particularly the following statement:</p><a name="06070315000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that
ultimate authority on issues of public concern should lie outside of
the scientific and medical
communities.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000030">That is a
sound principle, although many would argue that the scientific and
medical communities do not harbour nefarious intentions of the kind
that would make them incapable of self-regulation by their various
professional bodies. But even if the status quo of lay dominance over
day-to-day decisions is to be preserved, it is indefensible for the
HFEA to lack a sound basis of scientific expertise; that must be
corrected in any new body.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 560</b><br><p><a name="06070315000031">My concern is that insufficient
parliamentary time is given to these complex ethical decisions, which
are based on a rapidly evolving scientific evidence base. The
introduction to the Committee&#146;s report notes the statement, made
during an earlier inquiry, that, after12 years of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, it was necessary to</p><a name="06070315000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reconnect the Act with modern
science.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000032">It
also reiterated earlier criticism of the complacency of certain members
of the HFEA, and the Department of Health&#146;s &#147;limp
response&#148; regarding a policy of constant review. If the HFEA is
not keeping abreast of a rapidly advancing field because it has
insufficient expertise or organisational capacity, it is clearly
necessary to do one of two
things.</p><p><a name="06070315000033">The
first option is to return regulation to the relevant professional
bodies. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated in
evidence that</p><a name="06070315000148"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the body
regulating this area should have sufficient expertise in its make up to
tackle some of the difficult clinical, scientific and ethical issues
presented to
it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000034">Does
that description not include the professional bodies themselves? We
should at least be asking whether regulation can safely be left in the
hands of the royal colleges or the British Medical Association, safe in
the knowledge that they are deemed capable of engaging with other
complex areas of medical ethics. After all, the Committee made a number
of recommendations concerning professional bodies&#146; increased
involvement in the management of clinical and laboratory standards. It
is only a small step from that position to professional bodies&#146;
wholesale involvement in the development and review of an appropriate
regulatory regime. It is only the Warnock principle of lay primacy over
these ethical questions that holds us
back.</p><p><a name="06070315000035">Alternatively,
we must establish a regime of regular statutory review by Parliament.
It is time to turn our backs on a generation of ad hoc, laissez-faire
intervention by Parliament, which relies on the initiative of Back
Benchers to ensure that the law is kept in touch with science. That is
particularly apposite in the case of the law relating to abortion. I am
not an expert on accepted parliamentary practice concerning Back-Bench
initiation of legislation, but it seems in this instance to be a
convenient caveat to justify the Government&#146;s
inertia.</p><p><a name="06070315000036">I do not want
to go too far off piste and into the dangerous territory of advocating
a review of the time limit applicable to abortion, about which we have
heard much already. The decision whether to allow abortion up to 24
weeks, 20 weeks or even 18 weeks should be based on the available
scientific evidence and should, if anything, err on the side of caution
when it comes to the protection of a potentially viable
foetus&#151;in other words, a potential life. But, above all, I do
not believe that the Government should absolve themselves, or
Parliament, from the responsibility of regularly engaging in the
ethical debate on the regulation of human reproductive technology. I
believe that Parliament, not the HFEA, is the only crucible in which
these questions can be discussed fully, because we are uniquely placed
to respond to the scientific evidence, as well as to ethical problems
and public opinion. The HFEA is quite wrong to view its role as
insulating Parliament from difficult ethical choices.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 561</b><br><p><a name="06070315000037">I
am heartened by the strength of support of witnesses called by the
Committee for Parliament&#146;s increased participation in difficult
ethical situations. The Committee&#146;s recommendations about
parliamentary involvement are very welcome, particularly on the need
for Parliament to be able to revisit contentious issues. But more than
that, I am pleased that the Committee recognises the benefit of the
increased public confidence that stems from greater parliamentary
involvement in difficult ethical questions. It is, after all, easy to
lobby a Member of Parliament on a free vote&#151;and much less
plausible that anyone should lobby the HFEA.</p><p><a name="06070315000038">The HFEA is an unhappy
compromise between scientific, evidence-based decision making and the
Warnock principle governing the primacy of lay ethical opinion. If that
primacy is still required, its proper forum is Parliament&#151;a
point that the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) alluded
to earlier. The Government must now take steps to see that Parliament
is entrusted with the regular review of the legislation governing
biotechnology. Only Parliament has the resources to co-ordinate and
balance the available scientific evidence, the ethical concerns, and
the vagaries and inconsistencies of public opinion that are vital to
this area of law. More importantly, only Parliament has the moral
authority to ensure that the law keeps pace with scientific advances,
without exceeding ethical boundaries or failing to meet public
expectation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070315000159">6.19

Thornberry (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab):</b> I
appreciate the opportunity to address the House on recommendation 77 of
the Science and Technology Committee, which calls on both
Houses</p><a name="06070315000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147; to set up a
joint committee to consider the scientific, medical and social changes
in relation to abortion that have taken place since 1967, with a view
to presenting options for new
legislation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000040">I take the
opportunity to examine that recommendation, and particularly the
suggestion that there might be a case for reducing the time limit. I
want to put on record some facts about how many late abortions there
are, and I want to consider whether there really have been scientific,
medical or social changes of sufficient importance to warrant serious
consideration of changes in the law. I do not believe that there have
been.</p><p><a name="06070315000041">It is important
to recognise the passion that is provoked by the subject. It confronts
many people&#146;s core beliefs, and that includes me. It is one of
my core beliefs that it is important for every woman to be able to
control her fertility. Without such a basic right, women have no chance
of equality. No contraceptive method is 100 per cent. effective, and no
woman should be forced to carry and bear a child that she profoundly
does not want. Abortions must therefore be available. It is right for
everyone involved in the debate to declare their own interests, not in
the Alda Barry sense of declaring an interest, but as regards their
core beliefs.</p><p><a name="06070315000042">It is
important that those on the other side of the debate make it clear
where they are coming from on the issue. One of the reasons the
argument for restricting the time limit is so unconvincing is that it
is often put by people who themselves are not convinced by it, and who
take the pragmatic stance that if they cannot make abortion illegal or
criminal, they will do their best to restrict access as much as they
can.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 562</b><br><p><a name="06070315000043"><b><a name="06070315000176">Daniel

abortion should be illegal and that there should be no abortions, yet
he joins the debate. I believe it is women, not Parliament or the

decisions.</p><p><a name="06070315000045">On
the question whether there have been sufficient scientific or medical
changes to support a change in the law, let me start with a few facts
about late abortions. No one wants to have a late abortion if there is
any other realistic option. Less than 1 per cent. of abortions take
place after 22 weeks, and 87 per cent. of abortions take place before
13
weeks.</p><p><a name="06070315000046"><b><a name="06070315000178">Mr.

late?</p><p><a name="06070315000049"><b><a name="06070315000181">Emily
Thornberry:</b> Yes. Women who have abortions late are very
young, or women going through the menopause, women who do not speak
English, women who come across the one fifth of GPs who say they are
broadly anti-abortion, women who have had difficulty accessing services
and women who are scared, ill educated or marginalised. It is those
people who are confronted with such a decision and who, with the
assistance and support of medical services, make that extremely
difficult decision. It is for them and not for the hon. Gentleman to
make that
decision.</p><p><a name="06070315000050">There have
not been any dramatic scientific breakthroughs in recent years. The
survival rates are still very low for babies born before 24 weeks,
and those that do survive frequently survive with severe disabilities.
Last June, doctors at the annual conference of the British Medical
Association overwhelmingly rejected a motion calling for the upper
limit to be cut from 24 to 20 weeks&#151;77 per cent. of doctors
voted against it.</p><p><a name="06070315000051">The
spark that has reignited the debate on time limits is not medical
advances, but the beautiful and highly emotive 4D images of foetuses
offered by Professor Campbell in his private London clinic. Foetuses
can be seen opening their eyes, kicking their legs and sucking their
thumbs, but as Allan Templeton, the secretary of the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said, the images add little to the
science. If we want a debate about the science, let us talk about the
science. He
says:</p><a name="06070315000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Observing

be laid before the House. If she is wrong and there is new evidence,

descends into raw emotion and prejudice. I stated my position at the
beginning. We have heard from other hon. Members what their position
is. In the end, the decision often comes down to emotion, how people
feel and their own sense of what is right or wrong. That is why I
believe it is for individual women to make the decision, because it is
a profoundly personal
decision.</p><p><a name="06070315000057">The Marie

easier for families, the most important thing for us to do is to
improve sex education in schools and relationship education so that
people treat one another with respect, so that young girls know that
they do not need to sleep with their boyfriends in order to be
important and in order for their boyfriends to love them, and so that
people have respect for themselves and one another. That should be
comprehensively taught in our schools, and we should also ensure that

Afriyie (Windsor) (Con):</b> With 104 recommendations, the
report by the Science and Technology Committee is as deep as it is
wide. As a current member of the Committee, I did not play a part in
its production. Given its size, I am quite glad about that. I thank the
original members of the Committee, especially its former Chairman, the
hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), for the inquiry and for
the clear report and
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06070315000061">The
report rightly and necessarily challenges our emotional, ethical and
religious boundaries. In the field of human fertilisation and
embryology, scientific advances, developments and possibilities arise
almost daily. I am concerned about the group of people who donate in
order to help childless couples to conceive and have children.
Recommendation 33 criticises the Government in relation to the removal
of anonymity for those donors. It states:</p><a name="06070315000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We regret the
Department&#146;s poor use of evidence in policy-making and its
failure to commission and have published the necessary research

anonymity.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000062">One
could argue that there is now a threat to the flow of donors who have
been giving willingly. In their response, the Government reject the
recommendation on the basis that they used questionnaires,
consultations and surveys to discover the views of interested parties.
However, discoveries in social, behavioural and economic science often
require concerted effort through research or the commissioning of
research for science-based evidence.</p><p><a name="06070315000063">My question to the

scientific evidence was used to inform the Government&#146;s decision
completely and retrospectively to change the policy on the disclosure
of information on donors? The service provided by donors to couples
struggling to conceive is undeniable and self-evident. If the policy is
not based on appropriate evidence, the Government may undermine the
supply of donors and create a great deal of unhappiness for childless
couples in

the report and a very fair version of it. He inherited the report and
cannot claim that it is his baby, to coin a phrase, but he described it
well.</p><p><a name="06070315000066">The hon.

a fantastic job in difficult circumstances. I hugely admire his
commitment to science and to his work in the Committee. I extend those
remarks to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), for whom I have
huge admiration that increased, were that possible, as I listened to
his speech.</p><p><a name="06070315000067">Producing
the report was difficult, because five people supported many of the
recommendations and five people opposed them. The difficulty faced by
those of us in the notional majority was that when it came to debating
and voting on the recommendations, the minority had found it difficult
to turn up because of the pressures that have been described. It is
hard to develop coherence when people vote four against one in some
sittings and five against five in others.</p><p><a name="06070315000068">I do not accept that the report
is libertarian. It is liberalising. However, it does not argue for a
change in the 14-day limit, which is the fundamental limit in the 1990
settlement and in Warnock; it does not argue against the Warnock
consensus on the gradual acquisition of rights in consideration of the
interests of the embryo and the foetus; and it does not argue, as it
could have done, for liberalisation of abortion law. It was not
extremist or libertarian, but it is fair to say that it was
brave.</p><p><a name="06070315000069">The Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority felt that it was attacked in the
report, but it was not, as the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)
explained. I must be careful about the HFEA, because two of its last
three chairs are constituents of mine. The estimable Ruth Deech and the
estimable Bishop of Oxford, recently retired, are extremely senior
people in their field and brook no unjustified criticism. However, the
report should not be seen as a criticism of the HFEA, which does a
difficult job using a law that is 16 years old and creaking at the
seams and should not be dragged through the courts.</p><p><a name="06070315000070">I greatly enjoyed the speech by
the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton). Although I disagree with
her, she speaks for many people. She made several points that are worth
responding to, including some in which she mentioned me. She talked
about society&#146;s distaste for some of the report&#146;s
recommendations, although she did not provide data to back that up,
except in the case of sex selection, which I accept that a majority of
people currently oppose. However, it is not good enough for us to base
our law and lawmaking on the yuck factor, particularly when it involves
fundamental rights such as the reproductive rights of other adult human
beings. That is why the Government were right to legislate to permit
gay adoption although 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 566</b><br>a majority of people found that distasteful and something that they did
not understand. I am fairly sure that the hon. Lady voted against
permitting adoption of children by gay couples. The Conservative
approach is usually to argue for less state intervention in private
lives unless there is good evidence of harm that requires it. That is a
reasonable position. However, it was suggested in several well reasoned
contributions that the instinct on some of these issues is to regulate
and to legislate to restrict freedom, in which case it is necessary to
provide the relevant
evidence.</p><p><a name="06070315000071">Much has
been said about abortion and whether we should debate it.
Recommendation 77 argues for a future debate after a review of the law.
The hon. Members for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) and for Bolton,
South-East (Dr. Iddon), who are assiduous members of the Committee,
spoke well and clearly on the subject. I do not agree with the hon.
Member for Bolton, South-East that there have been lots of debates on
abortion, in Government time or otherwise. There have not. We had the
Abortion Act 1967 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990,
and last July I called an Adjournment debate on abortion time limits.
Other than that, I can find no record of parliamentary time devoted
specifically to abortion, other than on ten-minute Bills. We need to
have such a debate in order to retain public
confidence.</p><p><a name="06070315000072">The hon.
Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) gave a
full-blooded pro-choice speech that I greatly enjoyed. It is important
that that view, which reflects the majority view in the country, is
heard. We do not often hear it because the other side is well organised
and feels equally strongly about such matters. However, the hon. Lady
must acknowledge that her argument&#151;and the reasons that she gave
and that the Stopes report set out&#151;that the individual decisions
are for women to make applies at 25 weeks as well as 24, and that
Parliament must set a limit. The question is how Parliament determines
that limit.</p><p><a name="06070315000073">In 1990,
the limit was based on viability at 24 weeks. If that period has
reduced, the hon. Lady may continue to vote for 24 weeks as a practical
limit, and I might support her, having listened to the arguments for
why any such reduction should cut across the rights of women in
difficult positions. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough said, Parliament must debate that and make
its decision: for a practical limit of 24 weeks, a viability limit of
24 weeks or a lower limit, if it believes, on the basis of scientific
evidence, that the limit on which viability was previously based has
reduced.</p><p><a name="06070315000074">I share the
hon. Lady&#146;s scepticism about whether medical advances have
reduced the time on which viability is based&#151;if we believe that
to mean a reasonable chance of surviving a reasonable length of time
without unreasonable disability&#151;from 24 weeks. However, like my
hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, I do not know
the answer and Parliament should have an opportunity of examining the
science before
deciding.</p><p><a name="06070315000075">Our
recommendation in the report went beyond viability and considered other
issues, including medical and social advances that suggest that, for
example, access to early medical abortion, which is an easier way to
have abortions&#151;if we are to accept abortions, we should not
force women to go through more difficulty 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 567</b><br>than necessary&#151;reduces later abortions. There is a good argument
for making access to early medical abortion
easier.</p><p><a name="06070315000076">The hon.
Member for Bolton, South-East set out why we believed that sex
selection for social reasons might be considered, and that good
arguments against it would have to be made. He also clearly set out our
reasons for supporting research.</p><p><a name="06070315000077">It has been
said that I have strong views on the suggested welfare of the child
provision. That also applies to the rest of the Committee. I believe
that a provision for considering the welfare of a potential child when
dealing with the creation of families by the small group of people who
are infertile is discriminatory. It is the wrong way to protect the
welfare of the child, which we must do. Social services and child
protection bodies are best placed, when a child is born, to make a risk
assessment, especially if they have had a warning when someone began
the treatment process that there was some anxiety. Experts should make
such an assessment, not gynaecologists or general practitioners who
hardly know their patients and are not in a good position to make such
decisions. We heard evidence in Committee that such intervention was
pointless because it was ineffective and ignored, and that the birth of
only 10 children a year was avoided through the process. They could be
looked after through the other means that I described. Do we want state
regulation of fertility? I do not believe that we do, certainly not
without good evidence that it would be better to do that. Are we
genuinely arguing that it is better not to be born than to take such
steps?</p><p><a name="06070315000078">On the need
for a father, I believe that it is discriminatory and restrictive to
subject some women to such a test. The state must have good reason for
intervening in such matters and there is no good evidence to show that
the children of lesbian parents or single women who specifically seek
reproductive treatment are any the worse off for that background.
Evidence exists to show that children born to poor families do worse
than those born to rich families. Would hon. Members call for clinics
to check on the need for cash in the family before offering fertility
treatment? No, of course we would not do that. That would also be
discriminatory, even though there is more evidence of poor welfare in
those circumstances.</p><p><a name="06070315000079">Providing for the need for a
father creates a market for internet services such as &#147;Man Not
Included&#148;. If we start regulating those services, women will
turn to strangers to be impregnated, and there is no protection in such
cases. I do not believe that it is a matter of common sense because one
person&#146;s common sense is another&#146;s
prejudice.</p><p><a name="06070315000080"><b><a name="06070315000188">Daniel
Kawczynski: </b>The hon. Gentleman says that
we should not discriminate against lesbian couples but, unfortunately,
life is discriminatory. The Almighty decided that children would be
made through intercourse between a man and a woman. That is
nature&#146;s way of creating children. Why does he discount
that?</p><p><a name="06070315000081"><b><a name="06070315000189">Dr.
Harris:</b> We could have a philosophical debate about what
God intended and how much of medical science is playing God and going
against what nature 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 568</b><br>intended. Treatment for erectile dysfunction also interferes with what
God intended but we do not hear many men arguing against access to such
treatment.</p><p><a name="06070315000082"><b><a name="06070315000190">Daniel

yourself.</p><p><a name="06070315000083"><b><a name="06070315000191">Dr.
Harris:</b> I shall not take the hon. Gentleman up on that in
the debate because I must finish my speech quickly.</p><p><a name="06070315000084">The hon. Member for Windsor
(Adam Afriyie) made a good point about the Government&#146;s evidence
for the removal of donor anonymity. He may know that one of the
problems with that is that families who use donors choose not to tell
the child because they do not want that to be discovered. That means
that fewer children have access to such knowledge. There was no good
evidence of harm in the current circumstances or of any benefit from
following the suggested path. However, there was good evidence of the
threat to gamete supply, which has been affected by donor anonymity. I
feel strongly about the use of the precautionary principle, which my
hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06070315000085">When there
is clear evidence of benefit or likely potential benefit, the rule
should be that there should be good evidence of serious harm before
closing down research options. As the hon. Member for Salisbury said,
there is a moral imperative to do good. We should try to maximise the
benefits of the treatment. There is a moral imperative to treat
infertile women and couples, to conduct research using stem cells to
cure disease, and to develop new
technologies.</p><p><a name="06070315000086"><b><a name="06070315000192">Mr.
Newmark:</b> Is not there a moral imperative to protect the
unborn
child?</p><p><a name="06070315000087"><b><a name="06070315000193">Dr.
Harris:</b> There is a question about what constitutes the
moral rights of the unborn child and where they come in. We had the
debate about the 14-day limit and that on the limit on viability. We
are considering those matters. There is a balance to be
struck.</p><p><a name="06070315000088">The report is
not a slippery slope. If there is a slope, it goes upwards. I do not
speak for my colleagues, but allowing people to take advantage of the
technologies and helping people when there is no evidence of harm
constitutes an upward moral slope. In any event, we are not considering
a slope but a step. That hard-earned legislative step is considered
every 16 years at least. That is why we have confidence in proposing
that we go down the path that the report suggests.</p><p><a name="06070315000089">On the abortion limit and a

Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> I
congratulate all those who contributed to the excellent debate. I hope
that it greatly improves the understanding of those who have listened
to it and those who read it of a range of issues that will&#151;I
hope&#151;come before the House and that require, as the hon. Member
for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) said, a great deal of
debate,</p><p><a name="06070315000092">I thank the
hon. Member for Norwich, North and the Committee for the excellent
report. I do not have to agree with all of it to realise that it is an
important piece of work. As the hon. Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said, it shows the work of Select Committees
at their best. It does not simply hold the Government to account, which
is important, but tries to enhance Parliament&#146;s role in the
discussion and shaping of policy. That is especially apt in
circumstances in which the House has responsibility not only to review
the law but to make decisions in future about the shape of legislation
on the subject&#151;on a free vote.</p><p><a name="06070315000093">The hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) mentioned the two important words
&#147;free vote.&#148; Before I venture into the subject of the
report, I emphasise that point. Hon. Members who were present during
the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 will
recall that, two years before the measure was introduced, the
Conservative Government said that such issues would be considered on a
free vote. So they were. It is one of the Committee&#146;s
recommendations that the Government should make it clear that the
passage of any legislation on this matter will be conducted on a free
vote basis. That would certainly be true for the Conservatives, among
whom there are different views that it is legitimate for any hon.
Member to express.</p><p><a name="06070315000094">The hon. Member for Harrogate
and Knaresborough did a marvellous job of encapsulating many
recommendations in a number of key themes. I prepared a set of notes
for this debate containing all the issues that I thought we should
discuss, but I have discarded them because, in the course of the
debate, each of those issues has been raised. That is the mark of an
excellent debate that has covered all the necessary ground extremely
well. Some might think that it has covered more ground than was
desirable, but I believe that we have done the subject real
justice.</p><p><a name="06070315000095">The hon.
Gentleman touched on a matter of considerable importance, namely the
procedure involved in taking this subject forward. I also want to
emphasise that point before the Minister responds to the debate. On the
strength of the consultations that have been carried out, I believe
that we have reached a point at which the Government could come forward
with proposals. Bearing in mind what happened during the passage of the
Human Tissue Act 2004, I believe that the Committee is right to call
for pre-legislative scrutiny of any proposed legislation. I hope that
the Government will therefore publish a draft Bill for that purpose. I
also hope that the Minister will confirm that that process will be
conducted on a free vote basis. These are obviously matters for the
House as a whole, rather than solely for Front
Benchers.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 570</b><br><p><a name="06070315000096">The need for a Select Committee
on bioethics merits further discussion. We have discussed a range of
issues this afternoon, and there are others, such as surrogacy, that
have not been mentioned. The need for discussion on other matters,
including the use of gene therapies and genetic research, demonstrates
the desirability of having a body of continuing expertise to be
developed in the House, on which we could all rely. The Science and
Technology Committee has done a marvellous job in producing this
report, but we cannot ask it to be responsible for continuously
updating Parliament&#146;s views on these issues.</p><p><a name="06070315000097">We say that we have had no
legislation on these issues since 1990, but we have returned to them
from time to time. I recall that, when we debated stem cell research
four or five years ago, many Members felt as though they were suddenly
being asked to consider the matter without having had the opportunity
to do so before. The same applies to the issue of abortion, which, as
the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, does not get
debated if we are not considering legislation on the matter. A Select
Committee would offer greater opportunities to debate all these
issues.</p><p><a name="06070315000098">The hon.
Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) made a powerful
case for the need for a debate on abortion. Taking a very different
tack, the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily
Thornberry) argued her case on the issue. I want to echo what the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said on the issue. We cannot
decide here and now whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the
view that 24 weeks is too late a point&#151;based on the viability of
a foetus&#151;for abortions to take place except in the most
exceptional circumstances. The Committee makes a perfectly reasonable
case for that subject to be examined. Although such an examination
would not necessarily lead to the introduction of legislation, there
are proposals about access to early terminations of
pregnancy&#151;involving a nurse carrying out the procedure, for
example&#151;that might require legislative reform.</p><p><a name="06070315000099">My personal view is that it
would probably be unwise for that issue to be wrapped up in the reform
of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. I would not want
hon. Members to have to take a view on the desirability or otherwise of
a whole piece of legislation on the ground of their strongly held views
on abortion, when the bulk of the legislation ought to be able to
proceed without having to deal with that issue. In that respect, it
would be helpful if Ministers would make it clear that those issues
will be considered separately, and that, if a Committee of the House
were to propose options for the reform of the law on abortion, the
Government will do as a previous Government did and make parliamentary
time available for the House to conclude any such
discussions.</p><p><a name="06070315000100">My hon.
Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) took us into the
question of the welfare of the child, on which the Committee made a
number of recommendations. The way in which the Committee did that was
rather curious, because it suggested that the welfare of the child, as
currently expressed in the legislation, should be abandoned, but then
went on to say that it should still be considered if there were a risk 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 571</b><br>of significant harm to a child, and that there should be a threshold in
such circumstances. I cannot see how a legislative framework that
requires third parties to intervene to bring a child into the world
cannot consider the welfare of the child.</p><p><a name="06070315000101"><b><a name="06070315000195">Dr.
Evan Harris:</b> The Select Committee&#146;s report states,
on page 46, that</p><a name="06070315000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if the
welfare of the child provision is to be retained in any revised
legislation it should be based on the principle that the state has a
role in determining who can have fertility based on their personal
history and
circumstances.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000102">We also
stated, in relation to medical treatment, that doctors are required to
have regard to these issues without an extra layer of regulation. We do
not need a specific provision that allows clinics to discriminate,
because having regard to the welfare of the child is already embedded
in good clinical practice.</p><p><a name="06070315000103"><b><a name="06070315000196">Mr.
Lansley:</b> I understand that, but unless there is wholesale
deregulation of assisted reproductive technologies, those who carry out
fertility treatments must take responsibility within a specific
regulatory framework. It would send the wrong message if we were to
abandon a particular aspect of that framework. If we were to go down a
much more deregulatory path, however, the situation might be
different.</p><p><a name="06070315000104">My hon.
Friends the Members for Congleton and for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)
expressed a view that is shared by many people about the best
circumstances in which to bring a child into the world. I do not think
that we have any doubts about what they said; I hope that we do not.
However, when we ask whom we should prevent from having the opportunity
to provide a loving home to a child, that is a different question. The
argument was put to the Committee that the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990 was out of kilter with the Adoption and Children
Act 2002, but it is not. Under the Adoption and Children Act, social
services considering a child for adoption have to consider the
child&#146;s welfare very carefully, and to decide whether it will be
cared for and given a loving home. That is a perfectly reasonable test.
The issue is not whether the welfare of the child should be considered
in any proposed legislation but whether we should preclude providing
artificial reproductive technologies to lesbian or gay
couples.</p><p><a name="06070315000105"><b><a name="06070315000197">Mr.
Walker:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) was getting slightly confused
when he talked about male erectile dysfunction? This is a serious
point. If a man is treated for erectile dysfunction to improve his sex
life, that is one thing, and I hope that, if two lesbians were having
problems in their sex life, they would receive the necessary treatment.
However, we are not talking about erectile dysfunction and sex lives
here. We are talking about having children. I think that the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon was confusing the two
issues.</p><p><a name="06070315000106"><b><a name="06070315000198">Mr.
Lansley:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. We are, of
course, talking about children, and about the circumstances in which
couples, and in some cases 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 572</b><br>single people, have access to help to become a parent. From my point of
view, a gay couple who go through the process of surrogacy are capable,
and in some circumstances entirely capable, of providing a long-term
loving home for a child. If a lesbian couple or a single woman wish to
have fertility treatment&#151;rather than, for example, donor
insemination&#151;that is a perfectly acceptable way of proceeding.
Personally&#151;I emphasise that I speak entirely personally&#151;I
would prefer that, legislatively, we enabled children to be brought
into the world to parents who want to give them a loving home, using
the welfare of the child as a continuing measure, rather than trying to
restrict that. Too few children are being brought into loving homes,
and too many are being brought into unhappy homes where they are not
loved and not looked after.</p><p><a name="06070315000107">The hon.
Member for Norwich, North, who should take pride in ownership, with his
Committee, of this report, said that he would rather take penalties in
the last minute than go through this again. We would all prefer that,
as he might succeed. He touched on the whole question of the
HFEA&#146;s role. I confess that I do not understand why the
Committee concluded that the HFEA&#146;s tasks of policy
interpretation and of inspection and maintenance of standards are
necessarily incompatible or subject to a conflict of interest. I think
that its understanding of the role that fertility clinics play and of
developments in technology&#151;and its interface with clinical
practitioners&#151;are an essential part of informing policy. I
accept his point that by dint of working with 1990 legislation the HFEA
must increasingly make policy decisions that were not anticipated in
1990 and which legislators at the time would have expected to be
brought back to Parliament for consideration. That is one of the
reasons why we must have legislation, which I hope might establish a
slightly more flexible structure that allowed Parliament to take more
of the policy decisions, a decade or two hence, rather than leaving
such matters entirely to the HFEA.</p><p><a name="06070315000108">In passing, as the hon. Member
for Oxford, West and Abingdon spoke well of HFEA members, let me say
that I have been impressed by their work in my dealings with them. I
know that the Committee has had criticisms of them, not least in the
past. I am grateful for the work that Dame Suzi Leather has done as
chairman. She is now moving on, and although I do not necessarily agree
with every one of her statements, I think that she has helped
tremendously and tackled some difficult issues extremely well in a
public context. </p><p><a name="06070315000109">My
hon. Friends the Members for Salisbury (Robert Key) and for Braintree
(Mr. Newmark) touched on the contest between scientific capability and
the framework in which it should be exercised. I am not sure that I
could ever help my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury with his
question about what heaven might consist of, and I doubt that he was
asking my advice on the subject. However, his comments about not
stopping science are terribly important, and pre-implementation genetic
diagnosis is a good example. We are clear that there are circumstances
in which we would not want PGD to be used. For example, would we expect
it to be used to try to eliminate a small increased risk of a certain
disease later in life? No, I do not think so. In that area, however,
the legislation will introduce not broad prohibitions, but a range of
criteria, which will have to be determined over time and as science 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 573</b><br>develops. That is one of the compelling reasons for having an interface
between lay and scientific views. As the Committee made clear, however,
that interface should not just take place in the HFEA but in a dialogue
between the HFEA, the scientific and medical community and Parliament.
It is important for that to dialogue to continue.</p><p><a name="06070315000110">To echo a point that was
implied by my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree&#146;s comments,
science may continue to change, but science does not drive ethics. As
we have in part set out to do, we must make clear not just the ethical
framework but the ethical standards that apply to this area of
technology. Reproductive cloning is a good example. I cavil slightly at
the argument that reproductive cloning technology might have changed in
20 years&#146; time, which of course it might&#151;human
reproductive cloning might even have been achieved in other parts of
the world. However, I cannot for the life of me see why this
country&#146;s legislative framework should do anything other than
say clearly that we are against it and that it will not happen here. I
do not subscribe to the view that because science changes, our law must
change. On some matters, we must be quite clear. The legislation will
contain both broad prohibitions and sets of criteria in certain areas,
and we must be clear about the distinction between the two.</p>

<p><a name="06070315000111">The hon. Member for Brighton,
Kemptown (Dr. Turner) referred to clearer legislation on sex selection
criteria, which is a good example. We must make clear where those
boundaries are to be set. The Committee was right that, for instance,
the criteria for the use of human-animal chimera, PGD and
pre-implantation tissue typing must be set out to a greater degree in
the new legislation.</p><p><a name="06070315000112">My hon. Friend the Member for
Windsor (Adam Afriyie) made an important point about donor anonymity.
In Committee, we made precisely that point, and voted against the
regulations on those grounds. I am disappointed that the Minister
brought forward legislation and whipped it through without a free vote.
The Committee noted that, and subsequently discovered that the
legislation was drafted on the basis of poor evidence. As a
consequence, those providing fertility treatments are
suffering.</p><p><a name="06070315000113">The hon.
Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) made an important comment,
which I echo, about the availability of fertility treatments. I declare
a sort of interest, although not a personal one. While Louise Brown may
have been born in Oldham, the scientific work was undertaken at Bourn
Hall clinic in my constituency, and I am vice-chair of the all-party
infertility group. Two years ago, the Prime Minister said that the NICE
guidelines, especially on the availability of three cycles of IVF,
should be achieved, and that the Government would make clear further
progress on that. More than two years later, that has not happened. As
a consequence, there are still serious inequalities in the availability
of treatment. With regard to my constituents, from last September to
this spring, my primary care trust stopped making fertility treatments
available. It has now started to make them available, but it has
limited the number of contracts to 200, which means that fewer couples
are gaining access to fertility treatment than are coming on to the
waiting list. Some PCTs are setting perverse criteria, such as 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 574</b><br>not making fertility treatment available until women are 36 years old,
whereas the NICE guidelines were designed to optimise the
cost-effectiveness of fertility treatments provided through the
national health service.</p><p><a name="06070315000114">The hon. Member for Bolton,
South-East took an admirably utilitarian view of fertility treatments,
and said that they contributed to the country&#146;s economy as a
whole, which is no doubt true. From my point of view, I just meet
couples who want to provide a loving home to children and who, in my
view, should be given the opportunity of having their physical
impairment remedied by the NHS, as it remedies many other diseases.
Infertility is a disease, and it has a big impact on people&#146;s
lives. Bringing loved children into a loving home would have an
enormously positive impact on those lives, and would do a great deal
for society.</p><p><a name="06070315000115"><b><a name="06070315000199">Mr.
Walker:</b> My hon. Friend says that infertility is a disease.
Is infertility in women who have passed the menopause a disease, or
just a natural progression of
age?</p><p><a name="06070315000116"><b><a name="06070315000200">Ann

Lansley:</b> My hon. Friend says, from a sedentary position,
that it is a condition. Something that causes people considerable
distress is a disease, and it can be a consequence of what is clearly a
disease. For example, one of the reasons we are fighting chlamydia is
that in later life it will lead to an increased incidence of
infertility. Members may say that infertility is a subsequent condition
arising from a particular disease, but that is splitting hairs, and I
do not want to split hairs in this context. We are dealing with couples
who want to provide a loving home, and I think that one of our
responsibilities as a society is to increase the number of such
opportunities..</p><p><a name="06070315000118"><b><a name="06070315000202">Daniel

Minister of State, Department of Health (Caroline Flint):</b>
We have had a good debate. We have heard a variety of speeches from
Back Benchers&#151;12, I believe&#151;in three hours or so,
reflecting the complexity and diversity of opinions on what we have
been able to discuss today, let alone other aspects of the report that
there has not been time to
mention.</p><p><a name="06070315000122">I
welcome the report, and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich,
North (Dr. Gibson), who chaired the Committee that produced it. He
passed the gauntlet&#151;if that is the right word&#151;to the hon.
Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). As he said, I am
due to appear before the Committee next week, and I am sure that it
will explore many of the issues raised today in much more
depth.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 575</b><br><p><a name="06070315000123">We
have benefited from a number of authoritative reports produced by a
variety of Select Committees of both Houses in recent years, but I
think it fair to say that few have been as extensive as the one that we
are debating today, or have produced such wide-ranging recommendations.
The report followed a year-long inquiry involving written evidence
gathering, examination of witnesses and, as we have heard today,
fact-finding missions abroad. The result of that process has been very
thought-provoking. It has led to analysis and to a set of
recommendations which&#151;although we may not all agree with
them&#151;prompt questions that need to be put, given the pace of
change in both science and technology and social issues over the past
decade or so in this area of public
policy.</p><p><a name="06070315000124">Those who read
the report, regardless of whether they agree with its proposals, will
be compelled to examine their own reasoning and rationale in regard to
a host of fundamental legal, ethical and social questions and dilemmas,
many of which go to the heart of no lesser questions than what it means
to be human and what are the proper limits of toleration in a modern
pluralistic society. It is hardly surprising that the report did not
have an easy gestation, or that the Committee could not reach unanimity
on underlying principles. I should refer at this point to the special
report that records the dissent of five Committee members. That too has
been reflected in the speeches we have heard, particularly that of the
hon. Member for Congleton (Ann
Winterton).</p><p><a name="06070315000125">I do not
think, however, that a lack of unanimity is necessarily to be
regretted. It illustrates the complexity and depth of feeling that
surrounds these issues, and opens them up to wider debate. Certainly
our consultation, whose findings we published earlier in the year,
revealed a wide range of views. It would be unfair to suggest, as some
Members may have been inclined to suggest today, that there is only one
view in the scientific community, or that it does not take the issues
seriously. The feedback that I have received suggests that, far from
having a &#147;go fast&#148; attitude, many in that community want
the issues to be aired fully. They want a full discussion, because they
want to feel that there is confidence in their professionalism and
their approach to the important matters that have been raised
today.</p><p><a name="06070315000126">I do not
believe that any of the issues we have discussed are easy or admit of a
simple solution, or at any rate a solution that can be reached by a
simple or easy route. In January 2004 we announced our intention of
reviewing the 1990 Act&#151;a process that would include a public
consultation exercise in 2005. The Select Committee&#146;s report
provided an excellent starting point. We took up many of the issues
raised and suggestions made by the Committee, and signalled our
willingness to consider potential changes. I hope that our response
also identified points on which we agreed with the Committee, and
showed that when we did not agree we took on board some of the points
that have been made again today. I am thinking of, for instance, the
regulatory and policy-making role of the HFEA and the question of where
Government oversight should
lie.</p><p><a name="06070315000127">It is right for
us to take time to think through the issues and develop our response
properly. As I have said, we made clear our agreement with some of the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 576</b><br>report&#146;s recommendations, and made plain our intention to gather
views on others from a wider audience. In common with the Committee, we
concluded that the basic foundations of the 1990 Act, as rooted in the
earlier report from the Warnock committee of inquiry, remained
sound.</p><p><a name="06070315000128">I think we
should all be very proud of the legislation. Yes, science has moved on,
but I think we should be proud of the basic foundation that has served
the country so well, not just nationally but internationally. My hon.
Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) made a good
point: that in not being prepared to explore some of the issues that we
have explored, those in other countries have allowed the creation of an
atmosphere in which it has been possible to develop some of the worst
examples of what we do not wish to see. That has often brought into
question practices in our own country, but our debates on the issue,
and our underpinning legislation, have stood us in good stead and
protected us from some of the wider and scarier practices
overseas.</p><p><a name="06070315000129">The
foundations of the report include the idea of a special status
applicable to the human embryo, the need for active monitoring and
regulation, and a clearly defined time limit on the development of
embryos in vitro for research. When we announced our review of the Act,
we made clear that several aspects of the current law and scheme of
regulation would not be reopened for debate. We felt that those aspects
had been conclusively, and in some cases very recently, resolved by
Parliament, or the Government had already made clear their established
policy intentions. They include the removal of donor anonymity. The
hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Windsor
(Adam Afriyie) have expressed concerns about its removal, but
children&#146;s organisations and others have said that they consider
it right. We have talked a great deal about family and identity today.
The view has been expressed that children conceived by means of donors
have a right to receive information about those who allowed them to be
created in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06070315000130">As I have said,
on the whole the 1990 Act has stood the test of time, and is a tribute
to the foresight of its creators. It resulted from an extensive process
of deliberation and consultation over several years. It established the
principle of independent oversight of an area of medical practice, and
I believe it has proved to be remarkably robust in the face of legal
challenges. I also believe that it has promoted public confidence in
assisted reproduction treatment, and has played a large part in
enabling the United Kingdom to move to the forefront of cutting-edge
developments in scientific and medical
research.</p><p><a name="06070315000131">There has
been criticism of the HFEA, but I think that it continues to do a very
good job in dealing with the novel and complex issues that inevitably
come its way. I agree to an extent with the hon. Member for South
Cambridgeshire, who said that it was difficult for organisations to
look purely at regulation without examining issues relating to policy
development as they see it, in the context of their inspection and
regulatory processes. I join the hon. Gentleman in thanking Dame Suzi
Leather for her leadership and steering of the HFEA. I also thank all
members of the board, who constitute a mix of professional and lay
people.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 577</b><br><p><a name="06070315000132">Law and regulation have not
stood still since 1990. The House has passed both primary and secondary
legislation, either in response to developments or to seize new
opportunities. Nevertheless, the Committee and the Government have
agreed that there is a growing need to revisit the law, particularly
given the rise of new technologies. The Committee had previously
expressed that view as a need to</p><a name="06070315000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reconnect the Act with modern
science&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000134">There can be
no doubt that developments are moving fast. They include technological
breakthroughs in the screening of embryos for hereditary diseases, and
we have seen the number of babies conceived through IVF worldwide pass
the 3 million mark. That figure includes 100,000 children born in the
UK. We need to establish a framework that is broadly acceptable to
society, and fit for purpose in the 21st century.</p><p><a name="06070315000135">We should remember this, too.
It comes from the Warnock report, and it has the same resonance today
as when it was first written:</p><a name="06070315000154"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the law must not outrage the
feelings of too many people, but it cannot reflect the feelings of them
all.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000136">That is an
important quote today, as it was then. The report
continued:</p><a name="06070315000155"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
must therefore be drawn with a view to the common good".</p></ul><p><a name="06070315000137">I believe that a consultative and
deliberative approach is key. As we have said, we are keen to continue
to explore how wide-ranging a debate we can have andto
continue to provide opportunities for more involvement and more
debate.</p><p><a name="06070315000138">There were
535 responses to our consultation; more than 100 organisations took
part. We saw the wide diversity of views. None the less, the ultimate
basis for regulation in this area is the public good, and commonly
acceptable limits and boundaries. Therefore, the considered views of
society as a whole, identified through exercises such as the
consultation, the Select Committee report, this debate and debate in
the months ahead, are crucial to making sure that we end up with a law
as successful as the original law on which it will be
founded.</p><p><a name="06070315000139">It is clear
that responses generally favour measures such as a ban on non-medical
sex selection, and retention of a &#147;welfare of the child&#148;
consideration in some form. I will talk a bit more about that later.
Respondees were generally less convinced of the need to make changes to
the scope of permissible embryo research. It will be for Parliament to
weigh those arguments, opinions and evidence in its consideration of
any proposals to change the law that the Government may bring
forward.</p><p><a name="06070315000140">There has
been much discussion about the role of the HFEA. Some take the view
that Parliament could take more of a role not only on that matter but
on that movable feast, the way in which science and society develop. In
our response to the Committee, we did not feel that a bioethics
committee was necessarily the right way forward. We took that view on
the basis that the present distributed model of advisory bodies with
more specific briefs remained the best option, as it enables specific
bioethical issues to be addressed by dedicated groups with the
appropriate expertise and sufficient time to devote to the issue.
However, we share the Committee&#146;s view that airing and debating
bioethical 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 578</b><br>issues in Parliament is important, and we are willing to give further
consideration to the appropriate level of parliamentary control over
delegated powers under legislation. We accept the benefit of wide
consultation. As I have said, I am looking to explore how much further
we can develop that debate in the months ahead.</p><p><a name="06070315000141">Establishing a regulatory
authority for tissue and embryos is not just a costcutting exercise, as
some people have suggested, or just a neat joining of two
organisations. We believe that, through bringing the HFEA and the Human
Tissue Authority together, we can have a single competent authority
acting as a regulator under the blood, tissue and cells directives,
which will reduce any risk of overlap and duplication. We also think
that RATE will be better able to work with other regulators such as the
Healthcare Commission to ensure common standards and practices. Having
a single source of authoritative guidance on all issues related to the
use of human tissues of all kinds will be helpful in one organisation.
Again, that will help to ensure good practice and guidance established
on common principles in those related areas.</p><p><a name="06070315000142">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), the hon. Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough and other colleagues talked about the sex selection of
offspring. That issue is a good example of why we have chosen to review
existing law and regulation. It is established policy that the
selection of embryos on the grounds of sex, other than for serious
medical reasons, should not be allowed. That position is maintained by
the HFEA, which has undertaken extensive public consultation and
surveys. That was complemented by the response to our own consultation.
However, there is not an explicit statutory ban in law, and nor does
the HFEA's policy apply to treatments that fall outside its remit. The
rise of new technologies, such as sperm sorting, could therefore allow
sex selection to take place in settings outside the scope of
regulation.</p><p><a name="06070315000143">We
consulted on options, including a ban, ora partial ban in line
with the Committee's recommendation to allow sex selection for
non-medical reasons in order to &#147;balance&#148; a family. It is
clear from responses to our consultation that people favoured an
explicit ban with no exception for family-balancing, and a range of
other surveys have shown widespread public antipathy to sex selection
for social reasons.</p><p><a name="06070315000144">We must give serious
consideration to how a statutory ban could work in practice. As I have
said, services on the internet are one factor. My hon. Friend the
Member for Bolton, South-East asked whether the Government would
regulate internet sperm providers. We have said in our consultation
document that we intend to make the operation of internet services
involving supply subject to regulation. We have sought views on the
detail of that, but clearly, we can apply it only in the UK. We cannot
necessarily apply it to overseas
practices.</p><p><a name="06070323000001">The
welfare of the child and the need for a father are another social
concern. Concerns about the general welfare of children underpin many
aspects of the current legislation. For example, concern about the
psychological well-being of the child is a key reason for the ban on
human reproductive cloning. However, the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 579</b><br>extent to which the law should intervene in decisions to provide
treatment in individual cases, or impose &#147;social&#148;
criteria for assisted reproduction clinics is less clear-cut. Whatever
view we take individually on the merits of different family forms, the
issue is about whether it is the state's role to impose a view. I
listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for South
Cambridgeshire</p><p><a name="06070323000002">In
1990, Parliament chose to require clinics to take account of the
welfare of the child, including the need of the child for a father; any
change to that position will again be a matter for Parliament. The
Committee's report is very clear. What emerged from the consultation,
interestingly&#151;and, on this occasion, it contradicts the comments
of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East&#151;is that the
medical profession, as represented by the royal colleges and the BMA,
feels that there needs to be something that recognises the welfare of
the child. The BMA wants a general welfare of the child provision to be
retained, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
wants to subsume those considerations within good medical practice.
Therefore, there is a view that the welfare of the child is still an
important consideration to be taken into account.</p><p><a name="06070323000003">The question of the
&#147;need for a father&#148; has again been aired. It is not a
straightforward matter. The requirement to take account of the need for
a father is not a prohibition as it currently stands. The HFEA is
required to give clinics guidance on taking account of the welfare of
the child. On that point it
says:</p><a name="06070323000028"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where
the child will have no legal father, the treatment centre is expected
to assess the prospective mother's ability to meet the
child's/children's needs and the ability of other persons within the
family or social circle willing to share responsibility for those
needs."</p></ul><p><a name="06070323000004">We are looking at the
response to our consultation on the issue. I am sure that there will be
further discussion. Again, we felt it important to put those questions
in our consultation because we wanted to reflect the fact that perhaps
over time opinions had changed, and the emphasis on the welfare of the
child should be paramount in relation to decisions on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06070323000005">PGD has
concentrated colleagues&#146; minds. The hon. Member for Salisbury
(Robert Key) and my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown both
spoke about the issue. The screening and selection of embryos, and the
grounds on which that may be undertaken, feature heavily in the
Committee's report and have done so in preceding reports. Indeed, I
believe that that issue, more than any other, led to the instigation of
the Committee's inquiry. Although the courts have upheld the HFEA's
power to make licensing decisions in that area, the topic remains
controversial.</p><p><a name="06070323000006">The
analysis in the Committee's report is instructive. It raises several
facets of the debate, including making sure that embryos are not
created and destroyed frivolously, balanced against the avoidance of
serious inherited disorders or the ability to treat a seriously ill
sibling. It goes on to consider the appropriate setting for decision
making and the respective roles of Parliament and the regulator.
Responses to the consultation, where they agree that pre-implantation 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 580</b><br>genetic diagnosis should be allowed, show that there is a view that
there need to be some more explicit criteria in legislation to
determine legitimate purposes for which embryo screening and selection
may take place. Again, we need to think about how we deal with the pace
of change in the science and the role of the authority in the future,
as well as Parliament&#146;s input into the
decisions.</p><p><a name="06070323000007">My hon.
Friends the Members for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) and
for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) and the hon.
Members for Congleton, for Harrogate and Knaresborough, for Oxford,
West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and for Salisbury (Robert Key) debated
time limits. The subject was also touched on by other hon. Members in
various ways.</p><p><a name="06070323000008">One of
the differences between the last time Parliament discussed time limits
and now is that then relevant professional bodies exerted considerable
pressure in favour of a change. Some hon. Members may have participated
in that debate, and I was certainly aware of it. It was clear that the
professional bodies felt that the time limits needed to be changed.
However, today, the Government have not been approached by any of the
relevant professional bodies to state that they have changed their
views since the limit was reduced from 28 to 24 weeks in
1990.</p><p><a name="06070323000009">At low gestation
age, even if the foetus is born alive, there are high risks of death
due to immaturity. Indeed, while the possibility of survival of
extremely pre-term babies has improved, data suggest that, even with
modern intensive care, chances of survival at 22 weeks&#146;
gestation are only approximately 1 per cent., whereas that increases to
26 per cent. at 24 weeks. However, it should be noted that 88 per cent.
of abortions are carried out at less than 13 weeks&#146; gestation,
60 per cent. of which are at less than 10 weeks. Less than 1 per cent.
are performed at 22 weeks and over. Only 124 have taken place at 24
weeks and
over.</p><p><a name="06070323000010">Parliament
agreed in 1990 that the legal limit for most abortions should be
reduced from 28 weeks to24 weeks. The debate that informed the
decision considered a wide range of issues, including both ethical and
practical issues. It is still a matter for Parliament to decide, but I
wanted to be clear about the pressures that were coming at the time
from professional organisations. That is not happening today. Any
proposed changes would need to be carefully thought through, and we
have not had the pressure from the organisations for change. The BMA
and the royal colleges, which advised the need for a change in 1990,
have not given any such advice
today.</p><p><a name="06070323000011"><b><a name="06070323000029">Mr.
Willis:</b> If the Minister is confident&#151;I have no
reason to argue with what she has said&#151;that the science has not

Houses to put the matter to
rest?</p><p><a name="06070323000012"><b><a name="06070323000030">Caroline
Flint:</b> That is an issue for the House to decide. I was
trying to point out the differences between the debate in 1990 and
today. In 1990, the professional medical organisations urged the
Government to make changes, based on the scientific evidence, but they
are not doing so today.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 581</b><br><p><a name="06070323000013">We are trying to ensure that
women have access to abortion services as soon as possible. Primary
care trusts have a performance indicator designed to encourage them to
assist women to have access to early abortions. However, we know that
some of those taking part in the debate disagree with any abortion. We
have also carried out an audit of the gaps in access to contraception
for women, and the point has been made this afternoon about access to
better sex and relationships education and information for young people
so that situations do not end in an unwanted pregnancy for which an
abortion may the only solution for the individual
concerned.</p><p><a name="06070323000014"><b><a name="06070323000031">Ann
Winterton:</b> Is it not a fact that the more her Department
spends on sex education, the greater the level of sexual activity among
the young? Is it not time to think of such issues differently, because
the objectives are not being
achieved?</p><p><a name="06070323000015"><b><a name="06070323000032">Caroline
Flint:</b> Despite some of our best efforts, the provision of
sex education is still patchy, although there is some very good
practice, both in and outside schools. In fact, most young people do
not want information only about sex. Most of those under 16, the hon.
Lady will be pleased to know, are not having sex, but they do want
information about the changes to their bodies as they grow up and how
to cope with peer pressure during puberty. Much of the work that we do
on teenage pregnancy also takes into account issues of low self-esteem.
Young people need the confidence to not feel pressurised into having
sex, but if they are going to have sex, to do so safely. I wish that
the picture was as clear-cut as the hon. Lady might like to imagine,
but relationships hardly ever are. We could certainly do more to
improve sex and relationships
education.</p><p><a name="06070323000016"><b><a name="06070323000033">Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister is correct to say that there is no
call from the royal colleges or the BMA to reduce abortion time limits,
and it is fair to recognise that. However, nor is there any opposition
from those bodies to a review. The public want a review, and the
Minister obviously thinks that public opinion is important, because she
followed the public consultation on the changes to donor anonymity,
despite the opposition of the BMA. The Minister has to recognise that
in the end it will be a matter for Parliament, and many of us feel that
it would be timely to address it in this Session, after 16 years,
rather than wait for the next Session.</p><p><a name="06070323000017"><b><a name="06070323000034">Caroline
Flint:</b> This afternoon has been an opportunity for all
views to be aired on the issue, as was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
Adjournment debate last year. I am sure that the discussion will
continue. It is important that we understand how many women are having
late abortions and why. For example, some women cannot be screened to
see whether the baby they are carrying is likely to have severe
disabilities until very late in the process, and they may also need
some time to think about what to do&#151;which might be not to have a
termination. The timing can mean that women have to make very difficult
decisions. I do not think that any of the 124 women who have been
through that have taken it lightly, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Islington, South and Finsbury made that point well.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 582</b><br><p><a name="06070323000018">We must also consider the
science&#151;what is and is not possible. I heard on the radio
recently about the scans taken of foetuses that appear to be walking or
sucking their thumbs, but some of those scans were taken at 12 weeks,
so we need to think about what points people are making and whether the
debate is about the wider issue of access to legal abortion, and not
just time limits. I am sure that we will come back to the issue,
perhaps next week in Committee and in future debates.</p><p><a name="06070323000019">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East asked about definitions of embryos and gametes,
which he feels are inadequate. We have announced that we intend to
ensure that the definitions used in the legislation are fit for
purpose, taking account of the rise of new technology. That is a
primary reason for reviewing the legislation. For example, we will
ensure that all embryos outside the body are covered by regulation.
However, we have made it clear that, in common with the Science and
Technology Committee, we have no intention of altering the 14-day limit
for embryo research.</p><p><a name="06070323000020">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bolton, South-East and the hon. Member for South
Cambridgeshire(Mr. Lansley) raised the important issue of
access to fertility services. There has been quite a debate about the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority publishing its own
document on different clinics and what they provide. There were calls
from across the Chamber&#151;and, I think, from the hon. Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough&#151;to look at success rates. The
picture is not clear, because obviously the results very much depend on
the profile of the people coming through. As with anything, we do not
necessarily want a league table; we just need to be mindful of the
issue. Having said that, it is fair that people seeking IVF and support
should have some understanding of what they should be looking out for
in a good clinic. That certainly should be part of the commissioning
process.</p><p><a name="06070323000021">I have been
exploring further how we might improve the commissioning process for
IVF services, both within a primary care trust and perhaps among a
group of PCTs in an area, to see how they might commission such
services and get better value for money, and perhaps better outcomes
and understanding, too. I am pleased to have supported a new project by
Infertility Network UK, which we provide with core funding, on ways in
which it can work with PCTs to ensure that fertility patients&#146;
voices are heard when decisions about services are made
locally.</p><p><a name="06070323000022">I am so
pleased that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the
link between chlamydia and infertility. I have been trying to get the
Department and non-governmental organisations to think much more
closely about the connections between those two issues, and about why
the screening programme for chlamydia is so important. We should do
whatever we can to prevent the likelihood of future infertility, and
one of the ways we can do that is through better screening for
chlamydia; another is by people practising safer sex more
regularly.</p>

<p><a name="06070323000023">We believe
that stem cell research offers enormous potential to deliver new
treatments for currently incurable illnesses, such as chronic heart
disease, diabetes and Parkinson&#146;s disease. We want to encourage

cells. In the March 2005 Budget, the Chancellor announced the
establishment of the UK stem cell initiative, a taskforce charged with
developing a vision and a costing strategy to make the UK a global
leader in stem cell research. It is undoubtedly the case that
frustrated scientists in the US who want to do the world some good
through such research are coming to Britain to share their expertise
and to be part of such an important scientific development, which
brings hope to so many thousands of people, and so many future
thousands of people,
too.</p><p><a name="06070323000024">The
hon. Member for Windsor made a point about the decision to remove donor
anonymity. We took account of the views provided in response to a
public consultation and a further targeted questionnaire sent to
clinics and, through them, donors. The fundamental matter was whether
it was right to perpetuate the situation whereby donor-conceived people
were denied information held on a national database about their donor.
Following consultation, we decided that it was not. Again, that is an
issue about the rights of donor-conceived children to have some
information about their own life and background. We asked some other
questions about that in relation to the consultation and we have also
been looking into wider issues around information, which we are hoping
to share in the near
future.</p><p><a name="06070323000025">We have had a
wide-ranging debate. Clearly, there is an interest in the subject in
the House, of which I have taken note. I have also taken note of the
many different points that hon. Members on both sides of the House have
raised. As I said before, we should be proud that we have a law that
has done a huge service to the development of policy on the subject,
both on science and social grounds. However, we have to reflect social
as well as scientific changes, and we have to reflect on the best way
to get a regulatory authority that has some flexibility, while
considering fully Parliament&#146;s oversight role for the
future.</p><p><a name="06070323000026">I thank

Viggers (Gosport) (Con):</b> This is the first occasion on
which the House has ever had a general debate on the work of the
Electoral Commission. As the House will know, the commission is
entirely independent of Government, so the opportunities for private
Members to initiate debate about its work are limited. I am therefore
particularly grateful to the Liaison Committee for agreeing to provide
time for this debate. I know that the Electoral Commission prizes the
fact that it is directly accountable to Parliament through the
Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Electoral Commission, for which I
answer in the House, and has very much welcomed this first general
debate on its
work.</p><p><a name="06070327000006">The House will
see from the Order Paper that the Constitutional Affairs Committee has
drawn attention to the evidence it took on electoral administration,
which is one of the many facets of the work of the Electoral
Commission. I shall say more later in my speech about how the various
strands of parliamentary scrutiny of the Electoral Commission fit
together, but I would like to make it clear at this stage that it is
not the intention that the debate be restricted solely to the
commission&#146;s work on electoral administration, important though
that issue is.</p><p><a name="06070327000007">The
debate is particularly timely because, five years into the Electoral
Commission&#146;s life, it is a good time to take stock of its record
and to consider where its priorities should lie for the future. The
Committee on Standards in Public Life recently began hearing evidence
in its inquiry focusing on the Electoral Commission&#146;s mandate,
governance and accountability. I know that a number of Members on both
sides of the House have already given evidence to it. I know, too, that
the electoral commissioners themselves are taking this opportunity to
consider the future direction of the commission, and that is entirely
right. This debate will provide an opportunity for a wider
cross-section of the House to make known its views on the Electoral
Commission, and I hope that both the Committee on Standards in Public
Life and the commissioners will take the views expressed into account
when reaching their conclusions.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 585</b><br><p><a name="06070327000008"><b><a name="06070327000206">Mr.
Anthony Steen (Totnes) (Con):</b> I am having some difficulty
understanding section 16 of the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000, which outlines the arrangements for the transfer
of the functions of the parliamentary boundary commissions to the
Electoral Commission. Could my hon. Friend explain why the Committee on
Standards in Public Life has anything to do with delaying that actually
happening?</p><p><a name="06070327000009"><b><a name="06070327000207">Peter
Viggers:</b> The committee is not delaying that; the
Government have given power to enable the transfer to take place, but
the proposal to make the transfer has not yet occurred. I will refer to
that point later in my
speech.</p><p><a name="06070327000010">The Committee
on Standards in Public Life, to which my hon. Friend referred, played a
decisive part in the establishment of the Electoral Commission. In
November 1997, the Prime Minister extended that committee&#146;s
remit by adding to its existing terms of
reference:</p><a name="06070327000189"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To
review issues in relation to the funding of political parties, and to
make recommendations as to any changes in the present
arrangements.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000011">In the
committee&#146;s fifth report, on the funding of political parties in
the United Kingdom, published in October 1998, it recommended the
creation of a</p><a name="06070327000190"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;totally
independent and authoritative Election Commission with widespread
executive and investigative
powers&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000012">to underpin its
recommendations relating to party
funding.</p><p><a name="06070327000013">The committee
also envisaged that its proposed commission would report on the conduct
and administration of principal elections or referendums within six
months of their taking place, advise the Government on the
modernisation and revision of electoral law, be consulted by the
Government ahead of changes relating to electoral law and
administration, and act as the registrar of political
parties.</p><p><a name="06070327000014">Crucially,
the committee envisaged that its proposed commission would be, and be
seen to be, an independent and impartial body, the members of which
would be chosen on a non-partisan basis and by means of a non-partisan
procedure, while none the less being acceptable to the leaders of the
main political parties. It also recommended that the
commission&#146;s budget should be set in such a way as to preserve
its authority and
independence.</p><p><a name="06070327000015">The
Government responded to the committee&#146;s report in July 1999 and
were altogether more ambitious about the role of the new
commissions&#146; functions. They accepted the recommendation to
establish an independent and authoritative Electoral Commission, but
they went on to
say:</p><a name="06070327000191"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Electoral Commission&#146;s role will not be a purely enforcement
one. It will have a wide-ranging remit to review electoral law and
practice, much of which dates back to the last century. As well as
being a force for the modernisation of electoral machinery, the
commission will have an important role in promoting public awareness of
the democratic process and encouraging greater participation in it. The
establishment of the Electoral Commission also provides an opportunity
to rationalise the number of disparate bodies responsible for different
aspects of the electoral process and to bring overlapping functions
together under the overall control of one
organisation.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 586</b><br><p><a name="06070327000016">However, the Neill committee also made it
clear that the Electoral Commission&#146;s core functions would be
those recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. It
stated:</p><a name="06070327000192"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
bedrock functions of the Electoral Commission as recommended by the
Neill committee will be those relating to the new regulatory framework
for the reporting of donations to political parties, the ban on foreign
donations and the controls on campaign expenditure at parliamentary and
other
elections.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000017">The
Government also saw the establishment of the Electoral Commission as an
opportunity to re-examine the arrangements for the review of electoral
boundaries. The committee has expressed doubts about the Electoral
Commission assuming the responsibility of the parliamentary boundary
commissions, but the Jenkins Commission on the voting system, whose
report was published shortly after the committee report, had argued for
greater co-ordination and for bringing that work under the Electoral
Commission.</p><p><a name="06070327000018">The
Government therefore created in the Political Parties Elections and
Referendums Act 2000&#151;usually referred to as PPERA, but I prefer
to call it the 2000 Act&#151;the legislation that gave effect to the
new arrangements for regulating the finance of political parties and a
range of other matters: a statutory framework in which responsibility
for both reviewing parliamentary constituency boundaries and local
administrative and electoral boundaries could be transferred to the
Electoral Commission. To date, only responsibility for local authority
administrative boundaries has been transferred to the Electoral
Commission.</p><p><a name="06070327000019"><b><a name="06070327000208">Mr.
Steen:</b> I am great supporter of the Electoral
Commission&#146;s work&#151;it has done a wonderful job&#151;but
does my hon. Friend agree that the boundary commissions are in a
terrible mess. There are all sorts of boundaries
commissions&#151;local government, central Government and so
on&#151;and I cannot quite work out which one does what. Does he
agree that the boundary commissions are already producing new
boundaries for the next election that are not within the 70,000
electorate limit that has been recommended. Some are as high as
110,000, and some are as low as 30,000. Is it not about time that the
boundary commissions&#146; work, which is failing, was transferred to
a better and more competent
body?</p><p><a name="06070327000020"><b><a name="06070327000209">Peter

for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget

possible that she might refer to this matter because she has laid down
a timetable within which the work of the boundary commissions will not
be transferred to the Electoral Commission, while leaving it open for
it to be transferred at a later date. However, I would prefer to leave
that to the Minister, who can speak with authority on
it.</p><p><a name="06070327000021"><b><a name="06070327000210">Mr.

work?</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 587</b><br><p><a name="06070327000022"><b><a name="06070327000211">Peter

of a number of visits that I had made overseas, overwhelmingly in the
course of my then duties as shadow Secretary of State for International
Development. However, given that one already has a responsibility to
declare such interests in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, is
there not a danger of duplication&#151;I put it no more strongly than
that&#151;if by virtue of the 2000 Act, one is also required to make
a declaration to a body that could perfectly well apprise itself of
that information from a publicly available

made?</p><p><a name="06070327000026"><b><a name="06070327000215">Peter

Viggers:</b> I must press on at this
point.</p><p><a name="06070327000029">I think that I
have made the point that the 2000 Act substantially enlarged the
original plan for an elections commission, which became the Electoral
Commission and has been given very wide powers. The Government saw the
functions of the new Electoral Commission</p><a name="06070327000193"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as crucial to maintaining public
confidence in our democratic
institutions&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000030">It
therefore shared the view of the Committee on Standards in Public Life
that the commission should be wholly independent of the Government and
be seen to be scrupulously impartial in its dealings with political
parties. It was therefore deliberately not constituted as a
non-departmental public body, but was made directly accountable to
Parliament. During the passage of the legislation through the House,
the Government introduced stringent restrictions on the extent to which
commissioners could be involved in active politics.</p><p><a name="06070327000031">The arrangements for setting
the Electoral Commission&#146;s budget were designed to reinforce
that independent status. That responsibility was given to a statutory
committee&#151;the Speaker&#146;s Committee&#151;of nine Members
of Parliament, including Mr. Speaker and of which I am a member. The
Committee is deliberately constituted so that no party has a majority
of the membership.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 588</b><br><p><a name="06070327000032"><b><a name="06070327000218">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire)
(Lab/Co-op):</b> I understand that in the
evidence given to the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the
budget was then about &#163;26 million a year, which represented
about three times the figure that a broad range of similar activities

work of the Electoral Commission and am very impressed by its chairman,
but is the hon. Gentleman convinced that the extra two thirds, whatever
that may be&#151;&#163;16 or &#163;17 million&#151;represents
good value for money for the extra responsibilities that the Electoral
Commission has within its
brief?</p><p><a name="06070327000033"><b><a name="06070327000219">Peter
Viggers:</b> I will be dealing with exactly that point in a
few moments if the hon. Gentleman will contain himself. May I just deal
with the matter of the Speaker&#146;s
Committee?</p><p><a name="06070327000034">As
there has been some discussion in evidence to the Committee on
Standards in Public Life about an alleged lack of transparency in the
operations of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, I should perhaps note in
passing that it was a deliberate decision of the House, welcomed by all
the principal parties, that Mr. Speaker should chair the Committee that
bears his name. In 2000, the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Bill as originally envisaged, provided for Mr. Speaker
merely to appoint members to the Committee. Mr. Speaker&#146;s
predecessor agreed with the Government that she would become an
ex-officio Chairman of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, and that
decision was welcomed by all the principal parties. The view has been
taken that it would be inappropriate for a Committee of which the
Speaker is an active participant to meet in public. That is the basis
on which the Committee currently operates. There is obviously a
trade-off to be made between the degree of transparency and Mr. Speaker
taking an active part in the Committee&#146;s work. For my part, I
have no doubt that the benefit of the authority of his involvement far
outweighs the effects of the inevitable but limited reduction in
transparency.</p><p><a name="06070327000035">The
Speaker&#146;s Committee also approves the Commission&#146;s
five-year corporate plan. The Government intended the functions of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee to mirror as closely as possible those
ofthe Public Accounts Commission in relation to the National
Audit Office. They nonetheless had anxieties about how those
arrangements would work in practice and included safeguards in the
legislation designed to prevent what they described as runaway
expenditure. The Speaker&#146;s Committee is therefore required to
consult the Treasury on both the estimate and corporate plan and to
have regard to any advice that the Treasury may give. It must also have
regard to the most recent annual value for money report on the
Electoral Commission produced by the Comptroller and Auditor
General.</p><p><a name="06070327000036">Both the
Treasury input and the NAO reports are very much more than a
tick-the-box exercise. The NAO typically reports each year on a
specific policy that accounts for a significant amount of the Electoral
Commission&#146;s expenditure, such as its public awareness strategy,
on which the NAO has reported to us twice. In many cases, the
NAO&#146;s choice of subject reflects the concerns that the
Speaker&#146;s Committee has expressed, so there is a welcome synergy
between us. It is also a very transparent input; the Speaker&#146;s
Committee publishes these reports for all to
see.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 589</b><br><p><a name="06070327000037">The Speaker&#146;s Committee
has a significant part in promoting understanding between the Electoral
Commission and the House. However, it is not the only body with a role
in this place. I welcome the fact that various departmental Committees
have examined the commission&#146;s policy stances on a number of
important issues. While it is the duty of the Speaker&#146;s
Committee to be mindful, on behalf of the House, of what we call the
three Es&#151;economy, efficiency and effectiveness&#151;it is open
to others to hold the commission to account in the context of its wider
interests for its policy stances. The two strands of parliamentary
strategy are complementary, not competitive.</p><p><a name="06070327000038">Taken overall, I would submit
that there are few tranches of public expenditure of a similar size for
which Government are responsible that are subject to the same level of
sustained and systematic parliamentary scrutiny as is the Electoral
Commission.
</p><p><a name="06070327000039">About
five years on after the creation of the Electoral Commission, where do
we stand? The commission started out with an agenda that its chairman
described to the Speaker&#146;s Committee in November 2001 as
&#147;very ambitious&#148; in relation to its newness and the
existing resource level. The commission has grown. Its net resource
requirement for 2006-07 is &#163;26.18 million, and it now has an
average full-time equivalent staff of 150, compared with 25 in March
2001.</p><p><a name="06070327000040">The commission
has thoroughly documented its work in the successive annual reports
that it has presented to Parliament. I will comment later on some
aspect of its record.</p><p><a name="06070327000041">Over the past five years, the
political outlook has changed considerably. The conclusions of the
Jenkin&#146;s Committee, which clearly had a marked effect on the
Government&#146;s thinking about the role of the commission, have not
been implemented. The electoral modernisation has thrown up real doubts
about the wider impact of some of the changes that have been made, such
as easier access to postal votes. More recently, the controversy over
loans to political parties has raised doubts among the general public
over the effectiveness of the controls enacted in the year 2000, and
further dented public confidence in politicians and political parties.
At the same time the level of voter engagement remains historically
low.</p><p><a name="06070327000042">Not
surprisingly, this change in political outlook has impacted on the
Electoral Commission and raised questions as to whether the original
1991 blueprint still meets the current requirements. Thus some have
expressed the view that the commission&#146;s remit is too broad and
that it would be a more effective body if its remit were concentrated
on its core regulatory functions. Others have accused it of lacking
political awareness, suggesting that it would be more effective if
some, at least, of the commissioners had experience of active
politics.</p><p><a name="06070327000043">The
commission has had its disagreements with Government on a number of
issues&#151;notably on the extent of the piloting of postal voting in
the European elections and the acceptability of all-postal voting at
elections, and the need for improved safeguards for our current system
of postal voting on demand. There is particularly the debate about
individual electoral registration.</p><p><a name="06070327000044">In that context, it is worth
recalling the key principles on which Henry Samuel Chapman built the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 590</b><br>first secret ballot law 150 years ago&#151;the rock on which our
current system ultimately rests and
which</p><a name="06070327000194"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;by combining
secrecy with limited vote-tracing both protected the elector and
detected fraud when election results were in
dispute.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000045">People tend to
remember the secret ballot and tend not to know about limited vote
tracing, both of which are very important.</p><p><a name="06070327000046">That an independent body has a
difference of view with the Government over a policy issue is not
inherently a problem, but each of these is a sensitive political issue,
and there is a risk in these circumstances that such disagreement may
lead to a loss of confidence in the political process at a time when
there is general concern about overall levels of political engagement.
Some, such as the Government in their evidence to the Committee on
Standards in Public Life, have therefore raised the issue whether the
commission&#146;s policy development role continues to be
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06070327000047">There
have been two general elections&#151;in 2001 and 2005&#151;since
the Electoral Commission was established, but the most recent general
election was the first in respect of which the relevant provisions of
the 2000 legislation, including the provisions relating to notional
expenditure, applied fully. For all these reasons, and others besides,
it seems right that the opportunity is now taken on a number of fronts
to take stock of the arrangements put in place in 2000, and to consider
how best to move forward. One contribution to this process is, of
course, this debate. I welcome the many Members who wish to
participate. If the debate did not start at7 o&#146;clock as
we originally intended, I do not think that it is for me to apologise.
I am grateful for the attendance. The debate is an important part to
the process of discussion.</p><p><a name="06070327000048">There are three other strands
that I should mention. The first is the Committee on Standards in
Public Life&#146;s inquiry, which is currently in hand, focusing on
the core issues of the mandate, governance and accountability of the
Electoral Commission. In practical terms, this means examining the
current responsibilities and the balance between the
commission&#146;s executive and advisory functions. The inquiry is
expected to be completed by the end of the year. I have been pleased to
give evidence to it on behalf of the Speaker&#146;s Committee. I will
do so again, and I look forward to seeing the Committee&#146;s
conclusions.</p><p><a name="06070327000049">The
Speaker&#146;s Committee has taken steps to satisfy itself that its
conclusions that the estimates and corporate plans that it lays before
the House are, in the words of the 2000 Act, consistent with
the</p><a name="06070327000195"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;economical,
efficient and effective discharge by the Commission of its
functions&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000050">Those
are the three Es that I mentioned earlier. The Committee was itself
planning a general inquiry that would have encompassed issues relating
to the commission&#146;s governance and accountability, but deferred
these elements when it learned of the proposed inquiry by the CSPL.
Instead, the Speaker&#146;s Committee asked the Scrutiny
Committee&#151;that is the scrutiny unit at the House&#151;to carry
out a detailed study of the commission&#146;s business and financial
planning processes, how it assesses the effectiveness of policy
outcomes and how the statutory roles of the Treasury and the National
Audit Office contribute to the discharge of the Committee&#146;s
duty.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 591</b><br><p><a name="06070327000051">The
Speaker&#146;s Committee entrusted this review to the scrutiny unit,
which has the necessary specialist expertise to conduct precisely this
sort of review. I understand that this is the first exercise of this
type that the unit has undertaken. The Committee was pleased with the
thorough job done by the unit, and the positive response of the
Electoral Commission to the recommendations addressed to it. The
Speaker&#146;s Committee is still considering the detailed
recommendations that the unit addressed to it, designed to improve the
effectiveness of its scrutiny. Already, however, it has set up a
sub-committee, which I chair, and the Minister is good enough to
participate in our discussions. This is to give consideration to the
recommendations, and I expect to be putting forward recommendations as
to their implementation before the full Committee before the summer
recess.</p><p><a name="06070327000052">Finally,
there is Sir Hayden Phillips&#146; review of the funding of political
parties. It is also relevant to the work of the Electoral Commission.
Given the extension of the terms of reference in 1997 to the Electoral
Commission, specifically to cover party funding issues, it is perhaps
surprising that a separate review was felt necessary as a result of the
controversy over loans to political parties.</p><p><a name="06070327000053">I propose
briefly to analyse three specific aspects of the work of Electoral
Commission, including its record in each and some of the concerns that
have been expressed. They are: first, governance and accountability;
second, regulatory functions; thirdly, advisory
functions.</p><p><a name="06070327000054">In broad
terms, the accountability arrangements to the House appear to have
worked satisfactorily. As I have already said, the arrangements for
regulating its finances have operated effectively, and the run-away
expenditure feared by the Government has not materialised. All the
existing commissioners whose original periods of office have expired
have been reappointed; none of the reappointments has proved
controversial in the House. The commission has been to keen to
participate in Select Committee inquiries, and this has provided an
opportunity for its policy stances critically to be
examined.</p><p><a name="06070327000055">Less
satisfactory, perhaps, have been the arrangements for the political
parties to make an input to the commission. While the political parties
panel, constituted under section 4 of the 2000 Act, has provided a
mechanism for party inputs at an official level, the parties and the
commission appear not to have developed a similar mechanism at a
political level. Given that commissioners are by definition people with
no political experience insofar as that relates to donations, political
employment or standing for election for at least 10 years before their
appointment, this has been seen as a weakness, in that the commission
has had little exposure to front-line political reality. This, some
would argue, has been reflected in the overall way in which it has
interpreted its role, and on occasion in the nature of the proposals
that it has made.</p><p><a name="06070327000056">In
relation to its regulatory functions, the commission has continued to
register new political parties. The number on the register has more
than tripled since 2001 to 394. The commission has also received and
published details of more than 13,000 donations to political parties
totalling more than 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 592</b><br>&#163;180 million, and some &#163;86 million of campaign expenditure
at six elections and one referendum, since 2001, while investigating
where there is doubt about whether the existing rules have been
followed.</p><p><a name="06070327000057">A welcome
change, for which provision will be made in the Electoral
Administration Bill, will be the one-stop-shop for Members, whereby the
information needed by the Commission for its register of recordable
donations may be drawn from information given to the Register of
Members&#146; Interests. However, as the recent controversy over
loans to political parties has shown, there is evidence that public
confidence in some parts of the political arrangements is fragile at
best.</p><p><a name="06070327000058">It is right to
record that the Electoral Commission has successfully completed the 126
reviews of local authority electoral boundaries in England that it
inherited from the Local Government Commission for England and has
implemented all the consequent changes in good time for the next
election in the reviewed area. It successfully conducted the regional
government referendum in the north-east of England in November
2004.</p><p><a name="06070327000059"><b><a name="06070327000220">Simon
Hughes:</b> On the local government boundary issue and the
transfer of functions to the Electoral Commission, is it the view of
the Speaker&#146;s Committee that that job has been well done? If it
is, has the committee taken the view that therefore it would be
logical&#151;this point was made earlier by one of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s colleagues&#151;for the commission to be given as
soon as practicable the responsibility for all other boundaries,
because the precedent is a good
one?</p><p><a name="06070327000060"><b><a name="06070327000221">Peter
Viggers:</b> My best answer to that is that the
Speaker&#146;s Committee takes the view that the Electoral Commission
has fulfilled its role satisfactorily&#151;even very
satisfactorily&#151;but that it does not follow logically that the
work of the boundary commission should be referred to it. I hope and
trust that the Minister will refer to that matter
later.</p>

<p><a name="06070327000061"><b><a name="06070327000222">Mr.
Steen:</b> As I understand it, my hon. Friend is saying that
the commission&#146;s job with regard to local authority boundaries
has been very satisfactorily dealt with&#151;as my hon. Friend, if I
may call him that, the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
(Simon Hughes) pointed out. Why is my hon. Friend the Member for
Gosport (Peter Viggers) not as bullish about parliamentary boundaries?
Is it because he has not got the remit to speak, or is it that he feels
certain reservations that he does not feel able to share with the
House?</p><p><a name="06070327000062"><b><a name="06070327000223">Peter
Viggers:</b> It is for the Government, and not the
Speaker&#146;s Committee, to take the initiative on this issue, so my
diffidence is entirely justified.</p><p><a name="06070327000063">The Electoral
Commission has built up a role in providing authoritative advice and
guidance to those involved in running our elections&#151;the
electoral registration officers and returning officers. It has to be
borne in mind that it is the officers, not the commission, who have the
direct responsibility. However, we should consider some of the figures
being put forward for the number of errors on the electoral
roll&#151;both people who are not on it who should be and people who
are on it who should 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 593</b><br>not be. Dr. Pinto Duschinsky, in evidence to the Committee on Standards
in Public Life, recently suggested that there might be up to 7 million
errors&#151;a projection of an estimated under-registration of 3.5
million. That figure is disputed by the Electoral Commission. There
clearly remains substantial scope for improvement on that
score.</p><p><a name="06070327000064">The commission
has also worked hard to promote public awareness of, and participation
in, the democratic process. However, it is certainly open to colleagues
to comment if they feel that the Electoral Commission need give that
area less emphasis in future. That is a matter for colleagues to advise
on.</p><p><a name="06070327000065">The Electoral
Commission has come a long way in the past five years. It has
established itself as a serious and respected player on the electoral
scene&#151;from a standing start. It has not been helped in that
process by some of the rough edges on the legislative
framework&#151;at least some of which arose from the rushed enactment
of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The
Electoral Administration Bill addresses some of those matters, but
there remain a number of other issues, such as the qualification for
office, which may also be relevant.</p><p><a name="06070327000066">The
considerable achievements are a tribute to the hard work and dedication
of the Electoral Commission; the chairman, Sam Younger, and his fellow
commissioners; Peter Wardle and his predecessor as chief executive; and
all the staff. I visited the Electoral Commission recently to reopen
their refurbished offices and I was greatly impressed first by the
youth of the staff and then, in discussion with them, by their
commitment and enthusiasm. They are a good team. I also pay a personal
tribute to Dr. Christopher Ward, the Clerk of the Speaker&#146;s
Committee, who has been enormously helpful.</p><p><a name="06070327000067">I know from the
Speaker&#146;s Committee&#146;s own examination of the commission
that the commissioners accept the need to consider at this juncture
whether their priorities are clear enough and, in particular, whether
they have achieved the right balance between their different functions.
As the commission recognises, a key issue that it currently faces is
the extent to which the balance between its different
roles&#151;between its regulatory and advisory functions&#151;may
need to change in the light of the developments since it was first
established in 2000. As I said at the start of the debate, tonight is a
first. It gives the House an opportunity to reflect not only on the
considerable achievements of the Electoral Commission to date, but on
how we would like to see it move forward in the light of the challenges
that we face in the electoral field and elsewhere. I look forward to
hearing colleagues&#146; views. I apologise for taking so long, but
there are certain matters that it is important to put on the
record.</p><p><a name="06070327000068"><b><a name="06070327000224">Several

pm</h5><p><a name="06070327000071"><b><a name="06070327000226">Dr.
Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> I, too, welcome
the debate. I share the view of the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter
Viggers) that it is important. However, as he pointed out, it is the
first time since the Electoral Commission was formed that such as
debate has been held. In many ways, the arrangements that the Electoral
Commission has with the House&#151;in terms of how it reports to the
House, how it is scrutinised and how it performs its
function&#151;have played the role of an inspired invention. I am
talking about resolving through the legislation the difficulty of how
such a commission would work&#151;deeply involved as it was going to
be in matters that could be politically controversial, even though it
clearly should not be politically biased in its own right. How that
situation was resolved in the legislation, and the function of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Electoral Commission in that respect,
constituted that inspired invention.</p><p><a name="06070327000072">However, in reality, as the
hon. Gentleman said, the Electoral Commission is the equivalent of a
medium-sized non-departmental public body. It has a staff of 150 and a
budget of &#163;26 million. Normally, as far as the Government are
concerned, the structure for such bodies&#151;particularly, say, next
steps agencies&#151;will be a parent Department, a framework
agreement and a series of relationships with that Department in order
to specify how the accountability is to be undertaken. No such
framework exists for the Electoral Commission. There are a number of
other unique elements of that relationship with the House, which do not
in any way parallel the relationship of any other body of similar
size.</p><p><a name="06070327000073">In practice, the
Speaker&#146;s Committee has performed something of a scrutiny role
towards the work of the Electoral Commission through its meetings.
However, as the hon. Gentleman said, those are not held in public. He
gives understandable reasons for that, but it does have something of a
result. The Speaker&#146;s Committee accidentally, rather than
deliberately, scrutinises what the Electoral Commission is doing. We
have an indirect form of running accountability to the House, through
the short time allotted to questions to the Chairman of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee each month.
</p><p><a name="06070327000074">I ask myself whether
the commission might be more formally scrutinised through the medium of
a Select Committee, as a departmentally attached agency might be. I can
suggest a candidate for that role: the Constitutional Affairs
Committee, of which I am a member. In any event, the Chair of that
Committee, or a Committee designated by the legislation, sits on the
Speaker&#146;s Committee by statutory authority. It might be possible
for the Speaker&#146;s Committee to change its function. It could
take upon itself a scrutinising role through the appointment of senior
Back Benchers to form a scrutiny committee. Perhaps a good alternative
would be for that Select Committee function to be more formalised in
connection with the way in which the Electoral Commission
works.</p><p><a name="06070327000075">The hon.
Gentleman also mentioned what I think is a very restrictive definition
in the legislation of who may be appointed as an electoral
commissioner, or even an assistant electoral commissioner. It is
enshrined in the legislation that if a person is to be appointed to
such a post, they cannot have been a member of a 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 595</b><br>political party or held any form of office in one, and cannot have been
employed by a political party or, indeed, have been a named donor to
one. It is understandable that a number of those restrictions may be
imposed, but it is perhaps less known that also set out in the
legislation are similar if slightly less onerous restrictions on all
members of staff of the commission. Therefore, almost the entire
commission will never have had any dealings with political parties,
certainly not for a very long time.</p><p><a name="06070327000076">As the duties and
responsibilities of the Electoral Commission lie at the heart of the
functioning of the democratic system of government in the UK, and
political parties are an integral part of that, the involvement in the
political process of the electoral commissioners and the staff of the
Electoral Commission is a pertinent question to consider. As I have
said, those who put themselves forward as candidates for the post of
electoral commissioner are outside the political process, and it might
be necessary to readdress the legislation, but the question that arises
is whether there should be additional commissioners appointed through
the medium of political parties, or whether the nomination of
commissioners in its own right should be addressed. After all,
political even-handedness is not the same as political celibacy. It
would be beneficial to the functioning of the Electoral Commission if
the position on the political involvement of both commissioners and
staff were
reviewed.</p><p><a name="06070327000077">As the hon.
Member for Gosport also mentioned, the Electoral Commission has devoted
a considerable proportion of its resource not just to regulating
elections but to the promotion of electoral awareness and to providing
information on the practice of elections and referendums. Within the
terms of that remit, it has promoted electoral awareness well, but it
must be said that the limitations have meant that only one area has
been addressed&#151;voter disengagement, and the issue of not knowing
what to do about voting in an era of what one might say are atomised
families who might previously have gone to the polls
together.</p><p><a name="06070327000078">The results
of the commission&#146;s audit of political engagement show, however,
that other factors are at work. In particular, there is a distaste for
voting among those in their 40s, not just among the newly enfranchised.
The question of whether such distaste results from the inability of
parties to engage voters or from a more problematic anti-politics
societal norm is a difficult one to answer, but either way it presents
the Electoral Commission with a difficult task if it is to promote
voting on a wider basis than simply providing information about how to
do it. In essence, the challenge is one of promoting the norms and
necessities of democracy and politics themselves, which might be
considered outside the commission&#146;s
remit.</p><p><a name="06070327000079">In
considering what the commission does to advance awareness of the
electoral process, it is tempting, therefore, to argue for a
bifurcation of that promoting role. There certainly is a need for
information and reminding, and for research into the process of
voting&#151;certainly about whether the present geographically based
system of casting votes is seen to be appropriate to new generations 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 596</b><br>of voters, and whether changes in its structure can overcome other
issues such as the security and integrity of the vote.</p><p><a name="06070327000080">However, the process of
argument about the role that politics plays in democracy in the UK and
why the political process, including elections, is important might be a
remit too far for the commission, and the development of political
democracy foundations similar to those established in Germany, such as
the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung and the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, which
represent the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats
respectively, might be a better course of action to address the issue.
That would entail, of course, the development and resolution of the
argument about state funding for political parties, since the
establishment of such foundations could not be seriously contemplated
within the present structure of voluntary funding of political
parties.</p><p><a name="06070327000081">That brings
me to the role of the commission in policing the regulation of
political parties and the control of campaign finance. Other Members
have mentioned that the Electoral Commission has in general been
relatively effective&#151;within, frankly, a flawed regulatory
brief&#151;at implementing and policing the recording and controlling
role. The commission has been less effective in the regulation of
donations to political parties, partly because of its own issues about
asking questions about donations that might be considered at the
margins of its remit, and partly because of the limitations of that
remit itself.</p><p><a name="06070327000082">The
question that might be asked of the Electoral Commission is this: what
exactly does it regulate? Its name suggests that it regulates
elections, but its practice suggests that it regulates the conduct and
practice of elections and the functioning of political parties where
they relate to elections. As elections are an important but by no means
the sole activity of political parties, that entails the close
regulation of some party activity relating to the democratic process,
but no regulation of other matters, even where those matters are
closely connected. For example, the registration of parties in order to
nominate candidates is regulated, but the process of nominating
candidates for elections is not. The activity of such candidates once
nominated may be regulated, provided that it is within the period of an
election, but the activity and funding methods of adopted candidates
outside an electoral period is not regulated.</p><p><a name="06070327000083">In reality, political parties
do not make such distinctions, and in any event they do not operate
financially and in soliciting and managing donations in identical ways.
Therefore, it may be said that the first problem arises from an implied
assumption in the legislation that UK political parties are in essence
machines for electing people to posts&#151;essentially the American
party model&#151;and the second problem arises from an apparent
assumption by the Electoral Commission that, provided certain reporting
rules and accounting conventions were laid down, it would be possible
to gain a coherent picture of parties&#146; funding and hence
donations.</p><p><a name="06070327000084">The
Conservatives and the Labour party do not work, and never have worked,
in identical ways. The ways in which the parties fund themselves differ
fundamentally. The Conservative party was formed in Parliament and
gained supporters&#146; associations that 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 597</b><br>raised money for the party, while the Labour party was formed outside
Parliament and operated as both a federation and a centralised party,
combining funds in the middle in order to get into
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06070327000085">The
regulation of donations by the commission therefore often fails to
record accurately the real income of parties and does not pick up
innovations such as the recent funding of local parties outside the
campaign period to promote nominated candidates with the use of money
that might otherwise be declared as central donations. Proper
regulation under those circumstances would probably entail an extension
of the assumption of regulation of political parties generally, and
might therefore also entail a required operating standard for political
parties themselves. That might call into question the reasonable right
of political parties to organise themselves in the way that they feel
is best appropriate to their political and geographical circumstances.
Regulation that covered the whole range of party financial activity,
locally and nationally, regardless of the method of organisation, might
be more appropriate, and certainly a more transparent and
understandable way for the Electoral Commission to discharge its
regulatory function effectively in
future.</p><p><a name="06070327000086"><b><a name="06070327000227">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Does my hon. Friend
accept that some of us face particular difficulties inasmuch as, as
Labour/Co-operative MPs, we represent two parties? The two parties
could operate differently, and therefore any regulation must carefully
take account of diversity, because I would hate to have to choose which
party I wanted to
follow.</p><p><a name="06070327000087"><b><a name="06070327000228">Dr.
Whitehead:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point about
how we regulate for diversity. I was emphasising the fact that, because
of that issue, the commission has, not through any lack of resolve or
resourcefulness on its part, but perhaps because of the way in which
the legislation and its remit are cast, struggled to regulate campaign
and party expenditure. It has regulated well expenditure that clearly
occurs within campaigns, but that is and always has been an artificial
construct.</p><p><a name="06070327000088">One could
argue that campaigns in marginal seats start on the day that the
original result is declared and the seat is then appraised as being, or
becoming, a marginal. Efforts to regulate the campaign better by
defining more accurately what the campaign period is will probably be
doomed to failure. Indeed, as hon. Members will be aware, that is
precisely the difficulty that arose during consideration of how we
might legislate for that in the Electoral Administration Bill. Again,
the question arises of proper regulation implying oversight over the
whole activity of party politics&#151;the entire expenditure of
parties both locally and nationally.</p><p><a name="06070327000089">My plea to the House in respect
of the future conduct of the Electoral Commission is that the
commission works well where its remit is clearly defined and where that
remit can be undertaken transparently and expertly; it works less well
where the remit itself remains unclear, or the arrangements under which
the commission can work within that remit are incomplete. Perhaps, as
the hon. Member for Gosport hinted, it is time to review and make sure
that the remit 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 598</b><br>within which the Electoral Commission works in its regulatory, its
advisory and its promotional functions is more clearly defined. In that
way, we might ensure that on the sticky issue of how parties are
regulated and funded, among other matters, the procedure is clear, and
the role that the commission plays in it is therefore also

John Horam (Orpington) (Con):</b> In today&#146;s estimates
debate, it is appropriate to consider whether the Electoral Commission
is giving the taxpayer value for money. I believe that it could improve
the service it provides and reduce its costs if it took certain steps,
which I shall outline.</p><p><a name="06070327000091">The
commission employs about 150 people. I acknowledge the tribute that my
hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) paid to their
enthusiasm and youth&#151;I was glad to hear that&#151;and to the
excellent role played by the chairman. The commission costs the
taxpayer approximately &#163;26 million&#151;a figure that could be
cut by up to a half immediately if the commission accepted the
suggestion inherent in the remarksmade by the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test(Dr. Whitehead), that all the activity to
encourage participation is well beyond the role that the Electoral
Commission can realistically be expected to perform. The fact is that,
as I am well aware following my recent involvement in the by-election
in Bromley and Chislehurst, participation in general elections and in
local elections is affected by very different matters from putting an
advert on the side of a London bus telling people to go and vote and
giving them more information. The issue is far wider and bigger than
that, and, to be frank, the Electoral Commission is wasting its time
getting involved. The activity was imposed on the commission by the
Government&#151;it was not in its original remit&#151;and I think
that the commission should get well clear. Quite apart from anything
else, that sort of marketing activity requires different skills from
the regulatory role that is the commission&#146;s core
business.</p><p><a name="06070327000092">The
commission should concentrate on its core business. As we know, it has
taken a conscientious and straightforward approach in advocating
individual registration and personal identifiers. The fact is, however,
that the Government have in large measure refused to implement those
measures through the Electoral Administration Bill. At that point, the
commission should have had the robustness to say openly that the
Government, to their credit, set it up precisely to take such delicate
issues out of party politics but then, when the commission made
sensible proposals, the Government voted them down, and that is to fly
in the face of the logic of setting up the commission in the first
place. The Government have adopted a nonsensical position and the
Electoral Commission should have been more robust in making that plain.
I realise that there are difficulties in the way of the commission
making those points in public with force. None the less, it should have
tried, especially in view of the information dug up by my hon. Friend
the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) about the advice
given on the Government&#146;s consultation document by various
Labour consultees that are in favour of individual registration and
personal identifiers. That was brought out dramatically 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 599</b><br>in our last debate on the Electoral Administration Bill, and I am
pleased because it shows that there is support, not merely from the
official Opposition, the Liberal Democrats and the minor parties, but
from the Labour party for that sort of sensible improvement. As we have
always said, Britain and Zimbabwe are the only countries that do not
have individual registration, and it is ridiculous that it should be
so.</p><p><a name="06070327000093">Several hon.
Members have spoken about the Speaker&#146;s Committee and
accountability and their points were well made. With due respect to the
efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport, who has done a
conscientious and comprehensive job, as has the Speaker&#146;s
Committee, whose independence and neutrality we accept absolutely, the
fact is that the Speaker&#146;s Office and the Speaker himself have
many, many other responsibilities. The amount of time that the Speaker
and the Speaker&#146;s Committee can devote to these issues is
limited. I do not know how many times the Committee has met to consider
the matter of the Electoral Commission, but I suspect that the number
of such occasions is quite small in any one year. That suggests that,
as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said and my hon. Friend the
Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) has said on more than one occasion,
we need to examine the arrangements for accountability to this House.
Various suggestions have been made&#151;some rather
complicated&#151;but the matter should be grasped as soon as
possible. The present arrangements are not entirely satisfactory, even
though the Speaker&#146;s Committee is very conscientious.</p><p><a name="06070327000094">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Totnes(Mr. Steen) pointed out, with
great force, in his intervention, the whole business of whether the
Electoral Commission should take over the work of the boundary
commissions is a total mess. It is profoundly unsatisfactory and there
seems to be no clear decisiveness about what will
happen.</p><p><a name="06070327000095"><b><a name="06070327000230">Mr.
Steen:</b> Is my hon. Friend aware that 351 seats in this
House cover approximately 61,000 electors, despite the fact that this
House has instructed the boundary commission to make each parliamentary
seat cover 70,000 electors? Does he agree that the present boundary
commission arrangements are not only not working, but they are going
against what Parliament has recommended; and that if the boundary
commission&#146;s responsibilities are not to be transferred to the
Electoral Commission, something else should be done so that we get
parliamentary seats of the size that this House has
recommended&#151;something that has been prevented by the present
arrangements?</p><p><a name="06070327000096"><b><a name="06070327000231">Mr.
Horam:</b> My view is that votes should have equal weight,
wherever they are in the country. That is the principle that I would
like to see adopted by the boundary commissions. At present, we have
four boundary commissions and votes in different parts of the country
carry different weights, and that is unacceptable. I would like the
Electoral Commission to take that on board and I would like the
Government, whatever their views on the matter, to listen to the views
of the Electoral Commission. I do not take a strong view either way on
whether the Electoral Commission itself should take over the work of
the boundary commission, which would be quite a big 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 600</b><br>bundle of work, or whether the boundary commission should remain in some
form but supervised by the Electoral Commission. Whatever happens,
given that the present round of boundary arrangements is being
completed, the Government have plenty of time to consider the matter
fundamentally. As my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes says, this is
very important, so let us have clear decisions from the
Government.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070327000201">8.38
pm</h5><p><a name="06070327000097"><b><a name="06070327000232">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> As we know, the
Electoral Commission is responsible for overseeing several aspects of
electoral law, such as the registration of political parties, the
monitoring of significant donations and the regulation of party
spending on electoral campaigns. A further responsibility is promoting
public awareness of, and involvement in, the democratic system. I
understand that that responsibility commands 50 per cent. of the
commission&#146;s budget, and I will refer to that aspect of its role
first.</p><p><a name="06070327000098">Over the past
nine months or so, we have been discussing and debating low turnout in
elections and the associated problems of falling electoral
registration. In the Second Reading debate on the Electoral
Administration Bill last October, hon. Members acknowledged that there
was a crisis in registration. The Minister of State, Department for
Constitutional Affairs, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), talked about &#147;democracy
deserts&#148; and the fact that 3 million people, most of whom share
some of the characteristics of being poor, council tenants, black, or
living in inner-city areas, would not be on the register, whereas those
who were better off would be. The problem is illustrated in my
constituency and local authority area. Registration levels in Salford
vary from 75 per cent. to 92 per cent., with some wards having
registration levels as low as 64 per cent., which represents less than
two thirds of the people in those
wards.</p><p><a name="06070327000099">Low
registration leads inexorably to low turnout, and the turnout recorded
in last year&#146;s general election was 61 per cent. The Electoral
Commission&#146;s most recent audit of political engagement showed
that beneath the headline figures there were now considerable
disparities in the extent of political engagement among certain social
groups. That shows that social and political exclusion are strongly
related and mutually reinforcing. The report says that professional
workers are more likely to feel knowledgeable about politics than
manual workers or the unemployed. Only a minority of those in very
deprived areas are interested in politics, while a quarter are now
unwilling to engage in any activity around influencing decisions.
Perhaps most depressing of all, the extent of political knowledge and
interest in acting and participating is lower among younger people than
it is among the population as a whole. Anyone who is active in
political campaigning will know that there is a cohort of younger
people who have never voted and are becoming less likely to do so as
the years pass. I find it depressing to canvass a 30-year-old who says,
&#147;I have never
voted.&#148;</p><p><a name="06070327000100">Such
trends are well known by those who are locally and nationally
politically active, and they form the subject of comment and debate by
bodies such as the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 601</b><br>Hansard Society and of reports such as that of the Power inquiry. Having
set up the Electoral Commission with the express responsibility of
promoting public awareness of, and involvement in, the democratic
process, hon. Members should be worried that, five years on, we have a
crisis in registration and democracy deserts, with young people and
people in deprived areas being uninterested in our democracy and
unwilling to vote or to try to influence decision making. Happily,
there are measures in the Electoral Administration Bill to start to
remedy the problem of registration and to give returning officers more
powers to improve access to voting and promote participation.</p><p><a name="06070327000101">The Electoral Commission has
presided over a slide in registration and has done little that has been
truly effective to halt the decline in turnout. Additionally, the
commission has quite wrongly argued for amendments to the Electoral
Administration Bill that might lead to an even greater decline in
registration. It has backed individual registration despite knowing
that when such a system was introduced in Northern Ireland, it caused a
10 per cent. dip in
registration.</p><p><a name="06070327000102"><b><a name="06070327000233">Mr.
Heald:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</p><p><a name="06070327000103"><b><a name="06070327000234">Barbara
Keeley:</b> No. We have spoken about these matters a great
deal during our consideration of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070327000104">When I spoke on
the matter on Second Reading last October, I recalled that an electoral
registration officer for the Trafford local authority had said that, in
his view,</p><a name="06070327000196"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;whole areas
of the electorate would not
respond&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000105">to requests for
individual registration, especially the poorest responding groups, such
as young people. The registration officer for Salford local authority
said more recently that he thought that moving to individual
registration would have an impact on the register that would
be</p><a name="06070327000197"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a throwback to the
days of the poll
tax&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070327000106">because it would
make the registration numbers drop like a stone and they would not
recover for many
years.</p><p><a name="06070327000107">I have referred
to the cohort identified by the Electoral Commission of young people
who do not register or vote when they attain voting age and become less
and less likely to register and vote. That links to targets that the
commission has set, so I am surprised that it has taken such a stand on
registration over the past eight or nine
months.</p><p><a name="06070327000108"><b><a name="06070327000235">Mr.
Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b> Will the hon. Lady
give

Keeley:</b>
No.</p><p><a name="06070327000110">The Committee on
Standards in Public Life is conducting an inquiry into the Electoral
Commission and has asked about the balance of the division of
responsibilities between the commission and other public bodies when
promoting public awareness of, and participation in, elections. The
balance is not working well at present. Propensity to vote, which is a
key aspect of the Electoral Commission&#146;s targets 2 and 3 on the
increased or maintained likelihood of voting, is measured at 52 per
cent. Surprisingly, the most recent 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 602</b><br>report shows that the commission did not until this year establish
measures of public awareness on how to cast a vote, where to find out
about practical arrangements for voting, and why it is important to
vote. Those are key measures to have waited six years to
establish.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060703/debtext/60703-0731.htm"/>


<p><a name="06070327000111">So we have
very low levels of public awareness of, and declining levels of
involvement in, our democratic process. On target three, the percentage
of the public who feel that they know about politics has fallen from 45
per cent. to 39 per cent., so the key indicators are in
decline.</p><p><a name="06070327000112"><b><a name="06070327000237">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con):</b> Is the hon. Lady aware of
the huge amount of research showing that there is enormous&#151;in
some respects, unprecedented&#151;public involvement in politics? I
am thinking of the volume of correspondence to MPs, the great increase
in activity on the internet and young people&#146;s extensive
knowledge of, and involvement in, single-issue politics. Is not much of
the problem the failure of political parties to appeal to young people,
rather than young people deciding to dissociate themselves from
politics
altogether?</p><p><a name="06070327000113"><b><a name="06070327000238">Barbara
Keeley:</b> No, I do not agree. I have been
heavily involved in a single-issue organisation&#151;Amnesty
International&#151;for more than 20 years. Indeed, my husband used to
chair the local group, but when he gave it up nobody else was willing
to do it. Despite claims of increasing membership of such single-issue
organisations, we found that, in the entire borough area that we
served, it was very hard to get six, seven or eight people even to
attend meetings. People will sign the odd postcard and send messages on
the internet, but they will not contribute in various ways to the
running of such organisations. That happens not only in political
parties and single-issue campaigning groups, but in scouts, guides and
volunteering organisations. So I do not agree that the problem lies
with political parties; it is a problem in our society that the
Electoral Commission was charged with addressing, but which it has not
addressed
fully.</p><p><a name="06070327000114">A
further question relating to the Electoral Commission is governance,
which has been touched on, and I want to comment briefly on the
restrictions on who can be an electoral commissioner or, indeed, work
for the commission. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test
(Dr. Whitehead) raised this issue and I agree that the situation needs
to be reviewed. There is growing recognition that the restrictions are
unworkable. A national body is charged with regulating political
parties and their finances&#151;a complicated issue,
currently&#151;advising those involved in elections and reporting on
major elections; yet knowledge and experience of party structures,
organisation, fundraising and campaigning are disqualifiers for either
governing, or working for, that
body.</p><p><a name="06070327000115">In that context,
the Electoral Commission would perhaps have benefited from establishing
a robust relationship with political parties. When the Constitutional
Affairs Committee asked questions on this subject of Sam Younger, the
chairman and chief executive of the Electoral Commission, last
November, we were surprised to find out that that had not happened.
When questioned about the commission&#146;s being politically
naïve&#151;as it was put to him&#151;he 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 603</b><br>admitted that the commission had forged a working relationship with only
one political party, meeting quarterly with the Conservatives&#146;
1922 committee of Back Benchers. I found it astonishing, and I still
do, that an independent body charged with regulating parties and their
finance had, in effect, developed a working relationship with only one
party.</p><p><a name="06070327000116">Since that
shortcoming was identified, there have been a number of informal
meetings with MPs, which I and other Labour Members have attended. Sam
Younger will soon meet Members of both Houses to discuss this issue and
to see whether a way forward can be established. However, the fact
remains that, five years after we established the Electoral Commission,
it had not forged working relationships with the political parties
until members of the Committee on which I serve queried that point. So
as with the crisis in registration, static or falling turnout and low
levels of political engagement, the time must be right to re-examine
restrictions on the governance of, and staff employment in, the
Electoral Commission, so that it does not continue to be politically
naïve by
design.</p><p><a name="06070327000117">The issues to
which I have referred have been highlighted over the past eight to nine
months, and since then there has been recognition of gaps in
performance. It has perhaps been a question of too little, too late on
registration, as I have outlined, but rather more has been done on
trying to bridge the gap between the commission and political parties.
I hope that these improvements continue and gather pace, so that, in
the new situation following the passage in a few months&#146; time of
the Electoral Administration Bill, there will be a greatly improved
Electoral Commission.
</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070327000202">8.49
pm</h5><p><a name="06070327000118"><b><a name="06070327000239">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers), who gave an outstanding
speech setting out what the Electoral Commission has been doing and
putting the case for it extremely well. I shall be critical of the
Electoral Commission, but the chairman does a very good job and is an
outstanding man. We should bear in mind that it is a new institution
that has been messed around by some well meaning but ill thought out
Government initiatives and incomplete and defective
legislation.</p><p><a name="06070327000119">The
Electoral Commission was created because the Committee on Standards in
Public Life said that the oversight of elections should be neutral and
should be seen to be neutral, so the task should be taken away from the
Home Office. The case for doing so was never adequately made. The Home
Office system was not ideal. It gave the governing party an opportunity
to rig elections but, in a typically British way, that rarely happened.
Indeed, there was rarely even a controversy about the system. One would
not recommend such arrangements for Guatemala or the Ukraine, but they
seemed to work in the United Kingdom. The old system was also cheap,
and this is an estimates debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Orpington(Mr. Horam) pointed out. However, we cannot put the
clock back.</p><p><a name="06070327000120">Any
change that we make must be subject to one overriding test: does it
contribute to the securing of 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 604</b><br>consent from the electorate to the result? With that, we will get an
increase in democratic interest and respect for democracy. Without it,
we are on the slippery slope to
anarchy.</p><p><a name="06070327000121">It is
difficult to argue that the early years of the Electoral Commission
have bolstered consent. Examples to the contrary are legion, such as
the commission&#146;s failure to get to grips with the service voters
farrago. It is astonishing that we allowed ourselves to get into the
position where we effectively disfranchised a large proportion of our
service voters by mistake. The Electoral Commission was alerted to that
extensively by me before the election, as was the Government, but they
did hardly anything about it. Another example is the postal votes
scandal. The Electoral Commission was originally bright eyed and bushy
tailed about extending postal voting. It was far too weak and slow in
flagging up the crisis that was developing, which we could already see
early on as a result of the
pilots.</p><p><a name="06070327000122">There is the
risk of another problem being generated now in relation to the reform
of the boundary commissions. If the Electoral Commission is to have
such responsibility, it must open up a public debate immediately to
ensure that a vote is worth the same&#151;that is, that seats are of
equal size&#151;throughout the United Kingdom. We cannot carry on
with the moribund system that was put in place after the second world
war.</p><p><a name="06070327000123">There are several
other examples, I regret to say, of the Electoral Commission&#146;s
failure to grasp the nettle adequately. I agree with the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) that we still do not really know
how parties obtain their money. We are supposed to have more
transparency, but we have had only a little more. The Electoral
Commission should be pressing vigorously and in public debate to make
sure that all necessary information is
available.</p><p><a name="06070327000124">I also
worry that we have inadvertently created the conditions in which the
Government can behave as though they had been absolved of their
obligation to act impartially, as they had when they had responsibility
directly through the Home Office. The Government&#151;any
Government&#151;can abuse the system more effectively now by claiming
that they have been open to independent advice but, having considered
it, have set it aside. That is exactly what happened with regard to
postal voting.</p><p><a name="06070327000125">All the
functions that I have described are core functions of the Electoral
Commission. I deeply regret that the commission seems to have involved
itself far too much in what one might call not the bread and butter,
but the jam&#151;that is, the much more interesting work of
encouraging greater participation and understanding of the democratic
process. We have had a stream of reports and initiatives on that. It is
worth pointing out that when the Committee on Standards in Public Life
began the process, it did not recommend that this role should be given
to the Electoral Commission but argued that the core tasks given to the
commission were already sufficient to do the job. I am not convinced
that the problem of voter participation will be dealt with by anything
undertaken by the commission. That work will almost certainly turn out
to be a waste of money.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 605</b><br><p><a name="06070327000126"><b><a name="06070327000240">Barbara
Keeley:</b> I find it surprising that the hon. Gentleman is so
exercised by equal numbers for the boundary commissions but not worried
about participation. As many as 7 million errors may be being made in
registers, and 3.5 million people may not be registered. If there is
any scandal&#151;he has used that word several times&#151;that is
it.</p><p><a name="06070327000127"><b><a name="06070327000241">Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am not complacent about it, but I am not as
gripped by it as some Labour Members. Voter participation increases
dramatically when, as I think is going to happen, an election takes
place in which people do not know what the result will be and major
issues are at stake. As recently as 1992, arguably the highest turnout
in modern British democratic history was recorded. Technically
speaking, it was the third largest by a whisker, but a careful look at
the degree of redundancy in the register for the earlier elections
suggests that there is a good case for saying that there was enormous
participation in 1992. It is largely the job of parties to enthuse
electors. If we succeed in doing that, we will see a big recovery in
registration and turnout in
elections.</p><p><a name="06070327000128"><b><a name="06070327000242">Mr.
Stewart Jackson: </b>Does my hon. Friend agree that lower
turnouts are a function of social change? Voters may take a consumerist
approach whereby they are less tribal than they used to be, say, in the
1950s, when absolute levels of poverty and deprivation were higher and
there was no political education. That social pattern is the reason for
lower turnouts through the years, and no amount of Government spending
will change
that.</p><p><a name="06070327000129"><b><a name="06070327000243">Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I should like to think carefully about that before
agreeing with my hon. Friend. I am keen to speak for less than 10
minutes, so I will not think aloud at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06070327000130">I want to end
by making the five proposals that I have already made in a submission
to the Committee on Standards in Public Life. First, the Electoral
Commission must concentrate on its core tasks instead of engaging in
all these other activities. That will also lead to financial savings.
As a former Treasury adviser, savings interest me a good
deal.</p><p><a name="06070327000131">Secondly, the
Electoral Commission must exercise leadership right now with regard to
what it will probably have to take on board through its new
responsibilities for the boundary commissions. We cannot carry on with
boundaries that are always 10 to 15 years out of date in relation to
the population statistics and with constituencies of such widely
differing sizes. These problems are readily resolvable, but that
requires leadership from the
commission.</p><p><a name="06070327000132">Thirdly,
we need much more rigorous and independent thinking to implement reform
on postal votes. It cannot be right for us to go into an election as we
did last time, with so much scope for scandal. Again, the Electoral
Commission must be much more vigorous in public debate to ensure that
we do not carry on as we
are.</p><p><a name="06070327000133">Fourthly, we need
much more accurate data on party funding. For example, we cannot carry
on with the pretence of transparency but the reality of still not
knowing&#151;I hope that Members do not think that this 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 606</b><br>is a party political point&#151;how much and by what means trade
unions are supporting the Labour
party.</p><p><a name="06070327000134">We must also
sort out the accountability arrangements, to which many hon. Members
referred. It is not the Electoral Commission&#146;s fault but ours
that they are in such a mess. How on earth did we get into a position
whereby the commission is accountable behind closed doors, with no
verbatim minutes published, when it scrutinises more than &#163;25
million of expenditure? There is a case for a statutory committee to do
the work, chaired by a senior Opposition Member of Parliament, along
the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, rather than expecting the
Speaker to do it. It is burdensome for the Speaker. The Constitutional
Affairs Committee also has a role to play. I have raised that matter in
private hearings on several occasions, as the right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who chairs the Constitutional Affairs
Committee, knows.</p><p><a name="06070327000135">My
final point is about the Committee on Standards in Public Life. It
brought us to where we are and it is important that it considers
carefully what we should do now. We cannot and should not meddle with
the relevant legislation indefinitely. We must make one more change and
allow matters to settle down. Continual change is a recipe for the
further erosion of public confidence. My advice to the Committee on
Standards in Public Life is, therefore, to think carefully about the
matter, get it right and, to sum it up in one phrase, expect the
Electoral Commission to do less and do it
better.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070327000203">9.1
pm</h5><p><a name="06070327000136"><b><a name="06070327000244">Mr.
David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> After the downbeat
assessment of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), I am happy to
follow with a sunnier and more optimistic view of the Electoral
Commission. I enjoyed the account by the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter
Viggers) of his recent visit to the commission&#146;s premises. He
does not need telling that one is definitely old when one thinks that
even Electoral Commission staff look young. He needs no reassurance
from me that, behind chief executive Sam Younger&#146;s boyish good
looks lies a shrewd, intelligent and experienced
operator.</p><p><a name="06070327000137">Is it only
five years ago that we legislated to set up the Electoral Commission?
It is such an obviously sensible thing to do and a constitutional
necessity in a democracy such as ours. The public now take the
commission for granted, as though it had always existed. I am sure that
they found it interesting on the first occasion to learn, after the
2005 general election, the cost of the then Leader of the
Opposition&#146;s make-up or of the Prime Minister&#146;s
wife&#146;s hairdressing, but, like other hon. Members who spoke, I
hope that, after future elections, people will focus more on the
serious issues of the source of money and its use.</p><p><a name="06070327000138">It is fair to make criticisms
of the new organisation&#146;s role so far, and some hon. Members
have done that. I am sure that the commissioners and members of staff
are not too proud to learn from us and other observers where they are
going wrong or to try to make reforms to put that right. The debate on
the subject and the two reviews that are currently taking place, which
have featured so often in other hon. Members&#146; 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 607</b><br>contributions, are timely. It is a good time to speak about how well
some things have gone and how others need attention and change.
However, I do not agree that one of the Electoral Commission&#146;s
statutory responsibilities should be
removed.</p><p><a name="06070327000139">The Electoral
Commission has several statutory responsibilities, which I would
hesitate to rank because they are all important. Perhaps, after the
most recent controversy about parties using loans instead of donations
for funding, openness and transparency in the financial affairs of
political parties attracts people&#146;s attention. That is one of
the Electoral Commission&#146;s responsibilities and includes
registering political parties, monitoring and publishing significant
donations to parties and regulating their spending on election
campaigns.</p><p><a name="06070327000140">Beyond
that, the Electoral Commission has important responsibilities such as
reporting on the conduct of elections. We should pause and think about
the reports that we have received in the few years since it was set up.
They include reports on elections&#151;not only two general elections
but local elections and the pilot schemes for different ways in which
to organise voting in local elections, for example, through setting up
polling stations in popular places such as shopping centres, organising
all-postal ballots or attempting electronic voting and counting. These
all make a valuable contribution to our understanding of what works and
what does not, and to encouraging more voters to come out and take part
in the democratic process. The assessments from the commission have
helped us in our understanding of these approaches.</p><p><a name="06070327000141">The Electoral Commission has
done its job in identifying the weaknesses in the postal voting system
since the acceleration in the use of postal votes, and it has made
recommendations to the Government on the issue. In fact, when we pass
the Electoral Administration Bill into law, we shall be enacting some
of the commission&#146;s recommendations on making postal voting more
secure in this country. We ought to give credit where it is due in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06070327000142">An important
role for the Electoral Commission in the next few years will be to
oversee the implementation of the new legislation. For the first time,
consistent guidance will be given to all electoral returning officers
and, also for the first time, the commission will be able to insist
that the same information be supplied by all electoral returning
officers. In a recent discussion that I had with Sam Younger, he told
me about requests for information that he had made to returning
officers to enable him to compile his reports. He said that some
authorities had not even replied, because they were under no statutory
obligation to do so, they were busy with other things, and did not
regard it as a priority to give him the information that he needed.
That will change under the new legislation, and the commission will be
able to get the information that it needs to compile its reports, so
that people like us who are interested in these matters will be able to
read them afterwards.</p><p><a name="06070327000143">A good point was made about the
slowness of the response in regard to service personnel, but the
commission would probably say in its defence that this is an extremely
complex issue and that it has made 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 608</b><br>recommendations to the Ministry of Defence. So far as it is able to play
its part in promoting greater awareness of the electoral system among
service personnel and the importance of their registering to vote,
wherever they are in the world, the commission is doing its
job.</p><p><a name="06070327000144">I want to talk
about the statutory responsibility to promote public awareness of our
electoral systems. I disagree with the hon. Member for
Orpington(Mr. Horam)&#151;and with the hon. Member for
Chichester in so far as he agreed with the hon. Gentleman on this
matter&#151;in that I believe that the commission has an important
role to play in promoting such awareness. I am not saying that that
should be a substitute for our doing our job of making politics
interesting, making ourselves trustworthy and attracting lots of people
to come out and join the democratic process. However, there is a role
for the commission to provide independent expertise, advice and
information to those who want it.</p><p><a name="06070327000145">I shall give the House an
example of this working in other areas, where other regulators have
more than simply a regulatory role. The Financial Services
Authority&#151;another Labour innovation since 1997&#151;has a
statutory obligation to promote financial understanding. The Food
Standards Agency operates in a completely different area of policy,
although, curiously, it has the same initials. It is another Labour
innovation since 1997, and has the role, alongside enforcement and
regulation, of promoting knowledge and understanding of healthy and
safe foods. Those examples show why the Electoral Commission should
have a role in promoting public awareness. It can be trusted, it is
independent and it can be authoritative in providing
information.</p><p><a name="06070327000146">I
commend the work that the commission already does in that area.
Contrary to what the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) said in
an earlier intervention, education in politics and citizenship has not
been part of the national curriculum until recently. In fact, such
education was established in 2001, and it is now part of the compulsory
curriculum for all secondary schools. One strand of citizenship
education is political literacy, and the Electoral Commission has
contributed to the teaching of that subject throughits
&#147;Democracy Cookbook&#148;, a valuable source of teaching aids
for teachers and others in a learning environment. I therefore
congratulate the commission on its work in that role.</p><p><a name="06070327000147">Like other Members who have
spoken, I think that the Electoral Commission has done its job well as
a committee on local government boundaries and is worthy of taking over
that role for the boundaries of our constituencies, too. The adage that
we should walk before we run is sensible, and if the Minister tells us
that there is still a little more walking to be done before the sprint
stage is reached, I shall take her advice. The commission is earning
its spurs, however, and I am sure that it will in due course be a
reliable reviewer of constituency boundaries.</p><p><a name="06070327000148">With regard to referendums, the
commission has the primary responsibility for their conduct. On the
small number of occasions on which it has exercised that role, the
commission has done extremely well&#151;although perhaps the
Government have not enjoyed the result of one of those
referendums&#151;in overseeing the conduct of the referendums,
setting up the parties 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 609</b><br>for the yes and no camps and ensuring that the question is fair. I
foresee quite a call on its services in conducting further referendums
in future.</p><p><a name="06070327000149">Looking to the immediate
future, a lot of work will be done on electoral registration and
raising the practices of all local authorities to the level of the
best, both in the registration of people&#146;s entitlement to vote
and their ability to cast their votes in local and national elections.
The two reviews being conducted at present will lead to recommendations
to us to amend the 2000 Act, and I gather from tonight&#146;s debate
that there will be a willingness to consider sensible and
well-thought-through recommendations for change to that law, some of
which will be welcome. When we come to legislate, I hope that we will
consider not just the receipt of money by political parties but the
spending of it, especially between formal elections in this country. I
would like to see annual limits on spending introduced and perhaps, as
my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House says, an end to the arms
race in political spending in this country, with some flexibility in
the years of general and European elections.</p><p><a name="06070327000150">It is easy for Members of the
House who disagree with the Electoral Commission&#146;s
recommendations to say, &#147;We are hardened politicians and we know
this business; they are all novices,&#148; because those on the
commission are not even allowed to have an experience of politics, as
that debars them from being a commissioner or member of the senior
staff of the organisation. That is a criticism, and it undermines the
authority with which the commission speaks to us, the politicians. I am
one of those who supports a change in the rules about who may be a
commissioner or senior officer of the commission, and a lifting of the
bar on people who have modern, relevant political experience. That
could benefit the whole organisation in providing an understanding of
what we are about, what is practical and what will not pass through
this place. Ultimately, that would benefit the commission and our
country&#146;s
democracy.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070327000204">9.13
pm</h5><p><a name="06070327000151"><b><a name="06070327000245">Mr.
Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> I have served on the
Speaker&#146;s Committee almost continuously since it was created. I
now do so ex officio as chairman of the Constitutional Affairs
Committee. I used to do the job that the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter
Viggers) did so well tonight. The Constitutional Affairs Committee has
the Electoral Commission as well as the Department for Constitutional
Affairs within its remit. I should also mention that I have given
evidence to the Committee on Standards in Public Life for its review of
the commission. As a declaration of interest, I should mention that my
wife serves on the Committee on Standards in Public Life, but I am not
speaking on behalf of any of those aforementioned bodies. As time is
limited, I just want to refer to the governance points, and to follow
some of the arguments made so far.</p><p><a name="06070327000152">Generally, as the debate has
revealed, the Electoral Commission has done several good things, but it
has not dealt successfully with several areas, and several problems
have been identified. Some internal problems were identified by the
scrutiny unit report, to which the hon. Member for Gosport referred,
and which I agree was a very good piece of work.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 610</b><br><p><a name="06070327000153">My first key point about the
commission is that I think it needs authority in the political world.
It ought to be a body whose recommendations it is very difficult for
the Government and Parliament to turn down. That is what we want for
electoral commissions in all other countries, and it is what I want for
our Electoral Commission. As a number of Members have said today,
however, it is undermined by the lack of political experience on the
commission. It is too easy for us in Parliament to say, &#147;Sorry,
but you do not know enough about it. You have good intentions, but we
know what it is like.&#148;</p><p><a name="06070327000154">Sometimes that it true. We may
indeed be more aware of, for example, the fact that proposed
improvements would not achieve their intended purpose, because we know
how parties operate. I think it would be right for the commission to
include a minority of members who have experience of the various
political parties but are no longer in the front line of activity in
that context, and I think we should change the statute to make that
possible.</p><p><a name="06070327000155">As was
pointed out earlier, it was not originally envisaged that Mr. Speaker
would chair the Speaker&#146;s Committee. His chairmanship was seen
as a way of giving the committee, and hence the Electoral Commission,
more authority. That places limitations on the committee. It is clear
that if the Speaker&#146;s valued independence and impartiality are
to be preserved, the minuted discussions about whose absence&#151;in
a thoughtful speech&#151;the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)
complained cannot be allowed. If they are, the possibility will arise
that the Speaker&#146;s views will start to be quoted. Similarly, the
Speaker cannot be questioned on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member
for Gosport does the job in his place. The Speaker is a very busy
man.</p><p><a name="06070327000156">The decision to
give the committee authority by making the Speaker chairman had certain
consequences for the way in which it could operate. It is important to
remember, however, that it does not operate in quite the same way as a
Select Committee. Its responsibilities are comparable to those of a
Minister in relation to a Department: it is responsible for the
Electoral Commission&#146;s estimate, and effectively it brings that
estimate to the House. It does not merely scrutinise how the commission
has spent money; it decides in the first place whether it can spend
that money&#151;whether the money can be allocated for its
purposes.</p><p><a name="06070327000157">The
Speaker&#146;s Committee does a great deal of work of that kind. It
challenges the commission&#146;s budget. It makes the commission very
aware that certain areas of expenditure are under-challenged, that they
may not be continued, and that the budget may have to be varied. It
does its work through a regular cycle of meetings, with the assistance
of the scrutiny unit and, of course, the National Audit Office, which
provides it with extremely helpful material. Its function is different
from the normal function of a Select
Committee.</p><p><a name="06070327000158">At the same
time, the Constitutional Affairs Committee has a scrutiny role in
relation to the Electoral Commission&#146;s work, its policy
proposals and the Department&#146;s relationship with it. It is
necessarily an intermittent role. Our Committee has
numerous 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 611</b><br>other responsibilities concerned with numerous other aspects of the
Department&#146;s work&#151;including legal aid, the judiciary,
other public bodies, national archives and the Public Guardianship
Office&#151;although we do question the chairman of the Electoral
Commission, and also the chief executive. A number of our recent
reports have involved questions to him. We are currently engaged in an
inquiry into party funding, an issue that has been mentioned a good
deal this evening. We have elicited the views of the commission and
many others on that. Nevertheless, it is the case&#151;and will
remain the case following any future changes&#151;that the Committee
has few responsibilities in this regard.</p><p><a name="06070327000159">Do we need to modify the
system? There are obviously clear advantages for the Electoral
Commission in its being responsible to the House directly, rather than
through the Department. I am very glad that that was made part of the
system. Indeed, the Constitutional Affairs Committee has suggested that
a similar route would be appropriate for the Information Commissioner.
We have observed the difficulties presented to him by the fact that his
budget was set by the Department and set very late in the day, and the
problem&#151;a theoretical problem, at least&#151;that one of the
Departments he is scrutinising is responsible for his budget. The
direct route to Parliament is therefore
valuable.</p><p><a name="06070327000160">The hon.
Member for Chichester and others have suggested that a new committee,
perhaps chaired by a senior member of the Opposition, could conduct its
proceedings openly. We might then lose something of the authority
conferred by the Speaker&#146;s presence, and it might become a
little more difficult to resist Government pressure. It is quite useful
to have the Speaker on one&#146;s side if one has to do battle with
the Treasury over the estimates. However, it is a serious proposition
that we should look at. Even if such a committee were created, the
Constitutional Affairs Committee would still be involved because the
policy issues that the Electoral Commission is involved in are very
much its sphere.</p>

<p><a name="06070327000161">The
logical division of responsibility between the Speaker&#146;s
Committee and the Constitutional Affairs Committee is that the
Speaker&#146;s Committee does pay and rations and the Constitutional
Affairs Committee does policy, to put it broadly. It never works out
quite like that, for reasons that I will not go into in this short
debate. I do not think that we could put all those responsibilities and
the responsibility for presenting the estimate in one body, but now
that we have established the authority of the Speaker's Committee and
the relationship is clearer&#151;it is not as messy as has been
suggested by some&#151;we should perhaps consider moving to an
arrangement in which the Speaker did not need to chair it and its role
could develop from there. I do not have a rigid view about that, but I
suppose I would be staking my Committee&#146;s claim if in conclusion
I said that any Constitutional Affairs Committee, whatever its
membership&#151;four of its members have taken part in today&#146;s
debate&#151;would want to continue its scrutiny of the key areas of
policy of great constitutional importance with which the Electoral
Commission is concerned.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 612</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06070333000120">9.21

Robertson (Moray) (SNP):</b> Like others, I would like to
concentrate in the short time available on something that has not yet
been mentioned: the oversight of by-elections. By-elections have been
in the news in England and Wales, but I would like to share an
experience of a recent Scottish Parliament byelection that I think
should give all Members of the House cause to consider how elections
are conducted. In meetings with the Electoral Commission, I have
already suggested ways in which the commission should look at the
issue.</p><p><a name="06070327000164">There is a
juggernaut heading in the direction of politics in this country which I
find disturbing. It comes through the effective trebling of spending
limits in by-elections to &#163;100,000. The political campaigning
time is as short as possible; most parties think it to their advantage
to call short campaigns in a byelection. As we all know, with some
imagination, &#163;100,000 can go pretty far.</p><p><a name="06070327000165">I would like to make Members
aware of some of the most dubious campaigning techniques that are being
used. Again, I will concentrate on my experience in the Moray
byelection, where only two months ago, there was a byelection to
replace Margaret Ewing, who many people in this House will remember
served here between 1974 and 1979 for East Dunbartonshire and between
1987 and 2001 for Moray.</p><p><a name="06070327000166">It is important to point out
that I am raising the issue not out of sour grapes, because at the
by-election my party secured its biggest ever majority. It was our most
successful campaign ever. I am not going to go into how bad it was for
other parties, but it was not good for them.</p><p><a name="06070327000167">The campaigning spending in
that byelection was published last week. The Conservative party spent
&#163;91,000, the Lib Dems &#163;42,000, the Scottish National
party &#163;33,000 and the Labour party &#163;10,000. What happened
in that by-election? The Conservative campaign was launched on the day
of the cremation of Margaret Ewing. The majority of the materials used
by the Conservative party, which has traditionally been the main
challenging party in Moray, did not contain the word
&#147;Conservative&#148; or &#147;Tory&#148;. Clearly the
impression was trying to be created that its candidate, Mary Scanlon,
who had been of high standing as a Conservative Member in the Scottish
Parliament for the Highlands and Islands, was &#147;another bonnie
fechter&#148;, creating the impression that she was following in the
footsteps of a Scottish Nationalist. It is beyond credibility. Posters
were put up on lampposts throughout the constituency without mention of
the party&#146;s name.</p><p><a name="06070327000168">The real shocker was that
apparently handwritten letters were sent to constituents that claimed
to be from independent councillors who never gave their permission for
their names to be used in the campaign. That led to headlines on the
front pages of Scottish newspapers describing the Conservatives&#146;
campaign as
&#147;deceitful&#148;.</p><p><a name="06070327000169">The
Conservatives were closely followed by the Liberal Democrats, who
produced materials that claimed that the SNP candidate was from
Aberdeen. That is not true. He does not live in Aberdeen. Indeed, he
lived in the same parliamentary constituency as the 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 613</b><br>Liberal Democrat candidate, who was described as &#147;local&#148;.

Strathspey (Danny Alexander) notice that I intended to raise this
issue. Clarification has been sought of why such misinformation was

common parlance, that would make the claims
true.</p><p><a name="06070327000171"><b><a name="06070327000248">Angus

point that I am trying to make is that, for significant campaign

stop.</p><p><a name="06070327000174"><b><a name="06070327000251">Mr.

party had the honesty to add the party name underneath the
candidate&#146;s photograph and on the rest of the literature. The
party sought to create an impression that she was something that she
was not. That is not honest and that is not how political parties
should campaign.</p><p><a name="06070327000176">Worst
of all for the Liberal Democrats was the revelation that they took
their own quotes from a report in <i> The Northern
Scot</i>&#151;regularly voted the best weekly newspaper in the
UK&#151;and reproduced them in campaigning literature as the opinions
of the newspaper itself. The editor of the newspaper asked whether they
really thought that readers and the people of Moray would be stupid
enough to believe that the newspaper would prejudice its reputation for
impartial political reporting. That scam has been tried elsewhere by
the Liberal Democrats, so they cannot pretend that the manipulation of
the comments was a mistake.</p><p><a name="06070327000177">I venture to suggest that many
hon. Members have seen some of those campaign techniques in their
constituencies and in by-elections. It has to stop. Such dubious
campaign techniques do nothing but undermine the democratic

than half the population participates in elections, even presidential
ones. His most important point was about the high level of expenditure.
Does he agree that the only way to overcome that problem is to have
very low, rigidly enforced limits on election spending, so that we do
not go the way of the US, where parties are bought by big
business?</p><p><a name="06070327000179"><b><a name="06070327000254">Angus

campaign is far too much.</p><p><a name="06070327000180">The point about local media
coverage is that in Moray we have independent local newspapers that are
read by the entire local electorate, but I fear for by-elections in
places where the local media have less ability to report impartially on
what is being said and done. I would not like to be part of a debate
about people&#146;s concerns that elections were being bought. We are
running the risk of that happening in by-elections, which, as we all
know, are important for all political parties as tests of opinion
between general elections.</p><p><a name="06070327000181">The Electoral Commission has a

there&#151;but by-elections are robust events and local newspapers
are often prayed in aid; they certainly have been in every by-election
in which I have been involved for 20
years.</p><p><a name="06070333000007"><b><a name="06070333000129">Angus

be happy to continue the conversation outside.</p><p><a name="06070333000009">However, there is nothing wrong
with asking the Electoral Commission to look at by-elections, which is
the relevance of this debate, and I have no objectionto that.
I share the view that has been expressed on both sides of the House and
elsewhere that party expenditure is properly an issue for the
commission. In many ways, I regret the fact that that job was suddenly
taken from the commission&#146;s remit and given to Hayden
Phillips&#151;not that I have anything against him, but it seems
logical to give the commission the task of looking at spending. There
is clearly an issue in respect of the spending that starts in
seats&#151;whether the hon. Gentleman&#146;s seat, mine or any
other&#151;not just a month before the general election, but six
months, a year or two years before. That is local spending, although it
is 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 615</b><br>technically disguised as part of a national budget. All those things
justify giving the Electoral Commission the responsibility of looking
further at
expenditure.</p><p><a name="06070333000010">I welcome
this debate on the Electoral Commission. My colleagues and I are
grateful to the Liaison Committee for proposing the first debate of
this kind. We each have a maximum of 10 minutes for our wind-ups so, on
behalf of my party, I shall simply make the points that I think are
most important. I apologise to colleagues, therefore, for the fact that
I cannot reflect on all the other contributions.</p><p><a name="06070333000011">The proposal for an Electoral
Commission was a good one and we supported it. It is right that the
commission came into existence; it has done an important and good job
and we support its continuance. The commission has spent a significant
amount of money, but that has been scrutinised. Apart from one year,
when there was a critical comment about some of the spend, the scrutiny
process has endorsed the commission as having spent its money wisely.
That is a good commendation, much better than what we hear in many
areas of public life, not least Departments such as the Home
Office.</p><p><a name="06070333000012">The debate
plays into the review undertaken by the Committee on Standards in
Public Life, which was the genesis of the Electoral Commission, and is
thus especially timely. Like the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter
Viggers) and others, I have given evidence to the Committee and we
await with interest its conclusions at the end of the year. Like the
hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), I come in to bat strongly in
favour of the Electoral Commission. As my right hon. Friend the Member
for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said, both on his own behalf and
reflecting the views of his Committee, when the Electoral Commission
proposes something, the assumption should be that it has the authority
to carry the day unless there is a strong argument against it. But that
requires two or three things to
happen.</p><p><a name="06070333000013">First, a
minority of the commission&#146;s members should be from political
backgrounds, because that will provide the antennae and there will be
authority from inside and outside. Nobody will be able to say,
&#147;You don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking
about&#151;it&#146;s not like this in real life.&#148; The real
life element will have been inserted. I am clear that that should
happen.</p><p><a name="06070333000014">I am clear,
too, that the structure of accountability, which was conceived for the
best of reasons, needs to be reformed, so that it becomes a fully open
and accountable process of scrutiny and moves from the present position
whereby the Speaker, quite properly, cannot participate fully, because
it would be prejudicial to his role as the independent guardian of the
House&#146;s interests if he were to express views. Therefore,
whether with Mr. Speaker or his successors, we need to find another
structure to open up the process.</p><p><a name="06070333000015">Such things
should happen in open forum and the minutes should be recorded, and the
Committee might therefore meet more often and be able to take more
political responsibility. That would pick up some of the issues raised
by the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) and other hon. Members.
Any failings&#151;for example, on service voting&#151;might have
been picked up much more quickly and action taken much more rigorously.

<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 616</b><br>It would have helped the Electoral Commission to do its job better. I
can see no disadvantage&#151;but, yes, there must be a minority of
political appointees. Four such appointees in a commission of eleven or
more would seem entirely
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06070333000016">One
topical debate is still going on: we are debating whether personal
identifiers should be part of the registration and voting process, and
the Electoral Administration Bill is still before Parliament. My view
is that if the Electoral Commission makes a proposal, there should be a
mechanism whereby that proposal comes to the House, and that if the
Government want to amend the proposal, that is seen as a Government
amendment to the independent proposal. We will need to find a mechanism
whereby that legislation could be promoted, for example, by the
Committee and given special status. That is not impossible and there
are parallels in other
legislatures.</p><p><a name="06070333000017">The next
big question is whether Electoral Commission has tried to do too much,
and whether it has concentrated on the right things. My judgment is
that it has sought to do what it thought were the relevant things.
There are some very good election reports on all the major elections,
including on specific sub-issues, such as expenditure at certain
elections and the electronic counting of votes, which was tried for the
first time at the London elections. Some good policy reports have added
to information. An example of one of the ones that matter is the
funding of electoral services, which are often underfunded by local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06070333000018">There is
an argument that political advertising should be subject to the
Advertising Standards Authority. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>
Seriously&#151;I have argued for that on many occasions before. Those
are real issues, on which the Electoral Commission should be able to do
the work. I would not join those who say that it must do only its core
job; it can do other jobs too, and it has done them well, by and large.
It is clear that it chose to concentrate on party funding. That is very
important; the electorate want the reforms to be made. Mercifully, we
are moving in the right direction, but we are not yet
there.</p><p><a name="06070333000019">There
has been a set of exchanges about the boundary commission reviews. The
hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) confirmed that the boundary
commission review of local government boundaries in England had been
done well. I am clear that the Electoral Commission should take over,
as soon as possible, the review of UK parliamentary boundaries, and I
am clear that there should be one UK parliamentary boundary commission
for this Parliament. That would save a lot of money to start with. We
would not necessarily get constituencies of absolutely the same size.
There are some very good Scottish examples. In my view, it would be
illogical for the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland, as well as
Anglesey in Wales not be seen as natural constituencies. However, the
same principle could and should apply across the UK. If there is a case
for smaller electorate in a very depopulated or rural area, that
principle should be seen to apply equally in Scotland, England, Wales
and Northern Ireland, but we must not continue with different electoral
norms for this Parliament in the four countries. That is no longer
acceptable. We should have the same electoral norm for this Parliament,
other than for exceptions that could arise in any of the four
countries.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 617</b><br><p><a name="06070333000020">I want to make two last
substantive points. What key issues are now on our common agenda? One
of them is to ensure that we increase the number of people who are not
only registered but vote&#151;an issue that has been raised by other
colleagues. A guy called Gordon Spencer, whom I met at an organisation
in my constituency, has recently undertaken, as part of his degree, a
piece of research based on my constituency, focusing on what makes
people turn out to vote, or why they do not vote. I have a copy of
that, and it contains examples of the information that we all need. The
information shows, most tellingly, not that people were uninterested
but that there were practical issues that made a difference. For
example, people were away on the day and had not registered for a
postal vote; polling stations were not in convenient places, and were
not open for long enough in the day. There are many practical answers
to the question of how we can increase the ability of the electorate to
participate in elections, and we should do that. We are moving in the
right direction, but we have a long way to
go.</p><p><a name="06070333000021"><b><a name="06070333000131">Kelvin

Hughes:</b> No. I must finish in a few
seconds.</p><p><a name="06070333000023">I hope that
the Electoral Commission will carry out an urgent piece of work on one
last matter. We now have many different election systems in many
different parts of the UK. That in itself is becoming confusing. I hope
that the commission will review that diversity of experience. There is
a simple proposition which would make all our lives easier, and I ask
the commission to consider it. Given the exact nature of the process in
each of the elections, at least we should move to a situation that
wherever they are in the UK, at every election people can express their
preferences by a one, two, three system rather than some using
preference and others by putting crosses on ballot papers. There would
then at least be a greater likelihood of people understanding the
system, expressing a preference and participating more significantly. I
ask the commission to consider that, and I hope that we as a Parliament
will then consider the recommendations that it makes to
us.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070333000122">9.41pm</h5><p><a name="06070333000024"><b><a name="06070333000133">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> I did not
agree with that. However, some themes have come out of the
debate&#151;for example, that the Electoral Commission should have
more authority. I agree with the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) and with my hon. Friend the Member for
Gosport (Peter Viggers) that it would be wise for the people on the
board of the commission to have some political experience, provided
that it is not so much as to be overbearing&#151;a modest amount of
political experience, which is balanced. That would be a good
thing.</p><p><a name="06070333000025">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), who
said that the commissioners should do less and do it well. I think that
the commission is at its best when it is working from experience in an
area at the core of its functions. I would like to see it do more of
that and less of the work on the margins.</p><p><a name="06070333000026">I am pleased that we are having
an annual debate&#151;or are we? It is certainly nice to have the
first debate. I have said for some time that it would be useful to have
an annual debate about the Electoral 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 618</b><br>Commission. I hope that that will happen in future. I agree with the
hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) that we need more
scrutiny. However, I would like the commission to remain independent
and to report to Parliament. I would not want to see it come under the
aegis of the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p><p><a name="06070333000027">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend
the Member for Gosport, who opened the debate. He does a good job and
handles sensibly his role in representing the Speaker&#146;s
Committee in Parliament. He takes much trouble with hon. Members if
they ask a question. He will often ask them whether they want further
information over and above the answers that have been given. That is
much appreciated. I join the tributes that have been paid to Sam
Younger for the work that he has
done.</p><p><a name="06070333000028">The
issue of the Boundary Commission is a difficult one. I have some doubts
about the idea of the Electoral Commission taking over the work of the
Boundary Commission. That is partly because I see the work of the
Electoral Commission more as a regulator than as an executive body
taking forward work such as drawing lines on maps. I would like to see
the Electoral Commission considering how the Boundary Commission
functions and making comments, based on experience, of what lessons can
be learned. There are some points to be made about the figures that are
used and whether they are sufficiently up to
date.</p><p><a name="06070333000029">The process of
Boundary Commission reviews is long and some improvements could be
made. However, if the Electoral Commission is doing the work, there is
a risk that some of the exercises that we would expect from a regulator
will not be followed through.</p><p><a name="06070333000030">I agree that the boundary
committee and the various boundary commissions should come together in
one UK-wide body that has particular expertise. In terms of the period
over which the Electoral Commission has been working, five years is a
good point at which to have a reconsideration. We cannot be entirely
complacent. Obviously it is right to say that some good work is done by
the Electoral Commission, but if one looks at, for example, the
integrity of the ballot and the public perception of that
integrity&#151;that must be an important test for the Electoral
Commission after five years&#151;many people would say that the
standing of the ballot in Britain is probably at its lowest for many
years. I notice that, today, the Electoral Commission has brought out
its report on the last local elections. It reports that, again,
allegations of fraud were a feature of the local elections in 2006, and
that the public&#146;s perception of whether postal voting is safe
from fraud and abuse has fallen from 51 per cent. thinking it is safe
or very safe to just 37 per cent. thinking that. We cannot be
complacent about the way in which things are working.</p><p><a name="06070333000031">I agree with the hon. Member
for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) that there is great concern about the
number of individuals who are registered. There are some areas where
there is a registration desert. The only point that I would make to her
is that the levels of registration are unchanged from 10 years ago. A
Government who have been in power for nine years have to take some
responsibility for the fact that there has been no significant
improvement in levels of registration over that period. Nothing has
been done so far to ensure 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 619</b><br>that people are actively canvassed and that data are
matched&#151;things that we know can be done, from the experience in
Australia.</p><p><a name="06070333000032">On party
funding, I agree that there is an important role for the Electoral
Commission. I was as surprisedas the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey that the Government did not choose the
Electoral Commission to do the review that Sir Hayden is now doing. As
I said at the time, although we have the highest respect for Sir Hayden
and his background, the truth of the matter is that we are talking
about something that is the core work of the Electoral Commission. One
would expect the commission to be doing the job.</p><p><a name="06070333000033">As far as by-elections are
concerned, I am perfectly happy for the Electoral Commission to look at
that. That is an important suggestion. The idea that it is a
disgrace&#151;I think that this is the point that the hon. Member for
Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil) was making&#151;to describe your
candidate as a bonny fighter in a by-election is extraordinary. It is
particularly unfair of him to make that point with such a good
candidate. I certainly do not agree with him about that.
</p><p><a name="06070333000034">This is a short
debate and I can make only a short winding-up speech. If one looks at
the overall picture, the worry is about the integrity of the ballot.
There has been no shortage of advice about that. It is true that, over
the period, the Electoral Commission has changed its mind about postal
voting and it has come to individual voter registration rather later
than some of us, but its advice has been clear over recent months: we
need individual voter registration and identifiers if we are to have a
clean system in this country and to get rid of the fraud. It is
extraordinary, and a disgrace, that the Government have not been
prepared to take the advice of the body that they set up for that very
purpose. All the other parties in the House, with the exception of the
Scottish National party, which seems to have thrown a wobbly on the
issue, agree that we need individual voter registration and we need it
now. It is a disgrace that the Government have not done
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070333000123">9.48

throw away my original notes and respond, if I may, to some of the
threads that ran through the debate.</p><p><a name="06070333000036">Members raised three main
issues: first, the boundary commission and the Electoral Commission;
secondly, the political experience of the commissioners; and, thirdly,
the way in which the Electoral Commission reports. Before I move on to

of the Electoral Commission. In particular, I thank the hon. Member for

this slot in today&#146;s estimates debate. I thank the Liaison
Committee for accommodating that request.</p><p><a name="06070333000037">There are
many issues relating to the commission about which we may disagree.
However, we all agree

democratic system is very important. So, as the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, it is timely, after five
years of experience of the commission, that we have a review and learn
some lessons about what it has done.</p><p><a name="06070333000038">The commission&#146;s stated
aim is to promote openness in the financial affairs of political
parties, to develop electoral law and practice, and to increase
awareness of the democratic processes across the United
Kingdom&#151;in short, to promote integrity, involvement and
effectiveness in the democratic process. I want to say a few words
about how the commission has done that over the past few
years.</p><p><a name="06070333000039">It is clearly
of great importance to our democracy that the commission look at the
way in which political parties fund themselves. Nevertheless, a great
deal of controversy has been generated recently about donations and
loans, so it was appropriate for the Government to hand that matter to
an independent figure who could look at it in the round, which is why
Sir Hayden Phillips has been asked to review party funding. The
Electoral Commission will work closely with him in coming to a
conclusion.</p><p><a name="06070333000040">I am glad
that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House is present, because
in response to hon. Members&#146; comments about funding,
particularly at election times, I am pleased to put on record the fact
that he now agrees with me that there should be a cap on funding across
the piece. I am pleased that he will be taking that forward in much
more detail.</p><p><a name="06070333000041">The
commission has worked closely with the Government over the past five
years in developing electoral law and practice. It has dealt with the
passage of seven Bills through Parliament in that time and has worked
closely with the Government in trying to ensure that it is properly
engaged once those Bills become law. The Electoral Administration Bill
currently before Parliament is a very good example of that
partnership.</p><p><a name="06070333000042">I should
like to rebut a couple of comments that the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire and one or two others made about personal identifiers.
The Government have said all along that in principle we are in favour
of personal identifiers, which is why we have accepted amendments on
postal voting and personal identifiers. The hon. Gentleman was quick to
quote from the consultation, so let me explain to him and other
Opposition Members that the responses expressed a variety of opinions,
very often beginning along the lines of that from the London borough of
Hillingdon, which
said:</p><a name="06070333000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
difficult to oppose the idea of individual registration in principle
but the practical implications are extremely
worrying.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070333000043">Let us
consider instead the comments of King&#146;s Lynn and West Norfolk
council, which is hardly known as a bedrock of socialism. It
said:</p><a name="06070333000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Undertaking
individual registration will have significant resource implications and
present almost insurmountable difficulties for staff in contacting
every eligible elector. Under-registration and effectively
disenfranchisement will be obvious
consequences.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070333000044">The
hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) thought that that was not such a
bad idea anyway, and he and the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)
seemed to think that the role of the commission in developing electoral
awareness and encouraging people 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 621</b><br>to participate was, as the hon. Member for Chichester described it, jam.
Frankly, I am appalled that members of a democratic institution such as
this Parliament think that using institutions such as the Electoral
Commission to promote democracy is simply jam. It is far more bread and
butter than that.</p>

<p><a name="06070333000045">I turn to the
boundary commission issues. I have some sympathy with the view that a
number of Members expressed about the fact that the Electoral
Commission has been charged with at some point taking over the role of
the boundary commission. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is
looking at the role of the Electoral Commission. Some stakeholders feel
that it might be worth reflecting on whether the Electoral Commission
should take over that role. I hear what hon. Members on both sides of
the House say about how well the commission has done in local
government, and I have some sympathy with their views, but we should
wait until the Committee on Standards in Public Life has reported
before we take the matter any further. What is more, the boundary
commission has to complete its work, which is to report by the end of
this year, before we can deal with the
matter.</p><p><a name="06070333000046">Political
experience was a constant theme throughout the debate. Every Member who
spoke seemed to feel that the deliberate lack of political experience
in the Electoral Commission is not helping it. In my discussions with
Sam Younger, to whom I pay tribute, as did several hon. Members, I have
said that I think it would be useful, in the interim at least, if the
commission had a small group&#151;an advisory panel&#151;of
ex-Members of Parliament, who could offer a view on the experience of
being a candidate and of all that the election process entails. He has
been open to that idea.

small panels on matters such as candidates&#146; expenditure and
fraud, so he may well be open to setting up a group of the type that I
have described.</p><p><a name="06070333000050">On
fraud, in its press release on its report the Electoral Commission
states:</p><a name="06070333000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
majority of people (55%) did not think that electoral fraud was a
problem at the elections, although allegations of electoral fraud and
the way candidates fought their campaigns were a key feature in some
areas and in the
media.</p></ul><a name="06070333000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">Those who felt
fraud had been a problem said they were influenced by media coverage
(51%) rather than first hand experience
(4%)&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070333000051">Perhaps the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire will bear that in mind. He
continually bangs the drum and suggests that electoral fraud is
widespread in this country. It is not.</p><p><a name="06070333000052">Where the
commission should report is a tricky issue. The commission sees many
benefits in reporting to the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which
highlights its independence from Government. The chairman of the
Constitutional Affairs Committee, the right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), made a good point when he said that his
Committee will of course want to examine 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 622</b><br>some aspects of the Electoral Commission&#146;s work, so it should
have a role. I ask the House to wait to see whether, as a result of the
evidence that is put before it, the Committee on Standards in Public
Life takes a view on whether it would be more appropriate for the
Electoral Commission to report to a body other than the
Speaker&#146;s Committee. I assure Opposition Members that the
Department for Constitutional Affairs is not suggesting that it should
take that responsibility; we would much prefer it to be left to some
aspect of Parliament.</p><p><a name="06070333000053">Finally, let
me say a few words about the future. Since its inception, the Electoral
Commission has been successful in meeting its wide-ranging remit. There
have been differences of view on policy in some areas, but that has not
prevented an effective partnership, and those differences are a sign of
the commission&#146;s independence. We believe that the Electoral
Commission&#146;s operational role is crucial and probably the area
in which, in the next few years, it can add most value to the running
of elections and democratic services between elections.</p><p><a name="06070333000054">As we have said in our evidence
to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the Government have
developed a stronger policy-making capacity since 2000, so it might now
be appropriate for the Government to lead in policy development and for
the commission to concentrate on ensuring that electoral services are
delivered successfully. Meanwhile, we shall continue to involve the
commission, administrators and other stakeholders in policy and
legislation development to ensure that the electorate&#146;s needs
are being met. Another area in which it might be time for change is how
to ensure that, while retaining the commission&#146;s independence,

pm</h5><p><a name="06070333000063"><b><a name="06070333000138">Mr.
David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> The issue that I am
raising is not simply a London one. The dead and injured came from
various parts of country. On that terrible day, for instance, a
13-year-old girl, Neema Begum, came up to London with her teacher from
Walsall. She was to be presented with an award for public speaking in
the Youth Parliament. Fortunately, the two were not directly involved,
but as they walked from Euston station to Tavistock square, they heard
the explosion on the bus that took a number of
lives.</p><p><a name="06070333000064">On Friday, it
will of course be a year since the atrocities occurred on a day of
murderous infamy that took the lives of 52 totally innocent people and
left a number very seriously injured. It is difficult for normal people
to understand the sheer evil, depravity and fanaticism of the four mass
murderers. The evil that they did on 7 July last year will not be
easily forgotten or
forgiven.</p><p><a name="06070333000065">I accept
that, probably due to parliamentary, ministerial and public pressure,
there has been less delay than usual by the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Authority in paying out on claims. However, that is little
comfort for those who are still waiting for final awards, or even, in
some instances, an interim payment. The Minister will be in a position
to confirm or deny this, but it seems that a quarter of the claimants
have so far not received anything at all from the
CICA.</p><p><a name="06070333000066">In a
parliamentary reply, my hon. Friend the Minister told me that 319
awards have so far been made and that they amount to over &#163;2
million. Of those 319 awards, 189 were final payments. I take this
opportunity, four days before the first anniversary of the atrocities,
to urge strongly that the remaining claims be finalised quickly. I hope
that it will not be necessary to bring up this issue again in a
year&#146;s time. There is a need for urgency and speed and to
overcome red tape, which is of course the main reason why I have raised
this issue today.</p><p><a name="06070333000067">The
London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund was set up shortly after the
atrocities. The Government have made a significant contribution to it
and like everyone in the House, I welcome that. Nevertheless, the
amounts to be paid by the CICA do not reflect the seriousness of the
injuries suffered on 7 July.</p><p><a name="06070333000068">In the reply to my written
question, the Minister set out what is described as the tariff. For
instance, the sum for the loss of one leg below the knee is
&#163;33,000, and for the loss of one leg above the knee it is
&#163;44,000. For the loss of both legs, or of both hands or arms,
the sum is &#163;110,000. I should point out that these amounts apply
in all cases, and not only to the victims of the atrocities of 7/7.
There is a current maximum upper limit of &#163;500,000, which has
not been increased since 1996. That upper limit needs to be looked at
with some urgency, because in cases involving the most severe
injuries&#151;I will mention two such cases shortly&#151;I very
much doubt whether that capped sum of &#163;500,000, assuming that it
is paid, is sufficient.</p><br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 625</b><br><p><a name="06070333000069">It is unclear how many of those
seriously injured on 7/7 will receive the maximum, or anywhere near it.
I have been informed&#151;I checked the figures with the Library as
recently as today&#151;that the highest sum so far paid to anyone who
was very seriously injured who survived the atrocities is
&#163;152,000, and that only five people have received more than
&#163;100,000 from the
CICA.</p><p><a name="06070333000070">One person who
was seriously injured&#151;very seriously&#151;is Martine Wright,
who was on the Aldgate train. Her case has been much publicised. Both
her legs were destroyed above the knee. So far, Miss Wright has
received &#163;100,000 as an interim payment. I know that, apart from
the question of compensation, she is very keen for a public inquiry to
take place; however, I shall not discuss that today as it is outside
the terms of my Adjournment debate. None the less, receiving adequate
money so that she can try to get her life together as far as possible
is still a necessity. Yes, she has artificial legs, but as she has
discovered, she cannot walk all the time. She often goes out in a
wheelchair, and as she has stated in a newspaper article, she covers
her lower body with a blanket because she does not want people to
glance at her, which is perfectly understandable. If any of us suffered
such horrifying injuries, we would feel the same. Just imagine the
support that she needs in terms of alternative suitable accommodation
and future earnings. She is in her early 30s and was an international
marketing manager. It is not just her legs that have been badly
damaged; in the process, so have many other aspects of her life.
Lawyers have told her that it could take a long time for her final
claim to be settled. That is unacceptable, and I hope that the Minister
agrees with
me.</p><p><a name="06070333000071">Another claimant
is Danny Biddle, who is in his 20s. He lost both legs and an eye in the
Edgware road attack. I understand that, so far, he has received nearly
&#163;119,000. How long will it be before a final sum is paid to Mr.
Biddle? The figure of &#163;119,000 cannot possibly be anywhere near
the amount that he is entitled
to.</p><p><a name="06070333000072">In some cases
victims left behind a partner. One such case is that of Richard Gray,
who was murdered on 7 July. He was an accountant. His widow, with two
young children, is obviously keen to have an adequate sum so that they
can survive financially.</p><p><a name="06070333000073">I understand from the Library
that the average amount paid out so far is &#163;6,000. I know that
there are complicated rules. I know the argument that public money
cannot be handed out liberally. I understand that if there are rules in
force, they apply in all cases. But the victims of 7/7 were the victims
of a deliberate murderous attack on the state. To that extent, it could
be argued that compensation for them falls into a different
category.</p><p><a name="06070333000074">The hon.
Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), whose brother was murdered
abroad, wants to make a short intervention. I shall make way for him in
a moment.</p><p><a name="06070333000075">In
conclusion, on Friday we will again remember the dead. We will again
express our determination to ensure that everything possible is done by
the police and the security authorities to try to avoid another
murderous attack anywhere in the United Kingdom. We will make it clear
that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country, like the
rest of us, deplore and loathe the mass murderers. I make a plea to the

<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 626</b><br>Minister. Hurry up, please. Try to finalise the settlements as quickly
as possible. In so far as it is possible, let the sums be
realistic.</p><p><a name="06070333000076">I have
quoted two cases, but there are other people who were seriously
injured. The least we can do is try to help them with adequate
compensation, so they can get the support that they require in order to
rebuild their lives in every way possible. That is why I applied for
the Adjournment debate
today.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070333000126">10.12
pm</h5><p><a name="06070333000077"><b><a name="06070333000139">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> I thank the hon.
Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) for allowing me to participate
in this important debate, which is taking place at an apt time of the
year. I shall keep my comments brief as I am keen to hear the
Minister&#146;s response to those important remarks, which I fully
endorse. As the anniversary approaches, there are still claims for
compensation which have not been sorted
out.</p><p><a name="06070333000078">As
the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I lost my brother in the Bali bombing. He
was killed by the same organisations as hit us on 7 July, so I speak
for those people and for the people I have spoken to who were involved
in the Sharm el Sheikh tragedy. We did not get any compensation
whatsoever. We did not get any insurance payment whatsoever. Why?
Because insurance companies do not cover international terrorism
abroad, and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority does not
operate outside UK
jurisdiction.</p><p><a name="06070333000079">Will the
Minister please review the situation? We see what other countries do.
They now provide adequate responses to look after their citizens while
they are abroad. We do not find the UK doing that. I appreciate that
the Chancellor made an important announcement in the Budget about
providing &#163;1 million towards a charitable fund, but we have
heard about the sums being handed out, and &#163;1 million is not
nearly enough to cover the future atrocities that may unfortunately
take place.</p><p><a name="06070333000080">I do not
expect any compensation. That is not why I am taking part in the
debate. My tragedy has taken place. I am anticipating the events that,
sadly, will happen. And they will happen. We have only to look at the
size of the barriers surrounding the House of Commons to know that we
still live in a very dangerous
world.</p><p><a name="06070333000081">It is wrong
that we can receive compensation, poor though it may be, if we are on a
Eurostar train that is attacked while it is parked in Waterloo station,
but as soon as it leaves British soil we are not entitled to any
compensation from the UK Government. A number of good things came out
of Bali. We improved the website containing travel advice and we sorted
out the emergency response teams that embassies provide. One remaining
objective is to sort out the compensation that should be paid in parity
to those affected by terrorism in the UK. Terrorism recognises no
borders, and neither should the British Government&#146;s help to
support British
citizens.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070333000127">10.14
pm</h5><p><a name="06070333000082"><b><a name="06070333000140">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr.
Gerry Sutcliffe):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) on securing this very
important debate. I also offer my condolences to the hon. Member for 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 627</b><br>Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) on the loss of his brother. I fully
understand the issues that he raises, and I will touch on them later if
I can. I thank them both for the spirit in which they made their
contributions.</p><p><a name="06070333000083">The
question of help and support for the victims of the 7/7 bombings is
very much in our minds as we approach the first anniversary of those
dreadful events. My thoughts, and I am sure those of the whole House,
go out to those who suffered a bereavement or an injury, whether
physical, psychological, or emotional. As my hon. Friend says, none of
us can forget those horrific events of last year. This timely debate
gives me the opportunity to bring the House up to date with the facts
on how we have been able help those who were injured or bereaved by the
bombings. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim
Fitzpatrick), who is Minister for London, has joined me on the Front
Bench for this important debate.</p><p><a name="06070333000084">As my hon. Friend said, it is
widely known that 52 innocent people were killed in the bombings and
that more than 700 people were injured. The national health service,
the police, local authorities, and the special assistance centre and
telephone helpline established in the aftermath of the tragedy have
each played a key role in offering support and help to those affected.
We should never forget those who are committed to the emergency
services for the work that they do, and did on that day.</p><p><a name="06070333000085">The survivors
and the bereaved were eligible for compensation from the criminal
injuries compensation scheme, the statutory scheme that pays out
compensation to victims of violent crime in Great Britain. Compensation
claims are handled by the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Authority&#151;CICA&#151;which, as hon. Members will be aware, is
an executive non-departmental public body. The authority is responsible
for the day-to-day administration of the scheme. It interprets the
scheme&#146;s rules and decides how much compensation claimants are
entitled to according to its terms.</p><p><a name="06070333000086">Ministers are precluded by law
from getting involved in individual cases or from commenting on
CICA&#146;s handling of individual applications or its decisions in
individual cases. However, CICA, in administering a statutory scheme,
is bound by the terms of the scheme as set by Parliament. The authority
has limited discretion in applying the rules in individual cases. In
that respect, the scheme differs from, for example, the London Bombings
Relief Charitable Fund, which, as an independent charity established
specifically to help 7/7 victims, was free to set its own rules and
guidelines and can make charitable grants at the discretion of its
trustees.</p><p><a name="06070333000087">As I said, I
cannot talk about individual cases. However, I can give the House some
more general information about claims made to CICA and describe how it
is dealing with claims from those who were more seriously injured,
which is the issue of particular concern to my hon. Friend. At close of
business on Friday 23 June, CICA had received 516 applications for
compensation in respect of the 7/7 bombings. It had also received 12
applications related to the attempted bombings two weeks later on 21
July. However, I am not including 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 628</b><br>information about the 21/7 incidents, because none of those victims
sustained severe physical injury but have sought compensation only for
the mental trauma they suffered. Of the 516 7/7 applications, 18 have
been turned down, although some of the claimants have appealed against
that decision. CICA has paid 370 awards totalling &#163;2.3 million,
comprising a mix of interim and final awards. In 217 cases, a final
award has been accepted and paid, thereby bringing the case to a
close.</p><p><a name="06070333000088">As for serious
cases, CICA has interpreted that as meaning cases where the claimant
has lost an eye or a limb or has sustained severe burns or other injury
of comparable severity. It has received 17 claims where the principal
injury meets that definition of seriousness. According to CICA, in
every serious case it has made substantial interim awards on account.
In most instances, that interim award has been the tariff award for the
most serious injury sustained. Therefore, in several cases the interim
award has been well in excess of &#163;100,000. CICA is not yet able
to finalise these seriously injured cases, because they all involve
claims for compensation additional to the basic tariff award for loss
of earnings and special expenses. In all those cases, the final
prognosis for recovery is not yet clear and CICA is not yet in a
position to make a final assessment of the claim for financial
loss.</p><p><a name="06070333000089"><b><a name="06070333000141">Mr.
Winnick:</b> Will my hon. Friend confirm, unless I am wrong,
the figures that I cited, which showed that the highest sum paid so far
is &#163;152,000 and that only five people have received more than
&#163;100,000?</p><p><a name="06070333000090"><b><a name="06070333000142">Mr.
Sutcliffe:</b> I published figures in my written answer to my
hon. Friend, but I shall ensure that I put the exact detail in writing
if they are different from the figures that he cited and those to which
I referred.</p><p><a name="06070333000091">Work
remains to be done on the cases. The Criminal Injuries Compensation
Authority will, of course, aim to finalise the claims as quickly as it
can. However, when that is likely to take some time, it will be ready
and willing to make further substantial interim awards where
possible.</p><p><a name="06070333000092">The
authority continues to receive applications at the rate of about 30 a
month, and those newer applications account for most of the cases in
which it has not yet been able to make an offer of compensation. There
are also 11 bereavement cases, for which the authority has not yet
received
applications.</p><p><a name="06070333000093"><b><a name="06070333000143">Mr.
Winnick:</b> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but I
have looked at his written answer. At the time, I did not ask him the
question that I just asked and it is not therefore covered. I
understand that the issues are complex and I do not criticise my hon.
Friend&#151;he did not know what I might ask. Will he write to me in
reply to the question that I asked a moment ago and place the response
in the Library as quickly as
possible?</p><p><a name="06070333000094"><b><a name="06070333000144">Mr.
Sutcliffe:</b> I am happy to write to my hon. Friend. Clearly,
I want to ensure that the fullest possible information is in the public
domain and I shall therefore place a copy of the letter in the
Library.</p><p><a name="06070333000095">I said that
there were 11 bereavement cases for which the authority had not yet
received any applications. As I said earlier, the victims of 7/7 and
those bereaved by the bombings also had financial support from the
London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund. The Mayor of London 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 629</b><br>and the British Red Cross set it up in the immediate aftermath of the
bombings. The Government donated &#163;1 million to the fund in July
2005 and we announced last month that we were donating another
&#163;2.5 million to it, so that the trustees could give further
assistance to the bereaved and injured of the 7 July London
bombings.</p><p><a name="06070333000096">Before that
second Government donation, the fund had made more than 900 charitable
grants, totalling more than &#163;8 million, to more than 300
individuals. It now expects to be able to make another 200 to 300
charitable grants, and I believe that many such grants have already
been made to those who were seriously injured or
bereaved.</p><p><a name="06070333000097">To complete
the picture, I remind hon. Members that we also passed regulations in
2005 so that payments from the London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund
are disregarded for the purposes of assessing entitlement to
means-tested state benefits. We have, of course, thought hard about
what can be learned from these dreadful events. We had already been
examining ways in which to improve the criminal injuries compensation
scheme before the 7 July bombings. However, the events of 7 July
obviously highlighted specific problems with the scheme, especially the
process involved, the length of time taken, and the amount of the
payments, particularly in the serious cases. That is why the Government
made a donation of &#163;3.5 million to the charitable fund, which
has been able to make payments on a more flexible and quicker basis
than a statutory scheme. We have learned lessons&#151;for example,
that there needs to be a clearer policy for making interim payments,
and that discretion should be used when possible to allow practical
common sense to prevail, within the rules of the scheme.</p><p><a name="06070333000098">We know that the scheme in its
current guise isnot perfect. That is why we undertook a public
consultation this year, with proposals for refocusing the scheme to
increase amounts of compensation for those 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 630</b><br>most seriously injured, while providing more immediate local help and
practical support for those whose injuries were less serious. We will
publish the results of that consultation exercise later this month and
announce our plans for reforming the scheme before the summer
recess.</p><p><a name="06070333000099">Let me
consider the points that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East made.
One of the problems with the statutory scheme is that it was not
designed for the sorts of events that happened in Bali or, indeed,
those of 7/7. Supporting the charity was the best way in which to
introduce some flexibility into the system. However, I know that the
concern that the hon. Gentleman raised about terrorist tragedies
throughout the world is widespread. Perhaps we can meet him and people
who support his cause to ascertain what we can do in future to try to
find the best way in which to provide immediate practical assistance to
individuals at home and abroad. I undertake to consider that. Clearly,
we are now living in a world that is more dangerous than ever before,
and it is important that we address the situation by giving support to
the people who need it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="06070333000100">The CICA arrangements are in
place, as I have said. I understand what my hon. Friend is saying: we
should try to process these issues as swiftly as possible. I have tried
to explain that that is what we want to do, despite the difficulties
that we face in regard to the rules of the scheme. By supporting the
charity fund, we have been able to provide some flexibility, however.
We are looking at the future of the scheme and at what needs to be
done. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my explanation. I will
write to him on the issues that he has asked me about, and I hope that
the House will understand what the Government are trying to
do.</p><p><a name="06070333000101"><i> Question put
