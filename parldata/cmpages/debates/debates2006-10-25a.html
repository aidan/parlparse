lifting 30 million people out of poverty. It also addresses the
challenges of dealing with corruption, of accountability and of

involved in that large sum, not least in the DFID administration and in

achievements of Vietnam. Economic growth has averaged about 7 per cent.
in recent years, and since 1993 the Vietnamese Government have reduced
the number of people living in extreme poverty from nearly 60 per cent.
to just under 20 per cent. Those are considerable achievements, and I
hope that the aid we have committed&#151;to which my hon. Friend
rightly referred&#151;will help to lower the figure even
further.</p><p><a name="06102570000042">I can
reassure my hon. Friend about administration costs. Ours amount to less

there have been significant improvements in human rights in recent

Nations Office on Drugs and Crime&#151;with a relatively small sample
size&#151;showed that in 2006, 81 per cent. of farmers re-planted
legal crops following eradication. Only 2 per cent. re-planted poppies,

in Afghanistan, but the vast bulk of the money that we give in
development assistance goes to the Government of Afghanistan. They have
requested that we and other donors give our support in that way because
it is the best way to build their capacity to deliver services to their

important point about security, which is a precondition for

the criticisms of our activity in southern Afghanistan has been the
lack of co-ordination between projects. For example, the short-term
nature of the recent USAID project for drip irrigation for farmers has
only helped them to grow poppy. We have taken some action by trying to
promote provisional development plans, but that project appears to have
stalled, with no plans coming forward from southern Afghanistan. What

excellent speech he made in the Westminster Hall debate last week. I
respect his views greatly. He draws attention to an important issue. I
cannot claim responsibility for USAID programmes&#151;I will resist
the temptation&#151;but a balance must be struck between building
capacity for the long term and demonstrating progress in the short
term. The governor of Helmand has expressed some frustration about the
latter and that is why we have redirected some of our efforts&#151;as
the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;towards quick impact projects, so that
people can see change beginning to take place. I know that the hon.
Gentleman understands that point completely. One of the reasons why the
Government of Afghanistan have asked donors to provide more of their
support through Afghan mechanisms&#151;in particular, through the
Afghan reconstruction trust fund&#151;is so that the Government can
provide that co-ordination. If we get our act together&#151;and I
urge other donors to follow the lead that we have given&#151;we have
a better chance of addressing the problem that the hon. Gentleman

regulate the extraction of their natural resources and raw

and what we do will depend on the security situation. I should tell the
House and the hon. Gentleman that the single most significant step that
could be taken to bring the conflict to an end would be for those who
did not sign the Darfur peace agreement in Abuja in May to meet around
the negotiating table&#151;the Government of Sudan should be there,
as well as Minni Mannawi, who did sign&#151;because, as we have seen
in the past two weeks, an agreement signed with the eastern front will,

we have managed to reduce dramatically the time that it takes to get

Where we are building more homes&#151;and we need to build more

the right hon. Gentleman is against the climate change levy, but we

workable. That is why we will make sure that any proposals that we

that we will not merely allow that, but help Iran with a civil nuclear
power programme. However, we will not allow it to acquire material that

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I
would like to make a statement on the report of the Committee on
Radioactive Waste Management&#151;CoRWM&#151;which was published
on31 July. Similar statements are being made in the Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly. On behalf of the whole House, I thank
the chair of the committee, Gordon MacKerron, and its members, for the
outstanding effort that they put in to arrive at their unanimous
report.</p><p><a name="06102570000172">The
issue of nuclear waste disposal has dogged successive Governments.
CoRWM was asked to recommend the best option, or combination of
options, for the long-term management of the United Kingdom&#146;s
higher activity radioactive wastes, which provides protection for
people and the environment. The Government believe that the CoRWM
report provides a very strong basis for moving forward with clarity and
consensus. We accept CoRWM&#146;s recommendations that the
UK&#146;s higher activity waste should be managed in the long term
through geological disposal, as well as the continuing need for safe
and secure interim storage until geological disposal is available. We
also agree with CoRWM that we must continue to build on the momentum
that it has helped to
establish.</p><p><a name="06102570000173">As
CoRWM&#146;s report observes, geological disposal is the approach
that is being adopted in many countries, including Belgium, France,
Finland, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
Nevertheless, securing geological disposal represents a major challenge
that will require a commitment over many decades. We accept
CoRWM&#146;s recommendation that the process for developing a
geological disposal option should be undertaken on a staged basis, with
clear decision points. That will allow Government to review progress
and to assess costs, value for money and environmental impact before
decisions are taken to move to the next
stage.</p><p><a name="06102570000174">Planning
and development of the geological disposal option must be based on four
key pillars: a strongand effective implementing organisation,
with clear responsibilities and accountabilities; strong independent
regulation by the statutory regulators&#151;the Health and Safety
Executive, the environment agencies and the Office for Civil Nuclear
Security; independent scrutiny and advice to Government on
implementation; and a partnership with the host community.</p><p><a name="06102570000175">The CoRWM report observes that
the safe and secure storage of civil legacy radioactive wastes already
falls within the remit of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which
was established under the EnergyAct 2004. The NDA also has
responsibility in its current remit for low-level radioactive waste. We
have decided that responsibility for securing geological disposal of
higher activity waste should also fall to the NDA, so as to create one
organisation that is able to take a strategic view through all stages
of the waste management chain, and that is clearly and transparently
accountable to independent regulators and Government.</p><p><a name="06102570000176">The NDA is
already subject to statutory safety and environmental protection and
security obligations under the Energy Act 2004, and its contractors are
subject to

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1520</b><br>regulation by the environment agencies, the HSE and the Office for Civil
Nuclear Security. Its strategy and annual plans are subject to approval
by Government. We will ensure that, in future, the longer-term
radioactive waste management interests of Government are appropriately
represented in the NDA&#146;s strategy and that it has governance
arrangements to reflect its increased responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06102570000177">Nirex has played an important
role in maintaining and developing the UK's knowledge on geological
disposal, including the provision of advice to industry on waste
conditioning and packaging, since the demise of its geological disposal
development programme in 1997. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry and I, as joint shareholders in Nirex, are
grateful to the successive chairs and the board for their hard work,
and, of course, to the expert staff involved. None the less, the
Government believe that having two organisations on the same playing
field with potentially overlapping responsibilities would confuse and
blur accountability. Instead, we are determined to harness the skill
and commitment of the staff involved within the NDA.</p><p><a name="06102570000178">Following today&#146;s
statement, we shall allow Nirex a short period to comment on the
proposed ownership transfer and how it could best be brought about. The
independent environment and nuclear safety regulators believe that the
proposal will provide a framework that they can regulate strongly and
effectively. They are content that the NDA will be responsible for
implementing the geological disposal programme, within the
constitutional arrangements that I described earlier. The
regulators&#146; support is critical, as strong independent
regulation is key to ensuring the safety of people and the environment
and securing confidence and trust in the delivery
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102570000179">On the
third key pillar of our approach, we remain committed to the
independent advice that CoRWM has pioneered so well. Accordingly, a
successor to the independent committee will be appointed to give
continuing advice on the plans for long-term management of radioactive
waste.</p><p><a name="06102570000180">CoRWM has set
the standards for open and transparent advice that takes into account
not only the best available scientific and other expert input, but the
views of the public and stakeholders. It has also built up support
and&#151;perhaps surprisingly, given a name that does not exactly
trip off the tongue&#151;brand recognition. The new committee will
therefore maintain the current name, but its membership will be
reconstituted to reflect its role in the next stage of the
&#147;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&#148; programme. The
committee will be sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, the DTI and the devolved Administrations.</p><p><a name="06102570000181">The committee&#146;s primary
functions will be to advise on the implementation of a geological
disposal programme, including considering the strategy and delivery
plans and the site selection process. It will make its advice available
to the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly
for Wales, as has been done by CoRWM.</p><p><a name="06102570000182">The circumstances surrounding
the long-term disposal of higher activity radioactive waste are unique.
We have made it clear that we are not seeking to impose radioactive
waste on any community. In that

partnership, as described by CoRWM, with the local authorities serving
communities that might be affected. As CoRWM recognises, there is a
need to consider further how such arrangements will work in practice.
Accordingly, we will look to develop further an approach that includes:
the stages and decision points; how communities would be involved; the
role of democratically elected bodies locally; and the potential for
involvement and community packages as suggested by CoRWM.</p><p><a name="06102570000183">Disposal
facilities will be built only in a geologically suitable area, and we
will also consider how geological and scientific considerations will be
meshed with other societal considerations as, for a successful
programme, all the criteria will need to be met. I invite any local
authority&#151;or group of local authorities&#151;that wishes to be
involved in those discussions to contact me, the Minister for Climate
Change and the Environment, or my officials directly. Similar
invitations are being extended by my colleagues in the devolved
Administrations.</p><p><a name="06102570000184">It
must be stressed that any future facility-siting process will be a
wholly new process, divorced from the historical Nirex process. Lessons
have been learned from that. We are also determined that the new
approach will be carried out from the beginning in an open and
transparent way, with appropriate opportunity for public and
stakeholder, as well as expert, involvement. In light of that further
work, the Government will produce an implementation framework and
publish it for consultation as soon as possible next year.</p><p><a name="06102570000185">This announcement and the more
detailed response that I am publishing today&#151;copies of which
have been placed in the Library&#151;complete stage 2 of the
&#147;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&#148; programme. We are now
entering stage 3: planning for implementation. We aim to be able to
move to stage 4&#151;the final implementation stage&#151;in 2008,
and we are confident that the sharing of information and viewpoints,
and the transparency of the CoRWM process, will have been
maintained.</p><p><a name="06102570000186">The CoRWM
report
states:</p><a name="61025-0003.htmbrev_4"><a name="06102570001726"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For
over three decades, efforts to find solutions to the problem of
long-term radioactive waste management in the UK have
failed.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000187">Governments of
all parties have struggled to develop a long-term approach to the
problem that is founded on science and then driven by openness and
transparency. I believe that the content of my statement today combines
scientific rigour with clear accountability, and I commend it to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102570000188"><b><a name="61025-0003.htm_spnew114"><a name="06102570001924">Mr.

letting me have prior notice of its content. I also echo his comments
on Gordon MacKerron and the members of his committee&#151;the
Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. They have undertaken a
difficult, complex and sensitive task with skill and refreshing
transparency. I therefore broadly welcome the fact that the Government
have decided to proceed in accordance with the committee&#146;s
recommendations.</p><br>

views in the House on whether it is desirable or necessary to build new
nuclear capacity. However, I trust that we can all agree that there is
now an urgent need to find a long-term, secure solution to the problems
posed by historic nuclear waste. Whether we like it or not, it is there
and it has to be dealt with. Successive Governments have put off
confronting that issue for far too long.</p><p><a name="06102570000190">The Government have accepted
CoRWM&#146;s recommendation that geological disposal is the best
available approach to the long-term management of all the material
categorised as waste. They have also accepted that a robust programme
of interim storage must play an integral part in the long-term
management strategy. They are right to have done so.</p><p><a name="06102570000191">What is likely to cause more
controversy is the decision to give the responsibility for planning,
implementing and managing that process to the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority rather than to a new independent body. Is there not a danger
that conflicts of interest will arise from the fact that the NDA, which
owns the waste and existing sites, will also, under the
Government&#146;s plans, be responsible for implementing the
geological disposal? How will the Secretary of State ensure that, in
selecting the sites for storage, the NDA will not only act, but be seen
to act, with complete
impartiality?</p><p><a name="06102570000192">The
Secretary of State has rightly emphasised the need for openness and
transparency throughout the next stages of the process. Is there not a
risk that not only the transparency but the integrity of the whole
process will be compromised by the decision to place it, effectively,
in the hands of the industry? I strongly urge the Government to look
again at this part of their plans; the Secretary of State will
understand that it is absolutely essential that the procedures that
they adopt are beyond reproach and, as far as possible, beyond
controversy.</p><p><a name="06102570000193">This
aspect of the Government&#146;s plans has already called into
question the Secretary of State&#146;s green credentials&#151;and I
know that he is very sensitive about them. There is a case for the
implementation of the plans to bury nuclear waste to be overseen by a
body that is clearly independent of the nuclear industry. I know that
he will refer in his reply to the statutory regulators, but there will
undoubtedly be concerns that that is not
enough.</p><p><a name="06102570000194">In respect of
locating the disposal sites, the Secretary of State has indicated that
he is keen to explore the concept of voluntarism. He is right to do
that, but what indication has he received so far from local authorities
that they would be willing to enter into negotiations on becoming host
communities for nuclear waste? Also, what thought has he given to the
scale and nature of any inducements that might be offered to local
communities that agree to take such
waste?</p><p><a name="06102570000195">I am pleased
that the Government have set out a timetable, although I note that it
is described as &#147;indicative&#148;. Given the length of time
that we have all already waited for this announcement, it would have
been better if they had set out a firm timetable today. Although safety
must be paramount, and there is no case whatever for a rushed job,
there is an urgent need to make progress, and CoRWM has mapped out how
to do that.</p><br>

for any indication of the likely cost of the Government&#146;s
proposal. Surely the Secretary of State would not have made
today&#146;s statement without having any notion of what the proposal
will cost to implement in the short, medium and long term. I should be
grateful if he shared that information with us and with the taxpayer.
Out of which budget will the costs be met? It is hard to believe that
the costs will fall to beleaguered DEFRA, which is cutting its budget
to make up for the cost of incompetent management.</p><p><a name="06102570000197">Overall, we welcome the

shamefully, has remained unaddressed for far too

the serious tenor of his remarks and the engaged way in which he has
tried to address the subject. One major issue, to which I shall return
later, is the misapprehension on his part that the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority is anything other than a creature of this
House. In fact, it was created under the Energy Act 2004, so it is not
a creature of the industry.</p><p><a name="06102570000199">I completely agree with the
hon. Gentleman that we must applaud and build on the work of CoRWM, and
he is absolutely right to say that this issue should not divide people
according to whether they are for or against any further nuclear build.
He is also right to say&#151;he could hardly be wrong&#151;that we
must both proceed with due speed and not rush he job. He was taking no
risks in setting that out. I have yet to be approached by any local
authorities, but I know that Members have signalled in debates in this
Chamber and elsewhere that their communities are interested in those
discussions.</p><p><a name="06102570000200">I made
it clear that we would give further details on the site selection
process next year, which somewhat gives the lie to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s suggestion that we do not have a forward timetable.
Financing obviously needs to be considered by the Government, rather
than just one Department&#151;and certainly not just mine. That is
what we propose to do, in close consultation with the Department of
Trade and Industry and other interested parties, not least the
Department for Communities and Local Government.</p><p><a name="06102570000201">As I said, the NDA was set up
only two years ago by this House, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion that we should have yet another new body, which would
further complicate an already very difficult set of
issues,does not seem<i> &#151;[Interruption.] </i>The hon.
Gentleman recommended setting up another new body, but our and the
regulator&#146;s argument is that it needs a singular focus to
achieve the accountability that is being delivered. The NDA works not
for the industry but for this House and this Parliament, which gave it
a very clear mandate to serve the public interest. So the hon.
Gentleman should look again at the 2004 Act&#151;I am not sure
whether his party voted for or against it, but my memory is that it
enjoyed wide cross-party support. It is certainly quite wrong to
suggest anything other than that the NDA is driven by the Act under
which it was set up.</p><p><a name="06102570000202"><b><a name="61025-0003.htm_spnew116"><a name="06102570001926">Chris

statement, in that the Secretary of State
congratulated&#151;rightly&#151;CoRWM and its chairman, Gordon
MacKerron, on the work done, but then said that it is to be
reconstituted. So on the one hand, CoRWM has done a good job, and on
the other, it is being sacked. That is perhaps as bizarre a decision as
the Prime Minister&#146;s decision, following the incompetent
implementation of the single farm payment, to promote the Secretary of
State&#146;s predecessor and put her in charge of Britain&#146;s
foreign policy.</p><p><a name="06102570000203">May
we please have a clear commitment from the Secretary of State that the
distinction that CoRWM draws in its report&#151;it was not picked up
on in today&#146;s statement&#151;between dealing with the legacy
of our waste and any new decision should be very clear? There should be
no assumption that the decision taken today to set in process the means
of dealing with that legacy will set a precedent for dealing with new
waste. There should be no licence to create new waste from new power
stations.</p><p><a name="06102570000204">I am also
concerned that the statement is rather mealy-mouthed about a key
recommendation of CoRWM that there should be a commitment to
voluntarism, and no imposition of radioactive waste on any community.
The Secretary of State said in his statement:</p><a name="61025-0003.htmbrev_5"><a name="06102570001727"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have made it clear

communities would be much happier if the Secretary of State could tell
us clearly that no community will have radioactive waste imposed on it
against its will.</p><p><a name="06102570000206">Finally, I agree very much with
the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) about the
merger of Nirex with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Clearly,
the build-up of skills in Nirex, to which the Secretary of State
referred in his statement, is at risk of being lost in an organisation
that has a financial incentive to deliver decommissioning at the lowest
possible cost, rather than on the basis of safety or environmental
concerns. That seems bad for safety and the environment, and it
represents a considerable setback for the Secretary of State in dealing
with the interests of the nuclear industry and the Treasury with regard
to environmental protection.</p><p><a name="06102570000207"><b><a name="61025-0003.htm_spnew117"><a name="06102570001927">David

Parliament, the relevant Minister, who is a Liberal Democrat, has taken
a responsible attitude. That tells me, first, that the Liberal

the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) will never miss an
opportunity to be a complete opportunist. Let me run through his wholly
tendentious points.</p><p><a name="06102570000208">The hon. Gentleman suggested

completely common-sense decision, and the total opposite of his
insinuation.</p><p><a name="06102570000209">On new
waste, the hon. Gentleman again seems to have failed to read the CoRWM
report, which says clearly that the technical arguments applied to
dealing with existing waste apply just as well to future waste.
Deliberately, CoRWM does not take a position on the desirability or
otherwise of any future nuclear capacity. It does, however, address the
technical arguments. I can say clearly that the principles underpinning
the CoRWM report and my statement&#151;those in respect of geological
disposal and governance&#151;not only could but should be the basis
of future decision making about new waste.</p><p><a name="06102570000210">On voluntarism, given that I
made it clear that the former Nirex list is truly dead and buried, and
that there is every commitment to make voluntarism&#151;or
partnership, as it is sometimes called&#151;work in practice, I
cannot understand how the hon. Gentleman thought that my statement was
mealy-mouthed.</p><p><a name="06102570000211">Finally, the hon. Gentleman
complained that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is subject to
independent regulation but, within that, should seek to maximise value
for money for the taxpayer. That seems to me to be a completely
reasonable position for any authority. The opposite is to say that,
within the safety constraints, which are paramount, it should not seek
to maximise value for money. That seems a completely ridiculous
position. It has been made absolutely clear that the regulators will be
able to regulate that model in a strong, effective manner. Anyone who
wants to suggest an alternative will have to show me that the
regulators will be as happy with such a model as they are with this
one.</p><p><a name="06102570000212"><b><a name="61025-0003.htm_spnew118"><a name="06102570001928">Mr.

Many environmentalists are concerned that the body responsible for the
ownership of our legacy waste is institutionally linked to the body

congratulate the Secretary of State on facing up to this vexed issue,

State for Trade and Industry, to the House and to the wider public. If
anything has been made clear by the 30-plus years of what CoRWM calls

that a detailed response to all of CoRWM&#146;s recommendations has
been made available to the House. It contains more detail than I was
able to supply in my statement. If my hon. Friend reads that, he will
see that the Government are committed to transparency and to
independent and rigorous scrutiny and intervention by the statutory
regulators, which are the only bodies with statutory responsibility in
these matters at the moment. Although Nirex has played an important
role in advising the industry, it does not have any statutory powers.
The independent regulators are the only bodies with statutory powers,
either under the current system or in the future. I believe that that
is the right approach, and the existence of an additional oversight
committee made up of scientists and lay people means that we have an
important double lock on these matters.</p><br>

given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the regulation of mini
motos; and for connected
purposes.</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000272">I aim to
show that legislation on miniature motorbikes, which exist in a legal
grey area, is necessary, popular and overdue. A new law is necessary
because the situation that exists for my constituents, and for those of
many hon. Members, is intolerable. I am introducing this Bill on behalf
of the people whom the problem affects and on behalf of the legitimate
motorcyclists to whom it is giving a bad
name.</p><p><a name="06102570000273">Today, people
will be tearing around roads and paths in South Swindon on mini motos,
terrifying residents. In my first year as an MP, that has been one of
the main antisocial behaviour problems that my constituents have come
to me with, and they have every reason to expect
action.</p><p><a name="06102570000274">I can tell
those who have never seen a mini moto that they are replica motorbikes,
only a quarter of the size of a regular bike but with a two-stroke
engine that can take them to over 50 miles per hour. In theory, they
are to be used only on private land, but in practice they are driven
over public land, paths and, most terrifyingly, on roads. In Swindon in
just one small period of this year&#151;between 1 May and 19
June&#151;there were 128 complaints about antisocial behaviour and
dangerous driving involving mini motos. That amounts to about five
complaints every two
days.</p><p><a name="06102570000275">I have raised
the issue of minibike misuse on the paths between Eldene and Liden with
PC Phil Young, and various similar problems in the Parks and Toothill
areas with Inspector Steve Bridge. The police in Swindon are doing
fantastic work, often involving crushing illegally ridden mini motos,
but they are fighting against the tide. According to Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, there has been a twentyfold
increase in recent years in the number of mini motos imported into the
UK from China, and representatives of the motorcycle industry believe
that there could be 300,000 machines in
circulation.</p><p><a name="06102570000276">However,
the police in Swindon are not required by the Home Office to collate
the number of accidents, serious or otherwise, that mini motos cause.
That is a problem that I want rectified. I want the Home Office to
supply updated guidance to chief constables to require police to report
mini moto accidents separately. We need access to statistics to see if
the number of injuries caused by mini motos is exploding at the same
rate as that at which the bikes are flooding
in.</p><p><a name="06102570000277">I can quote much
anecdotal evidence on this matter from my constituency and from across
the country. For example, one of Swindon&#146;s Labour councillors,
Barrie Thompson, recently received a complaint from an elderly disabled
woman who said that she was harassed and nearly knocked over on the
path that goes up to her house by a person riding a mini moto. In a
separate incident in Peterborough, a 71-year-old woman was run into by
a gang of young people on minibikes and received a broken foot and
fractured knee. In addition, the brain injury association Headway is
backing the crackdown on the riding of mini motos, on the ground

(Mr. Drew) has his own mini moto story to tell. His leg was
gashed as a result of what happened, and I am sure that he will tell
the House about it at some point in the future. The Government believe
that existing legislation provides adequate powers to combat mini moto
misuse. However, that argument offers no consolation for my
constituents who are putting up with the nuisance. Clearly, more could
be done.</p><p><a name="06102570000278">Mini motos
have hurt children and can wreck lives, and it is entirely unreasonable
that they should be treated by the law as toys. There has been
confusion among enforcers&#151;that is, magistrates and the
police&#151;about whether they are considered to be motor vehicles.
Apparently, magistrates have tended to give the defendant the benefit
of the doubt in these cases, and the police have been uncertain about
which part of the legislation should be used in
prosecutions.</p><p><a name="06102570000279">I am
glad that the Department for Transport acknowledges this problem and
that it has issued guidance making it clear that it regards mini motos
to be motor vehicles. However, in the absence of legislation the
Department has left clarification to be determined by the results of
further court cases. The High Court has ruled on motorised scooters but
not yet on mini motos. Treating mini motos as motor scooters, which are
allowed on the roads, would not be an adequate
solution.</p><a name="06102570001721"><p>Mini
motos are not roadworthy. Unless they are modified, they do not come up
to European construction requirements. By banning mini motos from the
road we would send a clear message to enforcers and consumers, and the
vehicles could still be enjoyed on tracks created for the
purpose.</p><p><a name="06102570000280">This
measure would be a popular move with hon. Members, with the motorcycle
industry and with my constituents. My hon. Friend the Member for
Rhondda (Chris Bryant) introduced a ten-minute rule Bill two weeks ago
to deal with scrambler bikes and my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley
(Barbara Keeley) is introducing a similar Bill next week. Early-day
motion 2040, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North
(Helen Jones) was signed by 79 MPs and calls on the Government to
ensure that minibikes are clearly defined as motor vehicles. That shows
that the House wants to see action on tightening the regulation of
off-road bikes.</p><p><a name="06102570000281">The
industry does, too. Honda, based in my constituency, is supporting
motorcycle industry initiatives to tackle poor-quality, far-eastern
minibikes, which are flooding the UK market. My constituents also
support action&#151;78 per cent. of people in Swindon say that they
want a ban, as shown in a poll in my local paper, the <i> Swindon
Advertiser</i>, which has been hugely supportive of my
campaign.</p><p><a name="06102570000282">My
constituents, including the police who wish to reach offenders and
youngsters and their parents who are actively involved in the
fast-growing sport, have engaged extremely positively with me about the
Bill. The commercial manager of Swindon speedway stadium is keen to
work constructively with Swindon youth services and the police to
tackle the disruptive use of mini motos. I have received a further
positive offer of support from a track owner, Andrew Watts, and my
constituent, James Carter, a parent involved in

young sons, and he travels to a safe track to supervise their sport. He
is confident that those who are involved with mini motos would welcome
the Bill and he is encouraged by the local alternatives suggested as a
result of the
debate.</p><p><a name="06102570000283">Support
for my Bill has come from parents, police, youth services and members
of the public. They want to see children having fun, but not
endangering people&#146;s lives&#151;or their own&#151;and
blighting neighbourhoods. Instead of a complete ban, the best approach
combines both enforcement and managed provision. The law needs to be
changed so that mini motos are seen as vehicles, not toys, and are
driven off our streets completely. We should legislate clearly in a way
that the police, the courts and my constituents can understand and have
trust in. I hope that I have convinced the House that this small Bill
is what we need to defeat a massive
menace.</p><p><a name="06102570000284"><i> Question

new clause deals with the accounts scrutiny regime for charitable

businesses, not small charities. In the debate on the Companies Bill in
the other place, Lord Hodgson tabled Opposition amendments to take
small charitable companies out of the company law regime for accounts
scrutiny, placing them instead within the charity law regime. The
Government accepted the merit of that idea and took representations
from a number of umbrella bodies for charities and professional
accountancy bodies and received a favourable response, so we agreed to
proceed with the idea.</p><p><a name="06102570000296">At its heart is the sensible

Companies Bill amendments were made on Report last week and the
principal amendment to the Charities Bill is set out in new clause
1.</p><p><a name="06102570000297">The new clause
contains a new order-making power, allowing Ministers to amend the
Charities Act 1993 and the Bill to reflect changes in company
law&#151;the changes that will be made by the Companies Bill when it
comes into force. The result will be that we can apply the same
accounts scrutiny requirements&#151;professional audit for those with

between &#163;10,000 and &#163;500,000 and no compulsory scrutiny
for those below &#163;10,000&#151;to all charities, regardless of
their legal form. The order-making power will also allow the group
accounting requirements to be changed so that, in preparation of group
accounts, a group of charities headed by a charitable company is put in
the same position as a group headed by any other form of

No. 30 is the other substantive amendment in the group. It amends new
section 73E, inserted by clause 38 into the Charities Act 1993, and
arises from the diligence of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight
(Mr. Turner)&#151;and not for the first time, either. It
is designed to give the court the power to grant relief to the trustees
of a charitable incorporated organisation. Section 61 of the Trustee
Act 1925 gives the court a power to grant relief to trustees, but the
charity trustees of a CIO are not trustees within section 61 of
thatAct, mainly because the CIO is a new
institution.Section 727 of the Companies Act 1985 gives the
court the power to grant relief to the officers of a company, but that,
too, does not at present apply in the case of a CIO. The amendment
therefore provides for section 727 of the Companies Act to have effect
in relation to the charity trustees of a
CIO.</p><p><a name="06102570000303">In Committee I

Horwood:</b> New clause 3 addresses a problem that has, I
think, arisen by accident. Before the Charities Acts 1992 and 1993,
section 29 of the Charities Act 1960 provided that no land held by or
in trust for a charity that&#151;this is an important
phrase&#151;had been occupied for the purposes of the charity could
be sold, leased for more than 22 years, mortgaged or charged to
security without the consent of the court or the Charity
Commission.</p><p><a name="06102570000316">Section 32
of the 1992 Act superseded the 1960 Act and imposed an overall
prohibition of disposal of any land held by, or in trust, for a charity
without an order from the court or the Charity Commission. That section
was repealed and re-enacted without alteration as section 36 of the
1993 Act, which is the crucial provision that we are
addressing.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="25 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1542</b><br><p><a name="06102570000317">The effect of the rather rushed
1993 legislation was inadvertently to catch a category of land held in
trust for charities, left in wills as a charitable bequest, which had
not been included before 1992, because the original Act covered only
land held in trust and that had been occupied for the purposes of the
charity. The section 36 requirements were perfectly reasonable for the
normal disposal of land by charities, which had to acquire a proper
valuation and go through various procedures set out in the section.
However, by applying such procedures to land left in legacies the 1993
Act inadvertently gave charities a new and serious
burden.</p><p><a name="06102570000318">I shall give
the Minister a few examples. Macmillan Cancer Support derives about 33
per cent. of its total income from legacies. It
says:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_7"><a name="06102570001729"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
spend, as best we can calculate it, some &#163;14,500 a year on
section 36 reports. This includes not only the surveyor&#146;s fee
(and VAT which we cannot reclaim) but also the costs of staff in
considering, processing the information, passing it to Trustees for
approval, all communication with estate solicitors and co-beneficiaries
and ancillary costs such as postage and photocopying...There is
without doubt an adverse effect on the charity overall. The majority of
the reports simply confirm what the estate Executor has already
informed us about the property&#146;s broad state and value, which
will usually include, for instance, an offer higher than probate value,
or the possibility of development. In a small number of estates, the
s36 valuation does show a higher value than the estate administrator
has believed appropriate; however, it is not always the case that the
market then offers the higher
price.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000319">It calculates
that</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_8"><a name="06102570001730"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the time spent in
considering, processing and forwarding the reports represents nearly
four weeks of a person&#146;s time each year, for almost no
benefit&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000320">Macmillan makes the important
point that the fiduciary duty on executors would protect assets held in
trust for the charity by the executor. It
states:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_9"><a name="06102570001731"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
feel that little additional protection is given to the Charity&#146;s
trustees beyond that which already exists by virtue of the
Executor&#146;s duty to maximise
assets.&#148;</p></ul><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_4"><a name="06102570001794">1.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102570000321">Macmillan is
quite a large charity, but the provision affects smaller charities,
too, for which it might be even more onerous. A letter from Battersea
Dogs Home, which is at the lower end of the larger charity scale,
states:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_10"><a name="06102570001732"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Section
36 has proved to be incredibly confusing and costly to the
charity...Unfortunately, I do not have exact figures of how many
s36 reports we request per year but approximately 20 ...
&#163;10,000 of charity money on reports is a lot of money, which
could easily be applied elsewhere to help our
cause.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000322">At the
upper end of the scale, the largest charity of all&#151;Cancer
Research UK&#151;estimates that it has spent more than &#163;80,000
on section 36 reports in the past year and tells
me:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_11"><a name="06102570001733"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Release of
capital from estates can be prolonged due to irregular meetings of
trustees and administrative
hold-ups.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000323">One
of the procedures that are particularly onerous for larger charities is
that the section 36 reports have to be presented to the
charity&#146;s trustees and approved by them. That is all very well
for an occasional disposal of land, but larger charities frequently
have to deal with land left to them in legacies, or held in trust in
legacies. Large charities such as Cancer Research UK depend greatly on
legacies, so the provisions are a burden on the trustees as well as on
the charity&#146;s staff.</p><br>

that adds up to a serious problem, about which we have previously
advised the Minister, so I shall be interested to hear his comments. If
he can provide a suitably robust form of words I shall be reassured,
but this is a matter of law and unless the Bill is amended it is
difficult to imagine how the problem can be
tackled.</p><p><a name="06102570000325"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew181"><a name="06102570001991">Edward
Miliband:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood) for raising this important issue. The letters from
various charities that he read out were quite compelling and I hope
that I can help to offer a way forward. I shall also address our
amendment No. 35.</p><p><a name="06102570000326">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the purpose of new clause 3 is to change the
regime under which trustees may sell land belonging to a charity, where
the land has been given to it through a bequest made under a will. One
normal feature of that regime is that the charity trustees must obtain
a surveyor&#146;s report about the proposed sale. I have seen a
letter from the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners&#151;STEP.
I suspect the organisation has also written to other Front Benchers.
The letter raises a number of concerns, which I have discussed with the
Charity Commission. It seems pretty clear that the question is not, as
the hon. Gentleman suggests, one of law but more of perception or
administration&#151;either the perception of the charities or the
administration of the commission, as I shall explain when I have set
out the legal
position.</p><p><a name="06102570000327">The concern
seems to be that, at present, separate reports have to be obtained in
some cases where land is given to a charity in a will. One report has
to be obtained by the personal representatives of the donor&#151;that
is, of the estate&#151;and another by the trustees of the beneficiary
charity or charities, resulting in unnecessary expense for the charity.
I have talked to the Charity Commission about that concern at some
length. In its view, the legal position is that there is never any need
for double compliance with the
regime.</p><p><a name="06102570000328">If the
estate&#146;s personal representatives sell the land in the course of
their administration of the donor&#146;s estate, the charity land
disposal regime does not apply. If the administration of the estate has
been completed and the land belongs to the charity, the personal
representatives can sell it only as agents of the charity, or as its
trustees. The charity trustees must comply with the charity land
disposal regime, but their personal representatives need not. I hope
that that makes clear the legal position on double
compliance.</p><p><a name="06102570000329">STEP says
in its letter&#151;the point was repeated by the hon.
Gentleman&#151;that the situation is particularly difficult for
legacy-receiving charities with non-executive trustees, because a
surveyor&#146;s report and a certification of compliance with the
procedures must be obtained by the charity trustee personally. I
checked with the Charity Commission on that point, and found that a
whole range of powers given to trustees can be delegated to members of
staff; the section 36 power is one of them. There is no need for the
trustees personally to give approval&#151;that was one of the
concerns raised by STEP. I have made the position on double compliance
clear, but to enhance understanding 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="25 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1544</b><br>on all sides I have agreed with the Charity Commission that it will
listen to representations about the practical implementation of the law
on the subject, so that we can clear up any misperceptions or
administrative problems.</p><p><a name="06102570000330">If the intention behind the
amendment was the removal of the need for anyone to follow the normal
requirements of the charity land disposal regime when selling land left
to a charity as a legacy, there would be no justification for it. In
other words, charity trustees should not be exempt simply because land
has been given to them in a will. The regime is sensible, and it
clearly encourages the trustees to carry out their duties properly and
effectively; in addition, it ensures that, if charity land is sold, a
proper price is obtained, so it is a necessary protection for charities
and their beneficiaries. Having said that, the necessary content of the
surveyor&#146;s report is set out in regulations that are nearly 15
years old, so there is a question of administration, too. I said in
Committee that the Government have undertaken to review those
regulations, with a view to simplifying them, thereby reducing the
costs of surveyors&#146;
reports.</p><p><a name="06102570000331">Finally,
although we note the intentions behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment, as he set them out, I am advised that its wording will have
quite a different effect. If charity trustees have followed the
requirements set out in section 36(3) of the Charities Act 1993, they
need not seek the authority of the commission for the sale. I know that
this is not his intention, but if we removed the possibility of
complying with those requirements, trustees selling land that they
received in a will would always have to seek the authority of the
commission. In practice, that would involve complying once again with a
bureaucratic
requirement.</p><p><a name="06102570000332"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew182"><a name="06102570001992">Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> I am a little unclear about what the
Parliamentary Secretary is saying. He seems to say that the
charity&#146;s trustees would not have to obtain a valuation when
they inherit property that they sell straight away. However, clearly,
there must be a cut-off point between inherited property that is sold
straight away, and inherited property that is sold at a later stage,
and I am not sure what that cut-off point
is.</p><p><a name="06102570000333"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew183"><a name="06102570001993">Edward
Miliband:</b> I am saying two things. First, as I understand
it, the concern raised by charities, and in STEP&#146;s letter, is
that there is a double compliance problem. Their concern is that, after
the representatives of an estate have completed the whole process of
obtaining an evaluation and so on, the charity must go through the same
process. That is duplication. I am assured by the Charity Commission
that there was never any need for double compliance&#151;that is a
matter of
law.</p><p><a name="06102570000334">Secondly, to
respond directly to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention, it is
right that there should be the necessary protections ensuring that,
when a charity gets a bequest, it seeks a valuation of the land, so
that it can act in the best interests of its beneficiaries. However,
one of the concerns raised is that the sale of the land will require
the personal approval of charity trustees. That is a particular problem
if they are non-executives who are abroad. I reassure the hon.
Gentleman that, as with many other functions of a charity, that
function can be delegated to members of the charity&#146;s
staff.</p><br>

Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments, but they are surprising, given the
overwhelming body of legal advice that all the major charities that I
mentioned have been receiving for more than a decade. The
misunderstanding&#151;if it is that&#151;about the involvement of
the trustees is understandable, given what is said in part V of the
Charities Act
1993:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_12"><a name="06102570001734"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Except
where the proposed disposition is the granting of such a lease as is
mentioned in subsection (5) below, the charity trustees must, before
entering into an agreement for the sale...obtain and consider a
written report&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000336">I can
understand why charities believe that it is the trustees who must
approve the
reports.</p><p><a name="06102570000337"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew185"><a name="06102570001995">Edward
Miliband:</b> On the first point about the legal position,
clearly I have infinite capacity to surprise the hon. Gentleman. I am
assured that the position is as I said. On the point about trustees, my
understanding&#151;I am told this reliably&#151;is that the
authorisation can be delegated to members of staff. If I find that that
is not the case, for some reason, I will obviously correct it, but that
is my strong
understanding.</p><p><a name="06102570000338">The
overall point is that we are discussing a complex area of law. The
Charity Commission is clear that double compliance, which is the
primary problem that has been raised, is not necessary. The letters
read out by the hon. Gentleman, and the letter from STEP, convince me
that a lot more work needs to be done on sorting out the perception of
the law, and quite possibly its administration by the commission. I
have proposed that the commission should undertake such a process, and
it has agreed to do so. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102570000339"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew186"><a name="06102570001996">Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments,
but, as I said, I find them surprising. The people who are concerned
about the point of law that we are discussing are not amateur
organisations, or junior legacy officers in charities; as he said, they
include STEP, which is the professional organisation of trust
accountants and lawyers. There is a widespread body of legal opinion
that has been shared with most of the top 500 charities, and it
suggests that the issue remains a problem in law, hence all the
representations that we received. Clarification on the double
compliance issue might assist charities, and it will certainly provide
them with a defence in law if they are challenged on the lack of a
report on a particular occasion, but the overwhelming body of advice
from charity lawyers states that there is indeed a problem in law with
the personal involvement of trustees and the commissioning of
reports.</p><p><a name="06102570000340"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew187"><a name="06102570001997">Edward
Miliband:</b> To expand on my earlier point, I can reassure
the hon. Gentleman that it is absolutely clear that duties are given to
trustees throughout the law, but there are general powers allowing the
delegation of many of those duties, including the duty that we are
discussing. I hope that that satisfies him, and that he will withdraw
his amendment. I give him a promise that there will be proper dialogue
on the issue with the commission.</p><p><a name="06102570000341"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew188"><a name="06102570001998">Martin

Gentleman&#146;s comment; indeed, I was about to make it, myself. As
a charity trustee, I have some interest in the subject, and perhaps I
should declare that interest. Although we have good liability
arrangements in place, in general trustees have personal liability in
that regard. It is routine to delegate administrative functions,
including&#151;as the representations from the various charities have
made clear&#151;securing section 36 reports. No one is suggesting
that trustees are personally talking to surveyors and estate agents and
obtaining the reports; such duties are clearly delegated to the proper
officers. However, as part of the approval process that must be
followed, I guess that it would be a derogation of trustees&#146;
responsibilities if, at a meeting of trustees or of the governing body,
there was not, at the very least, a personal vote on whether to approve
the report.</p><p><a name="06102570000344">I welcome

like other hon. Members who have worked so hard on this impressive
piece of legislation.</p><p><a name="06102570000839">The issue that I want to speak
to is relatively narrow, and the Minister knows that it has been the
subject of correspondence with, in particular, the British Humanist
Association. I am an honorary associate of the National Secular
Society, and I wish to record that. I am also a member of the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, which has reported on this matter at least
three times, backing in general terms the amendments that I am
proposing.</p><br>

pm</h5><p><a name="06102570000840">The purpose of
the amendments is, as the Minister and other hon. Members know, to
widen one of the descriptions of charitable purpose&#151;&#147;the
advancement of religion&#148;, in clause 2(2)(c)&#151;by adding the
words &#147;or belief&#148;, using a definition of belief that is
consistent with previous legislation. That should be the default
position. The default position in law generally is that when we talk
about religion now, we talk about religion and belief. The
Government&#146;s own admirable Equality Act 2006 did just that; the
Communications Act 2003 did just that; and of course the parts of the
Human Rights Act that deal with these issues, notably articles 9 and
14, are predicated on that
basis.</p><p><a name="06102570000841">The default
position should be that the Bill says &#147;religion or
belief&#148;, so that non-religious belief systems analogous to
religion but not religious, and not simply non-theistic religious views
but non-religious belief systems, are covered. So the Government need
to provide an explanation, which I may or may not agree with, of why
they have departed from what is the default position in modern
legislation. I hope that they will realise that there is not a good
enough explanation, and will accept the amendments.</p><p><a name="06102570000842">Secondly, not to do that
creates an issue of principle, which is that in our legislation,
non-religious belief systems are being dealt with differently. There is
an argument to be had about whether that has a practical impact; I
believe that it has, although the Minister may claim that it has not.
But regardless of whether there is as yet a visible practical impact,
or has been in the past, there is a principled position, which must be
explained. </p><p><a name="06102570000843">I have
certainly received representations, and I have seen a letter dated 18
September to the Minister from the British Humanist Association, which
I shall refer to, setting out the practical impact of the fact that
until now charities law has dealt with non-theistic belief systems in a
different way, meaning that they have to jump through extra hoops and
offer extra justifications to get the treatment under charity law that
religious charities get almost by default. I intend to discuss that.
</p><p><a name="06102570000844">Finally, I shall draw
attention to the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on this issue,
because that Committee&#146;s recommendation is to draw to the
attention of both Houses the ongoing
concerns.</p><p><a name="06102570000845"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew194"><a name="06102570002483">Kelvin
Hopkins (Luton, North) (Lab):</b> I strongly support the hon.

whether he would give some idea of the proportion of the population who
might be excluded in a sense from the coverage of the Bill if the word

included.</p><p><a name="06102570000846"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew195"><a name="06102570002484">Dr.
Harris:</b> It is hard to say, because the
number of people signed up to humanism per se, through the British
Humanist Association and other organisations, is not as extensive as
for other religions. But as the hon. Gentleman knows, this is not a
question of numbers because the Bill makes provision, as it should do,
for small religions&#151;even religions whose adherents are fewer
than those who have actually consciously subscribed to a humanist
belief system&#151;to be recognised. I am sure that the Minister will
be aware that there are significant numbers of people who
say&#151;for good reasons, I happen to think, although I am not a
member of the British Humanist Association&#151;that they have a

that is something that should at least not be discriminated against,
and some may argue that it is a very laudable
thing.</p><p><a name="06102570000847"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew196"><a name="06102570002485">Chris
Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> What I do not understand is, what
belief system would not be covered by the definition of the advancement

elsewhere in the clause?</p><p><a name="06102570000848"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew197"><a name="06102570002486">Dr.
Harris:</b> I was going to come on to the point that the
Government have made about that. It is not that humanist or rationalist
new organisations, for example, may not be able to get charitable
status under another part of the clause. Indeed, the Government said in
their response to reports from the Joint Committee on Human Rights that
the catch-all, which used to be clause 2(2)(l) and is now clause
2(2)(m), and refers to subsection (4), would do. That is not the issue.
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is not that those are not
charitable activities; it is just that they should be dealt with in a
straightforward way, in the same way as religious belief systems. It is
easier, because of the specific mention of religion, for that to happen
with religious belief systems.</p><p><a name="06102570000849">For reasons of
non-discrimination, the default ought to be &#147;religion or
belief&#148;, as defined under the Human Rights Act 1998, introduced
by this Government. That definition has stood the test of all the other
recent Government Bills that have mentioned religion. This Bill is a
curious departure. To argue that the situation is okay because those
organisations will be able to do things some other way, which might or
might not take them longer, is not an argument of principle, and it is
an argument of principle that I want to hear from the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06102570000850">In the 18
September letter to the Minister, the chief executive of the British
Humanist Association, Hanne Stinson, says that the BHA has never been
given any reason why the separation of non-religious beliefs from
religion is necessary or desirable. That is the key point, and if that
is not addressed it will be hard for us to avoid pressing the amendment
to a Division. We need some sort of explanation. The BHA
says&#151;and I agree&#151;that the situation is objectionable on
formal grounds as an obvious discrimination between religion and
non-religious beliefs, even if no actual detriment is caused. It says
that it would be likely to lead to detriment for non-religious beliefs
as different bodies of case law or Charity Commission practice built
up, because cases dealing with non-religious beliefs may well not be
dealt with by the same staff or in the same context as those dealt with
under another sub-heading. That is at least possible&#151;some would
say probable.</p><p><a name="06102570000851">The BHA
claims&#151;I have seen the background to this&#151;that Government
assurances that there is no problem and that things will not be any
more difficult are undermined by past Charity Commission practice and
by Government assurances of special treatment for religion. I will give

&#147;religion or belief&#148; that can be taken, and is taken, to
show that for religion the obligation may not be onerous, but it may be
for things covered by the catch-all, or the items relating to education
that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). We
know from other debates that education is a difficult ground for which
to show public benefit.</p><p><a name="06102570000853">The Government need to be aware
that in practical terms, there has been an impact. The BHA goes on to
explain that past practice shows that it can be onerous to get
charitable status for a rationalist or humanist belief. The Rationalist
Association sought registration as a charity in February 2001 and put
in an amended application in November 2001. The process took another 15
months after the amended application was made, and there was endless
correspondence with a variety of Charity Commission staff, each
pursuing different lines of unnecessary inquiry, before at last the
application was approved in exactly the amended terms proposed in
November 2001. That cost a lot of money and
delay.</p><p><a name="06102570000854">The commission
made the following assertion in the course of that
correspondence:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_16"><a name="06102570001736"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
promotion of Rationalism and Humanism in themselves ... is not a
charitable
activity&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000855">Would the
commission ever write to a Christian charity to say that the promotion
of Christianity in itself is not a charitable activity? I believe that
debates will show that if anything, assurances have been given that the
straight promotion of, for example, Christianity is to be considered a
charitable activity in itself, before the other test about public
benefit, which we might debate later, is passed. I share the
BHA&#146;s view that that is</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_17"><a name="06102570001737"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the clearest demonstration of
blatant discrimination against non-religious beliefs by the Commission
and of the need for the Bill to bring religious and non-religious
beliefs together under the same head so as to deter to some extent at
least such detrimental treatment of humanist charities in the
future.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000856">It has
been argued that because there is a wide variety of non-religious
beliefs, they demand special scrutiny. However, the same applies to
religion. There are a multitude of religions. The Government have been
reluctant&#151;I do not argue with this&#151;to define religion in
statute, but have recognised that there will be a number of religions.
The non-religious beliefs that qualify under the Human Rights Act as
being governed by article 9 are already delimited by case law, and
non-religious beliefs are no different from religious ones in being
required to show public benefit. One can always argue about Scientology
and so forth, but the same arguments that might apply to non-religious
belief systems apply to some&#151;some might say all&#151;religious
belief systems. I am talking about the questions that need to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06102570000857"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew198"><a name="06102570002487">Mr.

does not cover politicalbelief systems. There is not a shred

to refer, does refer, and is understood to refer, to rationalist and
humanist belief systems, for example. I am not an expert in these
matters. We all have other things to be getting on with rather than
worrying about the meaning of life, even at a time like this. However,
the people who are affected have written to express their views. There
will be humanists and rationalists in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituency. I know that he will think about these things deeply
before deciding whether to opt for a discriminatory, or apparently
discriminatory, approach, and he will have their interests and feelings
in his mind as he decides his
position.</p><p><a name="06102570000859">I want to
cover what the Joint Committee on Human Rights has said and then I will
draw my remarks to a close. The Committee was clear in its scrutiny of
the draft Charities Bill. In paragraph 5.23 of its report of 1 November
2004&#151;its 20th report of that Session&#151;it stated, after
setting out the Government&#146;s response that they were satisfied
that organisations advancing non-religious beliefs would not be
disadvantaged under the Bill as currently
drafted:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_18"><a name="06102570001738"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
remain of the view that Convention compliance could best be supported
by including the advancement of non-religious beliefs as a charitable
purpose under clause
2(2)(c)&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000860">I
believe that that is still clause 2(2)(c) several versions
later&#151;</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_19"><a name="06102570001739"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and we
draw this matter to the attention of both Houses.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000861">The Committee went on to
comment on that in its report on the Charities Bill in the last
Session. It set out its detailed argument in paragraphs 3.11 to 3.15. I
will not repeat that, but the Committee did want to reiterate the
following point, in paragraph 3.15:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_20"><a name="06102570001740"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whilst we appreciate
that clause
2(2)(l)&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000862">&#151;now

capable of application in the way suggested by the government, we
remain of the view that protection of Article 9 rights on an equal
basis could most effectively and clearly be ensured by provision on the
face of the Bill, expressly extending clause 2(2)(c) to cover all
religious and non-religious organisations which promote systems of
belief. As we stated in our report on the draft Bill, at a minimum,
guidelines under the Bill must clarify that organisations advancing all
forms ofboth religious and non-religious beliefs protected by
Article 9 would be accorded recognition under either clause 2(2)(c) or
clause 2(2)(l) on an equal
basis.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000863">If guidelines are
going to say, &#147;Use clause 2(2)(c) to cover non-religious belief
systems,&#148; why not just include &#147;religion or
belief&#148; and make the statute look like what the guidance needs
to be?</p><p><a name="06102570000864">Finally, the
Joint Committee on Human Rights returned to the matter in its latest
report on the subject, the first report of the 2005-06 Session. It
recognised that there had been some improvement, because a definition
of religion had been included. I want to record on behalf of the
Committee, informally, our recognition that that was done. In paragraph
1.8, the Committee states:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_22"><a name="06102570001742"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We welcome the broad
definition of religion in clause 2(3)(a), as supporting the Article 9

compatibility with Article 9 and Article 14 could be achieved in
practice&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000865">I believe that that
is arguable&#151;by application of the catch-all</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_23"><a name="06102570001743"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as proposed by the government,
such compliance would best be assured by a definition which extended to
non-religious belief systems falling within the protection of Article 9
ECHR. We draw this to the attention of both
Houses.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000866">We
thus have not only arguments of principle, but the fact that the
default is to use a definition such as that proposed. We also have
three recommendations of the Joint Committee, which was set up by
Parliament to advise it on human rights and discrimination, and a
practical impact&#151;and we have heard in return no convincing
arguments of principle from the Government about why they are not doing
what I
propose.</p><p><a name="06102570000867">The
problem is that there will be attempts&#151;amendment No. 126, which
was tabled by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss
Widdecombe), is an example&#151;to treat religion as not requiring a
public benefit test. If that were ever to come to pass it would clearly
breach article 14, which addresses the duty of non-discrimination in
respect of rights enjoyed under article 9, and exacerbate the existing
system. The Government could solve such problems by accepting my
amendments
today.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_6"><a name="06102570001796">2.30

briefly to Government amendmentNo. 3? I have a close
association with the British Chess Federation, which has lobbied the
Minister hard on the need not to have a provision in the Bill that
would exclude the federation a priori from justifying its pursuit,
which is enjoyed by many disabled and elderly people, as a sport of the
mind. The federation would wish me to put on record its thanks to the
Government and the Minister, who will have free entry to any chess
club&#151;and they are pretty wild places&#151;and to the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) for raising the matter
in Committee. The Government have done a good thing by tabling that
amendment, so I hope that they will also do a good thing for the
humanists, not all of whom play
chess.</p><p><a name="06102570000869"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew200"><a name="06102570002489">Charlotte
Atkins (Staffordshire, Moorlands) (Lab):</b> The hon. Member
for Oxford, West and Abingdon(Dr. Harris) will not be
surprised to hear that I wish to speak about the issue that he just
raised. I welcome Government amendment No. 3 because it is clearly
intended to include activities such as chess in the scope of the clause
on the advancement of amateur sport. I applaud that, because the
promotion of chess will bring a huge public benefit for not only people
who are disabled or elderly, but young people, especially. When we talk
about chess, it is often not recognised that it does not require mental
agility and concentration alone. At higher levels, a lot of physical
effort is required to engage in a match lasting perhaps several
hours.</p><p><a name="06102570000870">Cheddleton and
Leek chess club, which is one of the most successful chess clubs in the
country, is in my constituency, and plays at national level in the four
nations chess league. It has produced five British junior champions and
one visually impaired international player, so I can tell the
Conservative Members who are smiling that it is not a joke
club.</p><br>

the club to attract even more people into the sport, and would mean
that it could put on more events such as its successful annual
congress, which draws many people, including international masters and
grand masters, to Leek. The club could then also provide much more
coaching to young people. It always holds a session on Friday nights
for the adult and junior clubs, and also goes into schools to promote
chess.</p><p><a name="06102570000872">The Cheddleton
and Leek club grew out of the passion of many young chess players. Back
in 1973, chess was on the junior school curriculum, but there was
nowhere for the youngsters to play after they got into high school.
They thus pleaded with a teacher, Robert Milner, to set up a club so
that they could continue to play. It is absolutely remarkable that the
same Robert Milner is leading the club today; he should be
congratulated on
that.</p><p><a name="06102570000873">Chess remains on
the curriculum at St. Edward&#146;s middle school, because it is
recognised that chess hugely improves pupils&#146; concentration and
benefits their learning potential overall. When I was a school governor
in London, a team of young black students took on many private schools
in south London and did remarkably well. Many of those students played
chess in their playgrounds on the benches provided. Chess gave them
huge motivation and massively improved their concentration and learning
potential.</p><p><a name="06102570000874">The
Cheddleton and Leek club now boasts a junior section with 70 members,
and its overall membership is more than 100. It has nine teams in the
junior league. Many of the youngsters take on older
players&#151;frequently beating them&#151;and there is a great
rapport between the students, who can be as young as eight, and club
members in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s. The club does a
tremendous job locally and should receive recognition for it. I am
extremely grateful for Government amendment No. 3, because it will
ensure that the club can get on the road to charitable status, which
will allow it to get the support that it deserves and continue its
valuable work in the community. I hope that other chess clubs
throughout the country will follow its good
example.</p><p><a name="06102570000875"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew201"><a name="06102570002490">Mr.

pay tribute straight away to the Minister for his kindness in talking
to me about the matter earlier, which was much appreciated. I hope that
he will be able to respond constructively to what I say. In the

such a way that it might preclude sports that come into existence in
the future from being covered. For example, triathlon is a young sport,

co-ordinates those sports at the Olympic and Commonwealth games. It
works hard with and is admired by Sport UK, and has an exemplary
reputation. I say immediately for the avoidance of doubt that I am
talking about target shooting with rifles and pistols, which has
nothing whatever to do with
hunting.</p><p><a name="06102570000883">The Bill
introduces the concept of &#147;the advancement of amateur
sport&#148; as being a charitable purpose. Sport is defined, rather
narrowly, in clause 2(3). The Government have tabled their own
amendment No. 3, which slightly broadens that definition. That is all
to the good. The federation, not unnaturally, is concerned about the
fact that target shooting with rifles and pistols, which is recognised
by the Olympic and Commonwealth organisations as an amateur sport,
could be excluded by reference to the current definition of sport,
though I hope not by the Government&#146;s new proposed
definition.</p><br>

its governance, must not be confused with hunting or any gun lobby.
Target shooting sport in the UK was founded in 1859 and featured in the
first Olympic games of 1896 and every games, bar two, since then.
Target shooting is an Olympic, Commonwealth and Paralympic sport. The
home nations have a high reputation internationally and regularly win
medals. Target shooting provides many opportunities for competitive
sport at county, national and international level through recognised
international governing
bodies.</p><p><a name="06102570000885">Target
shooting sport, as regulated and governed by the national governing
bodies, is an inclusive sport without any discrimination and with
special emphasis on encouraging the young. It provides a safe sport
requiring physical and concentration skills, and promotes and maintains
health. It also provides a safe sport for those with disabilities,
including blindness or sight impairment, in some cases on equal terms
with the fully able-bodied. It provides a lifelong sports activity for
the very young to the very old. It is a sports activity encouraged by
many local councils, schools and cadet units. It encourages a
responsible attitude to shooting and the handling of firearms from club
level upwards, and is therefore a force for good in
society.</p><p><a name="06102570000886">The listing
of target shooting sport as a charitable activity in the advancement of
amateur sport is fundamental to the federation, and would help to give
it the financial ability to support target shooting not only for its
members, but for the blind and the Paralympics, and for the training of
Olympic hopefuls. I believe that the Minister of Sport is sympathetic
to the federation&#146;s position, for I gather that in relation to
the Olympics he has written a paper for the Home Secretary to help
facilitate the making of arrangements for squad practice for target
pistol shooters in the UK in preparation for

target pistol shooting, which is a different concept. I understand that
the Charity Commission may have been advised that shooting should not

was no reference to the sport about which I am speaking&#151;target
rifle and pistol shooting. This sport is already accepted as a

to be recognised for charity purposes as a sport. As I said, this would
help with recruitment of the young to the safe use of firearms for
competitive
marksmanship.</p><p><a name="06102570000893">I stress
that we must concentrate on the misunderstanding among some people of
exactly what the activity of athletic, competitive target shooting is.
The federation justifiably claims that its courses of sporting practice
conform to requirements for fitness as they include elements of
stamina, strength and suppleness&#151;the qualifying criteria, in
many cases. The federation represents a major category of international
sport. If those sports are not regarded as a charity activity, they
would be the only sports recognised by the Commonwealth Games
Federation and the IOC not to be

(Dr. Harris) and I have similar views on religious faith&#151;I do
not profess to hold religious views, and neither does he. However, I
have reached different conclusions about the need for and practicality
of legislating on the protection or the charitable status of
non-religious views. The first part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
speech addressed beliefs and belief systems themselves, whereas it
seems to me that charitable purposes can apply only to organisations
which are involved in promoting those beliefs and belief
systems.</p><p><a name="06102570000906">One would not
want to discriminate on the grounds of lack of religious belief, in the
same way as we do not allow discrimination on the grounds of religious
belief, but the Bill does not do that, because it contains so many
opportunities for an organisation involved in advancing non-religious
beliefs to have its rights protected and for its charitable purposes to
be recognised. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government were right
not to define religion too tightly, but then appeared to accept that
non-religious beliefs could be defined sufficiently well to put them in
the Bill, which I found particularly difficult to get my head
around.</p><p><a name="06102570000907"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew215"><a name="06102570002504">Dr.

advancement of, for example, Christianity or Buddhism should be treated
differently from the advancement of humanism. Secondly, one can use
terms such as &#147;religion&#148; and &#147;belief&#148; in
legislation, because it is understood from previous legislation what
they mean. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about a wide definition
of &#147;belief&#148;, he should be concerned about the Equality

thinking along the same lines as me or he has been reading the

the Minister told me that clause 2(3)(a), which covers what religion
includes, can include matters besides those listed in sub-paragraphs
(i) and (ii). I hope that that is clear&#151;that explanation was
clear enough for my satisfaction at the
time.</p><p><a name="06102570000913">In an earlier

pointed out that subsection (2)(e) refers to &#147;citizenship or
community development&#148;. In this day and age, I do not think it
possible to discuss citizenship without discussing belief systems and,
indeed, the beliefs that underlie those systems. I therefore think that
an organisation that is involved in citizenship or community
development from an explicitly and specifically non-religious point of
view could justify its charitable status under subsection
(2)(e).</p><p><a name="06102570000914">Subsection
(2)(h) relates to the point raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West

advancement of human
rights&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000915">is included as a

9(1) of the Human RightsAct 1998. Even if that point were not

to</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_30"><a name="06102570001750"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any other purposes

a non-religious organisation, in so far as it is all about beliefs and

to have its purposes acknowledged as
charitable.</p><p><a name="06102570000918"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew219"><a name="06102570002508">Dr.

analogous&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000919">Why should
humanism be treated like that just in this Bill, when Buddhism is not,
simply because it is a religious belief? There is nothing innate about
Buddhism that means that it should not have to go through the hoops of
the extra test for non-religious beliefs. The hon. Gentleman thinks
that the extra test for non-religious beliefs is straightforward, but
practice has shown that it might not
be.</p><p><a name="06102570000920"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew220"><a name="06102570002509">Tom
Levitt:</b> As the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, it is not
practical to define exactly what we mean by &#147;religious
beliefs&#148;. It would be completely wrong to include a schedule to
the Bill listing religious beliefs for the purpose of the Bill. Even
among humanism, atheism and agnosticism, there are lots of different
views, and different organisations may adopt slightly different
approaches. I do not think that we should to seek to define
&#147;religious beliefs&#148; too
closely.</p><p><a name="06102570000921">Finally, I
have always believed that one of the problems with the funding of
political parties is that the public benefit that political parties
provide to this country is not recognised in law or charitable law. On
another occasion, perhaps we can examine whether political parties are
involved in subsection (2), although that may be a discussion for
another day.</p><br>

persuaded that amendments Nos. 123 to 125 had such a practical impact
as well as the point of principle involved. My personal experience with
humanist organisations was always that they had managed to achieve
charitable status through the formula of &#147;the mental and moral
improvement of mankind&#148;. The Minister pointed that out to me in
Committee. The formulation, &#147;religion and belief&#148;, is
increasingly widespread not only in human rights law but in Government
legislation on several different topics. I even found a regulation that
refers to it in its title&#151;the Employment Equality (Religion or
Belief) Regulations 2003. Some people worry that this might open the
door to Marxism, for example, becoming charitable. However, the meaning
of &#147;belief&#148; is well established in this context, as in
those regulations and in human rights law&#151;it does not extend to
political beliefs but is limited to relevant beliefs such as humanism
and
secularism.</p><p><a name="06102570000926"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew222"><a name="06102570002511">Tom

legislation that he mentions concerns unjustified discrimination on
various grounds, not belief itself. I am sure that we would all agree
that this is not only about there being no circumstances in which it
would be justifiable to discriminate against someone on the grounds of
their belief, whatever it happened to be, in relation to their job, for
example.</p><p><a name="06102570000927"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew223"><a name="06102570002512">Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, so
let me cite an example that does not deal with discrimination. It comes
from a rather unlikely source&#151;I found it on the Charity
Commission&#146;s website only yesterday. The commission recently
accepted the promotion of religious harmony for the benefit of the
public as a charitable purpose, and it gives some guidance for people
wishing to promote religious harmony. Under the heading,
&#147;Religion and Other Belief Systems&#148;, it
says:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_34"><a name="06102570001754"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This new
purpose is about promoting harmony or reducing conflict; it is not
restricted to promoting harmony between religions that are recognised
by charity law. Since &#147;religion&#148; in this context is not
confined to the charity law definition we believe this would also
embrace &#147;beliefs&#148; as defined in human rights case law. It
also includes the promotion of harmony between believers and
non-believers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570000928">So the

different&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The Minister is shaking her
head; perhaps she would like to explain why the title of the employment
discrimination regulations and the formulation proposed by the Charity
Commission are wrong. The fact is that it is now a widely accepted
formulation in legislation, in case law and in many other respects. In
principle, it means that humanist and secularist organisations do not
to have to jump through a series of hoops to prove that they are
analogous to religion.</p><p><a name="06102570000931">We have heard about some
imaginative ways of achieving that. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris
Bryant) gave a list of the different heads of charity that they might
come under. The hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) suggested that
they might squeeze in under the human rights head of charity or fall
within the subsection that allows for purposes analogous to those
listed previously. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). Why should humanist and
secularist organisations have to jump through these extra hoops in this
area of law alone when it is not required, for instance, in relation to
anti-discrimination law or human rights law?</p><p><a name="06102570000932">This debate would be so much
dancing on pinheads if the confusion did not have a practical impact,
but I am persuaded by some of the correspondence that I have received
that it does. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
cited the Rationalist Association, which had to wait two years before
its registration was eventually accepted, at some cost not only to the
association but to the Charity Commission. I dread to think how much of
the commission&#146;s staff time was chewed up in arguing over the
fine detail of the case.</p><p><a name="06102570000933">To follow the High Peak
principle, there is another advantage in clarifying the law, even if
the outcomes may be the same in that, one way or another, humanist and
rationalist organisations will achieve charitable status. This is
clearly an area of confusion. Most members of the Committee will be
familiar with the example given by Mr. Rosser-Owen of
Religions Working Together, who recently wrote about a description that
has recently been changed on the Charity Commission&#146;s website in
another context. It states:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_35"><a name="06102570001755"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Belief in a Supreme
Being is a necessary characteristic of religion in charity law which is
why the criteria that we use include reference to a Supreme Being
rather than a god. The existing law allows theistic, non-theistic and
polytheistic faiths to be regarded as religions in charity law and the
precise nature of a Supreme Being is not defined. A Supreme Being does
not necessarily have to be in the form of a personal creator god; it
may be in the form of one god or many gods or no god at all in the
accepted understanding of the term.&#148;</p></ul><br>

122, tabled by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins),
suggests that we use the Olympic games, the Paralympics and the
Commonwealth games as a guide to what constitutes a sport. Given that I
am a member of a party led by a former Olympian, it would be churlish
of me to oppose the amendment, which provides a neater formulation than
the one in the original Bill. Some hon. Members are worried that
certain worthwhile sports may be excluded. However, as the amendment
adds to the Government&#146;s current formulation in the Bill, we
need not worry about the exclusion of any sports apart from those that
might have difficulty qualifying under the Government&#146;s
formulation of requiring &#147;physical or mental exertion&#148;.
The hon. Gentleman clearly has shooting in mind, and I am happy to
support that in principle provided that nothing gets killed in the

difficulty in getting through under the formulation, &#147;physical
or mental exertion&#148;. Synchronised swimming, which is an Olympic
sport, certainly involves physical exertion. Curling and, I understand
from the Commonwealth games website, 10-pin bowling would unambiguously
be brought into the Bill by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment,
which is spreading the net rather wide. I say to the right hon. Member
for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) that I am sure that
croquet is already included under &#147;mental exertion&#148;. I
speak with some authority because the Cheltenham croquet club has
played host in recent years to the world croquet championships, which I
attended. I was disappointed not to see the Deputy Prime Minister
there&#151;I gather that he is a fan of the sport. Great mental
exertion was in evidence on that occasion, not least because two games
are sometimes played simultaneously on the same lawn. That is mind
boggling.</p><p><a name="06102570000939">I support
the group of amendments. I hope that the Under-Secretary will make it
clear in any directions that he gives the Charity Commission on the
substance of amendments Nos. 123 to 125 that humanist and secular
charities will no longer have to jump through the hoops that the
Charity Commission has specifiedin the past. I therefore also
hope that, in future, there will be a more level playing field between
those organisations and religious

there is physical exertion, but there is no indication that that
improves their health, so it would appear to be excluded by the

exertion, so it would probably be brought in by the new provision if
those undertaking that activity could demonstrate that it contributed
to the promotion of good health. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, the

thought about that and said, &#147;Well, it does promote good health,
so we shall slide it in under that.&#148; However, the Bill was
introduced without a definition involving the promotion of health.

the debate that we had in Committee about the exclusion of the
efficiency of the police from being a charitable purpose. The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) moved an amendment
that had been suggested to him by the Police Dependants Trust. We have
talked to it further, and we propose to insert the promotion</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_41"><a name="06102570001761"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;of the efficiency of the

charitable purposes. We also thought that we should include at the same

Gentleman&#151;I think that he has indicated that it does&#151;and
others.</p><p><a name="06102570000980">Before I speak
to the amendments tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), I shall talk about the sport issue. The
hon. Member for Isle of Wight tabled an amendment in Committee to probe
the Bill&#146;s definition of sport. As the hon. Gentleman has
expressed concern, I wish to reassure him that the intention of
amendment No. 3 is certainly not to narrow the definition of
sport&#151;indeed, it is to widen it, hence the reference to
&#147;mental...exertion&#148;. I want to make that clear at
the
outset.</p><p><a name="06102570000981">Let
me explain what the aim is of the new definition of sport. First, it
makes it clear that what we are talking about, in the context of
charitable sport, is sports or games that improve public
health&#151;I shall explain shortly why that is necessary. The
Bill&#146;s existing definition, with its requirement of physical
skill and exertion, implies 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="25 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1570</b><br>that, but it does not say so. The new definition takes a direct approach
by referring specifically to health. That puts into statute the essence
of the current law, and it will allow sports that the commission has
not so far accepted to make their case. I shall say more shortly about
the processes that will be gone through in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06102570000982">The new
definition also extends to sports or games that involve mental, as well
as physical, aspects. There is no justification for continuing to
prefer the physical to the mental, given that those two aspects appear
to be of similar significance. That responds to a point made by the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, and which was eloquently
spoken to in this debate by my hon. Friend the Member for
Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins). I should say that I was
never a chess player as a child as it was too complicated for me. I was
more of a backgammon player, but I am unsure whether backgammon will be
able to make its
case.</p><p><a name="06102570000983">Some Members
will ask why there has to be a link to health at all&#151;why not
just make all sport charitable? That is the approach that the community
amateur sports club legislation takes. For charitable status to
apply&#151;regardless of whether it is in respect of schools or
sports&#151;there must be a public benefit. Health is the obvious
link, and that is why it is flagged up in our amendment. However, I
want to make it clear that it will be open to activities that do not
qualify under the heading of sports that promote health to put forward
their case that they deliver public benefit under one of the other
headings that is available in respect of being a charitable purpose.
For instance, some sports clubs already qualify because they promote
citizenship or community
development.</p><p><a name="06102570000984">On
amendment No. 122, in the name of the hon. Member for Woking
(Mr. Malins), we considered over the summer whether we
should follow his approach of a list for sports. It is worth explaining
to the House the two reasons why we did not go for that option,
attractive though it might be in certain respects. The first of them is
a matter of principle: community amateur sports club relief is designed
for all recognised sports, and included in that are the National Rifle
Association, the Clay Pigeon Shooting Association and others. The
difference in respect of charitable relief is that there should be
public benefit.</p><p><a name="06102570000985"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew250"><a name="06102570002539">Mr.

Miliband:</b> I shall do so in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06102570000987">The second
reason is important and complex, and it is a reason of practice. The
clause that we are debating merely establishes a heading of
&#147;charitable purpose&#148;. As with all charitable
purposes&#151;whether for animal welfare, education or anything
else&#151;a test must then be applied to show that there is public
benefit by the commission and, ultimately, the
court.</p><p><a name="06102570000988"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew252"><a name="06102570002541">Mr.

charities. That is the whole basis of charity law. The problem then is

as was proposed in Committee, or adopted the approach of the hon.

the established law&#151;such as it is&#151;focuses on health.

Miliband:</b> In order to pass the public benefit test there
needs to be an entry point of some kind, and the accepted entry point
is health. If Parliament wanted to legislate to say that all sports are
automatically for the public benefit, it could do so. In my view, it
should not take that decision because there should be a proof of public
benefit of some kind. There is a whole range of public benefits that it
is open to different sports to prove that they possess. There is
helping young people and the disabled&#151;I shall deal later with
the specific case that the hon. Member for Woking raised&#151;which,
at least in part, are charitable purposes, and the promotion of health,
with which this part of the Bill deals. Our principal position is that
there should be a public benefit, unlike community amateur sports club
relief, which applies to all sports. I am afraid that the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Woking would not achieve the purposes
that some Members seek to
achieve.</p><p><a name="06102570001000"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew263"><a name="06102570002552">Mr.

the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Woking would not have a
material effect; having said that, I hope that I can offer him some
consolation. First, if the Bill passes as it stands, a definition of
sport for charitable purposes will have been put in legislation for the
first time. The Charity Commission has agreed to undertake a new
consultation on that basis, so that all sports can make their case
under the charitable heading. Secondly, it will be open to any sport to
make its case under any other heading. I received a letter from the
National Rifle Association&#151;as I understand it, it is already a
charity&#151;stating that it plays a particular role in helping young
people, which is another charitable purpose. So it can make that
case.</p><p><a name="06102570001005">The hon. Member
for Woking spoke eloquently about the role that target shooting can
play in providing a safe sport for disabled people and others. I am
happy to make it clear that that is obviously very different from field
sport shooting, and I am sure that the Charity Commission will be aware
of that distinction. Thirdly, I have talked to the commission and if
the hon. Gentleman has other concerns, it will be very happy to meet
him to discuss them.</p><p><a name="06102570001006"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew267"><a name="06102570002556">Mr.

angling does.</p><p><a name="06102570001008">I turn
to the amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon, which were debated extensively in another place. It remains
the Government&#146;s view that they are neither necessary nor
desirable, and I want to explain why as briefly as I can. They are not
necessary because it is established beyond any shadow of doubt that
organisations promoting non-religious belief systems such as humanism
and rationalism can be charitable. The British Humanist Association,
for example, has been a registered charity since 17 January
1983.</p><p><a name="06102570001009">I was
slightly confused by the speech from the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood). He said that it has been established that humanist
organisations can be regarded as charitable under the provision
concerning the moral, mental and spiritual improvement of humankind. So
there is a clear charitable purpose in respect of which humanism can
make its case; more than that, it is accepted under that provision that
humanism is a way of promoting such improvement. The amendment on
humanism is unnecessary because humanism&#146;s contribution to
charitable purposes is established in law and accepted by the Charity
Commission.</p><p><a name="06102570001010"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew269"><a name="06102570002558">Martin
Horwood:</b> I understand what the Minister is saying, but I
made a number of points in my speech&#151;not just concerning the
point of principle&#151;and accepted that the outcome would be more
or less the same. However, there is a very important practical point.
The Rationalist Association sounds to me, to all intents and purposes,
like an organisation very similar to the British Humanist Association,
but it has been put through the various hoops under existing charity
law, which will be the basis of the new definition, and it took two
years for it to achieve charitable status. So there clearly are cost
implications and practical problems.</p><p><a name="06102570001011"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew270"><a name="06102570002559">Edward

patient, I would have come on to some of the practical ways in which
the Charity Commission deals with humanist organisations.</p><p><a name="06102570001012">I shall now explain why the
amendment is not only unnecessary but undesirable. The hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon tried to mount a compelling argument, but I
did not think that he clarified the way in which belief is defined
under the Human Rights Act. Actually, it is not defined under the Human
Rights Act. As I understand it, the Human Rights Act reference to
belief has been relied on for cases of non-discrimination, as my hon.
Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) pointed out. If public
resources are being made available, however, the order of magnitude is
different. We would want to be assured that we were not opening up the
definition, through the use of the phrase &#147;religion or
belief&#148;, toa wide and uncertain class of individuals or
organisations.</p><br>

him on that point. The reason that the amendment is undesirable is that
it would potentially open up charity law and charitable status to a
whole range of organisations. As the noble Lord said, we would be in
uncharted territory.</p><p><a name="06102570001017"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew273"><a name="06102570002562">Dr.

is that religion is a shallow, charted sea. Everything that he said
about the potential coverage of &#147;belief&#148; applies equally
to the various religions. Why must only non-religious beliefs go into
uncharted, deep waters, and not the huge variety of, some might say,
strange religious beliefs, which, under his formulation, will not have
to pass the same extra hurdles as non-religious
beliefs?</p><p><a name="06102570001018"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew274"><a name="06102570002563">Edward

Bill, which we will come on to debate if we ever move on, is whether a
public benefit test should be applied to all organisations, including
religious organisations. My point to the hon. Gentleman is that we are
some hundreds of years into the establishment of religion in charity
law. Yes, the Charity Commission must make decisions about scientology
and other religions, but Parliament, if it is amending legislation and
passing charity law, must think carefully before potentially opening up
the definition to a whole set of organisations that might come forward
and say that they are now for a charitable
purpose.</p><p><a name="06102570001019"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew275"><a name="06102570002564">Chris
Bryant:</b> I wholly agree with what my hon. Friend says. For
the avoidance of doubt, however, on the matter that I raised with my
hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt), an ordinary person
looking at the Bill might think that religion is now defined as
involving belief in more than one God, or as not involving belief in a
God at all. I presume that that does not preclude religions that only
believe in one God. Obviously, it would be odd to include pantheism but
not panentheism, and to provide support for those who believe in Diana
of the Ephesians but not for those who believe in Jesus of
Nazareth.</p><p><a name="06102570001020"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew276"><a name="06102570002565">Edward

recognise the eloquent case made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West

have discussed the matter with the commission, as it has been raised in

treating non-religious beliefs differently from religion. That is the
test. The Minister said that there were two planks to his argument:

but one based on practice, and that it was not desirable, which was at
least entering into the discussions of
principle.</p><p><a name="06102570001029">In fact,
even the practical argument does not apply, because the Minister based
it on the fact that there was not a shadow of doubt that the
non-religious organisations concerned could be charitable. I accept
that entirely. The fact that they are charities suggests that they can
be charitable. However, it is not a question of whether they can ever
be charities; it is a question of whether they can be charities as
easily, or according to the same tests, as organisations for the
advancement of religious belief. That has not been found to be the case
in practical terms.</p><p><a name="06102570001030">Let me now deal with the
Minister&#146;s argument about the commission&#146;s wish to have
discussions with non-religious organisations in parallel with its
discussions with religious organisations. That is a practical matter.
It is a welcome practical matter, and I do not want to sound churlish.
It is about time that it happened, so it is welcome. However, the fact
that the discussions will be in parallel with the discussions with
religious organisations prompts me to ask why they are not being dealt
with under the same
heading.</p><p><a name="06102570001031"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew282"><a name="06102570002571">Edward
Miliband:</b> A humanist representative was invited to the
first consultation with religious organisations as part of the
consideration of the public benefit test, but I thought that there
should be separate discussions with the humanist organisations, given
that they felt so
aggrieved.</p><p><a name="06102570001032"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew283"><a name="06102570002572">Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister accepts that separate discussions are
necessary because he proposes to deal with them separately, under
different headings. That is, in fact, my point. In a sense, the
concession actually confirms that the treatment of non-religious
organisations is different&#151;and, I would argue, unequal and
unfair.</p><p><a name="06102570001033">I asked the
Minister to come up with a principled justification. Coming to his aid,
the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) said that it was difficult
to define belief; but as it is just as difficult to define religion, so
any arguments about definition apply to religious beliefs as much as to
non-religious beliefs. Just because a god is involved&#151;or even if
there is not&#151;it does not solve the problem. The argument that
the hon. Gentleman used as a principled justification for making
humanist societies do something different is that they can do something
different. But that is not a justification for making them do something
different.</p><p><a name="06102570001034">The final
argument was that it is okay to have equal treatment in discrimination
law, but not in this respect. The Human Rights Act 1998 applies to
public bodies so that they cannot discriminate in employment, in the
disbursement of public funds or the treatment of an
organisation&#151;and the Charity Commission is clearly a public
body. If a public body discriminated in employment, the victim would
have two arguments, one based on the Act and the right to freedom of
belief, and another based on employment legislation. The latter does
not rely on the Act, but is freestanding under the EU directive and the
employment regulations. The fact that employees in the private

the basis of race and, now, religion is not an argument that public
authorities should be allowed to discriminate disproportionately
without justification. That is not an effective argument against the
risk of incompatibility that the Joint Committee set out. If the
Charity Commission, as a public body performing the public function of
deciding which organisations are charitable, discriminates without
justification against someone on the basis of their religion or
belief&#151;in the words of the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;it will
be liable under a claim on that basis.</p><p><a name="06102570001035">The Government have said
nothing to justify the statement on the Bill that it complies with the
human rights legislation. The Minister said that there would have to be
a separate consultation because the process will be different. The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) argued that the
distinction was necessary because rational belief systems would more
easily pass a public benefit test and, therefore, non-rational belief
systems, such as religious ones&#151;he said that
non-judgmentally&#151;would require a light touch public benefit
test. That would be discriminatory, in a sense, and there would
therefore be a good case under the Human Rights Act 1998 for
discrimination. Just because someone has a rational point of view, they
should not be made to pass an extra test. The fact that the harbour
charity in his constituency took two years to gain charitable status is
to be regretted, but it is not the right comparator for the point that
I made.</p><p><a name="06102570001036">The difficulty
for those of us who support the amendment&#151;the Minister will note
that some Labour Members do so&#151;is that the Government have not
come up with a principled justification for treating non-religious
organisations differently from religious ones, despite three warnings
from the Joint Committee that they need to address the issue. I accept
the spirit in which the Minister made his remarks, but the only
concession that he has made confirms that the process will be
different. In a sense, that is the last thing that we wanted to hear.
With that in mind, it is my intention to test the opinion of the House
on the issue, because the Government will need to be able to show that
they have taken that view. I apologise for detaining the House on the
matter, but it is a key point of principle.</p><p><a name="06102570001037"><i> Question put, </i>That the

right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss
Widdecombe) to speak to the amendment. I am sure that if she catches
your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, she will have the opportunity
to speak, but I acknowledge that many Members would have preferred that
she do so now.</p><p><a name="06102570001560">There
are two purposes only to the amendment, and both encompass the removal
from the Bill of the presumption that the advancement of religion is a
charitable activity. The first purpose, raised by some of my right hon.
and hon. Friends, is to question whether the Charity Commission is
willing or able to apply the right public benefit test to religions.
The second is to ask whether it is possible for certain religions to
pass that test.</p><p><a name="06102570001561">In
Committee, we discussed three different activities in the same debate:
education, the relief of poverty and the advancement of religion. Under
the Bill, each of those activities loses the presumption of public
benefit. It was accepted that the public benefit test varies from group
to group. Despite the fact that all those activities have enjoyed the
presumption of public benefit, some charities have none the less had to
demonstrate public benefit, so public benefit tests vary from group to
group. This debate will give us the opportunity to concentrate solely
on religion.</p><p><a name="06102570001562">In
Committee, I said:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_48"><a name="06102570001765"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am told
that...it is not those who engage in religious practices who are
the public who benefit; the public benefit is the benefit that they
bring to society by rubbing shoulders with those who do not so
engage...people who engage in religious practices are presumed to
become more moral and altruistic as a result, so the public at large
benefit when they mix with such people.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official

that the good works done by many religious groups depend greatly on
their belief? The amendment would certainly endanger that activity, and

Horwood:</b> The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr.

Turner:</b> Such wonderful work is indeed being done, but not
all religious charities undertake it. Some religious charities pray,
and that is the key: how can it be demonstrated that prayer is of
public benefit? I find it difficult to understand how, rationally, in
the face of a reasonably sceptical, but not hostile, group of charity
commissioners, a religious organisation that prays can demonstrate that
prayer has public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06102570001569"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew291"><a name="06102570003087">Mr.

Gentleman used the word &#147;pray&#148;, but he did not spell it
for us. Would he not accept that there are some people and
organisations that prey, and that a distinction must therefore be made
between them and organisations that pray? The common-sense approach
would be to allow the Charity Commission to consider the question of
public
benefit.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_12"><a name="06102570001802">4.15

Turner:</b> Curiously, I think that the right hon. Gentleman
is wrong. There are of course some who prey. The Scientologists, for
example, have not crept through the current definition. They do not
count as a charity under the current law, under which religions enjoy
the presumption of charitable status. I do not think, therefore, that
the fact that some charities may prey is sufficient
argument.</p><p><a name="06102570001571"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew293"><a name="06102570003089">Bob

my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald believes
that; I am sure that many right hon. and hon. Members believe it. The
question is how that belief can be translated into proof that will
satisfy a reasonably sceptical audience, and the charity commissioners
may in this context be regarded as a reasonably sceptical audience. I

respect of medical treatment has been put to the test in a series of
trials&#151;of varying quality, it must be said&#151;and the
overall analysis is that there is no significant difference in the
prayed-for group and the non-prayed-for group of patients recovering
from an operation, regardless of whether they knew that they were being
prayed for. If anything, there was a finding, which was not
significant, that the prayed-for group did worse. So it can be tested
objectively, and so far, at least in that field, there has been found
to be no benefit to others, although of course it may help the
pray-ers.</p><br>

misunderstanding the current status of religion in charity law. Prayer
of itself, even under the current presumption, does not qualify a
religious charity for charitable status. That is why closed orders are
not currently charitable. There is only a presumption of public
benefit; in some cases it still has to be proved. So, in restoring the
current status he would not be allowing religious charities that only
pray to achieve charitable status anyway.</p><p><a name="06102570001578"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew300"><a name="06102570003096">Mr.

the Day&#148;, which I rather enjoy, this morning, but I feel that I
have more than made up for it by listening to some of the interesting
contributions over the past half an hour. I am inspired by the Prime
Minister&#146;s assertion that we are best when we are boldest and it
is in that spirit that I want to discuss amendment No. 1. I always
think that having amendment No. 1 shows a certain keenness. Together
with various progressively minded colleagues in the House, I tabled the
amendment in July. I cannot say that I have checked the wording with
No. 10, but, in a modest sort of way, it is in the audacious spirit
that the Prime Minister calls on his Ministers to
display.</p><p><a name="06102570001584">The
amendment does not attempt to define public benefit; it merely attempts
to ensure a robust application of that test of public benefit by the
Charity Commission. For the first time, it would give the Charity
Commission a statutory base to consider questions of access to public
benefit, undue restrictions, and charges&#151;in some cases fairly
high charges&#151;made by charities in return for their services. The
supporters of the amendment are not trying to say that, for example,
independent schools should not be able to claim charitable status. We
are saying, as I said on Second Reading, and as we say in Yorkshire,
&#147;You shouldn&#146;t get summat for nowt.&#148; The value
that independent schools, for example, get from their charitable status
is &#163;100 million. We would just like the Charity Commission to be
able to encourage them to provide more community benefit for that
charitable status.</p><p><a name="06102570001585">I
congratulate the Minister on being open to discussions on the Bill over
the summer and the autumn. I think that he will argue, among other
things, that the amendment is unnecessary because the sentiments that
it upholds are already incorporated in the concept of public benefit

questions of undue restrictions. I want to put three points before the
House to explain why I am doubtful

help to reassure me on some of those doubts.</p><p><a name="06102570001586">First, there is the legal base
of charity law. Without detaining the House for long, I think that most
lawyers would say that the available case law is pretty sparse. Andrew
Phillips, an eminent charity lawyer, wrote a few paragraphs that sum
that up:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_51"><a name="06102570001768"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
the Charity Commission lawyers know only too well, at the very best the
absence of any inclusion in the Bill of wording indicating the scope of
the Public Benefit test will leave the Commission in very uncertain
legal terrain when they confront, as they surely will, a few unreformed
and intransigent charity hospitals and
schools.</p></ul><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_52"><a name="06102570001769"><ul><p class="tabletext">Unless
Parliament remedies that&#151;and a modest amendment will be enough
to give the judges clear discretion&#151;the government are spoiling
their own reform, which is potentially a valuable
one.</p></ul><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_53"><a name="06102570001770"><ul><p class="tabletext">The legal
reality, in the absence of that, is that the existing, limited case
law, particularly Re Resch, leans in favour of an undemanding public
interest test, making clear that there is likely to be sufficient
public benefit if, for example, a hospital or school relives the
exchequer and alternative state provisions, or indeed if it provides
extra facilities for the
user.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001587">What
about the Charity Commission&#151;the regulator&#151;itself? It has
had a slightly ambiguous attitude towards my amendment. Andrew Hind,
its chief executive, spoke of a &#147;worrying lack of
clarity&#148; in the underlying case law, and he confirmed that
phrase to me in a conversation just a couple of weeks ago. Geraldine
Peacock, who was chair of the commission, said that overriding any
public school&#146;s charitable status would not be possible because
the Bill would not alter decisions based on case law. However, the new
chair of the commission, Dame Suzi Leather, has taken a different
approach. She says that she will apply the test robustly and has talked
about holding seminars with stakeholders in which there will be a
discussion of contemporary social mores, as she puts its, and the way
in which public benefit might be defined in the modern day. Although
the question of precisely how contemporary social mores would weigh in
the balance against the weight of case law was somewhat left hanging in
the air at the parliamentary briefing last week, I acknowledge that
there are tensions&#151;perhaps creative tensions&#151;in the
commission.</p><p><a name="06102570001588">What
about the voluntary sector? It, too, has taken a somewhat ambiguous
position. When the amendment was tabled, Stuart Etherington, chief
executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, warmly
welcomed it. He said that it would ensure clarity. He
said:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_54"><a name="06102570001771"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We hope
that the government accepts this amendment or comes forward with its
own amendment, agreed with the Charity
Commission.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001589">Campbell
Robb, director of public policy of the NCVO, went further. As late as
September, he wrote in <i> Charity Finance

to uphold public trust and confidence in the charity. To this end we

benefit, especially in areas where high fees are being

not affect all the various charitable bodies whose work is directed
towards particular groups, whether they have worked in a particular

It will be the job of the Charity Commission to decide, case by case,
whether a charity is worthy of that status. Nothing in my amendment and
nothing that is suggested by the Government will take away from that
responsibility. Many charities charge high fees, including one that has
been mentioned to me, which deals with autistic children. Clearly, such
charities provide a public benefit, and the Charity Commission will be
able to make that assessment.</p><br>

that undue restriction is inherent in the concept of public benefit,
and the Charity Commission can already make such a judgment, but he
cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue on the one hand that the
concept of public benefit assumes that the Charity Commission is able
to weigh these matters, and on the other hand suggest that if the Bill
is more explicit, it will lead to unintended
consequences.</p><p><a name="06102570001598">Having
expressed my doubts about my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s
position, I shall pose three questions to him, which might help to
clarify matters. First, does he agree that the Charity Commission can
and should consider matters of undue restriction and level of fees
charged when it considers whether a particular charity passes the
public benefit test?</p><p><a name="06102570001599">Secondly, what sort of public
benefit should fee-paying schools, especially independent schools,
provide to demonstrate their charitable status? Would a token sharing
of playing fields, or even an expansion of scholarships on a selective
basis&#151;contemporary social mores in all parties are against an
expansion of selection&#151;be enough? Should there not be a real
sharing of resources and perhaps of teaching time with the wider
community? That was suggested by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Education and Skills in a seminal speech in July, when he
told the national youth
parliament:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_56"><a name="06102570001773"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
want to ensure that private schools work more closely with the state
sector, sharing facilities and expertise; with the private
schools&#146; greater resources doing much more to improve the life
chances of all the children in their
community.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001600">Finally,
the coalition between the NCVO and the Charity Commission in July,
which fairly unambiguously supported the clause, has somewhat
fractured. There is now division, with some supporting my hon. Friend
and some taking a different view and supporting the amendment.
Sometimes the best one can hope for in politics is to live to fight
another day. I hope my hon. Friend is right and the public benefit test
will be robust, as it is set out in the Bill. If not, I understand that
there will be a review in three years. Will the review explicitly cover
the issue of undue restriction and whether the Charity Commission has
in practice been able to take that into account when making its
determinations?</p><p><a name="06102570001601">I have
two other things to say. I reflect that it may be only once every
quarter of a century that the House grapples with charity law and
public benefit tests. If the review in three years shows that there is
a need to revisit the concept of public benefit, it will require a
particularly determined Minister to do that. I received a letter from
Christopher Price, who was a Labour MP in the 1970s. He refers to a
Commons Select Committee in 1974 that unanimously recommended a robust
test of public benefit. The Committee concluded that that
recommendation</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_57"><a name="06102570001774"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;accords
both with the spirit in which many of our sixteenth century public
schools were founded and with a widespread feeling today that
charitable activities should not be manifestly devoted to privilege or
exclusiveness. We would therefore expect that our new test of
&#145;purposes beneficial to the community&#146; would only admit
to charitable status those institutions which manifestly devote the
education they provide towards meeting a range of clear educational
needs throughout the whole community.&#148;</p></ul><br>

remarks is wrong. The proposal that I mentioned was straightforwardly
for a babies&#146; hospice. It had nothing to do with the law or
changes in it. It was a case of guilt by association. If the Charity
Commission is swayed in such a way when a protection is built in, I
believe that its removal will enhance that effect, and that religious
charities that do not necessarily keep up with &#147;modern
society&#148; in some of their teaching will be
disadvantaged.</p><p><a name="06102570001623">The
hon. Gentleman also said that the two phrases that the Charity
Commission used do not appear on the face of the Bill. That is true.
However, when determining whether the law is right, we need to examine
the context in which it has been devised. The two phrases that I cited
constituted the Charity Commission&#146;s reasoning for wanting to
remove the presumption in favour of religious charities. It has stated
its reasoning, which Government Front Benchers have never disowned. We
should therefore be alert to how the Charity Commission will apply the
law if the protection is removed. I do not believe that the commission
should be in the business of adjudicating on religious beliefs.
Removing the presumption creates the risk that it will do
that.</p><p><a name="06102570001624"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew315"><a name="06102570003111">Mr.

the hon. Gentleman says that I have not advanced a reason why religion

easily testable by direct public benefit criteria. Therefore, to have a
presumption in its favour is the right starting point. If it can then
be shown that the activities of that charity are undesirable&#151;as
was the case with Abu Hamza, for example&#151;under existing law,
although the protection is still in place, it can be removed. The

the issue of public benefit goes to the heart of what the Bill is
about. The measure under discussion is easily the most significant
change made by the legislation, and I also think that it is the most
controversial. It is certainly the topic on which the House and the

demands the greatest

However, I do not think that his amendment is right or workable. My
hon. Friend the Minister, who has already gone some way toward
addressing the concerns not just of Labour Members or Members of this

to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), that I am
at a loss to understand what the Opposition&#146;s position is on
public benefit, having listened at length&#151;I also listened to him
at length on Second Reading&#151;to his somewhat tortuous and
occasionally toe-curlingly embarrassing attempt to avoid the question
of whether the Opposition support the concept. If he gets an
opportunity to do so, perhaps he will clarify the Opposition&#146;s
position. If I may, I shall offer a small piece of political advice. I
should have expected a party that nowadays seeks to claim that mantle
of modernity&#151;notwithstanding the concerns of the right hon.
Member for Maidstone and The Weald about the modern world&#151;to
welcome with no ambiguity what most people think is a long overdue
modernisation of charity law.</p><p><a name="06102570001645">If we can
get the public benefit test right, as I believe we can, it could
clarify an area of charity law that every Member knows fine well has
been greatly disputed for many centuries, including in the courts.
Perhaps even more importantly, it would introduce a healthy dose of
common sense into a complex area of charity law. We have to face a very
simple fact: what the public think of as a charity and what we define
in law as a charity are sometimes at variance. That is why, when asked,
only 15 per cent. of the public believe, for example, that a charity
such as Tate Modern is indeed a charity. Even fewer believe that Eton
is, or indeed should be, a charity&#151;but it is.</p><p><a name="06102570001646">So there are issues that we
must address, not least in order to sustain what my hon. Friend the
Member for Slough rightly called the charity brand, and its reputation
now and in future. To be frank, it is in any case right that charitable
status, since it accrues significant benefits, should be earned and not
simply assumed. After all, organisations that are charities enjoy high
levels of public support precisely because they are assumed to provide
a meaningful benefit to the public. So in that sense, the good name of
charities is at least as important as their good works.</p><p><a name="06102570001647">There is a further important
consideration&#151;a financial consideration&#151;which my hon.
Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) touched on in an
intervention a moment ago. Charities do notjust receive
generous donations from the public individually; they also receive
pretty generous financial support from the public collectively. For
example, in the latest tax year charities attracted tax relief worth
almost &#163;1.9 billion, which is a pretty significant pot of public
expenditure. Nowadays, nobody&#151;perhaps with the exception of the
hon. Member for Isle of Wight; I do not know&#151;expects public
money to be doled out like a free good. It rightly comes with some
strings attached. The public have the right to know what they are
getting out for what they are putting in. Charities cannot be exempt
from those
disciplines.</p><p><a name="06102570001648"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew326"><a name="06102570003122">Mr.
Beith:</b> Can the right hon. Gentleman not see that there is
an inherent difficulty in applying the concept of earning charity
relief to religion? The situation is more straightforward in education,
for example, where the extent of public benefit can be shown. That is
different from a state agency&#146;s having to decide which religious
groups earn, by virtue of their theological views and actions, the
status of a charity.</p><br>

this reassures the hon. Gentleman&#151;that the Joint Committee took
evidence from a variety of Army-related and military-related charities,

recommendations to Government. Incidentally, the Government addressed
many of our recommendations in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102570001654">Although much of the debate has
centred on the issue of religion, I think that the trickiest issue,
certainly politically, has been that of charitable private schools and
hospitals, which sit in the middle of a pretty uncomfortable triangle.
On one side, they are bound by their obligations as charities, because
they have charitable status. On another side, obviously, they owe
obligations to the fee-paying parents and patients who provide the
overwhelming bulk of their income. On the third side, they have wider
obligations to taxpayers, who fund the estimated &#163;100
million-worth, I think, of tax relief that they enjoy as a consequence
of their charitable status. Some may have seen the Bill as an
opportunity to resolve those tensions by exacting some sort of
ideological revenge on such private schools and hospitals by stripping
them of both their financial benefits and their charitable status. I do
not think that that is the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for
Selby, and it certainly is not mine. I am a long-term advocate of
partnerships between the public and private sectors.</p><br>

charities that charge fees for their services have a special obligation
to prove that they can none the less provide a wider public benefit. I,
for one, very much welcome the initiatives that many private schools,
for example, have taken in recent years to develop meaningful
partnerships with state schools. The problem is that while some have an
exemplary record, others, sadly, do not. Under the current law,
however, all benefit equally from charitable status. That, as
Mr. Jonathan Shepherd of the Independent Schools
Council&#151;which represents more than 1,000 private schools in this
country&#151;wrote in a letter to me dated 22 June,</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_63"><a name="06102570001780"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has sheltered lazy charities

get the new public benefit test right, rather than using it to drive a
wedge between public and state schools, I believe that it could help
drive them still closer together. The worry that some have, including
my hon. Friend the Member for Selby and those who have put their names
to his amendment&#151;to some extent I share it&#151;is that
without a clear definition, public benefit could end up being
interpreted as requiring nothing more from private schools or hospitals
than the offer of some form of indirect or tokenistic public benefit.
For example, they could argue that they save the taxpayer money by
educating children or treating patients who would otherwise be taught
in state schools or treated in NHS
hospitals.</p><p><a name="06102570001657">Surely
meaningful public benefit must be more than that&#151;and I would
argue that it must also be more than the odd sharing of a classroom
here or a playing field there. Ideally, it should be a lasting
partnership that enables many more state school pupils, regardless of
background, aptitude or ability, to benefit from the expertise and
resources that private schools often, although not always, have at
their disposal. That, after all, is the declared purpose of both
Government policy and private schools, as represented by the

there refers to the need to ensure that charities are not
&#147;unduly restrictive&#148; in the way in which they guarantee
public benefit, so allowing a balanced consideration of benefits
against disbenefits. The amendment, however, refers to &#147;any
undue restriction&#148;, which I think would make such a balanced
judgment more difficult to achieve. Indeed, I should be surprised if
that wording did not cause a learning disability charity that none the
less charged for its services to find itself failing the public benefit
test, thereby risking the loss of its charitable status. I am sure that
my hon. Friend would not want ambiguous wording to produce such a
result.</p><p><a name="06102570001662">I do not
believe that my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment does the trick. My hon.
Friend the Minister has moved the Bill forward substantially, but
although the proposal to review the operation of the law after three
years rather than five is welcome, I do not think that it does the
trick either. To me it seems rather like closing the stable door after
the horse has bolted.</p><p><a name="06102570001663">The Bill gives us an
opportunity to deal with charity law. My hon. Friend is right: it is a
once-in-a-generation opportunity. It is a rare event for charity law to
be changed by Parliament&#151;I believe that the last occasion was 15
years ago, and the penultimate occasion was probably 20 years before
that&#151;and unless my hon. Friend knows something that I do not
know about proposals for legislative changes in the future, I should be
surprised if we are given another crack of the whip in the imminent
future. So we need to get the public benefit provision right
now.</p><p><a name="06102570001664">That is what led
the Joint Committee to conclude that</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_65"><a name="06102570001782"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;while a detailed statutory
definition of public benefit would be too inflexible, nonetheless there
is a need for a more explicit definition of public benefit in
connection with the Bill&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001665">And of course clause 4 requires the
Charity Commission to issue guidance for that purpose. The problem is
that we do not have the guidance before us today, so it is difficult
for the House to know exactly what it is being asked to
support.</p><p><a name="06102570001666">Indeed, I was
struck by an article by Dame Suzi Leather, the new chair of the Charity
Commission, in <i> The Guardian </i>last week in which she argued that
the public benefit test was a &#147;slippery concept&#148;. That is
not to say that, having spoken to Dame Suzi, I am in any doubt about
her determination to see the public benefit test applied
vigorously&#151;a view that the National Council for Voluntary

article that fee-charging charities could be expected</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_66"><a name="06102570001783"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to assess and report the value of
the tangible benefits they bring as well as the value of their tax
breaks.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001667">I welcome that.
It is a significant step towards clarity in how the public benefit test
will be applied, but there is many a slip twixt cup and lip, as the
House knows. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, in
replying to the debate, can give a very clear indication as to whether
he agrees with Dame Suzi&#146;s proposal and how, more generally, he
expects public benefit to operate in practice.</p><p><a name="06102570001668">Short of a Government
amendment, which we do not have, it is important for the Minister to
put the Government&#146;s intention on the record, not least so that
the Charity Commission and the courts are left in no doubt that public
benefit is intended to be direct and meaningful. If he can do that, he
can kill several birds with one stone. First, he will bring clarity and
certainty&#151;important for the whole sector, which we want to
grow&#151;to a vital modernisation of charity law. Secondly, that
could help to foster more real partnerships between the public and the
private sector in health and education, for the benefit of both
patients and pupils. Thirdly, he will be able to offer many of us the
assurances that we need to give our wholehearted support to this part
of the Bill, just as we already do to the rest of it.</p><p><a name="06102570001669">This is a good Bill, which is
long overdue. The introduction of a public benefit test is a very good
thing, which will make a profound difference to the operation of the
charitable sector. I welcome what the Minister and my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster have done thus far; I just ask
them to go that one little bit
further.</p><p><a name="06102570001670"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew332"><a name="06102570003128">Martin
Horwood:</b> As the right hon. Member for Darlington
(Mr. Milburn) has just said, this is a very good Bill and
the concept of public benefit is central to it. Rather than citing
older Charity Commission reports, it is more useful to consider the
commission&#146;s current guidance on how it plans to implement the
Bill in future. The commission&#146;s website, which is a fertile
source of material for this debate, contains a briefing, issued this
month, on the approach to public benefit and how it will be treated.
The commission promises to apply the public benefit test robustly, and
that is welcome. Perhaps I detect the hand of the Minister in that form
of words, which is
welcome.</p><p><a name="06102570001671">The guidance
also contains some slightly more alarming words, which underline the
fact that the issue is a moveable feast&#151;a slippery concept, as
the right hon. Gentleman put it. For example, the briefing contains
what appears to be an entirely new concept of the need for continuing
improvement. It
states:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_67"><a name="06102570001784"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our
aim will be to ensure both that charities demonstrate public benefit in
what they do and, beyond that, continue to increase the value they
bring to the communities they
serve.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001672">That
seems to go beyond the Bill and add a dangerous new dimension, because
it puts an obligation on any charity to prove that it has satisfied the
public benefit test and later to prove that it has increased the public
benefit. That is perhaps a similar example to the one cited by the
right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) on

his mettle in managing the implementation of the public benefit
test.</p><p><a name="06102570001673">The concept is
slippery. As the right hon. Member for Darlington also noted, there are
areas of spectacular confusion, not least in respect of whether the
Bill changes the law on public benefit at all. Many
people&#151;including Liberal Democrats in this House and the other

leading charity lawyers beg to differ. Without some leverage in the
bill, the judges are not free to innovate, especially as the leading
case law endorses the status quo, where the school or hospital can
claim charitable status if it saves the taxpayer money or provides
extra facilities unavailable in the state
sector.&#148;</p></ul><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_16"><a name="06102570001806">5.15

in its current state leaves matters very unclear. The hon. Member for
Selby (Mr. Grogan) said that the NCVO and the Charity
Commission appear to be shifting their ground slightly about whether
further clarification is needed. Earlier this year, the NCVO issued a

I tabled in Committee. It was based on the established Scottish law,
which offers a much clearer way forward, but it was not accepted and we
are now debating the more modest proposal introduced by the hon. Member
for Selby. However, amendment No. 1 at least contains the useful phrase
&#147;undue restriction&#148;, which makes it clear beyond doubt
that the bar is being raised somewhat and that all charities would have
to earn their charitable status. The amendment would require the word
&#147;charity&#148; to be unequivocal, and that no charity could
take advantage of a status quo that allows all sorts of bodies to
retain their charitable status without having to change in response to
the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102570001681"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew337"><a name="06102570003133">Mr.

support the amendment, so that religion does not have to pass that
test?</p><p><a name="06102570001682"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew338"><a name="06102570003134">Martin

I shall come to amendment No. 126 in due
course.</p><p><a name="06102570001683">I was about to
say that I have consulted some of the outstanding private educational
establishments in my constituency, such as Cheltenham Ladies college,
the National Star College for Disabled Youth, Cheltenham college and
Dean Close school. I tested out the amendment to see whether those
institutions felt that it represented some great threat to their
charitable status, and they all thought that raising the bar was a good
idea. Given their excellent public service record of sharing facilities
with the wider community, they did not believe that it would damage
them, and they also believed it would helpfully raise the bar for
smaller, perhaps less reputable, organisations that were more or less
indistinguishable from businesses in their approach. I am not saying
that there is a large number of them, but raising the bar on public
benefit would help to clarify that such organisations need to act
charitably in order to earn the considerable benefits of charitable
status.</p><p><a name="06102570001684">There is a
good example in my constituency of a small private nursery and
pre-preparatory school that underwent some anxiety about whether it
would pass a stricter public benefit test. It wondered whether it would
be able to share any facilities with the wider community. It was a
problem, as it did not offer scholarships in the requisite age range,
so it had to think hard about the threat of a stricter public benefit
test. In the event, it decided to share music teaching with
neighbouring state schools. That seems an excellent result and it
happened on account of the threat of a test stricter than the status
quo.</p><p><a name="06102570001685">The question
remains whether the Bill in its present form contains such a test. I do
not believe that it does, but I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s comments. I wonder whether he will say that there are
sufficient incentives, either in law or from the commission, to
encourage organisations and institutions such as that school to improve
the quality of their public service.</p><br>

carefully, as ever, to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The
Weald. One of the Bill&#146;s central principles is that it removes
the current archaic definitions of charitable purpose, which date back
to the mediaeval era and are simply no longer fit for
purpose&#151;though I hesitate to use that rather new Labour phrase.
The right hon. Lady said, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke,
don&#146;t fix it&#148;, but the overwhelming consensus in the
charity sector is that current charity law is broke, at least to the
extent that the Bill deals with many areas of charity law and is
designed to reform and improve them. That is precisely why it has had
such widespread support&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member
for Castle Point (Bob Spink) shouts out &#147;Not religion&#148;
from a sedentary position, but I refer him to his colleague in the
other place, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who said in support of a
level playing field for all
charities:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_72"><a name="06102570001789"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What
we have achieved in the Bill is a delicate balance as regards the
public benefit issue. Therefore, for the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, to
talk about blanket advantages in the circumstances is not right. As the
noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, we are in fact creating a level
playing field here, in which all charities have to meet a public
benefit test, no matter what their purposes are, and must do so on a
continuing basis.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>28 June 2005; Vol. 673, c.
154.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102570001687">There is, in effect, no
divine right to charitable status. The National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution, the Royal British Legion, St. John Ambulance, Save the
Children and so forth will all have to pass a public benefit test, and
so will the Churches.</p><p><a name="06102570001688">Some have put forward
thoughtful arguments suggesting that all this will prove detrimental to
the Churches. One such argument is that religion does not have a
provable public benefit. That is, in effect, arguing that because the
charity or organisation is expected to fail the test, it should not
have to take it. As the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and
others have mentioned, it is equally difficult in some circumstances to
imagine how art, sport or even education can provably increase public
benefit&#151;but that is the purpose of case law and the purpose of
the Charity Commission in giving guidance.</p><p><a name="06102570001689">Indeed, help was provided by
the example of humanist organisations earlier. They achieved charitable
status in the end by suggesting that they aided the mental and moral
improvements of mankind. My guess is that most religious charities
would be able to argue robustly that they demonstrated comparable
public benefits. Most accepted world religions set out the golden rule
of doing unto others as they would expect others to do to themselves.
That is clearly to the benefit of the wider community. The example of
the Church of Scientology was also mentioned earlier. It was rejected
under current law by the skin of its teeth, only because it did not
have an act of worship. Without the public benefit test, there would be
a real risk of religious organisations that were undoubtedly religious
but harmful securing charitable status.</p><p><a name="06102570001690">The right hon. Member for
Maidstone and The Weald asked for a specific example of an organisation
that might fail the test. I offer her Satanism, which, under current

third sector and Parliament. It is a welcome
development.</p><p><a name="06102570001702">Many
people in the charity sector and Parliament have engaged with the
question of what public benefit is, and have been tempted to attempt a
more precise definition in law. I, too, have been tempted down that
road; we discussed it in Committee when the Minister engaged positively
with the issue. He has kept his promise to give careful thought to all
the options. The trouble is that it is always possible that the
courts&#151;or, in future, the charity tribunal&#151;will be limp
in how they interpret the intentions of Parliament. Our experience is
that case law in the field of charity is sparse. For that reason, MPs
such as my hon. Friend the Member for Selby understandably ask what the
point is of removing the old presumption and requiring that public
benefit be demonstrated clearly by charities, particularly those that
charge significant fees for entrance, participation or services, if the
requirement does not bite until a judgment is reached in a test case in

sensibly and progressively but without undue delay. The real downside
of choosing to include a more stringent definition is that it would
create a risk of unintended consequences. An enormous amount of
legislation on the statute book was intended to give tight and precise
effect to a definition or requirement, and was supposed to provide
limpid clarity, but turned out to be doubtful at best, or did not stand
the test of time. Animal welfare legislation has been a running sore
for just that
reason.</p><p><a name="06102570001704">Let us face

debate.</p><p><a name="06102570001705">Our discussion
has been worth while, but it has shown that the simple test of public
benefit, if interpreted and applied in the existing legal framework in
a modern context, is the right and simple way forward. Clearly, the
meaning of &#147;modern&#148; will be different in decades and
centuries to come, but the principle is clear. The question is whether
the public benefit test will be applied robustly to charities that have
been able to hide behind the historic presumption, or whether they will
ignore the challenge. The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald
(Miss Widdecombe) is no longer in the Chamber, but I would like to say
to her that, as a Christian, I think that Christian charities should be
subject to the same test as the rest, and we should welcome that. The
use of the public benefit test will depend on how the Charity
Commission interprets the law, and not on how Ministers spell it out,
although the Minister&#146;s reply in this debate will clearly be
important in setting out the basis of Parliament&#146;s
view.</p><p><a name="06102570001706">When it comes
to implementation, the Charity Commission&#146;s view will be
crucial. The commission is accountable to Parliament and the public for
the way in which it interprets its responsibilities. I asked the chief
charity commissioner how she and her advisers envisage their remit once
the Charities Bill reaches the statue book. She had already spelled out
her response to the Bill in the article referred to by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), and I think
that she correctly interpreted Parliament&#146;s intentions. I
particularly liked her comment that the public benefit requirement is a
call to innovate. She is clearly using the Bill as an opportunity to
allow not just Government, Parliament and the commission, but the
sector itself, to explore ideas and principles vigorously in a modern
context. It is important to mention the brief for MPs, which should be
lodged in the Library for future reference, because the notes on how
the public interest requirement will be interpreted by the commission
are extremely important.</p><p><a name="06102570001707">It is clear that organisations
will not suddenly be required, overnight, to demonstrate that they
provide public benefit, or to rethink their priorities, but there is a
clear expectation that charities that previously benefited from the
presumption will engage with the issues and, through their attitudes
and actions, respond to the change in the law. They will need to show
that they provide public benefit but, to be fair, many charities that
operate under the existing presumption already demonstrate that they
provide public benefit. That is the unwritten deal, and the public
clearly understand that charitable status provides reward and
encouragement for those who provide public benefit. Each charity must
simply ask itself whether it provides public benefit in a way that
justifies its charitable status, and whether it shows that benefit
clearly, so that the requirements of transparency and accountability
are met.</p><p><a name="06102570001708">Indirect
benefit is not likely to be enough in itself. The Charity Commission
believes that the law, as it

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1605</b><br>stands, makes it clear that it will not normally be possible to
demonstrate public benefit through indirect benefits alone, such as
savings in public expenditure that result from the charity&#146;s
provision of education or health services. It is therefore clear that
the benefit to the public must generally derive from the
organisation&#146;s primary charitable purposes, rather than any
secondary activity. Charities that were previously presumed to provide
public benefit must show that they satisfy the law, and the Charity
Commission must be satisfied that they have done so. Charities that
charge high fees for their services must take active and transparent
measures to ensure that someone who is eligible to benefit from those
services has a reasonable chanceto do so. It is sensible that
charities should have time to adjust, but it is reasonable to expect
them to engage with the changes.</p><p><a name="06102570001709">The commission&#151;not the
Government&#151;will make the final decisions about charitable status
on a case-by-case basis. Their decisions will depend on the
circumstances of individual fee-charging institutions following the
criteria that I have described. If, after the Bill&#146;s
implementation, the Government&#146;s intentions on public benefit
are not fully reflected in practice, a review of the legislation must
be instigated as soon as parliamentary time allows. In any event, the
Minister has made it clear that a review of the public benefit
requirements will be initiated three years after the Bill&#146;s
implementation.</p><p><a name="06102570001710">I
asked the chief charity commissioner, Dame Suzi Leather, whether I had
interpreted correctly the Bill&#146;s requirements. Would the
commission be reasonable, but firm and robust, in ensuring that all
charities fulfil those requirements in their day-to-day performance in
a realistic period of time? She answered, &#147;Yes&#148;. Only the
presumption was changing and organisations that have not grappled with
the issues until now, because they were not required to do so, must
show they have done so. The change will not be new for the many
charities that have already adapted to the change, which is welcome.
All charities, however, must adapt now that the change in the law has
become
clear.</p><p><a name="06102570001711">The
commission has published on its website an indicative timetable
outlining the steps that it would take to act on the public benefit
requirement following Parliament&#146;s approval of the Bill. That
indicative programme makes clear the commission&#146;s intentions,
and it should be available in the Library so that hon. Members can
refer to it. Provided that the Bill completes its passage in the
expected time scale, in November, the citizens&#146; forum will begin
research on public perceptions and expectations; in January next year,
the commission will launch a three-month consultation; next September,
it will begin a pilot assessment of public benefit, producing detailed
guidance for specific types of charities and consulting on the
guidance; and in summer 2008, it will report progress to
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06102570001712">The chief
charity commissioner stated her understanding that the Bill gives the
commission a clear role in ensuring public trust and confidence in
charity. I believe that that answers the problems raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Selby in his amendment. The commission regards
the public benefit requirement as a key component that makes a clear
and explicit link between public benefit and charitable status, and
which strengthens public confidence in the charity sector. It will
apply the

fee-charging charities will be expected to demonstrate how they provide
benefits.</p><p><a name="06102570001713">I accept
that my hon. Friend the Member for Selby wants to gain as much as
possible from our debate, but I am sure that the response from the
chief charity commissioner, the commission itself and the Minister will
allow him to reach the right place, which is not only as far as the
Minister could go but as far as he should
go.</p><p><a name="06102582000001"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew348"><a name="06102582000570">Bob
Spink:</b> The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)
will agree that there are none so generous as Yorkshire folk. He will
forgive me for providing the more common version of the Yorkshireism
that he cited to the House&#151;&#147;If tha does owt for nowt tha
does it for thissen&#148;. That is the opposite of the selfless work
undertaken by many volunteers for the wonderful charities that we are
seeking to control in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102582000002">Amendment No. 126 is
straightforward as it simply retains the presumption that the
advancement of religion is in the public benefit. The right hon. Member
for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) mentioned common
sense&#151;most people in the country would regard that proposal as
simple common sense. However, the Bill would remove that time-honoured
presumption and therefore represents a major change, and I suggest that
it could seriously damage religious liberties and our traditions and
even damage our benevolent and tolerant society.</p><p><a name="06102582000003">Moreover, the
clause is entirely unwanted, at least by the majority of the public,
who despise political correctness. Under the law as it stands, many
worthwhile religious charities have been registered in the UK, and as
my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss
Widdecombe) said, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix
it.&#148; If a charity, even a religious charity, has been acting
improperly and is found not to be acting in the public benefit, it can
be deregistered. That has happened plenty of times, such as in the case
of Abu Hamza and the Finsbury Park mosque. Under the existing statutory
regime, the Charity Commission has successfully regulated religious
charities and does not, nor should it, challenge or question their
underlying doctrine&#151;but that is what the Bill will inevitably
lead to, and it is wrong. The proposed, more aggressive approach of the
Bill is unnecessary and could be yet another step towards destroying
the traditions of our society.</p><p><a name="06102582000004">As we have heard, the
commission states unequivocally that the public benefit must be
assessed</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_73"><a name="06102582000563"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in the light
of modern conditions&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102582000005">and that keeping up with &#147;modern
society&#148; is required if a charity is not to have its charitable
status revoked. It is the word revoked that is so challenging and
worrying. It means that the intention is to remove charitable status
from some religious charities, and I wonder whether the Minister would
spell out exactly which ones he is thinking of.</p><p><a name="06102582000006">Christian charities, of course,
take guidance from the Bible, written in ancient Israel, but I happen
to believe, and so do many people in the House and in the country, that
that Bible is still as relevant today, and its words as meaningful
today, as they ever were. The Bill gives the commission massively
increased powers. The current commissioners may be good people, but how

future? They will be required to make very subjective judgments about
the ethos and ethics of different religions and religious activities.
As there is nothing in the Bill that sets out any objective criteria
for their judgment, their judgments will be subjective. How can they
decide which religious groups are &#147;beneficial&#148; and which
are not? On what criteria will they base that decision?</p><p><a name="06102582000007">In any event, why should the
commission&#151;or, indeed, the law in interpreting the
Bill&#151;be rational and consistent when even the Government are not
rational and consistent in proposing the Bill? The Government&#146;s
statements on this issue have been confused and contradictory. As we
heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald,
on Second Reading in this House the Minister said that removing the
presumption of public benefit would &#147;raise the bar&#148; on
religious, educational and poverty relief charities, while in Committee
he maintained that</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_74"><a name="06102582000564"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;religious charities and
organisations provide public benefit, and I see no reason why that
should change.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, Standing Committee
A</i>, 5 July 2006; c. 58.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102582000008">Those statements cannot both be true. So
the Minister has himself been inconsistent in presenting the arguments
for his own Bill.</p><p><a name="06102582000009">Time is short, so I shall
curtail my remarks. I believe that we should not inflict this clause on
good people who are simply serving their communities through a
religious charity. Political correctness must not become the new test
of charitable status. I commend amendment No. 126 to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102582000011"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew349"><a name="06102582000571">John
McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> I shall speak for

that, in the best of parliamentary traditions, we have confronted an
issue, and then avoided it and devolved decision making to another
body. That is why I welcomed the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) and wish that he had pursued
it. It would have been a good test of the power of prayer&#151;unless
the Minister fell on his knees.</p><p><a name="06102582000013">Because this is the only
opportunity that we shall have at this stage to influence the guidance,
I would welcome it if the Minister were to read into the record his
concurrence with the views of my right hon. Friends the Members for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) and for Darlington
(Mr. Milburn) and my hon. Friend the Member for Selby,
because in that way we shall assist in shaping that guidance.</p><p><a name="06102582000014">The second critical stage will
be when that guidance is published in 2008. It would be useful to have
an assurance that the guidance will be brought back to the House, at
least for a parliamentary debate in which we can again express our
views. If there is a promise of a three-year review, it would be useful
for that debate to trigger the review, so that it becomes a
parliamentary review rather than one that is again devolved or sent off
to a separate commission. In that way, we will have an assurance that
this is not a once-in-25-years review of the whole process, but an
ongoing process in which Parliament will have a direct and meaningful
role.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_18"><a name="06102582000568">5.45

Widdecombe), my right hon. Friends the Members for Darlington

Michael), and other hon. Members. In the time that I have available, I
want to deal with both amendments.</p><p><a name="06102582000016">First, I want to bring together
the questions of religion and of education, and the central burden of
the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald.
She asked, &#147;Why?&#148; Why should we have the principle that
all charities must pass the test of public benefit, without a
presumption in favour of a few? My answer to her is, fairness. Whether
we are talking about the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, Eton college or a religious charity, all should have to
pass the public benefit test. That seems a pretty basic
principle.</p><p><a name="06102582000017">The right
hon. Lady might say, &#147;I agree with your principle, but I think
that the practice is going to overwhelm the principle. I am really
worried about what this will mean for religious charities.&#148; That
was the second part of her remarks. I hope that I can reassure her on
those points. First, I want to reassure her that removing the
presumption that the advancement of religion provides public benefit is
not intended to lead to a narrowing down of the range of religious
activities that are considered charitable. Nor is the process intended
to be onerous for individual religious institutions.</p><p><a name="06102582000018">The right hon. Lady talked
about social mores. The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood),
not for the first time in my experience, made an excellent speech on
that point. Case law is the foundation of what we are debating in the
Charities Bill and of the legislation on which we are moving forward.
We have not put it all on the record in the Bill because that is simply
not possible&#151;that is the complexity of charity law. Yes, modern
social mores play a role&#151;the courts have determined
that&#151;but the foundation is case law.</p><p><a name="06102582000019"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew351"><a name="06102582000573">Miss
Widdecombe:</b> I appreciate that it will not be a formal
Pepper <i> v. </i>Hart statement, but will the Minister say briefly
whether it is his understanding that the fact that a particular
religion teaches a traditional and certainly non-modern sexual morality
could never be held by the Charity Commission to disqualify that
religion from charitable status? It is as simple as
that.</p><p><a name="06102582000020"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew352"><a name="06102582000574">Edward

assurance. Of course, the Charity Commission has to make a case-by-case
judgment on those points. She is raising a hypothetical example, but of
course it is the case. I thought that her description of what modern
social mores meant suggested a grand conspiracy between ourselves, the
Charity Commission and the whole of the charities
world.</p><p><a name="06102582000021"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew353"><a name="06102582000575">Miss

in modern social mores, somehow a religious charity is ruled out. I
hope that that gives the right hon. Lady the reassurance that she
wants.</p><br>

reassure the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald on the point
of principle. I also want to reassure her that the burdens will not be
onerous for religious charities. As with all charities, public benefit
has two dimensions. First, there must be an identifiable benefit.
Secondly, it must be accessible not only to the adherents of a
particular religion, but to the wider community. However, the
Government, the courts and the Charity Commission have recognised that
religious activities bring benefits not only to those who take part in
them, but to the whole of society. Religion has an important role to
play in society through faith and worship, motivating charitable giving
and contributing in other ways to stronger communities. Both those
dimensions will thus usually be apparent from the doctrines, beliefs
and practices of a religion. The Charity Commission is clear that most
established religions should not have any difficulty in demonstrating
their value to society from their
beliefs.</p><p><a name="06102582000026"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew357"><a name="06102582000579">Andrew

Miliband:</b> I apologise for not giving way to the hon.
Gentleman, but I need to make
progress.</p><p><a name="06102582000028">The
commission has already begun discussions with the major religions of
our country precisely to give them reassurance. I hope that the right
hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald will accept my reassurance,
too.</p><p><a name="06102582000029">I am pleased that
my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) has tabled
amendment No. 1 because it gives us the chance to talk about another
aspect of public benefit. On Second Reading, I set out several
principles of the Government&#146;s approach to the charitable status
of fee-charging institutions, including private schools, and I want to
reiterate them today. I say in passing to the right hon. Member for
Maidstone and The Weald that while I think that the bar will be raised,
especially for fee-charging institutions that were not subject to the
scrutiny of the Charity Commission because of the presumption, I do not
believe that I said the words that she attributed to me. However,
perhaps we can take that up on another
occasion.</p><p><a name="06102582000030">Our first
principle is that all charities must passthe public benefit
test and be continually tested on that by the Charity Commission. The
removal of the presumption will lead to that big change. The
presumption meant not that there was no public benefit test in all
circumstances, but that existing charities were not scrutinised by the
commission. The measure is designed to bring about consistency, as the
commission has confirmed. The history of this is that when the register
of charities was established in 1960, private schools were
automatically put on it if they had previously been granted charitable
tax relief by the Inland
Revenue.</p><p><a name="06102582000031">Our second
principle is that indirect benefit&#151;the claim that private
schools save money for the taxpayer by educating pupils, for
example&#151;should not be

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1610</b><br>enough to justify charitable status. That is right, and the view is
shared by not only Labour and Liberal Democrat Members, but the
Independent Schools Council, which says that indirect benefit savings
to the taxpayer should not be enough, given that private schools enjoy
the benefits that come with charitable
status.</p><p><a name="06102582000032">Some hon.
Members asked what private schools will have to provide&#151;my hon.
Friend the Member for Selby asked whether token benefits would be
enough. The Charity Commission will have to make a case-by-case
examination, but reassurance is available on the point of principle.
The commission said in its briefing earlier this
week:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_75"><a name="06102582000565"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It will
not normally be possible to demonstrate public benefit through indirect
benefits alone, such as savings in public
expenditure&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102582000033">The schools
must thus normally provide direct benefits. However, can those benefits
be simply for wealthy people who can afford the fees? Again, the
commission&#146;s briefing helpfully indicates the way in which it
wants to move forward. It
says:</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_76"><a name="06102582000566"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Charities
which charge relatively high fees must demonstrate accessibility to
those facilities or
services&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102582000034">Even at this
late stage, I hope that when the hon. Member for Isle of Wight winds up
the debate, he will announce the Conservative party&#146;s conversion
to such a basic principle of
fairness.</p><p><a name="06102582000035">The benefits
will need to be extended beyond the narrow class of people who are able
to afford fees and it is unlikely that a token provision will be
sufficient. To answer a question asked by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Darlington, the Government believe that the benefits should
be direct and meaningful. Generally, we believe that a school that does
a range of things to widen access through partnerships with state
schools and educational initiatives in the local community&#151;I pay
tribute to the many private schools that do this&#151;will find it
easier to demonstrate a public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06102582000036">Our third
principle is that the Bill will raise the bar for private schools. I
tell the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald that the key
point is that this is about fee-charging institutions that previously
benefited from the presumption that charitable status was automatically
conferred on them. That is why I do not believe&#151;if I said this,
I misspoke&#151;that the bar will be raised for religious charities
or charities dealing with poverty. This raising of the bar relies on a
Charity Commission with a robust plan to implement it, as the Charity
Commission has shown. It is embarking on a worthwhile process,
involving the development of principles around the implementation of
public benefit. It has promised to look specifically at the
fee-charging sector, and it will consult the public about their
attitudes. In the case of fee-charging charities, there has not been a
directly relevant case for almost40 years, as we heard, so the
commission is right to develop its approach by consulting the public,
taking account of the passage of time since <i> re</i> Resch. The Bill
seeks to establish confidence in the charity
brand.</p><p><a name="06102582000037">The fourth
principle of the Government&#146;s approach&#151;again, this is
important&#151;is that it is for the Charity Commission to take
individual decisions about particular institutions. This is necessary
because a rural private school miles from a neighbouring state school

urban private school, for example. Similarly, the private school for
disabled children or those with learning difficulties, which my right
hon. Friend the Member for Darlington mentioned, may face different
pressures, compared with other types of private schools.</p><p><a name="06102582000038">All those differences need to
be taken into account by the commission. That has made framing a
specific amendment to the Bill hard, as has been found by many hon.
Members who have tried to do so. The dilemma is between an amendment so
wide as to add little to existing law or so precise as to have
unintended effects. Over the summer we considered the matter and we
were not able to find an amendment that satisfied all the
demands.</p><p><a name="06102582000039">The amendment
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Selby, if I may say so, falls
into the first category. It does not add to the existing law. His
amendment states that in determining whether a body provides public
benefit, regard must be had to</p><a name="61025-0004.htmbrev_77"><a name="06102582000567"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any undue restriction on
obtaining that
benefit&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102582000040">The nature of
the public benefit test, though, is that charitable status is not

Friend said in a recent letter explaining his amendment that the
Charity Commission should have to weigh public benefit provided by the
school against the restricted access to those benefits. I agree with
that, as I have said. From our point of view, the amendment is
unnecessary, but we want to see proper implementation of the
principles. That is why we will review the effect of the public benefit
provisions not five years, but three years after implementation, and if
they are not having the intended effect and are failing to raise the
bar, we will consider all necessary options. My hon. Friend is
concerned to ensure that regard must be had to any undue restriction on
benefits. As I have made clear, this is part of the public benefit
test. It will be part of the review to determine whether our intentions
have been met.</p><p><a name="06102582000042">This is

is about religion. Most religions contain beliefs and values that
positively affect the relations of believers to their society and to
their fellow man. The tangible results of that are much more difficult
to prove than results such as poverty reduction or the advancement of
education. For that reason, I was happy to move amendment No. 126 and

Minister for the Cabinet Office (Hilary Armstrong):</b> The
Bill underpins a vibrant and exciting sector, which has a huge growth
rate. Since it was conceived, nearly 30,000 new charities have been
registered, along with more than 30,000 linked charities. In total,
charities spend over &#163;30 billion a year on good causes, and
employ more than 600,000 people. There are more than 1 million trustees
for such organisations&#151;volunteers who give up their time, and
money from their own pockets, to help others. Many Members are involved
in charities and causes that are dear to our hearts. It is up to us to
ensure that they are regulated in a modern, efficient and
easy-to-understand
manner.</p><p><a name="06102588000012">Although there
has been lively and thorough debate about some of the more
controversial areas, there seems to be a consensus in the House, in the
sector, and among the public at large, that the Bill is a good thing.
All Members in this House and Members in another place agreed that the
legislation governing charities needed to be updated, and it has been
reassuring to know that we were all working towards the same
ends.</p><p><a name="06102588000013">The Charities
Bill has been working its way through both Houses for rather a long
time. It was conceived in 2002 in the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy
unit and has been mentioned in no fewer than three Queen&#146;s
Speeches. Between both Houses, it has enjoyed over 80 hours of debate,
and it was considered in draft by a Joint Committee that was ably
chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington
(Mr. Milburn). Therefore, I think that we can safely say
that it has been well
scrutinised.</p><p><a name="06102588000014">The Bill
provides, for the first time in English law, a full statutory
definition of charity and charitable purposes. In doing so, it removes
the centuries-old presumption that some purposes&#151;relief of
poverty, education and religion&#151;are for the public benefit.
Removal of that presumption will not cancel the charitable status of
poverty relief, or of educational or religious charities. But it will
require those charities to show that they provide a public benefit,
instead of that being simply taken for granted. That will put those
charities on the same footing as all other charities, which already
have to

that&#151;I am trying to bring the House together&#151;but my hon.
Friend makes a valid point. Many Labour Members have long sought to get
international work on to the political agenda, and this Government are
very proud of the fact that we have indeed got international
development firmly on to the agenda. Indeed, even Opposition Front
Benchers now want to support such efforts, so, despite what was said in
the other place, we have seen real progress on that front in recent
years.</p><p><a name="06102588000019">The Bill will
put religious and educational charities and those dealing with poverty
relief on the same footing as other charities, which already have to
show, before they can be accepted as charities, that they provide a
public benefit. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward
Miliband) spelt out on Report the Government&#146;s view of public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06102588000020"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew365"><a name="06102588000175">Andrew

Lady confirmed that, as her colleague Lord Bassam of Brighton said in
the Lords on 3 February 2005, the proselytising activities of religious
charities will still be deemed to be a public benefit. In Committee on
4 July, the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) said
that he could offer reassurance so far as missionary work was
concerned. Given that the Charity Commission will interpret these
matters, I should like the right hon. Lady to put it on the record that
proselytising activity will still be deemed to be a public

well as putting public benefit at its heart, the Bill gives the Charity
Commission a new objective of promoting public awareness of, and
understanding of, the public benefit requirement. The commission will
have to prepare, consult on and issue guidance on public benefit. That
guidance will explain how the commission intends to go about ensuring

that do not. We know that the commission is determined to apply the
public benefit requirement with appropriate
rigour.</p><p><a name="06102588000023">These changes
are intended to reaffirm public benefit as the foundation of charity,
and we are confident that they will. Over the years following the
Bill&#146;s enactment, we expect charities, especially those whose
claim to be for the public benefit is in doubt, to expand the public
benefits that they provide and to become increasingly transparent in
explaining publicly the range and quantity of those benefits. Those are
our intentions and expectations.</p><p><a name="06102588000024">Under the Bill, we will have a
duty to review the operation of the Act and to report to Parliament. We
are in negotiations about which Select Committee will take
responsibility for activities under the Bill and other activities that
have recently come into our Department. The review will consider
whether the changes to public benefit and the definition of charity
more widely are meeting the expectations of the Government, Parliament,
the charitable sector and the public. If we find that expectations are
not being met, we will consider what action needs to be taken to put
things back on track. We are required to start the review within five
years of the Bill becoming law, but we are free to carry it out sooner,
and I am happy to commit the Government to review that part of the
legislation within three years. Defining the nature and scope of
charity, and the requirements for charitable status, is of fundamental
importance. We intend to get it right for the long term.</p><p><a name="06102588000025">I thank the Committee,
including its Chairmen, the hon. Member for North Thanet

the House.</p><p><a name="06102588000030">Given the
length of the Bill&#146;s life, it is also important to acknowledge
the contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Wythenshawe and
Sale, East(Paul Goggins) and for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) as
the Ministers in charge of the Bill during this and previous Sessions,
and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr.
Milburn) in chairing the Joint Committee that scrutinised the draft
Bill. I have mentioned my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak, but I
also thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth (Alun Michael) who assisted me and my hon. Friend the
Parliamentary Secretary in our thinking on the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102588000031">I also thank the Charity
Commission for its invaluable contribution to the Bill. Charity is at
the heart of the Bill. A strong charitable sector is a sign of a
healthy society, and it is our duty to maintain a safe, modern
regulatory structure to surround it. The Charities Bill is a
much-needed update to charity legislation, and I commend it to the

Andrew Turner:</b> I thank the right hon. Lady for her kind
words addressed to me and my hon. Friends on the Committee. I agree
that the Bill has had the longest gestation of any of which I am aware.
It has been scrutinised in the House of Lords twice and in this place
once and a bit, as well as being scrutinised by the Joint Committee, of
which the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) was
Chairman. I came to it late, and the Parliamentary Secretary came to it
even later. At various points during the Committee stage we may have
formed the view that we should not have started here, but here is where
we did start, and I think that we have reached a satisfactory
destination.</p><p><a name="06102588000033">I am
particularly grateful for the reassurances from the Minister for the
Cabinet Office about scrutiny. The Charity Commission will be an
enormously strong and powerful quango that, as my hon. Friends have
pointed out, will have power to revoke or indeed grant charitable
status. There are concerns about how it will exercise that power, and
it is good to know that a Select Committee will scrutinise it. I wish
the right hon. Lady well in her discussions with Committee
Chairmen.</p><p><a name="06102588000034">Let me first
thank the Parliamentary Secretary. It was a pleasure to work with a
Minister who listened carefully and sought honestly to deal with all
the inquiries fired at him from all sides&#151;including, on
occasion, his own&#151;in the best possible way and in the best
possible traditions of this place. We want to achieve a good deal of
consensus on Bills of this kind, and I think that in this case
consensus was largely achieved, but it was not consensus for the sake
of consensus; it was agreement on good legislation, and I pay tribute
to the Parliamentary Secretary for helping us to achieve
it.</p><p><a name="06102588000035">I
thank the charities team&#151;originally in the Home Office,
subsequently in the Cabinet Office&#151;for their assistance. They
answered questions at short notice, and also replied to a multitude of
letters. I thank the Charity Commission&#146;s staff, with whom I
think it fair to say I have had robust discussions on a number of
occasions: sometimes I have been persuaded, sometimes

proceedings on the Bill, and their representative organisations.
Without evidence from charities large and small at grass-roots level,
this would not have been such a good Bill. I particularly thank the
Charity Law Association. One or two of the amendments that the Minister
commended originated not from my pen, but from that of the
association.</p><p><a name="06102588000036">I thank
my colleagues who were members of the Committee&#151;my hon. Friends
the Members for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), for Upminster (Angela
Watkinson) and for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), some
of whom have been present this afternoon. I also thank the Committee
Chairmen, my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr.
Gale) and the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood
(Mrs. Humble). Finally, I pay particular tribute and give
particular thanks to my researcher Tim Sheppard, who has now gone on to
greater things but who saw me very well&#151;at least, I thought
so&#151;through the Committee
stage.</p><p><a name="06102588000037">One or two
minor issues remain, which we were unable to discuss on Report. In
particular, there is the question of access to the tribunal. We are
very pleased that there is to be a tribunal to provide an intermediate
post between a Charity Commission decision and judicial review, but we
are anxious about whether charities will be able to afford to face the
commission in the tribunal. We do not want the commission to spend a
lot of public money on lawyers when small charities do not want to
spend charitable money on them. We are also anxious to ensure that
justice is not only done but seen to be done in the tribunal. I hope
that the Minister will have one or two things to say about
that.</p><p><a name="06102588000038">The Minister for
the Cabinet Office mentioned a review that would consider public
benefit, and said that if there were not the evidence of public benefit
that Ministers would like to see, they would consider what action was
needed to put things back on track. She has committed herself to
beginning that process within three years. If the Conservatives inherit
such an inquiry or review, we will be happy to continue it and to take
the results to legislation if
necessary.</p><p><a name="06102588000039">I am, I
must say, a little concerned about the fact that having worked as hard
as we have&#151;and, more important, given the hard work of so many
other people&#151;we are bringing forth what may turn out to be
interim legislation. I hope that it will not be. I hope that the wishes
and desires of the Government, the charity sector and Members on both
sides of the House will be met successfully by the Bill. However, I am
concerned that conflicting signals have been sent, even at Report
stage, on exactly what the Bill means and, in particular, on public
benefit. It is not satisfactory to leave to a quango, however well
intentioned or distinguished its members, decisions not of
administration, but of policy.</p><p><a name="06102588000040">I fear that
the Minister has made comments that he hopes will be taken on board by
the Charity Commission and interpreted as policy but that were never
put before this House in the form of amendment or legislation. If the
commission responds too well to Ministers&#146; expressed wishes, or
the Government try to smuggle amendments through in the form of
statements of policy, wishes, desires and guidance, it will spend much
more time than it would wish before the tribunal. This House is the

Michael:</b> I welcome what my right hon. Friend the Minister
for the Cabinet Office has said to reinforce the commitment to early
parliamentary scrutiny. That is one of the undertakings that have been
given by Ministers that has helped to create the spirit of consensus
and movement arising from the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102588000043">I wish
also to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, my
hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) on the
exemplary way in which he has taken the Bill through the House. It is
quite a challenge to take on a Bill such as this in the first stages of
one&#146;s ministerial career, and he has done an outstanding
job.</p><p><a name="06102588000044">The Bill will
help to clarify the meaning of charitable purpose, as defined in clause
2. That definition is now clear and includes issues such as animal
welfare, which many of us have wished to see expressly set out in
legislation. Probably the most important aspect is the creation of a
level playing field in the application of the public benefit test. That
is an excellent
development.</p><p><a name="06102588000045">The Bill
takes the values of charity, which have been tried and tested over
generations, and reinterprets them for a modern age. Fortunately, they
have not been interpreted too narrowly, which was a danger had we
over-amended the Bill, but in a way that will give the Charity
Commission authority in taking its work forward. It is important that
the commission ensures that fee-charging charities take active steps to
mitigate the impact of fees and maximise the public benefit, as
transparently as possible. The outcome of those steps must be to ensure
that someone who is able to benefit from a charity&#146;s services
and who is eligible to do so has a reasonable chance of doing
so.</p><p><a name="06102588000046">I referred earlier
to a conversation with the chief charity commissioner and she has
confirmed that the words I am using correctly interpret her position,
and I hope that that will be of some comfort to the hon. Member for
Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner). On method and timing, the chief
commissioner confirmed that while the responsibility to meet the legal
requirements and satisfy the commission lies with the trustees of each
charity, she will encourage sectors to work with the commission to
develop good practice guidelines and to work progressively towards
clear standards and the ability to demonstrate how they are doing so.
In other words, it is an engaged process&#151;a relationship with
charities of a very positive
sort.</p><p><a name="06102588000047">That
is consistent with the concept of continual improvement that is now
generally accepted in the sector as being right in principle and
necessary to the

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1622</b><br>achievement of proper accountability. I believe that it is a sensible
and progressive development of the standards for which our charitable
sector is renowned. There is a clear expectation of timely action, but
with no harsh grinding of
gears.</p><p><a name="06102588000048">That is why the
hon. Member for Isle of Wight was wrong to imply that there was a
degree of uncertainty, both in the Bill and about what the Charity
Commission will do in interpreting it. The Charity Commission will not
have to respond to Ministers or to their policy statements, and that is
why I have been at pains to quote at some length what the chief charity
commissioner has said about her understanding of what Parliament is
doing to provide clear law.</p><p><a name="06102588000049">I believe that the Charity
Commission has raised its game over the past few years. I now feel very
confident that it will discharge robustly the responsibilities that
Parliament is giving it, but with common sense and professionalism.
Therefore, the doubts expressed by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight
are ill founded, and I hope that he will accept what the chief charity
commissioner has said about her interpretation of the
commission&#146;s remit from Parliament. That is a matter of
emphasis, but an important one.</p><p><a name="06102588000050">In the forthcoming spending
review, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon.
Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office will want to encourage the
process of continual improvement in the sector, and to ensure that the
Charity Commission is well equipped to drive that process forward. In
the meantime, I am certain that the Bill serves charities well, without
being too prescriptive about the definition of public benefit. The
principle is clear and has stood the test of time, but we need to
reinterpret it for the modern age. That will be necessary again in the
future, as eternal ideals must continually be interpreted anew as they
are applied to contemporary conditions and challenges.</p><p><a name="06102588000051">When my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister was Leader of the Opposition, he asked
me to do some work on improving the relationship between Government and
the charitable and voluntary sector. I have been increasingly aware
ever since that, although legislation and clarity about principles are
important, it is people who drive charitable endeavour, and that
legislation needs to nurture enterprise and vigour in that
sector.</p><p><a name="06102588000052">This Bill, in
the form that it has acquired as a result of the parliamentary scrutiny
process, is eminently fit for that job. I commend the efforts of those

importance of the Bill really came home to me when I addressed the
annual general meeting of a local charity, Cheltenham Community
Projects, which helps some of the most vulnerable people in our town.
The previous year, I had been sent away with something of a flea in my
ear, having been told that MPs should try to lift the regulatory burden
and other impositions placed on smaller charities if we wanted to
encourage
volunteering.</p><p><a name="06102588000056">I think
that I can go back to the staff of CCP and look them in the eye. They

be a great improvement for all such
charities.</p><p><a name="06102588000057">I
remain a member of the Institute of Fundraising, which has welcomed the
Bill&#146;s proposals on fundraising. For the Government to get its
support is no mean achievement. The particular issue is street
collections and face-to-face collections of funds&#151;very important
sources of income, as Christian Aid alone derives&#163;15
million a year from street collections. Face-to-face fundraising from
direct debits and standing orders raises &#163;37 million of new
donations every year, probably adding up to &#163;184 million of
donations over the lifetime of the donors for each charity. Some rather
unfairly describe the people who collect these donations as chuggers,
which is a rather insulting description for people&#151;some still
volunteers&#151;who work very hard to generate that sort of
income.</p><p><a name="06102588000058"><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew374"><a name="06102588000184">Mr.

reservations about the fundraising elements of the Bill, but I hope
that the Minister will reassure me that he is keen to ensure that the
local authorities given new powers to regulate street fundraising are
not over-zealous in their application.</p><p><a name="06102588000061">I have other reservations about
other parts of the Bill, including clause 38 on the liability of
trustees. It still fails to protect trustees from liability in respect
of pursuing ethical investment policies, which strikes me as entirely
laudable, so will the Minister look further into providing ways in
which such ethical policies could be pursued by charities just as they
are by others?</p><p><a name="06102588000062">I view
the charity tribunal as a very welcome development, as it is absolutely
right to have a court of appeal against decisions by the Charity
Commission. In Committee, I provided a particular example of the need
to allow the tribunal also to hear decisions that were not taken by the
Charity Commission. That argument was lost on the Minister, but he was
kind enough to describe the issue as extremely important. It

the Minister&#146;s comments.</p><p><a name="06102588000063">Issues of academic freedom are
also relevant. There are no powers to protect academic
freedom&#151;unlike in the Higher Education Act 2004, for
example&#151;and the Charity Commission has quite draconian powers to
remove entire boards of trustees. Those now apply to some higher
education institutions and collegiate universities, so the need to
protect academic freedom remains an important issue. These matters will
have to be pursued in other ways and in other places, but I hope that
the Minister will take them into account. I am hopeful that he will,
because both in today&#146;s debate and in Committee he demonstrated
a general willingness to listen and to respond, which has been greatly

would like briefly to thank the researchers who helped me during the
Bill&#146;s passage: Jake Rigg, Jessica Hambly, Elizabeth Poston and
Hollie Voyce, who at times had more influence on the Minister than I
did. I am most grateful for their contributions. I am delighted to be
present at the final stages of a Bill that I first debated when I was

Duddridge (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):</b> At the risk
of further alienating my hon. Friends, may I further praise the
Minister for his conduct both in Committee and outside? I have noticed
that when hon. Members compliment one another, particularly across the
Chamber, there is usually a &#147;but&#148; coming, so I hope that
the Minister will allow me to register one or two buts in my
contribution.</p><p><a name="06102588000066">Clearly, we need the best
possible framework to help the charitable sector reach its full
potential, but I am not fully convinced that parts of the Bill will
assist it to do so. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have spoken
about the removal of the presumption of public benefit. I do not oppose
the test per se, but I raised my concern in Committee that more schools
rather than fewer schools should benefit from having charitable status.
As the public benefit test is ratcheted up, it is possible that fewer
will receive charitable status. I would probably be more comfortable if
the test, and what it constitutes, were built more clearly into the
Bill. I understand that no such definition to allow the necessary
flexibility exists in the provisions before us. That will lead to
confusion and a lack of clarity.</p><p><a name="06102588000067">It is vital that clear and
concise guidance is given to independent schools about what is likely
to be in the test. I understand that the Charity Commission is already
holding discussions with representatives from the independent sector,
but from my discussions with independent schools in my constituency I
know that they are already concerned about where the bar will be set.
Although I was a member of the Committee, I was unable to provide
adequate advice to a governor who came to see me about the
issue.</p><p><a name="06102588000068">I asked the

that guidance documents were being refined; indeed, he precipitated
discussions between the Charity Commission and the SHIELDS parliament,
and I thank him very much for that. I also welcome the measures to make
it easier for charities to recruit new trustees. I sincerely hope that
they find those measures
helpful.</p><p><a name="06102588000069">Key to the
framework of the charity sector is the role of the Charity Commission.
I realise that it is committed to reducing the administrative burden of
regulation for charities by more than 25 per cent. over the next four
years. Like most Members, I welcome that step, but I am concerned about
the threshold for registration. It has been raised to &#163;5,000,
but that is still too low; conversely, the level of bureaucracy in the
commission is too
high.</p><p><a name="06102588000070">I support the
amendment tabled earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
(Mr. Turner), which proposed that the charity appeal
tribunal should administer a suitors fund, or something similar. If
small charities cannot appeal to the tribunal, its real value will be
limited. Finally, I thank the Minister for reconsidering the definition
of sport. I also express my personal thanks to him for not repeating
the minutiae of some of the debate in Committee, as that certainly was
not
necessary.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0004.htmordayhd_24"><a name="06102588000165">6.52

there had been talk of one. For the sake of accuracy, I do not want
anyone reading the report of the debate to be under a wrong impression

in the House. Before I make some closing remarks, I shall respond
briefly to some of the questions that have been raised in the debate.
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) referred to a
suitors fund. The premise of the tribunal is that it should be simpler,
cheaper and quicker for charities to use it without the need for
expensive legal advice or representation. However, if in practice it
becomes apparent that legal representation is routinely required and
that the costs present a barrier, we will have to revisit our position
on the suitors fund. I assure him that it will be part of the review
process.</p><br>

(Martin Horwood) has been persistent about decisions not to open an
inquiry. I have talked to the Charity Commission about that matter and
it appreciates the need for greater transparency in that area. In its
compliance role, the commission relies extensively on matters of
concern being brought to its attention. Once a complaint has been made
and an inquiry requested, the commission will acknowledge receipt and
may seek further information. The complaint will be subject to thorough
assessment to determine how it is to be dealt with. The commission will
let the complainant know how the case will be handled in the commission
and its outcome and, where possible, the reason for the decision. I
have already pointed out to the commission what the hon. Gentleman has
said on that
subject.</p><p><a name="06102588000075">As for local
authorities and raising funds, I know that there is anxiety among
charities that carry out face-to-face fundraising. Local authorities
were able to discriminate against them, but we are confident that that
will not be possible under the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102588000076"><b><a name="61025-0005.htm_spnew379"><a name="06102588000189">Martin
Horwood:</b> My point about face-to-face fundraising was not
that it was impossible under the Bill; in fact, we argued that it was
possible. If local authorities are inclined to be vexatious, will the
Minister urge the commission to direct them not to act in that
way?</p><p><a name="06102588000077"><b><a name="61025-0005.htm_spnew380"><a name="06102588000190">Edward
Miliband:</b> I certainly cannot give directions to the
commission, but I am confident that under the Bill, there is no
opportunity for vexatious local authorities to prevent fundraising as
the hon. Gentleman suggests. He mentioned ethical investment, but
charities have quite a lot of latitude in that area. A Charity
Commission publication, CC14, explains that, but I suspect that
discussion on the subject will continue.</p><p><a name="06102588000078">In closing,
let me make three simple points. First, the legislation has greatly
benefited from the long deliberation that has taken place, which
included pre-legislative scrutiny. I pay tribute to the work of my
right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)
and other members of the Joint Committee. I thank, too, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) and my
hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt), both of whom have
helped me.</p><p><a name="06102588000079">The long
deliberation meant that three Ministers were involved with the Bill,
including myself, and I thank my predecessors, my hon. Friends the
Members for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and for Wythenshawe and Sale,
East (Paul Goggins). I thank, too, hon. Members on both sides of the
House for taking part in our debate and improving the Bill,
particularly the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner).
He was a schoolteacher in a former life, and sometimes, when talking to
him, I felt as though I was undergoing a hard exam session, but the
Bill is the better for his contribution. The same is true of the hon.
Member for Cheltenham, who sought to improve the Bill, and has indeed
done so. He took remarks about the Cheltenham principle and
1/4ber-chuggers in the spirit in which they were intended. I thank
my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman), who has guided me
through the process, and my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham
(Dr. Blackman-Woods),

valuable help. I take the opportunity to thank a hard-working team of
officials, led by Richard Corden, and the parliamentary draftsmen,
whose work often goes unnoticed.</p><p><a name="06102588000080">Secondly, I thank the Charity
Commission for its contribution. It has come in for stick at times
during the progress of the Bill, but there is general recognition
across the House that it has a difficult job, given that there are
190,000 charities but only a few hundred staff at the commission. The
staff now have the heavy responsibility of implementing the Bill under
the leadership of Dame Suzi Leather, the new chief charity
commissioner. They take that responsibility seriously, and will seek to
demonstrate the qualities of a 21st-century regulator.</p><p><a name="06102588000081">Finally, I pay tribute to the
190,000 charities across the country, which are the subject of the
Bill. We all have charities in our constituencies, and they demonstrate

Wiggin (Leominster) (Con):</b> I am grateful for the granting
of this Adjournment debate. Although there have been many debates and
many questions have been asked relating to defence and the armed forces
in recent years, Parliament has only touched on the subject of
compassionate leave for service personnel. As such, I hope that the
Minister will take on board the points raised, especially at a time
when we are demanding so much from our service
personnel.</p><p><a name="06102588000102">As well as
some long-standing commitments, since 1997 the Government have taken
our armed forces into a series of new conflicts across the globe. Aside
from the 8,500 troops stationed in Northern Ireland, there are about
13,400 British troops on operational duties abroad. There are 5,000
operational troops in Afghanistan, 900 in the Balkans, 300 on UN
missions and 7,200 in Iraq. Each one of those troops does their duty
tirelessly.</p><p><a name="06102588000103">Day in
and day out, often in the face of intolerable dangers, our troops are
out there on the front line in some of the most inhospitable and
dangerous conditions imaginable. We are all no doubt aware of the
dangers that they face, especially in Afghanistan and Iraq, where they
are challenged by suicide bombings and other horrendous acts while
trying to bring peace and stability to those countries. We are all
grateful for their courage and
bravery.</p><p><a name="06102588000104">The
Government have sent those young men and women into those theatres of
danger and they have a responsibility to do what they practically can
to safeguard not only the safety of our troops, but their welfare and
morale, and that of their families. On tours of duty lasting six
months, our troops are separated from their family and friends. Being
so far apart from loved ones can have an impact on morale. Troops can
miss birthdays and weddings, and even births and deaths. That absence
is part of their job, and troops and their families understand that.
However, it can still create emotional and physical burdens on military
families. That is why we have a system to allow service personnel to
take compassionate leave in certain circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102588000105">I draw the attention of the
House to my constituent, Mrs. Beryl Miles, whose medically
trained daughter, Corporal Bronwen Pickup, is currently serving in
Iraq. Mrs. Miles was an active and sporting individual until
recently, when she had to have surgery for a serious spinal condition.
She is currently in a state of disability in her home, while she
recovers from her operation. Her home has had to be adapted and
transformed with new facilities, such as a stair lift, to make her life
a little easier for her. Despite the help that she is currently
receiving, like most other people at a traumatic time, what
Mrs. Miles really wanted at her time of need, both
emotionally and physically, was her daughter. Being medically trained,
Corporal Pickup was an ideal person to offer her mother the vital help
that she needed to recover.</p><br>

became clear that Mrs. Miles would need an operation, an
application for compassionate leave was made to the Army welfare
service. That application was rejected on the basis that
Mrs. Miles was receiving treatment in hospital. I am not
criticising that decision, given the circumstances at the time and the
criteria for compassionate leave. The problem with regard to
compassionate leave in this case arose when Mrs. Miles left
hospital in September and Corporal Pickup requested leave to be with
her mother. At that time, Mrs. Miles did not have access to
the 24-hour care afforded to her in hospital, which was the basis for
the earlier rejection. Nevertheless, Corporal Pickup&#146;s request
was again rejected by the Army welfare service and Mrs.
Miles was left to go
home.</p><p><a name="06102588000107">The
Army&#146;s criteria for compassionate leave state that it can be

hardship.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102588000108">Furthermore,
the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), when he was a
Defence Minister,
stated:</p><a name="61025-0005.htmbrev_86"><a name="06102588000159"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
purpose of compassionate leave is to allow Service personnel an
authorised period of absence to enable them to attend to a personal
crisis. There is no definitive list of occasions when it is appropriate
to allow compassionate leave to be taken as each case requires
individual, objective and sensitive
assessment.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 22 June 2005; Vol.
435,c. 1060W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102588000109">That is
a common-sense definition that allows our soldiers to have confidence
that, when things are going wrong, they will be allowed to go home for
a short time to deal with the crisis.</p><p><a name="06102588000110">Mrs. Miles was clear
that, when she left hospital, she was in need of urgent support from
her daughter, whose experience and medical training would have been
helpful to Mrs. Miles. More significant than Mrs.
Miles&#146;s opinion of what was best for herself, was the opinion of
her daughter. She, too, wanted to go home and felt that this was
exactly the sort of family situation that warranted compassionate
leave. This case was exceptional and the decision of the AWS added to
the physical and emotional burdens on Mrs. Miles, as well as
to the emotions of her
daughter.</p><p><a name="06102588000111">Part of the
problem in this case was the inconsistency of the AWS. It denied
compassionate leave because Mrs. Miles was in hospital,
which gave rise to the implied expectation that it would be granted
when she left. However, when Mrs. Miles actually left
hospital, Corporal Pickup&#146;s request was again rejected. Although
I appreciate that we cannot predict in advance every possible family
circumstance, we evidently need clearer guidelines in place so that
service personnel will have a greater understanding of when their
circumstances qualify for compassionate leave. As far as my constituent
was concerned, her circumstances seemed to fit the criteria, so she
thought that her daughter would be able to spend some time with her to
help with her recuperation, especially considering that her spine had
been operated on.</p><p><a name="06102588000112">I
mentioned earlier that the Government have a responsibility for the
morale of our troops. In that context, it is not good for troop morale
when hard-working and brave soldiers are denied the chance to spend a
few days at home with their ill parents. We need our soldiers to be 100

service personnel&#146;s work means that they cannot be afforded the
flexibility to respond to family responsibilities that they would get
in alternative professions, the Government must be considerate and
compassionate to those who put their lives on the line for their
country. The Government need to show that they care about our troops
and their
families.</p><p><a name="06102588000113">That was why
I was disappointed by the Government&#146;s response. I am worried
that we will lose Corporal Pickup because of the handling of the case,
despite the fact that trained and skilled soldiers such as her are
needed so badly at this time that they cannot be given compassionate
leave. The way in which the case has been handled has been a disgrace.
I am reluctant to interfere with the workings of the Ministry of
Defence at a time when it is under great pressure in Iraqand
Afghanistan. However, retaining troops and maintaining morale are
aspects of the way in which we can support our armed forces, and one
would expect the Government to welcome such
support.</p><p><a name="06102588000114">I took the
trouble of writing to the Secretary of State. The timetable for
granting the compassionate leave was about two weeks for the reason
that there was no point in sending Corporal Pickup home while her
mother was still in hospital. We eventually received a date on which
the operation would take place and then a date when Mrs.
Miles would leave hospital. I sent that information to the Secretary of
State by fax and
post.</p><p><a name="06102588000115">I understand why
the Secretary of State did not reply, but he clearly got the message
because, to my amazement, Corporal Pickup found herself being moved
from her base in Iraq to a new location where communication was much
harder, if not impossible. I do not think that that helped her to
recognise her vital role in the effort that we are putting into Iraq.
It simply confirmed that no one cared about her or her mother, or about
what happened to either of them. Indeed, if she had doubts about
remaining in the Army, such an extraordinary and perhaps vindictive
approach will have confirmed her worst
fears.</p><p><a name="06102588000116">Although I
appreciate that our presence in Iraq is important, my constituent has
been left with the impression that the Army&#146;s need for Corporal
Pickup was far greater than her need for her daughter, Bronwen. The
evidence seems to show that our need for fully trained medics is
greater than the media lead us to believe and greater than the reported
casualty figures suggest. If the situation is so bad that one corporal
cannot go home to help her mother to recover from a spinal injury,
perhaps that is why people are questioning exactly what is going on out
there. When the Minister responds to the debate, I hope that he will be
able to reassure us that the AWS is not being put under any political
pressure to find excuses not to grant compassionate leave because of a
shortfall in troop
numbers.</p><p><a name="06102588000117">I took the
trouble to telephone the person at AWS who was responsible for the
case. He told me that he had checked with the person at the hospital
and had had it confirmed that Mrs. Miles would be
&#147;all right&#148;. I do not think that that person was a
doctor, although Mrs. Miles has lived to tell this sorry
tale, so she is &#147;all right&#148; to some extent. The person
then assured me that if things got worse, the Red Cross could pop in. I
have nothing against the Red Cross or any of the people

Red Cross cannot provide the same moral and mental comfort that
Mrs. Miles needed and that her daughter wanted to
provide.</p><p><a name="06102588000118">I fear that
there could be more Corporal Pickups in our armed forces, some of whom
may be too cynical about the compassionate leave system to apply or who
may have been put off after hearing of the rejections of their
applications that others have received. I also fear that there could be
more Mrs. Mileses in our constituencies, in urgent need of
support from a family member serving abroad. I am further concerned
that this may have a detrimental impact on morale, recruitment and
retention.</p><p><a name="06102588000119">In the past
year, some 14,000 troops left the Army. Although we do not know what
proportion of those were feeling the strain of being apart from their
family, rejecting applications for compassionate leave such as Corporal
Pickup&#146;s will not help to encourage our soldiers to spend more
time in our military. Supporting our troops means more than letting
them go home.</p><p><a name="06102588000120">The
handling of this case was a disgrace and must not happen again. If a
soldier has a family crisis, moving them to an area out of
communication is brutal. It is well known that good leadership means
looking after the finest asset in our armed forces&#151;the people.
The treatment of Corporal Pickup and her mother is extremely
disappointing. The attitude of the Ministers involved is worse. The
letter that I finally received in response to my initial fax and letter
arrived on Monday, two weeks after the operation. Worse still, it said
nothing. It was clear that the Minister had no understanding of the
problem and the minion who wrote the letter had no information. When we
are trying so hard to support our soldiers abroad, it is a shame that
their own leaders in government should ignore their simple
requests.</p><p><a name="06102588000121">I do not
think the Minister can correct the wrongs that have been done to
Corporal Pickup and her mother, but he can try to prevent such weak and
short-sighted handling of a delicate and important problem. I look
forward to hearing his views on compassionate leave and whether he has
any plans to offer more assistance to people like my constituent,
Mrs. Miles, and her
daughter.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025-0005.htmordayhd_28"><a name="06102588000169">7.17

exists to help Ministers, who have ultimate responsibility for what
goes out in their
name.</p><p><a name="06102588000129">The Government
and the services recognise that welfare is an important and integral
element of operational efficiency. The Ministry of Defence has a duty
of care to ensure that wherever personnel are required to serve,
welfare measures are in place which provide the timely and effective
assistance necessary to maintain operational effectiveness. Welfare is
therefore MOD core
business.</p><p><a name="06102588000130">Before
turning to compassionate and other forms of leave, I must emphasise
that the granting and timing of all forms of absence is subject at all
times to operational requirements and the general exigencies of each
service. Compassionate leave is just one of the many types of leave
available to our service personnel. In addition to annual leave, which
is for the purpose of allowing service personnel time away from duty so
that they return to work refreshed, other types of leave and absence
such as post- operational leave, maternity leave and time off for
dependants are all available when
required.</p><p><a name="06102588000131">Before
I deal with compassionate leave, I must explain that there is a
difference between compassionate leave and time off for dependants,
although they may appear similar. Primarily, time off for dependants is
unpaid leave to allow individuals to deal with emergencies that affect
them or their dependants. Commanding officers may grant time off when
there are insufficient grounds to grant paid compassionate leave.
Service personnel who are required to be away for more than a few days
should apply for compassionate leave, annual leave or a combination of
the two according to service
regulations.</p><p><a name="06102588000132">With
regard to the purposes for which compassionate leave is available,
compassionate leave is additional to an individual&#146;s normal
leave entitlement and it is available to allow service personnel an
authorised period of absence to enable them to attend to a personal
crisis. However, given the myriad of potential difficulties individuals
can encounter, I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands why hard and
fast rules cannot be laid down for granting compassionate leave. We are
talking about real people&#146;s lives, and each case requires
individual, objective,

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1634</b><br>sensitive and timely assessment. The amount of compassionate leave that
may be awarded rests with the commanding officer, and it is, as it
always must be, a balance between the needs of the individual, the
current operational situation and the exigencies of the
service.</p><p><a name="06102588000133">Although the
rules governing compassionate leave need to be as flexible as possible,
general guidance is provided to commanding officers. The overriding
principle of the guidance emphasises that commanding officers should,
where possible, grant compassionate leave, unless the criteria laid
down in the guidelines are not met or the needs of the service take
priority. Compassionate leave may be granted for periods of up to four
weeks, but it may be extended in exceptional circumstances for longer
periods following a review of each individual
case.</p><p><a name="06102588000134">Compassionate
leave is not the solution to recurring problems, which should be dealt
with by addressing them by some other form of resolution through single
service welfare channels. Various other forms of leave are available to
service personnel, and they may be more appropriate to meet the needs
of both the individual and the service&#151;for example, special paid
or unpaid leave can be offered where practicable, and commanding
officers may grant specific short periods of authorised absence in
addition to compassionate and normal
leave.</p><p><a name="06102588000135">The hon.
Gentleman has raised the case of his constituent, Mrs.
Miles, whose daughter, Corporal Bronwen Pickup, was refused
compassionate leave to look after Mrs. Miles following
Mrs. Miles&#146;s discharge from hospital. The facts, as
the hon. Gentleman has indicated, are that Mrs. Miles was
taken into hospital with severe back pain shortly before Corporal
Pickup returned home on leave from Iraq in August. Corporal Pickup
asked to be allowed to remain in the UK on compassionate grounds
because of her mother&#146;s illness. Her unit referred the matter to
the Army Welfare Service, which investigated and recommended that
Corporal Pickup should return to her unit as planned because her mother
was receiving sufficient care in hospital and a hospital care plan
would be put in place following her mother&#146;s discharge. Corporal
Pickup returned to Iraq at the end of her
leave.</p><p><a name="06102588000136">On 15
September, Corporal Pickup again requested compassionate leave as she
was concerned that her mother, who had been discharged from hospital,
was not receiving adequate after-care. The Army Welfare Service then
contacted the occupational therapist dealing with Mrs.
Miles, from whom it was understood that Mrs. Miles had
friends and family, including her husband, who were able to care for
her as well as health professionals. It was therefore decided again not
to grant Corporal Pickup compassionate
leave.</p><p><a name="06102588000137">I understand
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s unhappiness, and that of the family, at
that decision. I assure him that the chain of command is very alert to
the difficulties that personnel can face when they are separated from
their families, and it is not vindictive. While taking into account
operational requirements, it is sensitive and responsive to individual
needs, and it will often release personnel on compassionate leave.
However, where it considers that an individual cannot be released
because operational requirements are paramount, it will, where
appropriate, refer such cases to the respective welfare

merits fairly and sensitively.</p><p><a name="06102588000138">Each service has developed its
own welfare organisation tailored to meet the different needs of the
respective personnel. The Royal Navy has the Naval Personnel and Family
Service, the Army has the Army Welfare Service, and the Royal Air Force
has contracted welfare support to the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and
Families Association. Each welfare organisation is professionally
qualified and trained and, most importantly, independent of the chain
of command. They are therefore well placed to balance individual
personal circumstances against operational requirements. Clearly, there
will be some cases in which they rule in favour of an individual and
some in which they do not.</p><p><a name="06102588000139">The important point is that
such a decision is made only after thorough consideration of all the
circumstances and merits of each individual case. In addition, each
case is kept under constant review as regards any changing
circumstances to ensure that our service personnel receive the best
support possible. In support of the chain of command and the formal
welfare organisations, personnel may, depending on the issue, seek help
and advice from other sources such as padres and doctors. There are
therefore many opportunities for service personnel to seek and obtain
help on any welfare issue.</p><p><a name="06102588000140">We are committed to providing a
welfare structure that, wherever practicable and manageable, supports
the needs of the service community. For personnel to be fully effective
in their duties, it is essential that their well-being and that of
their dependants is properly cared for. The same welfare structures
that are normally provided in the United Kingdom by local authorities,
or by other external agencies, should be available to our serving
personnel while serving overseas. Our aim is to deliver comprehensive
community support to our servicemen and women and their dependants. The
welfare provision provided by each service and other professional
agencies is equally accessible to the dependants of serving personnel,
whose morale and well-being have a direct bearing on the effectiveness
of service personnel. During peacetime deployments, or while on
operations, our aim is to provide the same level of support that would
be provided back at an individual&#146;s home base.</p><p><a name="06102588000141">I thank the hon. Gentleman for
raising this subject and for allowing me the opportunity to describe

be a helpful step. Our military personnel are best treated within the
military family. We try to give them all possible opportunities and
independent support. Ministers do get engaged, but there is a balance
to be struck at all times. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider
his Territorial Army experience, as he should understand only too well
the importance of the chain of command and of not having
cross-interference from Ministers.</p><p><a name="06102588000143"><i> Question put and agreed
