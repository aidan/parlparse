 All the Northern Ireland political parties support the principle of devolution. All of them support the principle of an Assembly and devolved government. They differ on how to achieve it. Our challenge is to bridge those differences, but one thing is certain: the current impasse cannot and will not continue. We cannot keep the Assembly standing idle; we cannot continue to pay Members of the Legislative Assembly indefinitely during suspension; and we cannot have meaningless elections in May 2007, to an Assembly that does not exist. This year is decisive, and all the party leaders will be facing some hard choices.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60315-01_spnew0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. What is the single biggest impediment to the Assembly being reinstated? Who is to blame for the fact that the process is dragging out?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60315-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 In the end, the Assembly can only be re-established and power-sharing governance instituted if the parties agree. Neither the Prime Minister, myself, the Irish Government nor anyone else can force Northern Ireland&#039;s parties to agree&#151;it is a decision for them&#151;but they will face a hard choice later this year if they do not reach that agreement.

<p>
<a name="60315-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">Can he update the House on what progress has been made on the re-establishment of the Assembly and the cutting of salaries?

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60315-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 What I said previously&#151;the hon. Gentleman quotes me accurately&#151;remains the case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60315-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down)</b> 
 (SDLP): After an ill-advised deadline of 8 March has come and gone, will   the Secretary of State now address the proposals of   the Social Democratic and Labour party, which called for the re-establishment of a fully devolved Administration&#151;if necessary, with a temporary Executive appointed from non-elected members or, indeed, consisting of the Northern Ireland Office Ministers themselves&#151;until such time as an agreed Executive can be formed? Does he not agree that that would encourage the parties to participate and that their failure to do so would be a rejection of their mandate and, in a sense, an illustration of the fact that they are putting party before people?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60315-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand the point that hon. Gentleman makes, but he has not persuaded, nor has his party, any other party to support that proposition. That is his problem, and there is no point in inviting me, as Secretary of State, to back that policy, when no party, apart from the SDLP, will subscribe to it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60315-01_spnew6"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b> 
 (LD): The Secretary of State talks about the restoration of the Assembly, but he allows his Ministers to make extraordinarily important decisions&#151;for example, about the Northern Ireland education system&#151;that should be left to a reconstituted Assembly. If he is so sure that we can get the Assembly running again, why does he allow the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith), to talk about doing away with the selection process, which, as everyone knows, needs to be the subject of considerably more consultation and discussion in Northern Ireland? Surely, regardless of where individual Ministers stand on selection, the Government need to agree that such a decision should be left to the Assembly. If they do not, it raises questions about how optimistic they are about the reconstitution of the Assembly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60315-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman telling me that he supports a child&#039;s future being decided on the basis of a test at the age of 11? Is that what he supports? Is it new Liberal Democrat policy that a child can either be relegated to a secondary school in Northern Ireland, with no decent future, or go to one of the excellent grammar schools? Is that the Liberal Democrat policy? Of course, such a decision should ideally be made by a devolved Assembly. However, until there is a devolved Assembly, we must govern in the interests of Northern Ireland on the economy, on health, with waiting lists coming down, and on reforming the school 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1439</b>

 (DUP): Why does the Secretary of State not face up to issue that there is one party that will not agree to the so-called basis of the agreement, namely that we all should be democrats? When will the Government be prepared to say, &quot;There&#039;s only one way in, and that way is for everyone. You have not kept that way. Therefore, you have to be excluded.&quot;? The time has come when he has to decide whether he will tell those who agree with terrorism that they can be in the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60315-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 If the right hon. Gentleman is saying that Sinn Fein has not committed itself following the IRA statement&#151;and, to be fair to it, for many years before&#151;to a democratic, peaceful and political path, I do not think that he is judging the evidence as it has been presented to us. If he is also asking me to bar a very important part of the Northern Ireland political constituency from representation in the Assembly or a power-sharing Government, I cannot agree with him on that. We have got to make progress. His party needs to talk to the other parties and, at some point sooner rather than later, his party needs to talk to Sinn Fein, because it is the second largest party in Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60315-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury)</b> 
 (Con): As the Secretary of State knows, we hope that these talks succeed. However, can he confirm that the Government accept the principle that no one should serve as a Minister in a Northern Ireland Executive unless he or she is willing to accept the legitimacy of the police and the courts and give firm support to both those institutions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60315-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Obviously, it is essential that all parties subscribe to the rule of law, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman on support for policing as well. We have repeatedly called for Sinn Fein to come into line and support policing in Northern Ireland. There is absolutely no reason for it not to do so. Indeed, there is increasing pressure from within republican communities for their elected representatives to co-operate with the police in combating ordinary crime. So we are absolutely agreed on that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60315-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 I am grateful for that assurance from the Secretary of State. If, as we hope does not happen, these talks do not succeed in allowing for the reconstitution of the devolved institutions, can he give the House an assurance now that, although we welcome and value close co-operation with the Irish Republic, joint authority as a means of governing Northern Ireland in the absence of devolution would be at complete variance with the principle of consent in the Belfast agreement and, therefore, should be rejected?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60315-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not think that anybody is talking about joint authority. I very much welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support for the general strategy that we have adopted, and I acknowledge that and the constructive role that he is playing in seeking to persuade all the parties to find a common way forward. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1440</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>But I am not anticipating failure. I think that there is a real prospect of getting the Assembly up and running and getting power-sharing governance at the end of that. Let us work on that together, as I am sure that he wants to do.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60315-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Shaun Woodward): </b> 
 The remit of the independent authority is to monitor, inspect and encourage improvement in the availability and quality of health and social services, and to regulate a wide range of services delivered by HPSS bodies and by the independent sector.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60315-02_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Robinson: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his response, but he will be aware that the authority has recently investigated the tragic death of Janine Murtagh at the Royal Victoria hospital. The coroner in the case wrote to the previous Health Minister to express concern about a claim by seven consultant surgeons at the RVH about obstruction in getting gravely ill patients to theatre for surgery. The authority said that this was not a factor in the Murtagh case, but will the Minister agree to a meeting with me and Mr. Murtagh to discuss Mr. Murtagh&#039;s grave concerns about the letter and the authority&#039;s response?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60315-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 First, I know that the trust has already apologised to the Murtagh family, and may I, on behalf of the Department, extend my deepest condolences to Mr. Murtagh following the tragic death of his wife? The hon. Lady knows that the coroner made those recommendations and that the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith), when she was Health Minister, asked the regulation authority to conduct an independent review. The independent review published its findings last October and it found that, in this instance, there was no evidence to support the allegations made by the hon. Lady. That being said, it has been necessary to make a number of very significant changes to clinical practice at the hospital&#151;those have happened&#151;and the authority will monitor and report on those changes. There are also implications for the health service more widely in Northern Ireland, and I am insisting that we learn the lessons of the tragic death of Mrs. Murtagh and that we apply those lessons for the benefit of all patients in Northern Ireland. I will be more than happy to meet Mr. Murtagh, with the hon. Lady, to discuss those changes.

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60315-02_spnew3"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 One of the key areas that we have to address in supporting the economically inactive back into work is skills. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#039;s announcement about the skills and science fund is so important. Despite the support from the Liberal Democrats for an education system that currently supports 24 per cent. of the working population having no qualifications&#151;the figure is only 13 per cent. for the rest of the UK&#151;we have to ensure that our work force are skilled. Through the skills and science fund, we will support pathways to work to get the economically inactive back into work, but also ensure that we provide additional support for young people coming out of school and those who have been out of work for some considerable time.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60315-02_spnew8"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend on that issue. As our recent manufacturing report highlighted, we must consider three requirements if we are to increase employment and grow the economy. We need to be innovative and creative, invest in research and development and ensure that we have a highly skilled work force. Only by skilling up our work force, using the skills and science fund, can we address the points that he makes. We need to attract inward

 (Con): Of those who are unemployed, 33.8 per cent. are long-term unemployed, compared with the UK average of 20.7 per cent. Those are the figures that the Secretary of State quoted in a speech to the Fabian Society in January. Equally worrying are the new deal figures, which show that as many young people in Northern Ireland are economically inactive now as when the Government came to power. Why are those figures so unfortunate and what can the Minister do about it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60315-02_spnew10"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 There are a number of issues. One of them is about ensuring that we have an education system and training system that addresses the challenges of the future. At present, we find that 24 per cent. of the working population have no qualifications. If young people are coming out of school with no qualifications because, at the age of 11, they were put into a system that did not allow them to reach their full potential, we do not meet the employment needs that we need to meet. The skills and science fund, the reviews of education and the changes in the curriculum will ensure that we skill our young people and get the economically inactive back to work. We are extending the pathways to work scheme, which has been very successful in England.

 (Lab/Co-op): Although I welcome the reduction in unemployment figures and the work that the Government are doing, the Minister will be aware that the public sector contribution to gross domestic product from Northern Ireland is the highest in the UK. What initiatives has she undertaken with the private sector to ensure that there is a more even distribution and, in an increasingly globalised world, what initiatives and talks has she undertaken with the Republic of Ireland on that issue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60315-02_spnew12"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is quite right to highlight that point. Public spending, at more than 60 per cent. of the GDP a head, is nearly one third higher than the UK average. The imbalance in jobs between the public and private sectors is a problem when looking to the long-term future of the economy. We need to encourage businesses to be innovative, creative and invest in research and development. Those factors encourage investment into Northern Ireland. If we do not improve the performance of the private sector, we do not meet those challenges. There are a number of international investors&#151;Coca Cola, Oracle and Seagate&#151;investing in Northern Ireland and they will grow jobs to ensure that we improve the balance between the public and private sectors.

 Will my right hon.

 Yes, we have supported the new Northamptonshire police call centre. As my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="60315-04_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Yes, I am satisfied about that. The question gives me the opportunity to explain to the House and, indeed, to the country that for the past three months we have been warning the Palestinian Authority that the security of the monitors was at risk and that the procedures at the particular detention centre were not adequate and proper. That culminated last week, on 8 March, in both the US and UK consuls-general jointly writing to President Abbas, making it clear that unless the Palestinian Authority met its obligations, we would have to terminate involvement with the mission with immediate effect. So for months we have been warning about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_o3">Let me emphasise to the House that the monitors are unarmed civilians whose roles is not to do the policing and to make sure that people are properly imprisoned, but simply to monitor that the procedures agreed were being implemented. For a very long time they had been saying that the procedures were not being properly implemented, so that idea that the withdrawal was precipitate, uncalled for or not thought through is wrong.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1448</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>





<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="60315-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 I am grateful for that answer. People will also have been concerned by the attacks on the British Council in the Gaza strip. Can the Prime Minister tell us what steps he is taking today to protect British citizens, buildings and organisations that have been working so hard to help the Palestinian people? Can the Prime Minister tell us whether they were given any advance warning to take extra security precautions yesterday?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60315-04_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 On the last point, I am not sure of the precise precautions that they were told to take, but I know that the matter had been discussed extensively with people, precisely because we were concerned about the situation that might arise. Perhaps I could make one other point. The United Kingdom has been immensely generous in the help that it has given to people in the Palestinian Authority area. We will continue to do everything we can to support the Palestinian people, but there is one issue that must be addressed by the Palestinian Authority&#151;that is, security on the Palestinian side. If people want progress towards a two-state solution, which we have championed&#151;an independent, viable Palestinian state living side by side with Israel&#151;the security within the Palestinian area is of prime concern. We have done everything we can to support them, but we need some help back from the other side. Incidentally, one other thing I should mention is that another reason for our concern was the recent statement from Hamas following the elections in the Palestinian Authority that they intended to release the particular people in that detention centre. I hope that people understand, therefore, that we could not continue with a situation where wholly unarmed people were put at risk.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60315-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 I am grateful for that answer. Specifically on the issue of Hamas, its election victory and the effect on the funding of the Palestinian Authority, do not the events of the past 24 hours reinforce the need to ensure that Hamas abides by the conditions set down by the international community, which are to recognise Israel, abandon violence and abide by all the previous agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, one of which concerned the running of the Jericho prison?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="60315-04_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is the case that in addition to the bilateral assistance, which in this financial year amounts to some &#163;36 million, we have also supported the &#8364;120 million package from the European Union, so we are giving every support of a humanitarian kind to the Palestinian Authority. The only way that we are ever going to get a peace process beginning again in the middle east is if it is accepted that the solution to which the international community is committed&#151;a two-state solution&#151;can be proceeded with only if both sides accept the existence of the other state. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to see how we can make progress. One thing should be made very clear again: we totally respect the mandate that Hamas secured in the elections. We supported those democratic elections, we support them still. But if it wants our help&#151;both financially and politically&#151;to make progress, it has to be on an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 (Lab): Yesterday in the House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary admitted that he knew that when the UK and US monitors were withdrawn from Jericho, the Israelis would immediately seek to take the prisoners by force, giving the impression across the Palestinian territories of collusion. Given that yesterday the Israeli Government also reiterated their intention unilaterally to seize more Palestinian land by extending the wall, incorporating more illegal settlements into Israel and effectively annexing the Jericho valley, what are the British Government doing now to re-establish their shattered reputation as an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinian Authority?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="60315-04_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am afraid that I have to disagree with my hon. Friend. Let me just explain the circumstances in which we came to do this monitoring function. We did it under what was called the Ramallah agreement, entered into in 2002, whereby people who were charged with serious offences, including the assassination of Israeli politicians, would be kept in the detention centre and we would monitor their detention. The agreement on both sides, with Israel and with the Palestinian Authority, is that the Palestinians would take charge of the detention, but it would be independently monitored by us. That was the agreement brokered. We have kept to that agreement every inch of the way. We have done the independent monitoring. The breach has been because the proper detention procedures were not being observed on the Palestinian side. I stress to my hon. Friend that three months of saying to the Palestinian Authority, including, last week, directly to the president of the Palestinian Authority, &quot;Look, this is a serious situation, you have to act&quot;, is evidence of our good faith, not our bad faith. I repeat to my hon. Friend, I think it is important that the message sent out from this country, is that we stand ready to take this process forward and to help in any way we can, but it has to be on the basis that agreements entered into are adhered to by everybody.

<p><a name="st_o71"><a name="60315-04_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is partly in recognition of it that we established both the Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme, so that for the first time there will be help for people whose pension schemes have been wound up. I accept and understand entirely the sense of loss, anger and anxiety of those who have lost pensions for which they have paid for many, many years, but we have been asked to give, on behalf of the taxpayer, a &#163;15 billion commitment and we simply cannot do that in circumstances where the reason for the loss is the collapse of the pension schemes themselves.

 What is the point of an independent ombudsman and a report which makes recommendations when the Government will not accept the conclusions?

 Except that, as I said to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, although of course we must and do treat seriously the ombudsman&#039;s findings, we are being asked as a consequence of them to give, on behalf of general taxpayers &#163;15 billion-worth of commitment. We simply cannot do that. There is a review of the financial assistance scheme, which may be able to help some people, and we will expedite that review and do it as quickly as we possibly can, but it has to be understood that, in the end, if we were to stand liable for the whole of that loss, it would set a precedent of extraordinary financial proportions for this Government and any other.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o74"><a name="60315-04_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is precisely because we understand concerns about selection and the possibility of new selection that we have strengthened admissions procedures so that schools have to act in accordance with the code, rather than have regard to it, so that local authorities have the ability to appeal when an admissions policy is breached and so that the admissions forum is strengthened. All those things will mean that, yes, schools will have the freedom and independence we want for them, but within a system of fair funding and fair admissions. I say to my hon.

I come back, however, to the choice that we face. I know that, because it is a difficult decision, the Liberal Democrats will not want to face up to it.

 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to establish a limit on the percentage of household income spent on water and sewerage charges; to provide for the capping of domestic water and sewerage charges so that the percentage limit is not exceeded; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Water and sewerage charges have increased by an average of 48 per cent. in real terms across the country since privatisation in 1989. The increase is an alarming 85 per cent. in the far south-west, mostly due to South West Water having some of the largest infrastructure and environment protection liabilities falling on one of the smallest customer bases. Indeed, the sewerage element of the water bill in the south-west has increased by over 100 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Failure at the time of privatisation to protect customers in areas where disproportionate charges would have to fall under market conditions, and inaction since, have compounded a problem first identified 30 years ago, and the situation is not set to get any better. Presently, households in Devon and Cornwall on fixed and low incomes are finding the &#163;449 average South West Water bill too much to accommodate. Many people in the south-west are spending more than 3 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage bills alone. That situation is unsustainable. It is projected that bills in the south-west will, on average, be &#163;675 within the next four years. That is not only unjust but a wholly disproportionate burden, especially in the context of the low average incomes in the far south-west. In my constituency people earn 23 per cent. less per week than the United Kingdom average, yet their water bills are 33 per cent. higher than the average. The greatest burden is falling on those who are least able to carry it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Water poverty is defined as spending more than 3 per cent. of disposable income on water bills. Nationally this year, nearly 10 per cent. of households were in water poverty, and that is set to rise. It is estimated that by 2010, 40 per cent. of the lowest quintile of earners will be spending more than 3 per cent. of their disposable income on water. Families and pensioners should not have to fear the next water bill to arrive, and worry about how it is to be paid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Those figures are unacceptable. More than 21 per cent. of average-income households in the south-west spend more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage. That is only the burden on the average household; the position of pensioners, families and vulnerable groups is much worse. In Devon and Cornwall, pensioners spend more than 6.5 per cent. of their incomes on water and sewerage before they find the money to pay their council tax, electricity bills and escalating gas bills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">As we know, the council tax protests started in Devon as a result of what were considered to be high council tax charges. A campaign began, with people withholding some of the increase in their council tax. As the Government are well aware, 75 per cent. of a local authority&#039;s income comes from central Government and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1459</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not the council tax payer. An enormous number of people would have to withhold council tax for it to have any impact on local Government services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">There has recently been talk of a similar campaign over water charges. As 100 per cent. of the charge funds the company, not many consumers would need to withhold a proportion of their payment for its share price to plummet. Who would be there to pick up the pieces if a water company went into liquidation following the cutting off of its income stream by its own customers? The Government would have to intervene to deal with the chaos caused by lack of water and sewerage supplies. That is why the issue demands the Government&#039;s attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Pension and benefit rates are supposed to reflect essential outgoings such as payment for water and heat, but national rates do not reflect regional variations. Many reasons and excuses are given for that regional disparity, but there seems to be no willingness to change. The far south-west must bear most of the burden of cleaning up the nation&#039;s coastline: 3 per cent. of the population pay for the cleaning of 30 per cent. of it. Just under 10 million tourists visit the area each year, and local people must accept the knock-on cost throughout the year in the form of higher water charges. Projects in other regions also have an impact on their water bills&#151;for instance, the renovation of Victorian infrastructure&#151;yet their bills are not increasing by as much as 10 per cent. a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">There are a number of ways of helping customers who are stuck in this situation. First, there is water bill equalisation. The precedent in Northern Ireland demonstrates that the Government are willing to consider fairer charging, and a similar method could be introduced in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Consumer Council for Water has said that the circumstances of Northern Ireland and the far south-west are identical in terms of low population, lower incomes and huge coastlines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Under the scheme in Northern Ireland, the water bills of some 200,000 households will be capped at no more than 3 per cent. of their incomes. That will not just help pensioners and those claiming benefits; all households will pay an average of &#163;30 less, and some bills could be as low as &#163;60.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">The principle has also been tested north of the border, in relation to electricity bills. Customers in the north of Scotland were burdened with high bills, due to geographical circumstances that increased the cost of distributing electricity. To reduce this unfair burden, subsidies were put in place, saving the average bill-payer &#163;27 a year and keeping 15 per cent. more people out of fuel poverty. That situation sounds remarkably similar to that of the people of the far south-west: geographical circumstances resulting in a higher utility charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Another option is a payment similar to the winter fuel payment to help pensioners stay out of water poverty. Pensioners are the group worst hit by high water and sewerage charges, and they would benefit most from support. However, such a payment to all pensioners would not target those who need support&#151;those whose water and sewerage bills exceed 3 per cent. of their income.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">So there are many mechanisms that the Government could consider, and which they have shown a willingness to implement in other contexts. They should have a duty of care to ensure that nobody in the United Kingdom lives in water poverty. More than 30 years have elapsed since the problem of disproportionate water charges was first identified, and it is more than a quarter of a century since legislation was introduced in this House to deal with it; sadly, it was repealed prior to privatisation. It is time that action be taken. This issue should not have to come before the House again in 30 years&#039; time.

 This is a piece of typical Liberal nonsense, but it is dangerous nonsense and the kind of thing that we have come to expect from the muddled thinking of the Liberal Democrats. I thought that we had many legitimate concerns these days about water supply. In fact, a current concern here in the south-east&#151;and, I suspect, in other parts of our country&#151;is that the water supply is in some danger, so we should be very careful when discussing the delicate balance that inevitably must exist between consumption of water, the price charged for it, security of supply and future security of supply. The Bill would interfere with all that in a very negative and unhelpful way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">This is a very obvious populist pitch by a rather desperate political party, but we must not be seduced by that, must we? We must remain focused on the vital necessity of ensuring that the relationship between water consumers and suppliers remains properly balanced. I, being a great believer in the market&#151;as the Liberal Democrats used to be but seem not to be any more&#151;believe that the price mechanism is still the best means of maintaining that balance. We have to ensure that water suppliers can achieve enough revenue and be sufficiently profitable to invest in security and cleanliness of supply, and to address the environmental concerns that rank so highly these days, not least in respect of sewerage, which the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">I fail to understand how on earth the artificial limit on the amount that can be charged for water that the hon. Gentleman is arguing for would allow us to achieve security and cleanliness of supply. If revenue is arbitrarily limited, investment will inevitably be limited&#151;unless the Liberal Democrats believe that the difference should be made up by the taxpayer. Perhaps they are prepared to contemplate passing on that additional burden to the taxpayer, turning the clock back to the bad old days when we had insufficient investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure. But I doubt whether anyone, except, perhaps, the Liberal Democrats, would deny that under the new regime we have seen a dramatic and consistent increase in investment in our water supply, for which we should all&#151;householders and other domestic consumers, business and industrial consumers&#151;be very grateful. That would be put at risk if we were to succumb to the argument that the hon. Gentleman made. I am sure that if right hon. and hon. Members were to study the terms of the Bill, they would find it completely unacceptable because it would destroy the relationship that has been built up very carefully between consumers and producers, which provides the investment necessary to ensure that our water supply is continued as we would wish.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_17">Today, I set out before the House a Bill whose very heart and purpose is to give every child&#151;no matter who they are or where they come from&#151;the opportunity to fulfil their potential. I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House will want to make interventions as we go along. I have spent many&#151;mainly happy&#151;hours debating these issues with my hon. Friends and other hon. Members over the past few months, and I will be generous. But with the permission of the House, I will make some introductory remarks before I outline the main provisions in the Bill, after which point I will be happy to take many interventions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">Last month, the parliamentary Labour Party celebrated its 100-year anniversary. Every party has played a part in progress towards where we are now, but it is Labour Governments who have delivered the key reforms, backed by the investment that was so badly needed. We brought in comprehensive education, it was a Labour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, who 25 years ago led the debate on the national curriculum, and this Labour Government introduced free nursery places for all three and four-year-olds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_19">Almost nine years into this Labour Government, spending on school buildings has increased sevenfold, there are 30,000 more teachers and more than 100,000 more support staff in our schools. Thanks to our sustained investment and reform, our children have been doing better, but we must do more. Yes, we have record results at ages 11 and 14 and at GCSE, but still 45 per cent. of children do not get five good GCSEs. Yes, schools in deprived areas have improved even more quickly than the rest, but still seven out of 10 pupils on free school meals do not get five good GCSEs. Yes, we have record numbers of our young people staying on to study at A level, but we still have one of the worst staying-on rates at age 16 of any country in the industrialised world. If Britain is going to go forward in the new global economy, I say to this House that that is simply not good enough. We must do better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">That is what this Bill is about. For the first time, it puts a duty on local authorities to fulfil the educational potential not just of the bright or easy-to-teach child, but of every child. In addition, for the first time in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1463</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>history of this country, this Bill introduces a right to a high-quality vocational education for every young person from the age of 14, reversing the historic weakness in vocational provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">If we want every school to be a good school, and that is our aim, we must act to make it happen, not just hope that it will. This Bill, through its proposals on trust schools, increased local authority intervention powers and stronger pressure to improve, does just that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_22">I turn now to the proposals in the Bill on trusts, one of the matters raised with me most frequently over the past few months. Every hon. Member knows that schools work best when they have an effective head teacher who gives strong and inspiring leadership. This Bill will build on what we know works. It will give heads the powers that they need to forge new partnerships and drive up standards in their schools. Therefore, trust school status will allow head teachers to work closely with other schools, with colleges and with external partners such as universities, charities and business foundations, bringing new energy and commitment to the education of pupils at the school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">Some people, including some Opposition Members, have argued that all schools should be compelled to become trust schools. However, I can tell the House that I will never force any school to become a trust school.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60315-07_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Louise Ellman  (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I am pleased to hear the Secretary of State make it clear that she will not force existing schools to become trust schools, and I should like her to confirm that. However, she has moved away from her initial statement that there would be no new local authority schools to suggesting that there could be new local authority schools, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. What criteria would underlie that approval? How can she convince me and others that the change is more than a change in wording and is, indeed, a change in substance?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60315-07_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I know that she takes this issue especially seriously, and she is right to point out that the Government have, quite properly, made a move in that respect. Some Labour Members, and other colleagues in local government, have made the case very strongly that, where parents want a new community school because they think that that is in their children&#039;s best interests, we should not prevent them from having one. It is right that there should be a route for new community schools, but we must make sure that local authorities really think through what is in children&#039;s best interests. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that the Secretary of State will, of course, allow local authorities that have done that thinking and that have a good track record to put forward such a proposals.
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60315-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend assure the House that her Department will not prevent community schools by the back door, as it were, by starving them of resources? That has happened before, with plans for new schools being rejected unless they have an academy.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60315-07_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can certainly give that assurance. Trust schools will be funded on exactly the same basis as any other local authority maintained school, because they are local authority maintained schools. I will not use my office to force local authorities to go down a route that they do not wish to go down. I will never force any school that does not want to become a trust school to adopt trust status.
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60315-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Blunkett  (Sheffield, Brightside) (Lab):</b> 
 In relation to the establishment of wholly new schools, will my right hon. Friend confirm that it will be possible to use the corporate performance assessment, the Audit Commission&#039;s quality assessment, to vary the approach of the Secretary of State to propositions developed at local level? Those with a high-quality assessment rating would therefore be exempt from intervention by the Secretary of State, on the principle of intervention in proportion to success.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60315-07_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I understand the very interesting proposition put forward by my right hon. Friend. The CPA criterion that he suggests as an objective measure of whether a new community school should be allowed is a potential answer to the problem, and I can assure hon. Members that the use of the Secretary of State&#039;s power will be based on objective criteria that can be judged and scrutinised by the House. However, I am not convinced that the CPA is precisely fit for purpose. For example, a local authority might not perform very well according to that assessment, but might also be improving its educational performance very rapidly. In such cases, it might make sense for a new community school to be proposed. That is precisely the sort of matter that I shall want to discuss further in Committee.

 I thank my right hon. Friend. Many colleagues on this side of the House have been worried about the concept of trust schools, and especially because of the ethical and financial probity of the sort of organisations that may get involved in such schools. We all seek reassurance about that. As the Bill goes through its Committee and Report stages, will she think about introducing an approved list of those who could bid to become involved in trusts?
</p>

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60315-08_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. I can tell the House that there will be very strong safeguards to prevent the acquisition of inappropriate trusts. That is essential. As a result, they will be regulated by the Charity Commission as well as by the local authority. They will be funded by the local authority, which will be able to object on educational grounds to any trust that it thinks will damage children&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1465</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>educational standards. However, perhaps the most important safeguard will be the common sense of parents and governing bodies. They will decide whether it is in a school&#039;s interest to adopt a particular trust. Moreover, I can reassure my hon. Friend about how that accountability will be reinforced. It should be possible to remove a trust if the non-trust governors on a governing body&#151;parents, local community representatives and staff&#151;decide that that should happen because the relationship has broken down.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60315-08_spnew1"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 The Secretary of State said that she would not force community schools to become trust schools. However, if it is such a great deal, can she explain why only 23 secondary schools and one primary school have expressed an interest in becoming trust schools? Those figures were contained in the Government&#039;s response to my request under the freedom of information legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60315-08_spnew2"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Lady that I have spoken to dozens of schools that are interested in becoming trust schools. Only this morning, one head teacher wrote to <i>The Guardian</i> and said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;This is about putting the interests of pupils first, to raise standards and improve outcomes for all. That is why we have such a strong commitment to collaborating with others&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_24">The author of that letter said that he thought that it was his school&#039;s duty to consider adopting a trust. Where schools want to raise standards and see opportunities for doing so within the local authority framework, they ought to be able to do just that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60315-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):</b> 
 On potential inducements to schools to become trusts, there is an element of suspicion about the Waltheof school in the constituency of the Minister for Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), to which children from my constituency go. It has been made clear to the local authority and the local community that unless they accept an academy, there will be no money for a new school. That was the inducement. Will she say explicitly that there will be no inducements or pressures on schools to become trusts schools? Will she extend that commitment to the future provision of academies, so that that sort of pressure is not put on local authorities to accept, with the obvious proviso being that they will not get the money unless they do?
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60315-08_spnew4"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend the commitment that there will be no financial inducement for schools to become trusts schools. They will not benefit from any additional capital or from any additional revenue funding. They will be funded by the local authority under the local authority distribution formula, which is then agreed locally by heads. That is the way in which the system will operate because trust schools are local authority schools and operate within the local authority framework. My hon. Friend has an issue about academies, but it is important that authorities think through from first principles on how to raise standards for children. However, I can give him the assurance he is seeking on trusts schools.

 A few weeks ago in the White Paper, the Government&#039;s position was that there should be no new community schools. Under intense pressure from their Back Benchers, they now say that there can be new community schools subject to a veto. When the pressure dissipates after the Bill is passed, what is to stop the Secretary of State, or indeed any of her successors, changing her mind, going back to the White Paper position and vetoing any new proposals for community schools? Some of us think that that would be a very good idea. Will the Government go back to where they were with the White Paper?
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60315-08_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Clearly, the hon. Gentleman has not been seeking the views of his local government colleagues. He only has to ask Alison King, the Tory chair of the Local Government Association&#039;s children and young people&#039;s board, what she thinks about the proposals for new community schools. She has been arguing that there should be a route for new community schools to be established because that is what is right. I have told the House that the Secretary of State&#039;s judgment will be based on objective criteria. We will have that debate in Committee, where we will examine exactly what the best criteria should be.

 I hope that my right hon. Friend will continue to encourage trust schools. As a former sceptic about city academies, I think that we need to look at the evidence. The evidence of the London academy in my constituency is that since September 2004, GCSE passes are up by 9 per cent. and A-levels by 40 per cent. The academy is now in the top 5 per cent. of schools nationally in terms of progress for 11 to 14-year-olds and in the top 3 per cent for 14 to 16-year-olds on the same intake as it had before. It is now over-subscribed twice over. Some 45 per cent. of the pupils are entitled to free school meals and more than half are from minority ethnic groups&#151;

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60315-08_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend was making a very important contribution, because academies can be vital in raising standards for children in under-achieving schools&#151;the worst schools in the country, sometimes&#151;and who face the most challenging circumstances. Last year, on average, academies improved the results at GCSE at three times the national average, which is why our commitment to introduce 200 academies by 2010 is so important.

 Is my right hon.

Is she also aware that my LEA is putting forward proposals for two academies in conjunction with our beacon status college, Barnfield college? Does she agree that that will assure parents and heads that we have good quality academies coming forward and that we will be able to raise standards in the two failing schools involved in those proposals?

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60315-08_spnew10"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1467</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there is an external partner that could help them to raise standards. That external partner might well be another school. Recently, we had a presentation in Downing street from a group of head teachers who are already working in successful schools, but are helping to drive up standards in schools that are performing less well. That is why federations will be such an important way of raising standards for children and one example of where trusts might well come to be of great benefit.

 On the question of schools collaborating to have a trust, I welcome the statement that my right hon. Friend has just made. May I ask her to go further and confirm that that will entail looking at the league tables and performance measurement of whole collaboratives, not just individual schools?
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60315-08_spnew12"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I agree that collaboration is important. In effect, I see adopting a trust as a way of forging deeper collaboration between schools within the local authority system. For example, if a group of schools decided that they wanted to introduce the 14 new specialised diplomas, mixing vocational and academic studies, they might want to establish a permanent relationship, share staff, set up new facilities and bring in outside experts to help. Our proposal is one way to achieve that.

<a name="60315-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_25">My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) points to how we will have accountability measures that will affect the proposal. First, the Bill introduces a new duty to secure the educational potential not just of the average child, but of every child, taking a real step forward in making sure that all local authorities concentrate on the difficult to reach children and not the easy to reach children. Secondly, my hon. Friend is right about progression. That, too, is important and we are looking at whether we should introduce progression measures to see how children fare after they leave school, as well as when they are at school. These are all issues that complement the five GCSE external accountability measure that is so important for our young people.

I am very concerned that our young people may be pigeon-holed into studying one type of option rather than another, and may not be aware of the significance of the choices that they make early in the school system. Schools must collaborate to deliver real choices within the school system.

 One of the things that concerns me and my colleagues is the issue of double standards when it comes to assessing the suitability of an organisation to develop a new school. The right hon. Lady is absolutely right to say that local authorities should prove their fitness for purpose in terms of developing a new community school. Yet it appears that by putting down &#163;2 million, a crackpot creationist will be able to open a new school and develop an appropriate curriculum.

<a name="stpa_26">Of course, I will issue guidance for decision makers&#151;school governing bodies&#151;to take into account when they consider whether a trust is the right one for them. The schools commissioner, based in Whitehall, will advise schools on the track record of trusts, so that they take those decisions in the full knowledge of what will work for children, but the Bill is about enabling schools that see an opportunity to do the best that they can for their children.

<a name="stpa_27">What I cannot accept for a moment is that there should be top universities in our country cheek by jowl with some of our most struggling schools and that they should not be asked to commit to the future of those schools.

The Government are giving more resources than ever before to deprived schools and deprived children, and we intend to continue to do so. Under the Bill and as proposed in the White Paper, we will spend an extra &#163;500 million over the next two years to support the individual learning of children and the best teaching and learning for this century, because we want to give every pupil&#151;no matter what their prior attainment when they reach secondary school&#151;the chance to catch up with their peers if they have fallen behind, with one-to-one tuition or small group support and, indeed, if they are gifted and talented, the chance to have their talents stretched and their potential reached. The personalisation of teaching and learning&#151;individual support&#151;with the funding geared to those schools that need it most, is an incredibly important part of our package of reforms.

 The admissions policy for most of the secondary schools in my patch is based on catchment area followed by siblings. How is it going to differ in any way if they become trust schools? There is a particular problem in that very popular schools sometimes find it very difficult just fulfilling the demand from the catchment area. Many people in the catchment area want their children to go to those schools, so will they be able to expand? How will the admissions policy change after the Bill? Will popular schools be allowed to expand?
</p>





<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60315-10_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 On the first point, if the policy changes, it will be tougher rather than the status quo. Issues such as catchment areas and siblings will, of course, be the issues that schools take into account, but where a school is deliberately manipulating its catchment area to avoid taking certain challenging pupils into the school, that will not be tolerated in future. Admissions forums will scrutinise what is happening at a local level and will, on a yearly basis, produce a report examining what is happening and whether schools are, indeed, following the code of practice on admissions. The forums will examine how special needs children, children on free school meals and ethnic minority groups are faring. They will submit their report to the schools commissioner, who will review the impact on social segregation in a full report that will be available to Members of the House, so that we can show that we are reducing social segregation through the Bill and not increasing it.

 I do not agree with my hon. Friend. The introduction of the duty on diversity was made to meet a very specific point.

<a name="stpa_45">The hon. Gentleman made a point about evidence forming his position in this debate. Rather than listen to the evidence of the Prime Minister&#039;s mates, will he look at the evidence presented by the OECD in its international comparisons, which shows that Finland, with its comprehensive system of education, driven through community schools, has the highest standards of attainment and achievement? The OECD also concluded that the fragmented systems around the world widen the gap between the achievers and the under-achievers. Why will not the hon.

 I would like to turn to the question of fragmentation and diversity in a moment. I hear a lot about Finland. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I should go there on a fact-finding visit. I would be very interested to see what goes on in Finland because several people have put the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point to me. However, I would be interested to look not only at the structure of education in Finland but at what goes on in the classroom&#151;at what the teaching methods are. I would be interested to see how literacy is taught, whether synthetic phonics is used, how mathematics is taught and what kind of history lessons are taught. I rather suspect that Finland&#039;s standards are so high in the international league tables because of the pattern of education in the classroom which Conservative Members believe in and which has disappeared from far too many of our schools.

 Before entering Parliament, I taught in one of the Conservative Government&#039;s independent state schools, otherwise known as grant-maintained schools. As I have said before, there is no doubt that the autonomy that we were given enabled us to achieve more, but grant-maintained schools operated within a system of inequitable admissions, which is ruled out by the Bill. Is the hon. Gentleman happy that that is ruled out, or does he want to go back to grant-maintained schools?
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60315-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 We have heard a great deal about grant-maintained schools, which have been caricatured. Two points have been made about grant-maintained schools. First, we have heard from several hon. Members that funding was unfair and that new trust and other schools will be funded differently. Let us be absolutely clear and set the record straight. Grant-maintained schools received the per capita funding of current expenditure along the lines inherited from their predecessors and there was no special arrangement whatsoever.
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60315-13_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 What about capital?
</p>





<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60315-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 It is true that they had access to capital on a different basis, because they did not have access to local education authority capital. If the Government think that grant-maintained schools having access to such money was wrong, why do schools receive access to &#163;0.5 million if they decide to become specialist schools? Why do academy schools sometimes have access to more than &#163;30 million of capital? If the arrangement was wrong for grant-maintained schools, why is it a feature of specialist schools and academies? If Government Members oppose that system, will they denounce those provisions as well? No more extra funding was provided to grant-maintained schools for capital than is provided to specialist schools or academies, so let us hear a bit less from them about that.

 Many Labour Members would object to any preferential funding for any school if we are to treat all children equally. The hon.

In a letter to the Secretary of State it said that the Government have missed a meaningful opportunity by emphasising structural change rather than the agreed drive for improved standards, which has already paid dividends, but with which we need to persist over a period of time.

We welcome the fact that local education authorities will now be obliged to conduct competitions for new schools, and perhaps more widely. Indeed, although the Secretary of State has not referred to it, buried in the Department&#039;s evaluation of the costs and the regulatory issues associated with the Bill is the assumption of 100 competitions a year between different providers to offer new schools. We think that such competitions to provide new schools are a very good idea. We look forward to 100 competitions a year, and welcome the fact that private providers, outside organisations&#151;not just charities but commercial organisations&#151;and independent schools can take part in the competitions to offer to provide new schools. It is a good thing to open up British education to far more diversity than has been the case in the past.

It is a pity, unlike our approach of proposing grant-maintained schools clearly, honestly and openly in a manifesto for an election fought on that proposal, trust schools do not appear in the Labour manifesto. We made it clear, however, in our 1987 manifesto&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;1987?&quot;] I have a copy with me. It makes clear what our grant-maintained schools could do. It is true that trust schools do not have quite as many freedoms as our grant-maintained schools, but they are a step in that direction. I would like to remind the Secretary of State of the commitment that we made on grant-maintained schools, and how we envisaged their operation.

 I should like to make progress, as I want to consider two crucial concerns about the Bill. The first, which has been mentioned already, is what we might call the fragmentation concern&#151;that the proposals in the Bill will lead to fragmentation and diversity, which will lead to inequity. That is a genuine concern, and I recognise that Labour Members express it with sincerity and conviction. If I honestly believed that the agenda of opening up more freedom for schools and giving them greater diversity would create even wider gaps in our society than exist at present, that would be a powerful objection to the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_56">However, I have to ask hon. Members who believe that argument, and who believe that we should return to the classic comprehensive model with every child going to their local secondary school, whether that model is as fair and equitable in practice as it is supposed to be in theory. In today&#039;s Britain, the main route for getting one&#039;s child to a good school is to get one&#039;s local priest to sign a chit or to be willing to pay the higher price to get a good house in a catchment area close to a good school&#151;a higher price of &#163;50,000 on average and in some cases possibly &#163;200,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_57">I do not believe that a system of allocation of school places by the power of the local clergyman or the parents&#039; ability to pay high house prices is any basis for a 21st century education system. In a modern, diverse, socially mobile country there is no way we can tie people down to their local catchment area and their local school. They are used to having a range of options and choosing between them. They will search the internet for information about how different schools are doing, and there is no basis on which any of us, on either side of the House, should try to pass laws and regulations to stop them exercising such choice.

 Let me make progress on this very important point, because it matters enormously to us on the Conservative Benches. We do not believe that that old model is any longer a way in which people can credibly claim to deliver social justice. That is why the system needs to be opened up, and why we need to consider a radically different alternative allowing greater diversity and choice.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_60">As an example of such thinking, I quote from the adjudicator&#039;s report on a request to open a new voluntary aided Montessori primary school. He wrote:

<p>
<a name="60315-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_63">Somewhere in No. 10, and perhaps at least with the Secretary of State and her adviser, Lord Adonis, there is a recognition that school adjudicators should no longer turn down bids to run a Montessori primary school. That is not a vision for education reform in the 21st century. The Prime Minister gets it. He is clear about that whenever he makes the case for education reform. It is a pity that, because of her fear of her own Back Benchers, the Secretary of State has been reluctant to make a case for education reform on those lines today. We know that the abolition of the school organisation committee and the new power of schools to compete to create new places are exactly what is necessary to move us in the direction that I have set out.

<a name="stpa_66">We have some concerns about restrictions in the Bill. I shall give two examples&#151;first, the power of the schools adjudicator. The Bill increases enormously the adjudicator&#039;s power to interfere in the decisions that individual schools take, including about their admissions, but about many other matters as well. The powers of the adjudicator appointed by the Secretary of State are so enormous that it would be tempting to allow the powers to go into legislation, knowing that a future Conservative Secretary of State could use the powers of the adjudicator provided for in the Bill to change the education system in the way that we wish. If we simply wanted to come to power with maximum Executive freedom by fiat to change schools, we would use the powers of the adjudicator. I am sure that Labour Members will wish to consider that point.

<p>
<a name="60315-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_67">I do not believe in free-standing executive discretion on the scale that will now be enjoyed by the adjudicator. It is important for those of us on both sides of the House, who believe that ultimately these decisions should be taken by people who are democratically accountable, to consider whether we are content with the amount of discretion that the adjudicator will enjoy under the Bill and, in particular, whether we believe that it is right that there is no provision for any appeal by a school against a decision by the adjudicator. This is one way in which it may be possible for Members on both sides of the House to improve the Bill.

<a name="60315-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_68">Secondly, on the important issue of interviews for admission, the Bill goes even further by explicitly banning, in primary legislation, interviews for all purposes other than the allocation of children to a state boarding school. That ban is already in force through the admissions code, but it is tightened up in the Bill. I recognise that, and I regret it. It goes to the heart of an important confusion in the Bill. The Bill contains tough, indeed draconian, powers on discipline, and, in this day and age, we need to make it clear that teachers have disciplinary powers. But the Government are only

<br>&nbsp;<br>thinking of how to improve order and discipline in a school by giving teachers almost unfettered power to discipline children. There is a better way of ensuring that schools are orderly and can maintain discipline, which is by encouraging schools to have a distinctive ethos and to have parents who are committed to the school and understand its ethos. Being able to invite parents to an interview to establish whether they and their children are committed to a home-school contract is a good way of establishing a commitment to discipline without having to fall back on the severe disciplinary powers proposed in the Bill. We know that a small number of Church schools have historically used interviews in order to establish the religious conviction of parents. I rather suspect that the Prime Minister is aware of such procedures used by schools. It is a great pity that he appears to be committed to a provision that would stop schools doing what the school to which he sends his children has been doing, which seems to us to be a reasonable way for Church schools to establish a denominational commitment.

Those parents are making a choice by opting out. We want people to make a choice by opting in to their local school where the standard of education is such, and where the culture and ethos have been so developed, that parents are proud to say that they are sending their chid to that school. The legacy we inherited was exactly the opposite. Special needs children were forgotten and under-investment and under-achievement were simply taken for granted. I remember what it was like in my constituency. People were not worrying about 25, 35 or 45 per cent. of pupils achieving A to C grades, but 6 and 8 per cent. In the school that is now known as Firvale community school, a specialist school, the figure was 6 per cent. The school had an 80 per cent. ethnic minority intake and the children and parents were told that no better could be achieved. The figure is now 36 per cent. and rising. That did not hurt neighbouring schools. They have transformed their achievements with the same intake they always had. Children will not be bussed from my constituency to the south-west of Sheffield, not just because it is a practical impossibility to get those in the south-west to bus back to my constituency, but because places are not available.

Education action zones focus on disadvantage and they draw in resources from outside business and support from universities. I do not mind at all if HSBC wants to use some of its &#163;11 billion to invest in an academy in my constituency. It will not have to because the seven schools that serve my constituency at secondary level have transformed themselves. They have also formed a new sixth form college in collaboration with the education authority in an entirely new governance model, reminiscent of the trust status that we are talking about.

 I see that I am going to have to repeat myself several times. That was pretty much the first thing that I said, when I explained that we all have to make a choice based on the whole Bill, just as the Conservatives have. They have made a choice on the whole Bill and said that although there are things that they disagree with they feel that it is worth giving it a Second Reading. We have looked at the whole Bill, and I am afraid that we feel that there are too many problems for us to be willing to give it a Second Reading.

<a name="60315-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">Let me return to the word &quot;choice&quot;, which has come up rather a lot. The choice in the Bill, if there is any, is all about decisions at 11. I believe that choice should be a theme that should run throughout the education

<br>&nbsp;<br>system. Even when choice is mentioned, I cannot help wondering whose choice it really is. If one lives in a rural area, much of the hubbub about choice in schools is irrelevant because there are not that many to choose from. For parents in urban or semi-urban areas, whether or not free transport is offered, the crisis at 11 is about surviving the stampede to get into one popular school and hoping that one&#039;s child does not end up lumbered with any of the unpopular ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">That is not meaningful choice. The problem is that if we give schools the freedom to control their own admissions, we will take away what little choice they have and hand it to schools that will have the power to choose their pupils. All the evidence suggests that when schools do that, they choose the well-off and bright children, leaving the others to go to other schools. That is hardly surprising given the incentive to do so because of nationally publicised league tables. If we move further down this route we could completely undermine the comprehensive system.

<a name="60315-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">Let us look at the evidence on admissions and social segregation. From the Sutton Trust, to Simon Burgess&#039;s work at the University of Bristol, to Rebecca Allen from the Institute of Education, the findings are similar. Schools that control their own admissions and perform highly are less likely to take poorer students than the catchment area would predict. The Government will say that they have outlawed more schools being able to select by ability, that they have forced schools to operate in accordance with the new code, and that they have legislated to prevent schools from interviewing in order to choose pupils. That is welcome, but it is not enough. Very few schools use interviews to select pupils anyway. Much more serious are the covert measures such as gerrymandering of catchment areas, name recognition and selection by aptitude, which is really just a semantic sleight of hand for selection by ability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_96">Is anybody really convinced that a code to be published after the Bill will be tough enough anyway? Will it be sufficiently tight? Can a beefed-up admissions forum police it adequately? Will it have the data? Will it be prepared to challenge the data provided?

<a name="stpa_98">Every MP and councillor will know that schools admissions are one of the most controversial aspects of education. Surely that is therefore the one issue that should have some accountability. The local authority is the right place to decide an area&#039;s admissions policies for community schools, foundation schools and city academies. Whatever other freedoms they may have, this one needs a strategic overview.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_99">What about parent representation on the governing body of these trust schools? We know the direction of travel that the Government take on this. Look at academies, which need only one elected parent governor, with all the others appointed. That is no way in which to increase parents&#039; influence on schools.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="60315-17_spnew12"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 If 100 pupils are admitted to a school and 365 are turned down under one admissions policy, and the admissions policy is changed, will not that still lead to 100 pupils being admitted and 365, perhaps different, pupils being turned down?
</p>





<p><a name="st_183"><a name="60315-17_spnew13"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 It will not change how many are turned down. The key problem is the criteria that are used for turning them down and whether those criteria are accountable. Will the brightest children or those with the most well-off and articulate parents be taken? If so, we will have two-tier schooling.
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="60315-17_spnew14"><b> Ms Angela C. Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Lady&#039;s comments about city academies are surprising given that when the Liberal Democrats were in charge of Sheffield city council they opened up negotiations with the Vardy Foundation for a city academy. I would appreciate her comments on that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60315-17_spnew15"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 One of the problems with the way in which the Government run education is that they do not give councils an awful lot of freedom about the kinds of schools that they want to offer in a particular area, so that they are forced down a route, either through bribery or financial incentive, and often through the building schools for the future programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_100">If the Government really want to turn round underachievement and social segregation in schools, they need to look again at the way in which schools are funded. If a means could be devised to target specific funding at young people who are underachieving or disadvantaged, schools would have an incentive to take those young people and they would get the extra resources that they need to thrive. By that I mean not just targeting a local authority or a school but following the pupil. We are looking at how such a system could be implemented in practice. A similar model has been used in the Netherlands and in Finland with considerable success, and I hope that the Government will look in more detail at such methods.

<a name="stpa_101">I want to move on to the roles of central and local government. For all the spin on freeing up schools, it is notable that in the first 70 pages of the Bill the Secretary of State is mentioned in action or possible action more than 60 times, regulations prescribing this and that are mentioned more than 50 times, and the guidance of the Secretary of State is made available 20 times. She is going to be an extremely busy girl. It is hardly localist. We broadly support the idea of local authorities moving to a more commissioner-based role to support increased diversity in the system, but we do not see why they should not also compete to run community schools. That is a local decision that should not be subject to the Secretary of State&#039;s veto or interference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-18_para1">

<a name="stpa_104">Secondly, when local authorities commission other services they follow a standard model of good practice whereby they carry out a needs assessment, then commission services to meet those needs and hold service providers to account. The model in the Bill has been spun as little more than giving local authorities the power to book the newspaper space to advertise the competition. There is a key strategic role for local government here, which has not been adequately acknowledged. This Bill, like the Conservative legislation in the late 1980s, has been driven by 10 years of rising school rolls and increasing levels of distress and anxiety on the part of parents, particularly in the capital, who have found they cannot get their children into a school they that they are happy with. However, we are about to face 10 years of falling school rolls, and we will lose an estimated 500,000 teenagers from our schools in the next 10 years.

<a name="stpa_108">In the short time that Back Benchers get, I should like to concentrate on two matters, the first of which is the background to the Bill. Many words are bandied around about different parties&#039; achievements in comprehensive education. We should all remember with some humility that comprehensive education was a grass-roots movement. It was a passion of people from many parts of our country who hated the 11-plus, and the social division on which it was based, so much that they and local authorities throughout the country&#151;some of them not Labour&#151;changed the situation. National politicians joined in a bit later. Let us be honest about that.

<a name="stpa_109">However, once we had got rid of the inequity of the 11-plus in much of our country, we did not think hard enough about its replacement. Too much of the debate for the past 50 years has been superficial. Let us consider the history of comprehensive education. Last year, I went to Kidbrooke school for its 50th anniversary. It was the first purpose-built&#151;in 1955&#151;comprehensive school in the country. In 1964, Harold Wilson said that now we had comprehensive education, we would all have a grammar school education. That was wrong. We wanted comprehensive education to mean the right education for all the talents&#151;practical, vocational, academic or a combination of all three. Some of us have been slow to tackle that.

We wanted schools that were of their community and responded to skills needs, parents&#039; aspirations and so on, and a fantastic change has occurred since 1997.

We have genuinely changed the commitment.I shall make one party political comment. I sat in the House for 18 years listening to Secretaries of State who would never send their child to a state school tell me, who sent all my children to state school, how well they had done for the state sector.

No measure has ever been perfect. However, we should be proud as parliamentarians that we turned the measure into a good Bill. We made it a rigorous, better and radical measure. I believe in its principles: fair admissions and diversity and choice. What is wrong with that for the communities that we represent? Nothing.

Labour Members are never more ridiculous than when they go blue in the face trying to convince us that the supposed trust schools are not grant-maintained schools, or that the city academies are not city technology colleges, renamed. Indeed, the same legislation was used to introduce the academies that we used to introduce the city technology colleges.

That has been slightly obscured in the wording of the Bill, but let there be no mistake among Members below the Gangway on the Labour Benches: I know how a Conservative Secretary of State&#151;and new Labour Secretaries of State over the next year or two, if they can get away with it&#151;will implement that policy and use those powers.

Before we get to our resounding majority in this debate, the main problem is that the Labour Government are not being allowed openly to express the courage of their new convictions by their own Back Benchers. We are engaged in a curious political exercise this afternoon, but I hope that it will lead the way not to total agreement&#151;there are plenty of details still to argue about&#151;but to a new agenda, a new footing for the education debate. That is certainly what Margaret Thatcher, Kenneth Baker and I, when I was Secretary of State, would have wanted to see 15 or 20 years ago.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am conscious of the fact that the Labour Front Bench, my Front Bench and Members like myself have not yet managed to get the public to catch up with us. It is only too easy for the Liberal Democrats, every time reform is proposed, to get on a platform and oppose all reform and structural change. The easiest way to get a cheap round of applause is to say, &quot;We don&#039;t need to change anything. All we need to do is make our own local school better.&quot; We have spent years doing that, and the present Secretary of State and every Conservative Secretary of State have been driven to the conclusion that that will not just spontaneously happen. We need resources and reform, and we need the system to be shaken out of its complacency about its performance. People do not realise, if they live in a decent area and their school is doing rather better than those in the run-down downtown areas, that this is not good enough. As the Government rightly say, too many schools are coasting along. Some are doing quite well, but they are not doing as well as they should. Diversity, choice and competition

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), although on this occasion he confined his remarks to generality and rhetoric. We heard very little about the outcomes of his own tenures as Secretary of State for Education and as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Those of us who have followed developments in education over many years know that those were years in which teachers and others involved in education, including parents, were desperate because of the underfunding of education and this country&#039;s relatively poor attainment levels in comparison with those elsewhere in Europe, to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred. Those levels are improving significantly, and I would have expected him to acknowledge that the Government&#039;s increase in resources for education has been a major factor in that improvement.

<a name="60315-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_131">I am one of the Members who criticised the White Paper when it was published. I considered it a poor piece of work. It was incoherent in many respects, it lacked an evidence base, and it contained claims and statements that were difficult to credit. It was difficult to understand how local authorities could act as strategic champions for their areas, working to raise standards and to ensure an adequate supply of places to meet parental aspirations, if they were the subject of vilification in some of the background briefing and if their role was being written off as though they were being sidelined. I do not think that that was at all helpful.

</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>recognises the importance of a coherent approach that links what is being done for teaching with the wider &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda&#151;something that appears to be entirely unfamiliar to Conservative Members, whose approach seems to involve ignoring the importance of coherence and interdependence. I think that in future years they will rue their failure to understand the position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_134">I also support the changes that have been made to ensure fairness in selection, a proper role for local authorities and a significant reduction in the bloated and rather bureaucratic role envisaged for the office of the schools commissioner in the White Paper. Nevertheless, one or two fundamental changes are still needed. One involves the Secretary of State&#039;s power to veto a local authority&#039;s proposal for a new community school. I am glad she has accepted that if there is to be a competition for new schools, it must be a fair competition, and that if parents want a community school they should have that option. However, I do not buy the argument that the Secretary of State needs the power to prevent a local authority from proposing an inappropriate scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">Clause 7 provides for that veto, but only in respect of a local authority submitting a plan for a community school. If an authority submits a plan for a foundation or trust school, there will be no veto. If the aim is to restrain poorly performing local authorities, the provision should apply to all types of school. The fact that it applies only to community schools implies that a degree of bias remains, and I think that it should be removed in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_136">I also hope that more thought will be given to the difficult balance that must be achieved between promoting choice and diversity, which I support, and ensuring that we maintain the highest standards of quality. It is not always possible to combine the two. Measures to improve one school may well be compromised and undermined by measures to expand another. In my area, a clear and co-ordinated approach has enabled a hugely successful post-16 campus to be created alongside the sixth forms of a number of existing schools. That co-ordination has ensured the widest possible choice of curriculums and courses, and the maintenance of quality. If there were a proliferation of small sixth forms, all constrained by a lack of resources and unable to provide such a wide opportunity, quality and choice would be undermined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_137">The issues are complex. I felt that the speech of the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), in which he promoted diversity and choice, was a little superficial. He did not recognise that there are difficult challenges to be addressed. Addressing those challenges will depend on local authorities&#039; having an understanding of the issues, an ability to engage with all the parties and the power to ensure a co-ordinated approach not just to education, but to the wider &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda. That is why the crucial role of local education authorities must be maintained, as&#151;I am glad to say&#151;my right hon. Friend and her colleagues now recognise.

 I share the lukewarm support expressed by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford). I shall support the Bill. I am sorry that the Secretary of State is leaving the Chamber: I was going to say some nice things about the intelligence and eloquence of her speech being a walking argument for the highly selective education that she enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_140">Our time is very restricted, and I shall deal with just one very specific issue&#151;what I believe is the failure of the state system to deal with very talented and intelligent children. In my view, that failure has become abundantly clear. I can cite two studies, one of which was conducted recently by a professor of education at York university. He took a sample of 5 per cent. of the most able pupils at key stage 2, aged 11. Of those pupils&#151;37,500&#151;30,000 went into the state sector and 7,500 went into the independent sector. At the age of 16, almost every pupil who had entered the independent sector achieved five A or A* grades at GCSE, but only two thirds of those in the state sector did. At the age of 18, almost every pupil in the private sector achieved three As at A-level, while only 40 per cent. of those in the state sector achieved the same result. It is not surprising that when we look at the entry to really good universities, we see that it is skewed even further. The state sector is letting down bright pupils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_141">Anyone who wishes to dispute that evidence should look at the Department&#039;s own statistics. They show a happy improvement in the percentage of young adults attaining three As at A-level in all sectors. However, in the independent sector it has risen from 17 per cent. to 26 per cent., an increase of just over 50 per cent.; in the selective state sector it has risen from 12.5 per cent. to 20.5 per cent., an increase of slightly more&#151;nearly 60 per cent.; and in comprehensive schools it has risen only from 4.7 per cent. to 5.7 per cent., an increase of 20 per cent. Not only is that group of children being let down by the state sector, and particularly by the comprehensives; the gap is becoming wider. Those in selective schools in the state sector, or in independent schools, are doing better and better as time goes by in comparison with those in the state comprehensive sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_142">That is obviously palpably unfair to the children involved. They are bright kids, who are not receiving the education that they need and deserve to develop their talents for the purpose of their own lives. It is also bad for the country, however. Our economy relies heavily on the development of high technology, and if we are to have judges, doctors and professors of medicine, we need the brightest people we can get. Whatever their background, those people must have the education that is appropriate to them.

<a name="stpa_143">What should we do? Lip service is paid to this issue, and my party talks a lot about streaming, which has its part to play. To judge by schools in my constituency, there is much more streaming than there used to be, but only big schools with a lot of teachers can stream in more than a few subjects, because it is resource-demanding. The Government have a gifted children programme, but it does not do what is called for. People do not want a national academy for gifted schoolchildren; what they want is for the school that their child attends to be able to teach them and to enable them to fulfil their potential.

<a name="stpa_144">Having represented two different constituencies, my view is that a school&#039;s ethos is absolutely crucial. If most of a given school&#039;s parents value education, the children do their homework, they learn from other pupils and there is a competitive academic environment, very bright kids will flourish. Some comprehensive schools have that ethos and almost all independent and grammar schools do, by definition, but it needs a critical mass. The constituency that I used to represent was an inner-city area, and my current constituency is a largely rural, very prosperous middle class area. I wish that there had not been a gap between my two periods of service in this House, but that gap has given me a perspective on both situations.

On examining the percentage of children with special educational needs and the number of unauthorised absences from school&#151;a euphemism for truancy&#151;it is clear that there is not much difference between the two types of school. The problem is the critical mass and the expectations.

I used to say that they were creating an educational archipelago. We all know what can happen in archipelagos. People can lose their way, and those who find a better island in their travels can be sure that it has already been occupied. Of course, as Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#039;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; showed us, people can lose their life opportunities if they lose their way and are stranded in an archipelago.

<a name="stpa_150">On co-operation between schools and the sharing and dissemination of good practice, we in Knowsley have a philosophy and policy of corporate entrepreneurship.

All are concerned that this philosophy should not be undermined by the intrusion of the individual entrepreneurship of school trusts&#151;a danger intrinsic in this Bill but, I hope, one that can be avoided. Rather than a rigid model based on individual schools, we want trusts to be developed in a local context, not spanning local authority boundaries, but perhaps including several schools being federated in trusts. Such co-operation is the spirit, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) said, of the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda&#151;a spirit that consciously aligns with other Bills before the House on child care and vulnerable children.

It is no accident that the title of &quot;director of education&quot; in Knowsley has been replaced by &quot;director of children&#039;s services&quot;, thereby indicating this systemic, inclusive, corporate and holistic agenda. I seek assurance from the Government that that agenda will be allowed to prosper once the Bill is enacted. I am encouraged by earlier remarks by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, both in the House and outside, that that might be the case and that there is the possibility of a strengthened role for the local authority&#151;certainly more strengthened than I feared after reading the White Paper.

Knowsley has established its credentials, demonstrated by its early selection for funding support for the building schools for the future programme, a system-wide reform in a local authority context.

Ministers tell us that progress is being made in secondary education. Every week, they pray in aid&#151;the Prime Minister did so today&#151;the increasing number of good grades at GCSE and A-level. Grades have been improving, as they were before 1997. However, the conclusion that because grades have been improving over a long time standards are rising depends on the heroic assumption that standards are as high at GCSE and A-level as they were in the past. That is not an assumption that everybody finds it easy to make. It may not be comfortable for any of us to say that, but it is not a unanimous assumption&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, I shall ask the Minister directly.

 Labour Members have argued long and passionately over the past few weeks about how to transform the White Paper into this Bill, and those who belong to the Select Committee have done so in a way that I consider to be both constructive and positive. Our passion stems from something deep in our psyche, history and personal experience, as we all have people in our families who have failed the 11-plus or been the first to go to university.

We need federations that will act alongside local authorities, which must be the overall commissioners of education and we must ensure that the Bill impacts positively on all children in a local area.

If we have trust schools, we must make sure that they do not go down the same route. It is important that schools should be subject to the same scrutiny under local authorities.

 A good LEA is the one in the county of Leicestershire, which has never been controlled by the Labour party, so this is not a partisan point. Does my hon.

<a name="stpa_199">It became clear to me that, without significant reform, an education Bill based on the White Paper would not command wide support on the Labour Benches and elsewhere. In his introduction to the White Paper, the Prime Minister quite rightly emphasises the real improvements in education since 1997. Teachers&#039; pay is 20 per cent. higher in real terms. There are an extra 32,000 teachers and 130,000 support staff. There is improved literacy and numeracy. Ofsted reports that the proportion of good and excellent teaching in primary schools has risen from 45 per cent. to 74 per cent. There have been big improvements in GCSE results and more children are gaining university places. All of that has been achieved within existing structures.

<a name="60315-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_200">Recently, however, we appear to be in danger of talking down our own achievements and implying that further progress cannot be achieved or sustained. That is in marked contrast to our earlier education mantra: standards, not structures. Labour MPs and Labour councillors were entitled to ask what had changed, where the evidence was and where the proposals came from. At the last election, in the Labour document &quot;Schools forward not back&quot;, we attacked Tory education policy. The document stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;The current catchment areas used by schools would be abolished and schools would be forced to introduce their own admissions system. This policy would see the end of community based schools and lead to a massive increase in bureaucracy for headteachers, with each school having to design their own admissions process.&quot;</p>

Colleagues who are thinking of voting down the Bill on Second Reading should realise that disengaging from the process at this point is sub-contracting education policy from the Labour party and the Labour Government to the Opposition. That is not something that any of us came to Parliament to do. My message to colleagues still concerned about aspects of the Bill is to stick with it: continue to engage with the process by supporting the Government on Second Reading but reassess the situation when the Bill returns to the House on Report. That is what parliamentary democracy is supposed to be about. We can all make grand gestures on Second Reading but, quite frankly, some of the issues have become conflated.

We all know what happens in some of the oversubscribed schools. People turn up to churches and try to make themselves known to the parish priest.

<br>&nbsp;<br>look carefully at the schools, as I do. The fact is that they band: 30 per cent. the most able, 30 per cent. the middle, and 30 per cent. the least able. They are genuine comprehensives. People may not like them for other reasons, but they are trying to protect their ethos, whether Catholic or Anglican. Why should they not be allowed to do so? Why should the Secretary of State take this great sledgehammer to crack this tiny nut, especially when there are schools in inner London that, unlike many schools, are attracting parents from every social stratum? The Labour party should be in favour of that. It should want state schools to attract middle-class parents. It should not want ghetto neighbourhood comprehensives that middle-class people do not want to go to. Why are the Government trying to change the ethos of the very schools that are successful in difficult areas and are achieving what the Government want; that is, a social mix? I feel strongly about that.

<p>
<a name="60315-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_213">I also feel strongly about the role of the adjudicator. I talked to the Catholic Education Service about this last night. It is extremely worried because the adjudicator will be given untrammelled new powers. I have talked widely about this to headmasters and other people. At the moment, the adjudicator can step in and interfere in the admission criteria for that year only. Under the Bill, the adjudicator can step in and make indefinite changes. It is a huge extension of the power of the adjudicator and the Secretary of State. We should be worried about that.

<a name="stpa_216">Why do we have so little trust in head teachers? Why do we assume that if we give them power over selection, hiring and firing or excluding we will somehow create a load of new grammar schools, God forbid? There are only 165 grammar schools in the country, but 3,500 schools. If we gave powers to head teachers to do as they know best and to run their schools in the way that they believe in, there would not be radical change. Of course, there would be incremental change, and gradually some schools might become more selective, but maybe not. In the independent sector, there are schools that are selective and schools that are not. There are schools that cater for every whim. I cannot understand why, when we have this great opportunity, at the same time that we are creating new trust schools we are loading more control over them. There used to be a cry, &quot;Trust the people.&quot; I say, &quot;Trust the schools.&quot; I say to my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>In Wandsworth, there are a lot of partially selective schools, so I am thankful for the ban on the expansion of such schools. There was an anomaly in the Education Act 1998 that allowed adjudicators to increase as well as decrease the level of selection where it has been decreased since 1998. I see Committee stage as an opportunity to close that loophole.

<a name="60315-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_217">Trust schools seem to be the most controversial part of the Bill. I take them very seriously. Last month, some colleagues and I went to Sweden to look at one of the models for trust schools used by the White Paper team, to see for ourselves and reach our own conclusions. No doubt, we have reached different conclusions, but we have done so on the evidence of our own eyes. Sweden has schools that are fully funded by local authorities. They get the same funding per pupil as local authority schools and are not allowed to charge fees. They are not allowed to select in any shape or form, but they are independently owned. Some are parents&#039; co-ops, some are Montessori-type schools, some are Church schools, but about half of them are owned by businesses. That would be precluded by this legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_218">When those schools were set up 15 years ago, they had three aims: to widen choice, to raise standards and to reduce costs. I shall briefly set out their experience. They have widened choice, mainly by introducing new teaching methods in their curriculum&#151;not only Montessori but many others&#151;which have spread out to local authority schools, too. Some of the schools introduced new specialisms that are also spreading to the local authority sector. Some use personalised timetables and personalised level groups, whereby children are taught not in year groups but according to the level they have reached in a subject; for example, a student could be in year 3 for English and year 6 for mathematics. Those new methods are spreading throughout the system, so there has been some widening of choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_219">Raising standards is a key aim. The schools obtain higher grades than local authority schools, but that is not surprising as, on average, they are more likely to be in higher income areas. They also have higher added value, which research has shown fairly conclusively. The key question is whether they have had any effect on the rest of the school sector. It was said earlier that there was no evidence, but in Sweden there certainly is evidence that the existence of those free schools&#151;only 8 per cent. of the total&#151;has raised standards in local authority schools. The evidence is not wholly conclusive; there have been four studies, not all of which reached a statistically significant conclusion, but those that did so show that the rest of the system has improved. That is mainly because the free schools are more likely to be innovative, which acts as a spur to innovation change in the local authority sector, where schools are changing in directions pioneered by the independent schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_220">In terms of reducing costs, the schools have been a complete failure. At first, in some areas, they succeeded in reducing costs, but the costs have now increased. Local authority schools have had to raise their game to compete with the nearest independent school and have had to carry a fair amount of overcapacity to make choice a reality. What some people considered a way of reducing costs has turned out to be more expensive, which causes planning difficulties for local authorities. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1522</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>They do not know how many children will be enrolled in their schools in August or September because the independent schools are in the market, too. Overcapacity may be the price we have to pay for real choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_221">The independent schools make up 8 per cent. of the total and only 4 per cent. of them are business-owned, so it would not be right to make grand claims on their behalf. However, we have to face the possibility that the existence of even a small independent sector may be a spur to improvement throughout the system. I have no brief for private providers in public services. In my ideal world, the public sector would provide all public services, but we have to be prepared to look at the evidence.

<a name="stpa_222">Until 1999, only 4 per cent. of students at a school in my constituency were gaining A to C grades at GCSE&#151;the sixth lowest in the country. No school in Liverpool, Manchester or Sheffield had such bad results. The school has now been turned around and the number is up to 30 per cent., which is a great achievement, but 70 per cent. of students still fail to achieve the basic A to C grades. If we are failing 70 per cent. of our children, and there is any chance that an innovation could raise the quality and standard of education for low income people, there is nothing I would not do to achieve it.

Despite the fact that the Government are denying to the people of Northern Ireland what we want for them, we are prepared to support a Bill that will at least move towards it in England.

However, it is not funding alone that creates change. I do not want to repeat the statistics that we hear bandied backwards and forwards between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition at Question Time about what is happening to schools.

Allowing bad schools to shrink and good schools to expand will improve efficiency and provide incentives for change. Permitting schools to apply for trust status will bring greater expertise and resources&#151;not just money, but other resources&#151;into the system. Encouraging schools to have that autonomy will give good leaders the opportunity to make the changes that they know are needed to improve the situation in their own local area. The enhanced disciplinary powers for teachers are welcome, given that 41 per cent. of parents indicated in a recent survey that they are concerned about school discipline.

However, I take some joy from clause 40, which allows for auditions or oral or practical tests. That, to me, is selection of a sort; the Minister can call it what she likes.

<a name="60315-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_234">Our actions so far in government have told us what makes a good school: strong leadership, well-supported staff, a balanced intake and parental support. Too many schools do not have all those elements, but autonomy and parental choice alone are not likely to deliver them. There is simply no evidence to show that the exercise of choice drives up standards. It is possible for choice, diversity and good schools to co-exist, as happens in Sweden. However, there is little evidence to show that parents choosing between different schools or schools competing for pupils drives up standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_235">There is evidence to show that choice increases social segregation. Some people respond to that by saying that we should stop choice. I must say to my colleagues who feel like that that it is a non-starter. Although many parents do not especially want to exercise choice, they undoubtedly wish to feel that they have a choice. It is a political dead end to believe that we can solve our school problems by removing choice from the equation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_236">The challenge for us is to deliver a genuine choice of good schools. Choice itself does not ensure that schools are good. Successful schools will have a balanced intake. They are what we used to call &quot;comprehensives&quot; before that went out of fashion. The evidence suggests that comprehensives work. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), when speaking about The Oratory&#151;a school of which I had not heard previously&#151;tried to defend it on the basis that it sought a comprehensive intake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_237">One of the most distinctive things that has happened with academies is that schools that used to have an entirely disadvantaged intake now have a balanced one, and the Government say that they produce better results. I wish that we had been more prepared to argue that schools with balanced intakes were more successful for more pupils than any other model of education, and then set about finding the best strategies to achieve balanced intakes. As I said, I do not believe that one can do that by removing choice and saying, &quot;You&#039;ve got to go to that school&#151;end of story.&quot; That will not work. We must win the argument parent by parent and school by school throughout the country.

We have done enough so that in the areas where local authorities and others wish to do so, we can begin to devise local strategies for developing schools with balanced intakes. We will have information, monitoring and the admissions forums to take forward the campaign for a better sort of education. All of us, working together, have helped to achieve that in the past few months.

The Secretary of State has given us assurances that will provide some constraints, although not all the ones that I would have put in if I had been asked to write the Bill. However, I was not asked to write the Bill, so I am working with the one that we have got.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_240">When building on the Bill, we need to go beyond the idea of having a statutory admissions code. That is a building block for making the argument about a balanced intake. We then have to determine at local level how we should develop an approach that genuinely persuades parents that schools with a balanced intake are better for their children&#039;s education. There are elements in the Bill that will be important in enabling us to do that. I would almost throw the whole Bill away if I could keep the powers that will enable us to intervene quickly on schools that are beginning to fail, but have not yet been condemned by Ofsted. Too many children have suffered in schools that have drifted for two, three, four or five years before anything was done about them. The ability to get in there quickly is important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_241">There is not a lot about personalised education in the Bill, although the flavour of the concept is there. It involves the ability to give a guarantee to parents that their child will not disappear into the morass of a school that offers a lowest-common-denominator education. That is a key part of the strategy to develop schools with a balanced intake. For that reason as well, I believe that there is enough in the Bill to illustrate that we have made progress since the publication of the White Paper and that we should support it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_242">I wish, however, that the Bill had gone further. It is not enough to aspire to co-operation between schools. One of the big dividing lines between Labour Members, certainly on the Back Benches, and the Conservatives is that the Conservatives celebrate the independence and irresponsible autonomy of individual schools. We, however, believe that it is essential that schools collaborate across an area and take responsibility for the achievements of all children. I wish that the Bill had gone further in regard to the powers to require schools to form federations and to take responsibility for working together. I hope that, in the course of the Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament, we can diminish those deficiencies.

<a name="60315-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_243">When I decided to become a teacher, the first class that I faced before I did my postgraduate certificate was in a secondary modern school. I was horrified at the poverty of aspiration in the people in that school, from the teachers and parents to the children. That experience motivated me strongly to believe that we had to do something about the problem. During the course of that year, I passed a term at Leeds grammar school, and a more traditional and excellent school one could not find anywhere in the 1960s.

<a name="stpa_244">I am glad to say that, because my first full-time education was in Scotland, I am a Scottish-registered teacher. I recognised within about five minutes an enormous difference between the approach to education in Scotland and, in particular, the approach in England in the 1960s. During my 16-year education career, I also learned an enormous amount&#151;as a governor of schools in the old Inner London Education Authority&#151;about education at all levels and for those of all ages. I realised how privileged I had been in my own education; I also realised what I wanted for my children and for other people&#039;s children.

I have a great admiration for the grammar school system throughout the country. Grammar schools make an enormous contribution and I hope that we shall see no diminution of support for them, although I do not believe that there will be any particular call for their re-establishment.

<a name="stpa_249">What I particularly like about the Bill is that it will do things for my rural constituency as well as other constituencies. I do not agree that it is a London-centric Bill, although I know that that worries many people. For instance, clause 7, entitled &quot;Invitation for proposals for establishment of new schools&quot;, is right on for the problem that we face in rural constituencies such as mine. Following the Government&#039;s &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; initiative and the one-school pathfinder project, my local education authority was told, &quot;Here is &#163;20 million: build us a new secondary school.&quot; There was then a frantic competition. The LEA had to choose one secondary school among dozens that needed rebuilding. Last week, my constituency lost out&#151;for all the wrong reasons. It was not that we do not need new secondary schools; we need at least two rebuilt secondary schools, or completely new schools. Good luck to Melksham: it won and we lost. It should not be like that, however, and I think that the Bill will enable us to overcome such failures in the system.

<a name="stpa_250">I am also delighted that school transport is being tackled in a more constructive way for the first time. I particularly like clause 11, &quot;Establishment of school as a federated school&quot;. We have huge problems in rural schools, especially primary schools. We simply cannot go on having little village schools with 40, 50 or 60 children when more than 50 per cent. of children are brought in, unsustainably, in 4X4s from the surrounding market towns because their parents happen to like a particular school with a particular head teacher at a particular time, and it is a brilliant school. I do not want us to experience the traumas that we experienced in the village of Farley last year, or those that we are experiencing in the village of Redlynch this year. I want to see an approach like that in the village of Broadchalke, where there is to be one big school that will look after the needs of a large number of villages in the Chalke valley west of Salisbury.

Thousands of the children of our service men and women are served very well by the service schools education authority. The Education Select Committee is not allowed to investigate service schools because they are a matter for the Ministry of Defence, and I am glad to say, as a member of the Defence Select Committee, that we are going to investigate service education.

 I listened with interest to the speeches from the Government and Opposition Front Benchers, and noted in particular the supportive tone of the latter and of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who waxed eloquently about consensus. I should point out that I speak today more in a spirit of sorrow than of anger. Labour has, as many colleagues have said, a very good record on education. Huge extra resources have been pumped into improving buildings, classrooms and equipment, and into providing many more teachers, smaller classes and steadily rising educational standards. There are certainly aspects of the Bill that build on that foundation. For example, it contains a welcome emphasis on personalised learning, makes clear the Government&#039;s impatience with coasting and failing schools, and demands proper rules of discipline. It is also concerned with improved nutritional standards and the restoration of vocational education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_255">All that is clearly excellent and should be supported, but the Bill&#039;s central thrust is based on a rather different philosophy: a competitive market model opened up to external sponsors and driven by parental choice. That model, which will give popular and successful schools their head as the engines of innovation and change in the locality, has clear and distinctive drawbacks and disadvantages that have been widely publicised ever since the far-reaching nature of these proposals was first divulged in the White Paper. It was not divulged beforehand, and certainly not in Labour&#039;s election manifesto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_256">However, it is fair to say that since objections to that model were extensively voiced in the Labour party and outside it, the Government have engaged in discussions to try to deal with some of them. In my view, they have done so. On admissions, they have now agreed to a ban on selection not only by ability but by interviews, which is clearly important. Schools will now be required to act in accordance with the admissions code, and not merely to have regard to it; however, we have not seen the content of the code to which they are obliged to have regard.

<a name="stpa_257">The sheer length of the last admissions code&#151;at the time of its withdrawal it was more than 70 pages long&#151;illustrates some of the difficulties involved in trying to close all the loopholes that undermine a fair and balanced admissions policy within an open market system. In such a system, will the admissions forums be sufficiently robust and effective to counter pressure from high-performing schools against including a fair share of children from poorer and more difficult backgrounds? I, for one, have my doubts about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_258">On expansion, the White Paper envisaged popular schools being free to expand with little or no regulation, and with few if any limits on their size. It is now proposed that local authorities should be responsible for lifting standards in weak or failing schools&#151;which is much better&#151;and that they can take consideration, as they should, of the overall educational performance of all schools in the area. However, in an open-market system, it is all too likely that the capacity of local authorities to do so effectively will be undermined unless we write into the Bill criteria such as no damage to surrounding schools and no impairment of the local authority&#039;s efficient use of resources. At the moment, the Bill does not include such criteria. When local authority intervention fails, a school that has been made unviable can be closed and replaced, but only at the expense of struggling with increasingly inadequate education over several years. I, for one, regard that as too high a price, both for teachers and for children.

<a name="stpa_259">On governance, the founding of independent trust schools would represent an irreversible transfer of public assets to external sponsors, be they businesses, charities or faith groups, for which there would be little or no public accountability whatever policies they might pursue. The important point has been made that if there was evidence that coasting or failing schools, which are a major concern, would routinely and reliably be transformed by taking on trust status and, crucially, that the overall educational performance of all the schools in the surrounding area would also be lifted, the case for the change would be strong. However, there is no such evidence. The Education and Skills Committee, in a very good report, considered all the evidence and concluded:

As has been said&#151;and it is relevant because the OECD evidence is widespread&#151;Finland and other Scandinavian countries have the highest literacy and education standards in the world. Finland has a fully comprehensive system, based entirely on community schools. I know that my hon.

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), I think that the Bill is, on balance, a good thing. It is a small step in the right direction. I have several reservations about it, but in some ways the saddest aspect of the Bill is the extent to which it now falls short of what was promised in the White Paper. In particular, having seen how charter schools in some of the most deprived areas of the US work incredibly well, I was excited to read what the Prime Minister wrote in his foreword to the White Paper. He pointed to the successes of charter schools, and to the success of school choice in Florida, so I was sorry to find that the Bill did not contain any of that radical edge. I hope that we will try to restore it as the Bill goes through the House.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">Here are the facts. Last year, 70.2 per cent. of children in Trafford gained five or more A* to C grades at GCSE. That compares with 51 per cent. in Bolton, which is represented by the Secretary of State, or 56 per cent. in Worcestershire, where the constituency of the Minister for Schools is situated. In Bury&#151;and I see that the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) is in the Chamber&#151;where the social profile is broadly similar, the figure is 58 per cent. In Trafford, a wholly selective area, more than 70 per cent. of children get five or more good GCSEs.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and he will know that I was responsible for education in Trafford from 2000 until 2004. The statistics that he has read out are very impressive, but I have to tell him that we encountered many difficulties. We had problems with admissions, as some schools were oversubscribed and it was very difficult to get looked-after children or those with special needs into them. That was one of the most difficult jobs in the country. Moreover, in the period when I was responsible for education in Trafford, there was always one school that was failing or subject to special measures. The hon. Gentleman must be careful when he quotes those statistics, as there is a danger that they are partial and do not take account of the problems that the Trafford system caused.

 The hon. Lady is absolutely right; there are problems and difficulties with any system of education. The point is that, in Trafford, we managed to overcome those problems and get the best results in the country. The hon. Lady should be pleased about that.

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_270">The rigour and transparency of selection helped to ensure high standards of primary education long before the publication of performance data. Equally striking is the extent to which these high standards are maintained throughout a pupil&#039;s school career. Richmond-upon-Thames tops the league table for primary schools; Trafford is second. Yet at GCSE level, Richmond slides down the rankings to 69th place, with only 55 per cent of children getting five good GCSEs. Trafford maintains the momentum; we continue to top the table at GCSE and at A-level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_271">None of this, of course, is new. We heard an excellent speech earlier about the Northern Ireland selective system, which gets the best results in the whole of the United Kingdom. Last year, even the DFES admitted that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;between the ages of 11 and 15, pupils in wholly selective local education authorities make more progress than pupils in partially selective or non-selective authorities and that extra progress equates to pupils in wholly selective LEAs achieving approximately two grades higher in one GCSE than in non-selective LEAs.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_272">The fact is that selective LEAs do better for all children across the board. If seven out of ten children in Trafford can get five good GCSEs, why not in Oxfordshire, where only half of children reach that level? If seven out of ten children in Redbridge, with selection, can get five decent GCSEs, why not in Hampshire, Westminster or Manchester&#151;or why not in Bristol, where only half as many children get five good GCSEs as those living in Trafford or in Redbridge?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_273">We all know that the same few LEAs dominate the top of the table for GCSE achievement: Trafford, Redbridge, Sutton, Buckinghamshire and Kingston upon Thames, all of which are selective. The case for selection has been made as eloquently by the Government&#039;s own value-added tables as by anything else. The value-added tables had been expected to knock the grammar schools off their perch. But between the ages of 11 and 14, of the 21 schools adding most value, 18 were grammar schools and the other three were independent. If value-added tables were a wheeze to show the effectiveness of comprehensives, it did not work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_274">Of course some comprehensives do work well&#151;usually ones where pupils are taught in classes set by ability, because pupils learn better when they are engaged at the right level of ability. That is the way grammar schools operate; if grouping pupils according to ability within schools is effective and desirable, it should be acceptable also to group pupils according to ability between schools. What matters is what works. Perhaps that is why today&#039;s ICM poll shows that 70 per cent. of the public would like more grammar schools, while only 21 per cent. oppose them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_275">Trafford&#039;s outstanding results are achieved not just because of the grammar schools, but because of the quality of the high schools that stand in the place of the failed secondary moderns of the 1960s&#151;proud, high achieving schools with a rich pattern of specialisms,

<br>&nbsp;<br>from sport to technology. We can judge the effectiveness of the high schools by the results that they produce. Do not forget: the most academically inclined children have gone elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_276">The national average for children achieving five good GCSEs in 2005 was 57 per cent. Ashton on Mersey high school in my constituency, also a specialist sports college, easily beat the national average: 62 per cent. of pupils got five good GCSEs. Down the road at Wellington, 73 per cent.&#151;16 percentage points above the national average for children of all abilities&#151;got five good GCSEs. Children at Trafford&#039;s high schools are receiving a better education and getting better results than at most comprehensives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_277">Indeed, if you exclude the performance of Trafford&#039;s grammar schools, with roughly the top 40 per cent. of the ability range, the high schools on their own would come 65th out of 148 LEAs in England, ahead of Richmond-upon-Thames and many others.

 We have moved on a long way from the rhetoric of the White Paper six months ago. Some of the White Paper&#039;s language could have been lifted directly from the speeches of Sir Keith Joseph in about 1981, shortly before he made his terrible speech in Preston and argued that all women in social classes D and E should be sterilised, as the solution to the problems of the welfare state. Nevertheless, we have moved on since that early rhetoric. I commend the Secretary of State and her ministerial team for the way that they have listened to the criticisms from a wide range of sources to try to convert the White Paper into a Bill that is practical and workable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_279">Perhaps the key moment during the past six months, when we saw that we were moving in the right direction, was when the Secretary of State came to the Select Committee on Education and Skills and made the very simple and straightforward point that, regardless of the rhetoric about trust schools and the brave new world promised in the White Paper, in reality a trust school would be no different from the existing category of foundation schools that already have their own foundations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_280">In fact, trust schools will be simply a subset of foundation schools.

Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher): the emphasis on curriculum reform, particularly at key stage 4, and on the personalisation of the curriculum and the measures on school discipline. However, there are controversial issues about the governance of schools, the role of local authorities and the admissions policies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_282">Although we had genuine concerns about those issues six months ago, the Government have responded to them. Local authorities will be able to run new community schools, subject to the veto, and it is extremely important that the criteria by which that veto will be exercised are spelt out in the Bill. There are also concerns about the eligible bodies that could become involved in the new trust schools, and it is important that there are measures in the Bill to determine what external partners can become involved. The key criterion is that an external partner should be a charity or a corporate body that already has a good track record in delivering education, not someone who just happens to have a couple of million pounds to spend and wants to inflate his ego.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_283">As the corollary of the tightened admissions procedures already included, it is important that the code of practice appears in the Bill, albeit not necessarily in full. I am not convinced about whether such a long document could be included as a schedule to the Bill. Although it already has 18 schedules, I should have thought that a 19th schedule with the full text of the code of practice would not be unreasonable. The Bill should certainly state the key admissions criteria that are deemed acceptable and those that are not. Of course, the precedent has been established for inserting some criteria in the Bill, such as in the clauses that relate to banding and interviewing.

I pick out the issues of diversity, choice and independence as three of the most important concepts that go unchallenged. I am quite relaxed about schools being slightly different; I am not really bothered what the name on the front door of the school says. I recognise that there is a public demand for a wider range of products and services in all spheres of our public life, but what matters at the end of the day is not the name of the school. In fact, I am not sure that what matters is the school&#039;s ethos, because I get slightly nervous about the term &quot;ethos&quot;. It really is a euphemism for selecting those who are similar to us. However, I am bothered about diversity within the school. If the Government are going to fulfil our absolute commitment to raising standards of education and achieving the potential of all children, we have to recognise the differences among all children, and we have to be able to provide diversity of curriculum and diversity of pastoral care arrangements within each school.

In any system of education, health care or of any other aspect of the welfare state, choice has to operate within a series of constraints. The key issue for Government is to decide what constraints there are going to be and in whose interests they operate. There could and should be such a thing as managed choice that works in the greatest interest of the greatest number rather than a na-ve view of totally free choice, which will inevitably advantage those who are most confident and articulate.

 Throughout the Select Committee&#039;s work, it was clear that the education professionals who appeared before the Committee were in a mood to have reform; they were pro-reform, rather than anti-reform. The Liberal Democrats are not anti-reform either, despite some of the things that have been said during the debate. However, the Select Committee found that the reform that the professionals sought related to improving standards, enhancing quality and ensuring fair access for all. That is why it is a source of great sadness to me that, although there is much in the Bill to be welcomed, it is flawed by its concentration on structural change, as has been said. Much of that appears to be unnecessary and some of it is downright unhelpful and perhaps counter-productive, at least if we assume that the Government want to improve fair access to the best quality of education for all, as I believe they do.

Members may have heard him. Of course, he presented no evidence for the claim, but he explained that the Bill was a welcome step towards &quot;marketising&quot; education. He did not give any explanation of why the marketising of education was to be welcomed. Given the problems that we are experiencing in the NHS, specifically with regard to dentistry, we can see the consequences of dogmatic and inappropriate marketisation.

I wonder whether it has occurred to the Secretary of State that young people who are succeeding at school rarely play truant. Those who are achieving their potential, or on the way to doing so, rarely play truant. Almost exclusively it is the case that young people who play truant, who go on to get into trouble and whose contribution to society may end up being limited are those who do not succeed at school.

The Government should not be surprised that so many teachers and parents in my constituency and others like it stand perplexed in response to the Government&#039;s celebration of choices that simply do not exist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_297">Even for those less rural parts of my constituency where it is physically possible to get to more than one school without resorting to ferries, choice will in essence be meaningless. The Select Committee discovered that the Government have no serious practical plans to expand the most popular schools, so once they are full, they are full. Given that most of the most popular schools are by definition already full, even in this respect choice between institutions is a mirage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_298">Perhaps, however, despite all the watering down of the Bill, the reality is not that important to the Government. Perhaps what matters are the messages. Perhaps the message of the controversial part of the Bill is intended to be a dog whistle to those who consider themselves aspirational and ambitious for their children. That includes me, by the way, so I am listening. The message is, &quot;Whatever we say, this will lead to the opportunity for your child to do better, to take advantage of your aspirations and those of your aspirational school. It&#039;s a desperate shame, of course, for the other dozen schools in your city or town that are non-aspirational and also that the parents of the kids there aren&#039;t as aspirational as you, but that&#039;s not your fault and it can&#039;t be helped.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_299">The Conservatives like that sort of thing, and I would like to think that that is why they are preparing to back the Bill, but it is nothing as sophisticated or intelligent as that. This is low politics. The Conservatives will back the Prime Minister simply to embarrass him, but they could back us and defeat him, and at the same time protect our children from a dangerous slide back to opportunities for a few at the expense of the many.

 There is much in this Bill that is sensible and well thought out and builds on the Government&#039;s excellent progress in education. But I deeply regret that I cannot support the Government&#039;s proposals for trust schools because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1540</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe them to be wrong in principle and flawed in practice. Moreover, I believe that far from improving education for the most disadvantaged children, they will in fact disadvantage them further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_300">There are two things that we try to do in education. One is to pass on the skills that we need to the next generation, but the other is to transmit values to them. One cannot contract out that process&#151;it is one of the basic responsibilities of civil society. Yet that is what we propose to do here. We propose to allow foundations, businesses and charitable organisations not simply to be partners in schools but to own and control them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_301">The proposal stems from two propositions&#151;first, the belief that the current system has failed and, secondly, the belief that the measure will fix it. It is difficult for the Government to argue the first proposition when they keep announcing educational successes. They are right to do so, because the latest Ofsted report makes it clear that the proportion of good or excellent teaching has increased enormously since 1997. The number of schools causing concern or in special measures has fallen, and results have improved. The Opposition hate that fact, as they would rather that kids did not achieve many good results, but the numbers attaining five good GCSEs and better A-levels, as well as the proportion of children staying on at school, are increasing all the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_302">It is therefore difficult to argue the first proposition. There are still problems in the education system that need to be reformed, and I hope to come on to that later. The question is whether the measure offers the right reform&#151;will it fix the problem? Quite simply, there is zero evidence that people who have made a great deal of money are good at running schools. When the Select Committee examined the White Paper that preceded the Bill it said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;No causal link has been demonstrated between external partners and the success of a school, or the independence of a school from local authority control and its success.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_303">The Government have cited the example of specialist schools and academies. Our predecessor Committee said in 2003 that research on specialist schools could not separate the effect of an external partner from the large injection of cash that such schools receive. The data on academies is such that the case for them is still unproven. Most academies accept a smaller proportion of deprived children than their predecessor schools, but while some have improved results, others have stalled and some have produced worse results.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_304">We are therefore being asked to make a leap of faith. In a form of educational creationism we are asked to proclaim &quot;All the evidence is against it, but I believe it anyway.&quot; Doing so, however, would result in the creation of a system that is unfair, does not meet parents&#039; aspirations, and fails to address many of the problems that remain. Despite the work that the Government have done on admissions&#151;I acknowledge that work and give them full credit for it&#151;the key question is who monitors admissions procedure. The Select Committee recommended that it should be local authorities working with school admissions forums that set benchmarks and produce annual reports. The whole process would be accompanied by an annual report to the House. Admissions forums, which are largely ad hoc bodies, are not capable of doing that by themselves, and they cannot administer an extremely complex system used by different admissions authorities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_305">It is assumed that diversity in itself promotes choice, but the evidence does not stack up. Diversity and choice are two different things. In the London borough of Barnet, which has a large number of different schools and admissions authorities, 52 per cent. secure their first-choice school. In my local authority, the figure is 97 per cent. In other parts of the north-west, it is 99 per cent. The evidence for that assumption is simply not there. A great deal of evidence was given to the Select Committee showing that a wide variety of schools increases social segregation and clusters the poorest children in a small number of schools. I am worried about that, and I fear, too, the people who are waiting in the wings to take advantage of the proposal. Make no mistake&#151;creationists and fundamentalists of all colours and creeds are waiting to use the proposal to take over schools. At a time when we ought to bring our young people together and allow them to learn to live together, I fear that we will push them further apart, which would be disastrous for this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_306">There are contradictions in what is proposed. A Government who want to restore community cohesion want to move away from community schools. A Government whose whole agenda for 14 to 19 education, extended schools and even the youth service depends on co-operation between institutions have not accepted the recommendation of the Select Committee to put in the Bill a duty of co-operation between trust schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_307">There is much that we need to do to reform education. We must get our best teachers into the most challenging schools. We must find out why some schools in very difficult circumstances produce excellent results and others do not. We need to manage the transition from primary to secondary school and make the personalised learning agenda a reality through proper training. The Bill is not the right reform to achieve that. It is not a reform for this century, but a return to the notion of philanthropism that applied in the 19th century. When my hon. Friends look at charities, I hope that they will remember that famous Labour saying&#151;yes, it is an old Labour saying, and I am proud of it&#151;that private charity is no substitute for organised justice.

She says there is no evidence of benefit, but that does not mean that there is evidence of disbenefit. She speaks about the percentage of parents in her constituency who are fortunate enough to get the school of their choice compared with those in Barnet, but there is not much choice in some constituencies.

There are regulation-making powers in clauses 7, 8, 12, 17, 19, 22, 24 and 25. If Ministers do not display a light touch&#151;I suspect they may want to treat the regulation-making power with a light touch, although I am not sure that their hon.

 I would probably have joined all my colleagues at the last election in proudly campaigning at every school gate that I could get at to hail the progress made in my local schools. The investment has gone in, and many of the reforms that needed to be made have been made. However, if we think that we have reached a point where we can relax, we are kidding ourselves. I say to my hon. Friends and to the Opposition that if they have any doubt about where we are and the road that we still need to travel, they should go to the Department for Education and Skills website, click on &quot;school performance tables&quot; and have a look, first at every school in their local area and its performance&#151;the website allows that to be done very easily and shows a five-year period&#151;and then have a little roam around the country. Members will see that there is a story to be told that is even more shocking than the 40 per cent. headroom that we still have to make as an average. There are schools that are bumping along, barely getting to 30 per cent, and they have done that for years. Derbyshire is a three-star authority and has done very well in supporting many of the schools in my constituency. Ten out of the 12 poorest schools fit into that category. If one looks more closely, there are schools that are achieving higher than that, but they are coasting. They are still going nowhere. One will also see some schools that are doing phenomenally well, reaching high levels of attainment and making that change very rapidly.

 I welcome the Bill. It is symbolic of the change in this Government&#039;s attitude to education. By freeing the provision of education, putting more emphasis on parental choice and giving schools the opportunity for greater freedoms, it marks a comprehensive departure from Labour&#039;s past. It is a recognition by the Government that to make the next step-change in improving standards, we need to free the education system in this country. We need to harness the accountability that increased parental choice and increased diversity of provision can bring to the education system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_313">For far too long we have relied on centralised control and direction to raise standards in our schools. The measures in the Bill will lay the foundations for a change in emphasis in our education system. The Bill will introduce more choice and more diversity. That will benefit parents and pupils, not just in leafy suburbs, but in urban areas and cities as well. For too long we have allowed education in our inner city areas to be neglected. Too often, education has not been seen as a route out of deprivation and social problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_314">I am concerned that the Government have already made too many concessions since the White Paper and the vision that the Prime Minister set out in its foreword. The concession that the Secretary of State made to allow LEAs to set up new community schools will be used by the weakest local authorities to hide their performance. Local authorities that are strong, confident and proud of the schools in their area will have no fear of new providers. The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) pointed out from his experience of a visit to Sweden that competition from new providers can raise standards, improve diversity in the system and lead to better results, not just in the new schools but also in the schools already in the area. We need to learn that important lesson from experience in Sweden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_315">We also need to say to those people who do not believe that autonomy and freedom can contribute to an improvement in standards that they should look at the value added tables for schools published earlier this year. What type of school was at the top of those tables in raising attainment beyond the expectation of children at the end of key stage 2? The answer is city technology colleges&#151;the Conservative forerunners of academies. Schools with the least freedom&#151;community schools&#151;actually experienced a reduction in standards at key stage 4 compared to their results at key stage 2.

 The Government have a good story to tell about their education programme; about investment, which has never been matched by any other Government, the new building programmes, the record number of teachers and teaching assistants and rising standards across the board. But if we are honest, there is one thing we have not delivered: a rise in standards in areas of social deprivation. The question we face is how to address that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_317">The areas of greatest deprivation can easily be identified. We should be building schools there for the pupils who live there. A pay structure for head teachers and classroom teachers should reflect the difficult and different nature of the job in those areas. We should have something that our public school comrades have always had&#151;class sizes of about 1:12. If it is good enough for them, it must be good enough for us. The important point is that those changes should be carried out in the community itself, rather than bussing kids to other schools. Two communities suffer from that; bussing children out of one area deprives it of a school, while school sizes balloon in the other.

 I want to explore two issues&#151;the value of independence in dealing with poor performance and choice. Information is available on demonstrable demand for independence. An experiment took place in the 1990s, when grant-maintained status was offered with significant financial inducements. We are not repeating that experiment this time, and one must therefore assume that that offer was unattractive to many schools.

<a name="stpa_325">In the 1990s, roughly 3 per cent. of primaries and 25 per cent. of secondaries went down the grant-maintained route, and almost all those schools are now foundation schools. In the past seven years, about 20 schools have converted to foundation status, so the offer has been there, but it has not been taken. In August last year, greater freedom was given to apply for foundation status, but I believe that the Department for Education and Skills is currently considering only a further six applications, which does not suggest that people are battering at the gate.

I understand that the Government intend to introduce no fewer than five of those diplomas by 2008, 10 by 2009 and the full 14 by 2010, which is an ambitious time scale. I simply say to the Minister, in the most positive and courteous spirit, that in view of the need for extensive training for new personnel and for people with workplace experience to translate the aspiration of the vocational specialisms into effective practice, I hope that people will not have their expectations raised only to be disappointed.

However, I hope that the Minister will accept that we need more specifics for this bold educational and social reform.

 In Plymouth, there is real enthusiasm for collaborative work, but the current performance measurement gives people little credit for doing important work that can achieve as much&#151;arguably more&#151;in driving up standards than any single trust or foundation school. All 17 secondary schools, including the three grammar schools and two further education colleges, are part of collaboratives that extend the curriculum pathways for 14 to 19-year-old students. The quality and extent of those opportunities has been complimented by Ofsted. Schools also collaborate on staff training and development, including the training of new teachers. We want to take that work forward in radical new ways that include all our schools, not only the high-performing ones. We are concerned that some of that will be limited by the Bill&#039;s focus on the individual school as a unit of change and improvement.

<a name="stpa_332">Personalisation and collaboration extend choice in the curriculum for parents and students, as well as driving improvement. Such work already addresses postcode selection by mortgage issue, and has the potential to do more&#151;probably more than the White Paper proposals. It breaks down rigidities between grammar schools and the rest of the education community, up to a point, and could do much more in that direction to ensure that no child is ever made to feel that an 11-plus examination is a barrier to their progress. The significant personalisation money&#151;&#163;0.5 billion over the next two years&#151;could work very well with the grain of that and help us to go as far and as fast as any education community in the country. I am among those who accept that we have much more to do.

<a name="stpa_333">In response to my earlier intervention, the Secretary of State said that she would actively encourage such an approach, but I seek her assurance that she will ensure that the money for personalisation and other specific funds is allocated in a way that complements collaboration and ensures that the money can follow the pupil from primary to secondary school. Most importantly, will she quickly find a way of measuring and acknowledging&#151;indeed, rewarding&#151;success across collaborating education communities, perhaps in relation to clause 114(2) to (4)?

<br>&nbsp;<br>at the heart of the Bill lies a structural issue about trust schools. That outweighs everything else in it. I agree with the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who said that we were considering something that was roughly analogous to grant-maintained schools.

I had the honour of speaking about schools for the then Labour Opposition. We defeated the Bill by one vote, mainly thanks to a hapless Whip on the Government&#039;s side, I hasten to add. Nevertheless, we defeated it, and we were committed to removing what we saw as a travesty of educational policy that went under the banner of grant-maintained schools.

If these trust schools are introduced, they will atomise comprehensive, co-operative and cohesive local educational communities. I can put this no better than the head teacher of the Notre Dame specialist arts school, a girls&#039; faith school in my constituency, who wrote to the Secretary of State to tell her that she had missed the point completely, and that trust schools and foundation schools were of no consequence whatever in meeting the demand for raised standards.

At the centre of the Bill are the proposals to devolve to schools new powers and responsibilities, to empower schools to acquire self-governing trust status, and to devolve power and responsibility away from remote educational experts.

It is the children from the deprived wards where expectations are lowest, the children whose parents are not well motivated to support them through education, and the children who leave school at 16 to go into low-paid jobs with low skills and to continue the cycle of deprivation.

It takes an holistic approach to children and is not obsessed with league tables. Father Gabriel, the head, does nothing that could not be replicated in any other school.

 I am concerned about the direction in which we are travelling. The reforms that we have introduced since 1997 are a recipe for success, and success is beginning to come through: 2005 was the best year ever for results. The recipe is based on strong leadership from head teachers, substantial funding for schools and better, more highly trained teachers, working with children who are now motivated because they are in an environment that is more conducive to learning and teaching. The reforms have brought success, so it is standards that we should concentrate on, not structures.

<a name="stpa_359">My fear is that altering the structures, and particularly turning foundation schools into trust schools, will lead to unintended consequences. I honestly believe that there is no evidence to support the argument that competition in education can drive up standards. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) referred to the USA and in particular to California, but he missed out Minnesota. According to research done for the alternative White Paper, the charter school system in Minnesota did not work. Seventeen of its 88 charter schools have closed in the past decade, and the ones that remain open are providing education for better-off people.

 A generation ago, there was a great debate in this country on how we should run the economy. On one side were those who argued in favour of big government, planning and protecting failed industries and institutions; on the other were those who advocated competition, allowing successful institutions to expand and letting industries that were no longer fit for purpose fail. The latter view prevailed because some of the brighter elements in the Labour party recognised that the debate was no longer worth having, and that they needed to adapt. The same is happening now, in that those brighter elements recognise that the values of choice and diversity are also vital to our public services. Fundamentally, that is what this Bill is about.

Who is to say that they will not reverse their position once the pressure is off?

 I will support the Government tonight in the Lobby. The reforms that have been introduced, in terms of diversity and structure, increased powers for local authorities, and parental choice, will all in their different ways drive up standards. The research is clear and outlines the problems. As the proportion of children from low income backgrounds goes up, average results go down. The research explains that children from different backgrounds have very different chances of achieving good results. Those facts must be acknowledged and, when they are, we will have a chance of putting reforms together that will improve standards.

<a name="60315-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_367">In my constituency in low income wards, only 24 per cent. of children achieve five good GCSEs. In average and high income wards, 80 per cent. of children achieve five good GCSEs. Over the past seven years, we have seen a 10 per cent. improvement in low income wards, but at that rate of improvement it will take 32 years for the children from low income families to match the achievement in average and high income wards. That is not acceptable. Reform is not an option: it is an absolute obligation.

<a name="stpa_368">The issue is not investment. We have put that in and we are still struggling to deliver effective improvements in standards for children from low waged families. It is therefore crucial that we improve the structure of delivery. I say that while acknowledging the research based on academies. It is not popular, but I will say it because it is factually correct. In Middlesbrough we have three academies and two of them are seriously delivering. Over three years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of children achieving five good GCSEs. We have also seen parents becoming very involved in the schooling of their children, and that is to

Therefore, what measures will be put in place to help and sustain those schools suffering the drift away of able children to the better schools? How will those schools be protected, and how will they get the extra teachers, money and resources that they need to combat such competition?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_372">Thirdly, how will the schools commissioner ensure that we do not have what might be called post-code trust-school syndrome, by which I mean that trust schools will be in the better areas, and not the poor or deprived areas that really need them? Trust schools are a very good idea, as long as power in the school is proportionate to contribution. Governors will have to make a massive contribution to their schools: otherwise, there will be no point to the changes, and we will have what amounts to merely an academy-light system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_373">Fourthly, governors will have too many duties. Their duties will be enormous, and will prove to be much too hard for ordinary working people and families, and especially single-parent families, to perform. They also need to be paid&#151;not out of school funds, but by the local authority or the state&#151;if they are too to do the job properly, and if working people are to be represented among their ranks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_374">Finally, the power of local authorities needs to be strengthened, not reduced. Only they can ensure fair play for the whole area, with a fair distribution of SEN kids and other children with problems, and expulsions.

<p><a name="st_303"><a name="60315-36_spnew0"><b> Clive Efford  (Eltham) (Lab):</b> 
 I resent some of the comments that have been made to me in this debate about the White Paper and the Bill, as they have suggested that I am somehow in favour of the status quo. I do not support the status quo: I accept that this Government have improved education across the board, in every school in my area. However, I am sure that those schools still occupy almost exactly the same places in the secondary education league tables as they did when those tables were first published.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_375">Much has been said about choice in regard to this Bill, but for whose benefit are we introducing that choice? Who are we empowering to make choices in the education process? Fiona Millar and Melissa Benn produced an alternative paper entitled &quot;Quality and Equality for all Children&quot;, in which they proposed a bounty for children attending schools that attract those who have not achieved higher results in primary education. In support of their argument, they quoted Tim Brighouse, who suggested that there should be a flat rate for pupils, with additional sums for those who had achieved only levels 3 or 2 at primary school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_376">Similarly, Peter Hyman wrote an article for <i>The Guardian</i> on 24 October, in which he suggested that resources should be targeted at schools with the most challenging pupils. We need to ensure that the system drives up standards in those schools, but the Bill does not say how resources will be targeted on those areas, with the specific aim of raising standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_377">The Bill wants to promote diversity, and places an onus on local authorities to do that in their areas. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said earlier, it is a question not of using the Bill to end selection in one sweep, but of challenging discrimination in our education service and removing the circumstances that cause people to opt out. However, the creation of a marketplace in our local education service requires winners and losers and, sadly, the people who will be the losers will be the same ones who have always lost in our education system. The challenge for all of us is to empower those parents so that they can ensure that their children&#039;s education improves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_378">Who are we legislating for? Many parents do not engage in their children&#039;s education in the way that we would like them to. Recently, I visited a primary school in my constituency, where only five parents had bothered to visit any of the secondary schools that their children might attend. We must make sure that we improve standards in such schools, and that we legislate in such a way that they get the resources that they need.

 This has been a fascinating and enjoyable debate, with pro-Bill speeches from Labour and Conservative Members and some passionate anti-Bill speeches from Labour Members. The number of people wanting to participate in the debate reflects the importance that many Members attach to education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_379">This is a necessary, if rather modest, Bill. It is necessary because although we happily acknowledge that there has been a degree of improvement in standards since 1997, there is still a huge amount to do.

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1556</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>It cannot be right that nearly half of 11-year-olds leave primary schools without the necessary skills in reading, writing and maths combined. These children rarely catch up when they go on to secondary school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_380">It cannot be right that despite improvements in GCSE figures, still only 44 per cent. are achieving five or more good GCSEs when English and maths are included, or that the proportion gaining five or more good GCSEs is falling when the core subjects of English, maths, science and a foreign language are included.
</p>





<p><a name="st_305"><a name="60315-36_spnew2"><b> Nia Griffith: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that GCSEs were set up as an amalgamation of O-levels&#151;available to only about 25 per cent. of the population&#151;and the CSE, and that a D is actually the average grade of GCSE expected of a pupil? We must stop labelling as failures the pupils who struggle to get D and E. A child may equally be under-achieving if he or she gets a B when capable of an A. We should be looking at the reasons behind that. Does he agree that we should stop labelling these children, as that is half the problem?
</p>





<p><a name="st_306"><a name="60315-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 I accept the hon. Lady&#039;s point, but no one is blaming the children. Too many schools in this country are underperforming and letting down the very children she is talking about. For example, it cannot be right that employers complain that new graduate employees are writing what they describe as illiterate memos and letters. The National Audit Office has reported that 23 per cent. of secondary schools are underperforming. It is clear that education reform is still crucial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_381">We support the Bill because:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;The system will finally be opened up to real parent power. All schools will be able to have Academy style freedoms . . . No one will be able to veto parents starting new schools or new providers coming in, simply on the basis that there are surplus places.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_382">How could anyone disagree with the Prime Minister when he said that? Even after the unnecessary concessions made to Labour rebels in the Secretary of State&#039;s letter, these essential principles of reform remain as she described them. She said:

 We have a diverse set of opinions in the Conservative party, but we all believe in more good schools. It is important that good schools&#151;schools that are over-subscribed by 10 applications for every place&#151;are allowed to expand if they wish. It is important that committees made up of people with a vested interest to maintain the status quo are not allowed to veto such expansion. That is why we welcome the abolition of the school organisation committees in clause 27 and the abolition, in effect, of the surplus places rule.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_385">The Steer committee has made some important recommendations about giving teachers statutory powers over discipline, and we welcome the fact that the Bill contains those new powers. Good behaviour is crucial to raise standards in our schools. However, we have some serious concerns about parts of the Bill. It is over-prescriptive on admissions, reflecting a world view that the quality of a school is driven by its intake, rather than by the quality of its teaching and leadership. The school adjudicator&#039;s powers, which are increased in the Bill, need to be tempered by a right of appeal. We will table amendments on those issues and amendments to undo the unnecessary concessions in the Secretary of State&#039;s letter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_386">Despite all the measures in the Bill that make it easier to establish foundation schools, trust schools and academies, the Conservative party could have taken the view that, because the Bill did not go far enough, we would oppose it. With a looming Labour rebellion, that approach would have ended up with the Bill being defeated. We could have formed an unholy alliance with Labour&#039;s rebels in the No Lobby. The public loathe that kind of politics. Such an approach brings politics into disrepute and is deeply cynical, and my right hon.

<a name="stpa_388">The Secretary of State has written to my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) to ask why, if we support the Bill, we oppose the programme motion. We oppose the programme motion, because we almost always oppose programme motions, as they are an affront to the procedures of the House. It would be wrong therefore if we failed to oppose this programme motion simply because we happen to support the Bill. Some of the concessions made to Labour rebels that were agreed behind closed doors should be debated more fully on the Floor of the House&#151;issues such as the powers of the unelected schools adjudicator; the outlawing of interviews by schools, even interviews that help to enforce home-school contracts, which are particularly important in raising standards in inner city schools; and, of course, the concessions on community schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_389">Those concessions were negotiated by the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), who is the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education and Skills, on which I had the pleasure to serve.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_390">A similar point was made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#151;a former Secretary of State for Education and Science&#151;in an excellent speech. He said that we may now be moving towards a consensus, perhaps one that is 20 years too late, and that we should try to build a consensus on how we tackle low expectations and poor leadership and standards in schools, such as those referred to by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), where only 8 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs in the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_391">Consensus was also sought by the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), in a very powerful and passionate speech, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson), whose speech was very different from that of the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter). I was surprised by the speech of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), who leads on the issue for the Liberal Democrats. She agrees with the provisions on discipline and vocational education, yet she is pledged to vote against the Bill. She also agrees with not serving mechanically recovered turkey, yet she is pledged to vote against those provisions in the Bill. Perhaps her predecessor and fellow Liberal, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), hit the nail on the head when he said, in the shortest speech that I have ever heard him give, that this was a Tory Bill. In a very thoughtful and candid speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made a similar point when he asked how Conservative Members could vote against a Bill that promotes diversity and choice. He, indeed, is right.

Despite 40 per cent. of the children in Trafford going on to grammar schools and Wellington school taking some of the other 60 per cent., 73 per cent. of its pupils achieve five or more grades of A to C at GCSE. It can be done.

<a name="stpa_394">In a highly effective three-minute speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) made the key point that we need more good schools. My hon.

We need to ensure that the curriculum is rigorous and that pupils are set by ability so that the less able have the time and space to learn and the most able are stretched to their full potential.

 I start by thanking all the Members who contributed to this very lively debate. I am not surprised. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) suggested, education is the passion that brought many of us into politics. This debate has built on the important debate that we had since we published the White Paper and up to the publication of the Bill, a debate that involved parliamentary colleagues. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) and the work of the Education and Skills Committee in taking forward that debate.

<br>&nbsp;<br>frankly wrong to ask people to vote against the programme motion, as is the Conservative party. The programme motion sets an end date for consideration of the Bill in Committee. I know that some colleagues are worried that that might limit the time available for scrutiny, but I can assure them that the number of Committee sittings and how long they last is not in the motion. We have already said to Opposition parties that we are prepared to be flexible about this matter to ensure that the Bill has all the scrutiny necessary in Committee and two days for Report stage and Third Reading on the Floor of the House. I ask my hon. Friends and others to support the programme motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_401">During the debate, many colleagues have contributed their experience as teachers, governors, local councillors and parents. I taught for 11 years before coming into this place. I taught in the lean years, when funding per pupil was falling in real terms, when we used to run around putting buckets under leaky roofs, and when the four in 10 11-year-olds who came into secondary schools without the necessary levels of English and Maths sank or swam&#151;and usually sank&#151;on their own. So, although I welcome support from wherever it comes in the House, quite frankly I would not depend on Tories to deliver our shared ambition to provide the best education for every child, wherever they live, whatever their background.

Well, there is one thing that can be said about those years: at least then Tories used to vote with the courage of their convictions. Tonight, they will be voting with the courage of our convictions, because the Bill builds on the hard work of staff, governors, school leaders and local authorities throughout the country, backed by Labour Government investment and reform, which has led to the best ever results, more young people staying on and getting on, and fewer failing schools.

<a name="stpa_403">For this Government, however, good enough has never been good enough. While there are still seven out of 10 young people on free school meals who do not get five good GCSEs, while too many leave education and training at 16, and while where someone comes from still determines where they will get to, there is more to be done, and only a Labour Government can do it.

When a trust school wishes to dispose of non-playing field land, it will have to inform the local authority, which will be able to object or claim a share of the proceeds. If a trust is removed, the assets will revert to the governing body or, in the case of school closure, to the local authority.

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_413">I turn now to the issues raised by several hon. Members about the role of local authorities. This is a Bill that enshrines the role of local authorities as the champion of parents and pupils, and as the guarantor of standards&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) rightly challenged hon. Members to look to improving standards in their constituencies. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) that the tougher powers for local authorities to intervene earlier and more strongly where schools are failing will apply to all schools whatever their status. There is also a key role for local authorities as the strategic leader of local services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_414">In very thoughtful speeches, my right hon. Friends the Members for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) and for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) rightly argued for the important role that local authorities can play, first, of course, in planning places and particularly in relation to expansion. It has been possible for all categories of school to publish expansion proposals since June 2003, but that is not an unfettered right. What is new is that the Bill provides for the local authority, in its new role as a champion of parents and pupils, to take responsibility for school organisation decisions, rather than the school organisation committee. In reaching any decision, the local authority and the school adjudicator will take into account the impact on overall standards in an area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_415">My right hon. Friends also argued strongly for local authorities to bring together the elements of their responsibility for children&#039;s services and for delivering on our belief that every child matters, alongside their role in commissioning schools. That is a key area of the new strategic role for local authorities, which is why every school will have a duty to pay regard to the children and young people&#039;s plan produced by the local authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_416">Several of my hon. Friends raised the issue of community schools and local authorities&#039; ability to propose the establishment of such schools. May I reiterate what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said this morning? We are content to explore in Committee whether we should set out in legislation&#151;and, if so, how&#151;the factors that the Secretary of State must consider in reaching a decision about whether to allow a community school proposal to proceed. Finally, the Bill guarantees fair access to the system of higher standards that we believe that we can build through its provisions and our reform programme. It will do so not just for people who can afford to move house for it or who can afford to pay for it but for everybody.

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_417">My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), throughout the debate and in a very thoughtful speech this evening, has emphasised the need for fair admissions, and we have included that in our objective. I assure my hon. Friends that we can consider in Committee the detail of the admissions code and the criteria that will apply to it, as my right hon. Friend spelt out. Some hon. Members expressed concern about the way in which the admissions forums will work in their new strengthened role, but we can look at regulations on reforming admissions forums so that they can play that role not only by referring schools to the adjudicator and producing an annual report but by establishing a collective commitment to fair access across a local authority area. Those are all important questions, and I give the House a commitment that we can consider them in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_418">The Bill is about delivering equity alongside excellence. It is about delivering less selection and more opportunity. Ironically, if Members vote against it this evening they will vote for weaker admissions arrangements. It is a decisive move away from the policies previously embraced by the Opposition&#151;a grammar school in every town; a few grant-maintained schools opting out of the local family schools and receiving the differential capital funding available at the time; and a passport out for a few children, rather than the drafting in of support for the many.

 I have already welcomed the Opposition&#039;s support. While I am glad that they are trying to put their past behind them&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There was some uncertainty among Opposition Members about the issue, and some of them have been brought kicking and screaming and flipping and flopping to our door. We should not be in any doubt: this is a Labour Bill. A vote for the Bill today is a vote to build on the work of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside, my noble Friend Baroness Morris and my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke). The next stage of reform is built on the foundations created by the Labour Government. A vote for the Bill is a vote for the belief that every child&#039;s potential and achievement matters; that every school must be empowered to deliver the transformation of children&#039;s lives; and that a job this big needs to draft in all the support that it can to our schools to make the difference. It is a vote for the aspirations of parents and children throughout the country; it is a vote for Labour values; and I commend the Bill to the House.

 Many issues that Members bring to Parliament arise from constituency work, and this is one of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_427">Three-year-old Amicie Onyema Nwokeochar was on the footpath outside a chip shop in Highfield road in my constituency at lunchtime on 15 November 2003 when a car mounted the pavement and ploughed into the chip shop. Tragically, Amicie died within one hour of being admitted to hospital as a result of massive chest trauma following a collision with the car. Amicie lived in the constituency of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), but he regularly visited his grandma Mrs. Carol Brooks, who lives just around the corner from the chip shop.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_428">The car was driven by a man within a few weeks of his 90th birthday, who started driving before a driving test became compulsory under the Road Traffic Act 1934. He claimed that he had pressed the accelerator of his Honda Concerto car instead of the brake while parking. The driver was convicted on 27 May 2004 of driving without due care and attention, fined &#163;1,000 and banned from driving for two years. A police officer who gave evidence in the coroner&#039;s court, which recorded a verdict of accidental death, said that the accident was probably aggravated by the medical condition of the elderly driver, who surrendered his licence voluntarily to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_429">Due to an ongoing heart condition, the driver was unable to attend the coroner&#039;s court, so the coroner could not cross-examine him. There is a requirement that all those who have attained the age of 70 submit themselves for a medical examination every three years. Form D45, which is sent out automatically by the DVLA, contains questions about a driver&#039;s health. If the DVLA is told of any conditions, it may require that medical evidence be provided before a licence is renewed. However, that is not a rigorous test of ability to drive and Amicie&#039;s grandmother, Mrs. Carol Brooks, and the family&#039;s solicitor, Mr. Tim Woods of Carl Chapman & Co, whose offices are in my constituency, have requested that I campaign for compulsory cognitive tests to be brought in for older drivers. They believe that, at the very least, form D45 should be completed in the presence of a general practitioner who has known the driver for at least three years, and that the form should include a section enabling the GP to give a statement on the driver&#039;s ability to drive. In their opinion, evidence of a recent eyesight test should also be presented to the DVLA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_430">Mrs. Brooks and Mr. Woods believe that a person&#039;s ability to control the car that they actually drive should also be tested in some way. On 25 October 2005, <i>The Times</i> reported that too many older drivers in Torquay, a well-known retirement town, were hitting the accelerator rather than the brake and thereby causing accidents. Police Constable Chris Lancaster, Torbay&#039;s road safety officer, recommends that older drivers enrol on a roadfit scheme, which allows participants to take 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1576</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>part in a one-hour observed driving exercise to check their ability to drive. I am not sure whether this is a local or national scheme, but it sounds like a good idea to me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_431">Two million people aged 70 or over now hold a driving licence, and that figure is likely to rise to 4.5 million by 2015. The biggest increase in older active licence-holders has been among older women. Between 1965 and 1985, there was a 200 per cent. increase in male drivers aged over 65, but a 600 per cent. increase in female drivers over that age. In 2004, 550 car accidents out of a total of 7,035 involving drivers aged over 70&#151;about 8 per cent.&#151;resulted in the driver being killed or seriously injured. Despite an increase in the number of older drivers, between 1979 and 1996 there was a significant fall&#151;from 10 per cent. to 4.6 per cent.&#151;in the number of male casualties aged 60 to 69. The number of male casualties aged 70 to 79 has also fallen, but there has been a modest increase in the number aged 80 or over.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_432">Older drivers drive less than those in other age groups. The rate of motor vehicle crashes per mile driven is higher for the 70-plus age group than for middle-aged drivers, but only after the age of 85 does it reach or surpass the rate for younger drivers. However, older people are, unsurprisingly, over-represented in accidents involving death because of their increased frailty. They drive more slowly than other drivers and they cannot handle traffic conflict situations very well. The 60 to 69-year-old age group have a higher percentage of accidents at junctions in both rural and urban settings. They drive less at night due to deteriorating eyesight, and they have to be closer to signs to be able to read them.

<p><a name="st_334"><a name="60315-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister has heard me make this point before, but I will do so again now because it is very important. When I talked to my local group representing those who suffer from macular degeneration, which, sadly, is a common problem in older age, I was staggered to learn that, virtually to a person, they had volunteered to give up driving. There was no medical requirement for them so to do, even though they themselves felt unsafe when driving. Does my hon. Friend agree that something needs to be done about that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_335"><a name="60315-41_spnew1"><b> Dr. Iddon: </b> 
 I certainly do, and that intervention underlines the message that my Adjournment debate is intended to give to my hon. Friend the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_433">Older drivers are badly affected by the glare from oncoming headlights. The visual field shrinks significantly beyond the age of 75. They suffer commonly from muscle and joint stiffness, which affects their ability to turn their head or body in the car. They are less able to monitor their position in dense traffic, reverse safely or change lanes safely as a result. Reaction times are also slower for older people. Of course, many older drivers are far more experienced than younger drivers. Nevertheless, in their late 60s and 70s, older drivers&#039; impairments seem to outweigh any advantages that they may have accumulated with their years of experience and more cautious behaviour, and combined with their increased frailty, they are beginning to meet more risks on the road. However, many older drivers are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1577</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>aware of that increased risk and avoid more dangerous situations such as driving at night or in dense traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_434">Older drivers are more likely to take medication that may affect their driving. There is reliable evidence that certain prescribed medicines increase the risk of a road traffic accident, especially for older drivers. Anxiolytics as a class&#151;benzodiazepines, for example&#151;produce up to a fivefold increase in risk. Sedation and drowsiness are associated with pain-killing medicines containing opiates and opioids, including over-the-counter products. How many doctors discuss those increased risks with their older patients? Although some doctors are reluctant to advise their patients on driving, an increase in litigation, in which they are held liable in the event of an accident for not having advised a patient to stop driving, should act as a caution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_435">Certain diseases, such as epilepsy and diabetes, carry with them an increased risk of accidents on the road. A combination of those risks, which is more likely to occur in an older person, produces a much higher risk. Heart disease, however, is a fairly rare cause of traffic accidents. In a study of 2,000 acute collapses at the wheel while driving that led to a police-reported accident involving personal injury, only 10 per cent. were shown to be caused by a heart attack and 7 per cent. by stroke, the rest being due to epilepsy or diabetic hypoglycaemia. Many older people recover well enough from strokes to enable them to drive again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_436">A given dose of alcohol results in a higher blood alcohol concentration in an older person because of the reduced water content of the blood compared with a younger person of similar weight and sex. Alcohol can also increase night blindness and sensitivity to glare. The prevalence of dementing disorders is estimated to be as high as 47 per cent. for those aged 85 or older. Individuals with dementia are twice as likely to be involved in an accident as non-demented older people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_437">Not all older drivers are dangerous, although some clearly are. I am reminded of the case of veteran driver Tom Soulby, who got a lot of publicity last year&#151;his 100th year&#151;when he complained that his GP was insisting that he stop driving, after 82 years. Legislating on the ground of age is discriminatory. Therefore, if we are to deal with the dangers that some older drivers present on the road, we need to ascertain their fitness to drive in a more sensible way than we do now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_438">There are measures that the Government can encourage to make older drivers safer on the road. The motor industry is beginning to think about the design of motor vehicles with older drivers in mind. Design features include hand-operated braking and acceleration controls, other easily operated controls and easily readable instrument panels, swivelling seats, higher roofs and step-in access with rising seats, sliding doors, intelligent night vision systems and even rear view cameras. We can expect to see advertisements in future aiming cars at the older driver, alongside the racy adverts that are clearly aimed at the younger driver. Some useful changes, such as satellite navigation and sensors in front and rear bumpers are already with us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_439">We should not forget that older people are more at risk as pedestrians than as drivers. In general, older drivers are a lot safer than younger drivers. In 2004, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1578</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>number of 16 to 19-year-olds and their passengers killed on Britain&#039;s roads increased by 12 per cent., while the annual rate for all drivers fell&#151;I am glad to say&#151;by 8 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_440">In late 2004, the DVLA commissioned an independent review to assess the effectiveness of the present medical licensing system. It believes, as my constituents do, that the existing rules are outdated and inadequate.Research commissioned by the DVLA has shown that the present system is widely abused, with only 10 per cent. of drivers with a notifiable condition admitting it on the D45 form that they return to the DVLA. Further reports in the early part of this year indicate that the DVLA is about to embark on a public consultation on proposals to require drivers over the age of 75 to take a fitness-to-drive test every five years. It is proposed that those drivers who have reached that age will be required to bear the cost of attending an assessment centre to complete a paper-based test designed to examine their fitness to drive. A draft EU directive may require drivers over the age of 70 to renew their driving licences every five years instead of every three years, as now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_441">My constituent Mrs. Carol Brooks, and her family&#039;s solicitor Mr. Tim Woods, have also asked me to look at the Motability scheme and the safety record of its drivers. This scheme was launched in 1977, following the introduction of the mobility allowance the previous year. Prior to that, only disabled drivers who could drive themselves received help with transport. Most were supplied with a small, blue, single-seat, three-wheeled motorised invalid trike, which was incapable of carrying any passengers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_442">According to a parliamentary answer of 13 June 2005, more than 30 motor manufacturers supply over 140,000 new vehicles to the scheme annually, thus giving 400,000 disabled people mobility. Of those who benefit from the scheme, 33 per cent. are not actually the drivers of the vehicle, and around 10 per cent. of the drivers who benefit from the scheme require special adaptations to the vehicle to enable them to drive safely and in comfort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_443">The point has been made to me by Mrs. Brooks that the scheme is extremely generous with respect to the choice of vehicle. In her opinion, a significant number of disabled older drivers are allowed to purchase quite powerful vehicles. Therefore, does my hon. Friend the Minister feel that there is adequate oversight of the scheme to ensure that the purchased vehicle is suited to the capabilities of the older disabled driver?

<a name="stpa_444">We cannot discriminate against older drivers, but the fact is that they become an increasing risk to themselves and other road users with advancing age. In my opinion, more can be done to minimise the risk&#151;by the Government, through legislation, regulation and careful planning of the road network and its signage, and by the manufacturers of motor vehicles designed with older people in mind.

<p><a name="st_336"><a name="60315-41_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) on securing this debate. This is not his only contribution to road safety: he is a doughty campaigner on road safety in general, and he has bent my ear about this matter for some time. He is quite right to do so; the case of Amicie Nwokeochar is tragic and very sad, and we have to learn from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para14">
<a name="stpa_447">As my hon. Friend said, Amicie&#039;s death was the result of an accident caused by a man who was nearly 90 years old and who was subsequently found guilty of careless driving. For obvious reasons, I shall not comment directly on the case, which raises some general matters of which account should be taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para15">
<a name="stpa_448">I agree with my hon. Friend that we should do everything that is reasonably possible to avoid any repetition of such a dreadful accident. That is why the Government take the matter at the heart of this debate, and the issue of road safety in general, so seriously. My hon. Friend was involved in the Second Reading debate of the Road Safety Bill just a few days ago. He will know that it contains various measures designed to help to reduce road traffic casualties. I very much welcomed his contribution to last week&#039;s debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para16">
<a name="stpa_449">None of us can avoid the ageing process. The way in which it affects our mobility and fitness to drive will, of course, vary from individual to individual, but it is understandable that many motorists should want to continue to drive for as long as they are physically and mentally able.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para17">
<a name="stpa_450">The ageing of the population is one of the major structural changes facing the UK. The safety implications of our wish to remain mobile and independent will come increasingly to the fore as life expectancy and the average age of the population rises. Sadly, that will also increase the potential for older drivers to be casualties in road crashes, not necessarily as the cause but as a victim. It is very important, therefore, that we carefully consider not only the safety of older drivers but their relationship with other road users.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para18">
<a name="stpa_451">The public have every right to be concerned where older drivers have been involved in or have been responsible for accidents. Such incidents are often tragic and the issues they raise must never be forgotten, but, compared with the general picture of road traffic casualties and their causes, they tend to be the exception.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para19">
<a name="stpa_452">A great deal of research has been conducted into the accident involvement of and casualty causation for older drivers. Studies have shown consistently that older drivers do not pose a significant excess risk of injury to other road users compared with drivers of other ages, particularly young drivers. My hon. Friend is also concerned about the rate of accidents caused by younger drivers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para20">
<a name="stpa_453">The indications are that many older drivers tend to regulate themselves by driving lower mileages, and keep within their limitations by avoiding, or reducing their driving at, higher risk times such as rush hours, at night and in the winter. This research has also shown that older drivers, when involved in accidents, are themselves more likely to be injured than others.

<a name="60315-41_para21">
<a name="stpa_454">In our view, the crucial factor is not age but the physical and mental fitness of the driver to drive competently and safely. Old age alone should not be a bar to driving; my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East would share that sentiment. A number of statutory requirements currently apply to older drivers. The present driver licensing system recognises that, after the age of 70, there is a greater likelihood that health will deteriorate in ways that might affect driving. Licences expire at that age and must be renewed every three years thereafter. At each renewal, applicants are required to answer questions about their health and eyesight and to certify that they meet the required standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para22">
<a name="stpa_455">There is a further legal requirement for drivers of any age to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency if they become aware of the onset or worsening of any health condition that might affect their fitness to drive safely. Failure to do so is a serious offence. When such notification is received, the DVLA will make medical inquiries and reach a decision about future entitlement to drive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-41_para23">
<a name="stpa_456">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is concerned about road safety, raised the issue of macular degeneration and related issues. The same rules apply to people suffering from macular degeneration as apply to any other eyesight condition. If it is shown that somebody suffers from macular degeneration, which they ought to indicate to the DVLA, the DVLA will be responsible for making sure that an appropriate eye examination is performed and a judgment is made about fitness to continue to drive.
</p>

<p><a name="st_337"><a name="60315-42_spnew0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 The problem is that medical intervention should kick that off. I argue that, very often, doctors will not take the initiative and they leave it up to the individual.
</p>





<p><a name="st_338"><a name="60315-42_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern and I will say in a moment how we might address that. The process of self-declaration and other issues affecting competence to drive are exactly the same for macular degeneration as they are for any other condition that affects a person&#039;s eyesight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para0">
<a name="stpa_457">In addition to self-declaration, the DVLA frequently receives notification of potentially unfit drivers from third parties, particularly the police, doctors or concerned relatives or friends. If someone wants to inform us confidentially that someone is unfit to drive, we are happy to receive that information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_458">We also aim to ensure that doctors are well informed about the relevance of certain medical conditions to driving, and they obviously have a role in advising patients whether they should continue to drive. The DVLA issues guidance to all GPs for that purpose, which includes advising people who suffer from macular degeneration. In addition, the General Medical Council has issued guidelines to advise doctors to inform the DVLA about unfit patients who may have failed to declare themselves. In other words, the GMC expects doctors to do what my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud suggests, although doctors are not required to do so by law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_459">Present driver licensing arrangements are based on the second EU directive on driving licences&#151;91/439/EEC, for those hon. Members who want to dig it out

<br>&nbsp;<br>and read it for themselves&#151;which sets minimum standards of medical fitness for driving, and on the advice of the Secretary of State&#039;s six honorary medical advisory panels. The panels comprise eminent medical practitioners and medical scientists who are acknowledged experts in their field.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_460">Eyesight is, of course, a crucial element in medical fitness to drive. All drivers, of whatever age, are required to demonstrate their ability to read a number plate from a distance of 20.5 m and to inform the DVLA if they are no longer able to do so. That long-standing test has been effective in determining whether those who wish to drive have adequate vision. It is easy for the police to conduct and it complies with the current visual standard for driving set out in the second EU directive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_461">If, after an investigation by the DVLA&#039;s medical advisers, a driver is found to be unfit, or if co-operation is withheld, his or her licence may be revoked. In some cases, a driver may also be required to re-sit a driving test. Courts, too, have powers to require someone to take a driving test if, following a motoring offence, they have reason to doubt the individual&#039;s competence to drive. Those arrangements have, in general, been found to work satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_462">Although there is no denying the potential danger posed by older drivers where they are unfit on our roads, there is no justification on road safety grounds for depriving older people of the right to drive, providing they can satisfy the DVLA that they are medically fit to do so. From time to time, there will be isolated cases where drivers evade those checks and endanger themselves and others by driving when they should not do so, but it is not clear at present that more stringent measures, such as compulsory medical examinations, eye tests or additional driving tests, would be the best way forward. The Government&#039;s overall aim is to maintain a balance between freedom of movement for older drivers and road safety for everyone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_463">As my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East said, in 2005 the DVLA appointed consultants to undertake a fundamental review of its medical driver licensing system. The review was commissioned because the current arrangements have been in place since the early 1970s and to take into account significant demographic changes, medical developments and changes in public expectation that have occurred since then. The review looked at all aspects of the process for declaring, evidencing and assessing medical fitness to drive across all age groups. Recommendations for change centred on better identifying those whose fitness to drive needs to be formally assessed by the DVLA and on improved assessment and monitoring of those cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_464">In spite of press speculation about the possible introduction of cognitive and eyesight tests for drivers over the age of 75, as my hon. Friend has suggested again today, no decisions have yet been taken on the research findings. I can assure my hon. Friends that we will take account of their comments and views and the tragic case of Amicie when reaching those decisions. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East was correct to suggest that we have promised that, when we make those recommendations and decisions, there will be full consultation on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_465">It is essential to find ways to help older people to drive safely for as long as they are fit to do so. That is being done in a number of ways, including with research into

<br>&nbsp;<br>developing training, information, counselling and driving assessment and support tools for older drivers. The 16 mobility centres in the UK, which make up the Forum of Mobility Centres, provide invaluable advice for elderly and disabled motorists to enable them to make informed decisions about their mobility needs. Such information ranges from advice on car adaptations and vehicle access to the individual assessment of driving ability. The forum, which in England is grant funded by the Department for Transport, includes the Department&#039;s own mobility advice and vehicle information service. The mobility centres are also used by the DVLA to carry out assessments to inform medical fitness to drive decisions. I will also take into account the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East about the Motability scheme. I assure him that, when people approach the scheme, it gives them advice about whether they need to declare any particular medical condition. However, he makes some interesting suggestions about the range of vehicles that Motability provides.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60315-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_466">A number of local authority schemes have been developed to improve older drivers&#039; skills. The Driving Standards Agency&#039;s &quot;Arrive Alive Classic&quot; programme, which is aimed at older people&#039;s organisations, offers a wide range of relevant information for older drivers. We also encourage the establishment of refresher courses for older drivers who wish to brush up their driving skills.

<a name="60315-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_467">Most recently, I was pleased to note the announcement by the Institute of Advanced Motorists of its intention to enter this market in 2006. I also welcome the institute&#039;s new advisory leaflet for older drivers &quot;Staying Focused on Road Safety&quot;, which complements the Department&#039;s own &quot;Drive On!&quot; publication. The quality of information and variety of opportunities for assessment and training for older drivers are already quite impressive and expanding. As more drivers reach their later years and demand increases, I am sure that these services will make an even greater contribution to ensuring safe mobility for older drivers and improving road safety for the whole community.
