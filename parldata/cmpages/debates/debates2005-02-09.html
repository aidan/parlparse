 (Lab): What discussions he has held with the National Assembly for Wales Government on housing policy.  [214868]
</p>


<p><a name="50209-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 Ministers and officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister liaise with the devolved Welsh Assembly Government at regular intervals. In particular, we held wide-ranging discussions with National Assembly officials in the preparation of our Housing Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew0"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I welcome the fact that my right hon. Friend has given that answer. I shall deem him an honorary Welshman for the next few minutes by virtue of his having studied at Aberystwyth university back in 1966.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-01_para0">
In housing policy, we often look far afield to try to find solutions, but does my right hon. Friend agree that Wales and England have much to learn from each other and that the innovative use of such things as starter tenancies, community housing mutuals and home buy schemes will provide useful icebreakers in his next chat over a cappuccino with his counterparts in the Welsh Assembly at Cardiff bay?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Well, Duw, Duw. I am delighted to be named an honorary Welshman by my hon. Friend, and delighted of course with the high level of co-operation between my Department and the Welsh Assembly Government in pursuit of the Labour party&#039;s aims of expanding both the supply of homes for social renting and low-cost home ownership for first-time buyers. I welcome in particular the big improvements to homes in my hon. Friend&#039;s beautiful Ogmore constituency, resulting from the housing stock transfer in the Bridgend area. Of course, my hon. Friend and I know that in Wales and in England the James review would mean massive cuts in housing investment if the Tories ever got back to power.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Win Griffiths  (Bridgend)</b> 
 (Lab): Has my right hon. Friend had an opportunity to look at the green

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1484</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pastures scheme run by Pastor Peter Cunningham in Southport? In <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> yesterday, it was claimed that there were no homeless people in the Southport area because of his scheme. He has bought some houses in Flint in north Wales, so can my right hon. Friend discuss with his counterpart in the Welsh Assembly whether there is something in that scheme? If so, it will certainly make a huge contribution to dealing with homelessness.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question. I did not spot that article in <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> yesterday, because my eye was caught by the front-page report of Labour&#039;s massive lead over the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Nevertheless, I undertake to follow up on the matter and find whether, working with the Welsh Assembly Government, benefits could be derived from that scheme.
</p>




<a name="50209-01_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Social Home Buy</h4>


<p>2. <a name="50209-01_wqn1"><b> Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b> 
 (Lab): If he will make a statement on social home buy.  [214869]
</p>


<p><a name="50209-01_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 Our new home buy scheme will offer more social tenants the choice to own a home. Tenants will be able to buy as little as half their existing home at a discount, with the opportunity to increase their share and become full owners over time. Home buy will put home ownership within the reach of up to 300,000&nbsp;more social tenants. Unlike right to buy, the social home stays in the public sector and the local authority will be able to invest the full 100&nbsp;per cent. proceeds in new housing, rather than 25&nbsp;per cent. under the present right to buy scheme. We will consult on the details of the scheme before Easter.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew4"><b> Iain Wright: </b> 
 I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s comments because social home buy provides people on low incomes with a real stake in their home and their communities. It provides a great opportunity to regenerate areas of low demand and exclude unscrupulous and profiteering private landlords. Does he agree that the siting of such schemes and homes is vital? I am thinking particularly of previously run-down town centre areas. Social home buy needs to ensure that such areas once again become vibrant places to live and that the doughnut effect of all new homes being located in the suburbs is avoided.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I very much agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, our policy since 1997&nbsp;has been to achieve greater growth in towns. Our first job was to reverse the increase in out-of-town shopping, which we have done, and for the first time more retail shopping is now being done in town centres than outside towns. That has brought a new lease of life to the centres of cities and towns. The home buy policy, which is our current housing policy, as well as the brownfield policy and sequential testing have all led to exactly what my hon. Friend wants&#151;the rebirth of towns, for which he is a doughty champion, especially in Hartlepool.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Caroline Spelman  (Meriden)</b> 
 (Con): At the heart of the Government&#039;s plans to solve the housing crisis is the provision of cut-price houses for &#163;60,000&nbsp;each. The Swedish retail giant, IKEA, has a name for properties of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1485</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that sort: it calls them Bokloks. Given that the land that they would be built on has already been earmarked for sale by the Chancellor and the definition of &quot;key worker&quot; is at best muddled, does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that the term &quot;Bokloks&quot; just about sums it up?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 Once again, the hon. Lady shows her ignorance of what is actually happening. If she had gone to the sustainable development conference, she would have seen the &#163;60,000&nbsp;house on display. It was a wow at that conference. The industry told me that it could not be built. We not only built it and displayed it at the conference, but it has now gone to Allerton Bywater and will be part of the development of a pit site of houses available at &#163;60,000. It is a reality, and a lot of people who want to buy their homes welcome the fact that we have thought of new ways to provide affordable homes. That contrasts very well with the press report that I have seen in <i>Kent on Sunday</i> that the hon. Lady&#039;s first statement on housing arising out of the James review was that she would cancel the plans to build 130,000&nbsp;new homes in Kent. That kind of message to the people in Kent and the south-east who are desperate for homes shows quite a contrast with what we are trying to do.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b> 
 (LD): The Deputy Prime Minister knows that the size of the discount for social home buy is crucial in understanding what that policy means and how it will operate, and he is rightly consulting on that. However, will he say now who will pay for the discount? Will it be the housing association or the taxpayer? If it will be the housing association, does he accept that social landlords will end up building fewer affordable homes, when we need more? If it will be the taxpayer, what provision did the Treasury make for that in the spending review?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 The financing is the same as we had before. If the housing association pays, it will be compensated by the Housing Corporation, whose funds come from the Government. There are varying amounts of subsidies, as the hon. Gentleman knows. The right to buy subsidy can range up to &#163;40,000, which is the reason why we have lost 1.8&nbsp;million houses from the public housing sector. The right to acquire subsidy is down to &#163;16,000. As he rightly says, we are consulting on the subsidies involved, but it is important that by allowing people to buy equity in such situations, they can afford the mortgage price, and that is available to about 300,000&nbsp;more people, whereas if I had extended the right to buy to the right to acquire situation, it would have benefited only 60,000&nbsp;people. We are giving more choice to more people and meeting their demands.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew7"><b> Lawrie Quinn  (Scarborough and Whitby)</b> 
 (Lab): Will the consultation that my right hon. Friend has announced on this welcome policy also allow people who live in rural areas who are equally under pressure in trying to get the first foot on the ladder and very much in need of good social housing to be included in the roll-out of the policy?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin5"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 Yes, those people certainly will be included. In fact, one of the great 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1486</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>difficulties of the previous Administration&#039;s policy on rural housing was that they limited it in certain circumstances where they believed that there was a housing crisis. The houses were supposed to be available to people in the local area. The trouble was that the younger people usually did not have the money to buy the houses, which usually went to people who lived in the area who used them for holiday lets. That is not acceptable. The opportunity extends to rural areas, but I go further and call on all local authorities to do the same. Indeed, to be fair, my mate the Mayor of London has just discovered an awful lot of plots of land that he can build on. Local authorities and Government agencies could go round looking for those plots of land and take this opportunity to build good, high-quality houses&#151;by the way, the &#163;60,000&nbsp;house is up to the highest standards, saving energy and water&#151;and give a real opportunity to people in rural areas.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew8"><b> Dr. Howard Stoate  (Dartford)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend knows that one of the main issues that affects public sector recruitment in areas just outside London, particularly in Kent Thameside, is the cost of housing there. Will he show how his policies will make more houses available, particularly to those key workers in nursing, teaching and the police whom we so desperately need if we are to continue the regeneration of areas outside London?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin6"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 Absolutely critical for sustainable communities is, first, that we should not cancel all the houses that are being built, which seems to be the Opposition&#039;s policy.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 It is not the Liberal Democrat Opposition&#039;s policy.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-01_spmin7"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I mean the real Opposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-01_para1">
We will keep to the building programme. The second thing that we would do is to provide the opportunity for key workers to buy using that form of equity. Under the present key worker policy, we pay up to about &#163;100,000&nbsp;in subsidy to provide a house to maintain a hospital or teacher service. Frankly, that is not the best way to use money. With the equity shares that we are now using or by separating the construction price from the land price and using the Government land that we keep to our advantage, we allow key workers to have a mortgage price that they can afford.

 (Lab): What plans he has to increase the stock of council and housing association dwellings for rent in London.  [214870]
</p>


<p><a name="50209-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 We are investing &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion over two years to provide more than 21,000&nbsp;affordable homes in London, of which 10,000&nbsp;will be social rented, with 7,000&nbsp;for key workers and 4,000&nbsp;for low-cost home ownership. London will also share in the additional &#163;430&nbsp;million of investment in new social rented homes by 2007&#150;08.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 I welcome any new housing for people in London on low incomes or in desperate

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1487</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>housing need. Does the Minister recognise that in inner London, especially, there is an absolute crisis due to the falling supply of council housing because of the right to buy and the small number of housing association properties being built? Many children live in disgracefully overcrowded conditions, but the only alternative that people are given by councils is to go away from London, and thus away from families, jobs and education. Does she realise that there is a crying need to invest in homes for rent for people in desperate housing need so that they can remain in their local communities rather than being forced out by wealthy, upwardly mobile people coming in?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that there is a need for additional investment in social housing in London. That is an extremely important issue, which I why I am surprised that there are only four Conservative Back Benchers in the Chamber for our discussion of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-02_para0">
My hon. Friend referred to the need to provide affordable housing. We are increasing the rate of new social house building throughout the country by 50&nbsp;per cent. over the next few years and we will shortly announce what that will mean for London. He is right that we also need to provide assistance for key workers and we are doing that to support our public services.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not the case that all housing in London is now less accessible and affordable than ever, thanks in no small part to the Labour Government&#039;s property taxes? Does the Minister realise that, since 1997, average stamp duty in London has risen from &#163;1,280&nbsp;to &#163;9,296? What plans does she have to end that blatant discrimination against those who live in our capital city?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I am intrigued that the hon. Gentleman is suddenly worried about housing in London, given that his party wants to cut the housing budget by &#163;1&nbsp;billion. When we accused the Conservatives of wanting to cut the budget by &#163;400&nbsp;million, they denied it, but that was because they actually wanted to cut it by &#163;1&nbsp;billion, as the James review says. The Conservative Front Bench must realise that houses cost money and we must invest in new houses. It would be utter madness to make the cuts that they propose.
</p>

<p>4. <a name="50209-02_wqn1"><b> Bob Russell  (Colchester)</b> 
 (LD): How many of the affordable rented houses to be built over the next three years will be council houses.  [214871]
</p>


<p><a name="50209-02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Local and Regional Government  (Mr.&nbsp;Nick Raynsford): </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be providing 75,000&nbsp;new social rented homes over the next three years to 2007&#150;08. Of those, we estimate that more than 3,000&nbsp;will be provided by local authorities.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew4"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister, because the 3,000&nbsp;council houses that he announced will match the&nbsp;3,000&nbsp;that new Labour has built in the past eight years, which is in stark contrast to the 350,000&nbsp;that the Thatcher Government built over an eight-year period. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1488</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bearing in mind the success of the Attlee, Callaghan and Wilson Governments in building hundreds of thousands of family council houses, why is new Labour hostile to council houses through its systems of management, ownership and new build?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 We are not. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman did not refer to the Government&#039;s considerable investment in improving the stock in his area. We have invested &#163;35&nbsp;million to support the arm&#039;s length management organisation in Colchester, which will bring all the council houses in the area up to a decent standard by 2007. He would better serve his constituents if he argued the case for improving the condition of existing homes. He has forgotten that the Government inherited 2&nbsp;million council homes in poor condition and one of our proudest achievements is bringing 1&nbsp;million of them up to a decent standard.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend accept that we must not only build more affordable houses, but protect the affordable housing stock? Does he accept that the housing market has changed significantly in the past few years in areas such as Sheffield? As house prices have risen dramatically, more people have tried to rent and more have bought their council houses. The number of right to buys has gone up from about 400&nbsp;in 1997&nbsp;to more than 2,000&nbsp;last year, which has created much longer waiting times. Will he consider extending the discount limits on the right to buy that apply to certain areas of the south to parts of the north in which there are real housing market pressures?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I had an agreeable visit to Sheffield recently and was delighted to see the impressive progress that is being made in renovating the existing stock and learn about the successful ALMO. I was also told about the opportunities for helping tenants to get an appropriate home through the choice-based letting scheme. My hon. Friend will know that people now want a range of choices and it is right that we should provide for people seeking good quality homes to rent, for those seeking homes to buy and for those seeking equity shares.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-02_para1">
On right-to-buy discounts, my hon. Friend knows that the Government have taken steps to ensure that people should be able to acquire a home if they want to with a discount, but we also need to ensure that that is value for money, and that remains our objective.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew8"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): I think that the Minister may be able to anticipate my question, which is straightforward. Does he believe that local housing authorities&#151;that is, those that manage council housing, such as Macclesfield borough council, which by the way is debt-free&#151;should be treated on exactly the same basis as registered social landlords? At the moment, they are not. Macclesfield is being forced to transfer its housing stock because the Government will not allow it to retain adequate revenue to keep to the decent housing standard. Will he look at this request, because I believe that council housing is important?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that council housing is important, but equally important is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1489</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ensuring that housing is brought up to a reasonable standard. That is why we have required all housing authorities to carry out an option appraisal to look at the best way of ensuring that their housing is brought up to the decent homes standard in a reasonable period. I should have thought that he, like other Members, would want to support proposals that would achieve the decent homes standard in the quickest way, whether that is through retention by the local authority or a stock transfer to a registered social landlord. <i>[Interruption.]</i>

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning recently visited North Wingfield in my constituency, in connection with its pathfinder scheme, which hopefully is making progress. Would one of the Ministers on the Front Bench like to revisit North-East Derbyshire? There is a place called Clay Cross, which has a great deal of experience of council housing and we would really like to get into detail with Ministers about the future of council housing and the role it should play in Government policy.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I apologise for the fact that my hon. Friend is getting an answer from me rather than from my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, but I paid a visit to Derbyshire early in the lifetime of this Government and saw the terrible consequences of the dereliction by the previous Government, particularly in a number of former mining areas which had been abandoned and were disgracefully run-down. This Government have been investing not just in improving the quality of housing but in regenerating many of those former mining areas, including north Derbyshire, and I am proud of the record of trying to improve the conditions and prospects for people in such areas.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings)</b> 
 (Con): If this Government&#039;s housing policy was not so tragic it would be funny. It combines dictating where people should live with the provision of low-value prefabs, like a mixture of Chairman Mao and Maplin&#039;s holiday camp. But what is not funny is that the Government are building half as many social houses as the last Conservative Government did and, under Labour, 100,000&nbsp;people are stuck in temporary accommodation. Does the Minister understand that his Government&#039;s failure to build social housing deprives desperate people of the homes that they long for and that their only hope is his and his colleagues&#039; swift and enforced return to the Opposition Benches?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 What a risible contribution from a party with a disgraceful housing record and a current policy of cutting &#163;1&nbsp;billion out of housing investment while pretending that it can somehow offer more, even though it opposes the Government&#039;s actions to ensure that housing needs are met and has done nothing to support the improvement of the appallingly substandard council housing that it left as our inheritance. The Conservatives would serve the country better by a period of silence on this subject.

<p>5. <a name="50209-03_wqn0"><b> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East)</b> 
 (Lab): What effect he expects the five-year plan will have on the level of asset inequality.  [214872]
</p>


<p><a name="50209-03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 Our five-year plans will help to reduce asset inequality by offering more choice and fairness in housing, including new proposals to allow thousands of tenants to buy a share in their home, by recycling public assets, by tackling disadvantage and by promoting more prosperous regions.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew0"><b> Dr. Iddon: </b> 
 Has my hon. Friend seen the Shelter report &quot;Know your place&quot; on housing wealth and inequality? Is he as concerned as I am that, if action is not taken urgently, in 30&nbsp;years&#039; time the 10&nbsp;per cent. of children in Britain&#039;s wealthiest areas will be in families that own more than 100&nbsp;times the housing wealth of the 10&nbsp;per cent. of children born in the poorest areas of the UK?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to highlight those inequalities in assets, which is why the five-year plan published by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is called &quot;Sustainable Communities: Homes for All&quot;. It contains new measures to help first-time buyers on to the housing ladder and to extend home buying so that council tenants and tenants of social landlords&#151;up to 300,000&nbsp;people&#151;have an equity share in their own home. Those are radical proposals to redistribute the assets of this country to help the poorest the most, unlike the policies of the Conservatives, whose &#163;1&nbsp;billion cut in housing would deprive those poor communities of the housing that they desperately need.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson  (Coventry, North-West)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Minister aware that the Shelter report shows that home ownership&#151;for those who have been able to do it&#151;is a major factor in the growing inequality in this country? Is he also aware that his policies for social buy and affordable housing are welcome in Coventry, where I can assure him and his policies of a warm welcome and a total rejection of the Conservatives&#039; proposed cuts of &#163;1&nbsp;billion?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. It is important that 100&nbsp;per cent. of the proceeds of the sale of the new assets is reinvested in housing. Home buy will help social landlords to deliver new social homes for homeless households and others in priority need of housing. I am delighted that things are going so well in Coventry. I just hope that its people remember that when it comes to making a choice in a few months&#039; time.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a serious point, bearing it in mind that houses could be bought in his area, and, indeed, in Oldham when I visited it recently, for &#163;1,500. That is a collapse of the housing market and many houses are empty. If we are to make those communities decent and sustainable, some houses will have to be knocked down because they are unfit to live in and other areas will have to be improved, with green space provided. We are trying to create sustainable communities in which people are proud to live. One of the consequential effects of that is that house prices will rise from under &#163;1,500.

<p><a name="50209-03_spnew5"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 Students bring vitality to an area and attract new business, but I am glad that the Government are beginning to recognise the difficulties that arise from a transient population. Will my hon.

<p><a name="50209-03_spnew6"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that there can be pressures in areas with high student populations. We recognise that. She will also know that it is difficult to address the problem through national planning rules because the pressures that arise are often local.

 (Lab): If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 9&nbsp;February.
</p>


<p><a name="50209-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister  (Mr. Tony Blair): </b> 
 This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew7"><b> Ross Cranston: </b> 
 I want to ask my right hon. Friend about identity cards. All the evidence on the doorstep and on the phone in Dudley, North is that more than 80&nbsp;per cent. of people support ID cards. Obviously, they do not want a &quot;Show me your papers, please&quot; society, and that is not what is being proposed. The one issue raised with me is cost, in particular to the less well-off. May I ask for an assurance that the cost of ID cards will not be disproportionate for the less well-off?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The point that my hon. and learned Friend makes is right. It is important to realise that the cost of going to biometric passports, which we should do because other parts of the world are doing so, will be about &#163;70. The additional cost of the ID card is only about &#163;15. That is why it represents a sensible way of proceeding. In our view, identity cards, with the new technology that is available, are necessary in the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism, and in order to protect our services. Their introduction is the right thing to do and I hope that, rather than facing both ways, all the Opposition parties will support us on that proposition tomorrow.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Michael Howard  (Folkestone and Hythe)</b> 
 (Con): Last week the National Audit Office said that the Government had spent nearly &#163;900&nbsp;million on improving behaviour in schools and reducing truancy, but as we know, behaviour in schools has not improved and truancy has increased. Was the money well spent?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The amount of money that was spent on truancy specifically was a tiny proportion of the &#163;860&nbsp;million. Let me explain how it was spent. The vast bulk of it was spent on pupil referral units, in order to educate pupils excluded from schools. When we came to office, there were only 7,000&nbsp;such places, many of them only for a couple of hours a week. There are now 13,000&nbsp;such places and those pupils get full-time education. Yes, that money is well spent.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 But large numbers of children still do not spend all the school day in pupil referral units, as the Prime Minister well knows. Last week we had an Ofsted report saying that nearly one in 10&nbsp;secondary schools have unsatisfactory levels of behaviour, and the number of schools where behaviour is unsatisfactory shows no sign of reducing, so the money is clearly not well spent.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1493</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para0">
Let me ask the Prime Minister about something else. This week the Public Accounts Committee said that &#163;500&nbsp;million could have been saved if the Government had managed the surge in asylum applications in 1999&nbsp;and 2000&nbsp;more efficiently. Was the PAC right?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, I should like to go back and answer the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s question about truancy. He cited the Ofsted report. Let me give the quotation in full:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Parents in England can and should take heart at the considerable improvements in our education system over recent years. We have made a move from a system that educated a few superbly and the rest indifferently to one that is attempting to educate everyone very well&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para1">
the difference between Tory and Labour policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para2">
As for the report on asylum, the allegation is that instead of spending the money on removals we should have front-loaded it to deal with applications. We believe, however, that increasing the proportion of removals is also a very important way of getting asylum applications down, which is why we do not agree with the report. The difference between this Government and the administration over which the right hon. and learned Gentleman personally presided is that in 1996&nbsp;about 5,000&nbsp;asylum seekers were removed and in 2003&nbsp;it was 18,000&#151;not good enough, but a darned sight better. Before people talk about the numbers, let me also tell him that the latest asylum figures indicate that when he was Home Secretary applications went up 50&nbsp;per cent. and the numbers were roughly what they are today.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 If there are fewer asylum seekers, obviously fewer will be removed. It is no use the Prime Minister trying to throw back to the past. The permanent secretary at the Home Office said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The truth of the matter is that we got into real difficulties at the end of 1999.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para3">
Now let us get back to the billions of pounds of taxpayers&#039; money that this Government have wasted. Two weeks ago, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said that taxes would have to increase by &#163;11&nbsp;billion if there were another Labour Government. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that he would not put up the top rate of income tax. Will he give the same pledge on national insurance contributions?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, I want to return to the point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman made&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh yes, just to pin him down exactly. He was saying that the proportion of people removed to the numbers of asylum seekers was the same. Wrong. Actually, he only ever managed to remove about two in 10&nbsp;failed asylum seekers. The figure is now five out of 10&#151;yes, a long way to go, but a lot better than his system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para4">
Secondly, no. We will make our commitments on tax plain at the time of the manifesto, as we have done before. While we are talking about waste, though, let me tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman about waste that this Government have never incurred&#151;the waste on the poll tax, the Black Wednesday waste, and the waste of 3&nbsp;million unemployed when he was Employment Secretary. Yes, we never engaged in that waste, and we never will.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 It is no use the Prime Minister talking about keeping his tax pledges for the manifesto, because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1494</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>he gave one yesterday, and everyone now knows that yesterday he gave a pledge on the top rate of income tax and today he has refused to give a pledge on national insurance contributions. So billions of pounds have been wasted, taxpayers are not getting value for money, and everyone knows that taxes would go up under another Labour Government. Is it not now clear which tax it would be?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I will tell the House what is clear. There was one party that gave a pledge that it would not put VAT on fuel&#151;a specific election pledge&#151;and the right hon. and learned Gentleman and his party voted for it, and if it had not been defeated in the House of Commons that would have hurt pensioners and some of the poorest people in our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para5">
I will tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman exactly why we have been able to sustain a strong economy and put money into public services, and I do not accept that this money is wasted. When we have money going into extra teachers and nurses and better equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted. When waiting lists are not up by 400,000&nbsp;but down by 300,000, that is not money wasted. When we have 2&nbsp;million extra jobs and 1&nbsp;million helped by the new deal, that is not money wasted. When we have the lowest inflation, mortgage rates and unemployment for decades, that is a successful economic policy, not the boom and bust that people remember.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I entirely concur with the sentiments expressed by my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Charles Kennedy  (Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</b> 
 (LD): The Prime Minister asserted again a few moments ago that he saw identity cards as essential in the fight against terrorism, but given that identity cards did not prevent the Madrid bombings; that the 9/11&nbsp;bombers travelled under their own identities; that they will not be compulsory in this country for 10&nbsp;years; and that visitors to this country will not require them, how will they make such a difference to the fight against terrorism?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The reason why this measure is supported not only by the Government but by the police and the security services is that people believe that, particularly when we have biometric passports and the biometric technology available, we can construct an identity card that gives us the best possible protection against crime and terrorism. No system will prevent all crime and all terrorism: the question is whether it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>actually enhances the security of our country. When this technology is available, and when we are going to apply it in any event to visas and passports, it seems to me to make sense to use it to give us an identity card and bring us in line, frankly, with best practice around the world.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Kennedy: </b> 
 But the Prime Minister must recognise that 10&nbsp;million people in this country, many of them pensioners, do not possess a passport and do not have the intention or the need to get one in future. Under his proposals, those 10&nbsp;million will be required to travel distances to centres to have the tests carried out, and then to pay for the privilege. That is a further reason why we will oppose identity cards tomorrow, as we have before&#151;unlike some others.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin12"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is for that very reason that we have said that the Identity Cards Bill is enabling legislation. We have always made it clear, under pressure from all quarters in the House, that before there is a final move to compulsion, there will be a rigorous evaluation and a chance for this House to debate it again, but the Bill allows us to get this project under way. I believe that many people now recognise, particularly, as I say, with the possibilities of the new technology, that we can genuinely make a difference to our own security, to the fight against crime, and to the protection of our public services. In the world in which we live, where there are people who will cross borders to a far greater degree than ever before, and organised crime and terrorism are far more sophisticated than ever before, I do not think it is wrong or a breach of anyone&#039;s civil liberties to say that we should have an identity card. Most people carry some form of identification anyway. I think it is long overdue, and we should get on and do it.

<p><a name="50209-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Robert Jackson  (Wantage)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my right hon. Friend accept an invitation to visit the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in my constituency to see the new Diamond synchrotron, which is nearing completion there? It is the biggest single investment in the history of British science, made by this Government, and it is a very apt symbol of the commitment that this Government&#151;and the Chancellor and the Prime Minister&#151;have made to the future of British science.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin13"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. The synchrotron is a very important innovation indeed, and I can assure him that the increase in the science budget, which is a vital part of this country&#039;s future prosperity and competitiveness, will be maintained under this Government.

</p>


<p><a name="50209-03_spmin14"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As I have said on many occasions, I do not believe in the quota system that would be applied by the Conservatives. We should have a system whereby we welcome in people who are genuine refugees and people whom our economy needs to work here, and whereby we tackle and weed out the abuses. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin15"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We are pursuing the policy of engagement, which we have conducted with France and Germany, and indeed with the United States&#039; full support. I have to say to my hon. Friend that it is important also to make it clear to Iran&#151;I hope this is a message that he will join in sending to the Iranian Government&#151;that it cannot breach the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency and cannot develop nuclear weapons capability. That is the very clear wish of the entire international community. I happen to believe, however, that it can be pursued by diplomatic means of engagement.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Michael Howard  (Folkestone and Hythe)</b> 
 (Con): Under the proposals that the Home Secretary announced on Monday, will net immigration rise or fall?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin16"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration, the numbers will probably fall, because it will be clear that those who come in either abusing the system or without being covered by the restrictions that the Home Secretary is placing on them cannot settle here. The right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s proposals for a fantasy island for asylum seekers&#151;again, it might be nice to know where it is&#151;and literally halving the immigration service budget will simply make the problem worse.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I am interested that the Prime Minister has again raised overseas processing centres. I have a letter from him to the President of the European Council. It reads:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Dear Costas,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I am writing to ask for a very short discussion at the Brussels European Council&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of an idea we have been developing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. asylum seekers arriving in the UK and other EU member states could be transferred to a transit processing centre where their claims would be assessed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The centre would be located outside the EU.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-03_para6">
So the Prime Minister is interested in overseas processing centres, too. The difference between us is that he will do it only with the EU, and we will do it on our own; and he is all talk, and we will take action. Is not the difference between us the fact that we will impose an annual limit on immigration and he refuses to do that, so that only a Conservative Government can be relied on to bring immigration under control?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin17"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, the letter to which he refers was publicised at the time. Let me point out the two important differences. The vast majority of people claiming asylum do so now not at port but in country. They could never be covered by any processing centre. In any event, neither all the other countries in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1497</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>European Union nor the United Nations could agree on a way forward. I therefore ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman: which country is prepared to take Britain&#039;s asylum claims and process them? There is no such country. That is why, for the four years when he was Home Secretary and asylum claims rose by 50&nbsp;per cent. and applications took 20&nbsp;months to handle, he never did any of that. If it was such a good idea, why did not he do it?

Will he also ensure that there is no backsliding by any of the parties involved? Since he has spoken of it as a priority of his premiership, may I congratulate him on breaking the record of my old boss, Harold Wilson, for length of service as Labour premier?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-03_spmin18"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that. The middle east peace process is at an important juncture and I hope that it will be possible to make progress. Yesterday&#039;s meeting was of historic importance, but it is important that we do everything that we can to build on it. I greatly hope that the conference that we shall call and hold in London in early March allows us to give the Palestinians the plan that they need, so that when Israeli disengagement from Gaza and parts of the west bank happens, they have what they need in terms of the beginnings of an independent viable state. Only if that can be agreed have we any chance of reaching the solution that I think everyone wants: two states, with a secure Israel and an independent Palestinian state, living side by side in peace.

 As I recall, we set up a commission under Lord Jenkins that gave us various options for electoral reform.

</p>


<p><a name="50209-03_spmin21"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am always content to meet people to talk about issues such as these. Of course, this is a question of balancing the amount of money that has been put into the water industry and the investment that is there, with the necessary quality controls. I am not saying that the situation that the hon. Gentleman described does not exist or cause concern in the south-west&#151;I know that it does. On the other hand, it has caused concern for a considerable period.

 My hon. Friend and I should probably hope that such instructions and their consequences have changed since we were at school. The point that he makes about investment in our schools and classrooms is absolutely right: it has been of tremendous importance. We have only to go to a school in any constituency to see the investment that has gone in. The excellence in cities programme has also driven up results significantly, and it is important to recognise that we now have the best ever primary school results, the best ever GCSE results and the best ever A-level results. These are certified by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. It is also important to recognise that every single penny piece of the additional investment was opposed by the Conservatives.

Those communities have to use the powers and extra investment, and as his constituency shows, many are doing precisely that, and to great effect, for their local communities.

If extradited, the so-called Bermingham three and my constituent, Mr. Giles Derby, being non-Americans, face little prospect of bail under US law. That means that they will have to spend many months in a Texas jail before they are finally brought to trial. Is it not about time that we stopped acting as America&#039;s poodle and revisited our unbalanced and unfair extradition arrangements with the US?

<br>&nbsp;<br>about our being America&#039;s poodle, I think that it is time we recognised that the American or transatlantic alliance has served this country well. We should support it, and hon.

Does he further agree that we should do whatever is in our power to ensure that all religious faiths, including the thousands of Christians and Muslims in my constituency, receive similar protection? Does he also agree that both sides of the House should support that legislation?
</p>


<p><a name="50209-03_spmin26"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I hope people do. It is an anomaly when faith groups associated with a single race are protected from incitement to hatred, but multi-ethnic faith groups are not. The legislation was requested by key leaders in all the major faith communities and it has to be said that it prohibits the stirring up and the incitement of religious hatred. Prosecutions will have to be brought, of course, through the Crown Prosecution Service, with the Attorney-General&#039;s consent. I really think that the idea that it will interfere with comedy and the normal run of things as part of our way of life is absurd. The fact of the matter is that incitement to racial hatred has ended up with none of those problems. Incitement to religious hatred represents a change to the law that is long overdue. It makes the law fair. I hope that we can give sufficient assurances, as the Bill passes through the House of Commons, so that people realise that there is no intention to curb proper freedom of speech, but there is an intention to ensure that all parts of our community are treated fairly.

<a name="50209-04_head0"><h3 align=center>NHS Funding</h3>

<a name="50209-04_time0"><h5>12.31 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209-04_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 With permission Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about allocations to primary care trusts in the national health service in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para0">
I am today allocating revenue resources to England&#039;s 303&nbsp;PCTs for the financial years 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. PCTs have already been informed of their allocation for 2005&#150;06, so they will now be able to plan for the medium term, knowing with certainty their allocation up to March 2008. I have written to all hon. Members with details of the allocations to the PCTs that serve their constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para1">
This Government believe in the NHS. We believe in its founding principle that there should be equity of access, free at the point of need, for everyone. Furthermore, we believe that the NHS can be reformed and transformed as well as improved, so that health care can be delivered to the standards of, and in a way expected by, today&#039;s public. That is why in 2002&nbsp;the Government outlined our plans for an unparalleled increase in expenditure in the NHS over the five years from 2003&#150;04&nbsp;to 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para2">
Today, I can tell the House that I am allocating more resources to the NHS front-line services than have ever been allocated before&#151;&#163;64&nbsp;billion in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;70&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. That contrasts with &#163;45&nbsp;billion only four years ago. That means that PCT allocations will grow in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;by no less than 9.2&nbsp;per cent., and in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;by 9.4&nbsp;per cent. On average, PCTs will have, compounded, 19.5&nbsp;per cent. more resources in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;than in 2005&#150;06. The increases between 2003&#150;04&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;represent a faster growth in resource allocation than ever before in the history of our NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para3">
The distribution of those resources has had regard to four main principles under this Labour Government. The first is that the increase will allow the NHS to take significant strides in improving access to health services for everyone throughout the country. Secondly, places with greater need will receive an even greater allocation of resources. Thirdly, for the first time, this allocation will allow significant resources to be used for the prevention of ill health and for health improvement. Finally, there will be a floor to the allocation to each primary care trust today. No primary care trust will receive an increase in funding over the two years of less than 16.8&nbsp;per cent. Not one primary care trust in England will receive less than a 16.8&nbsp;per cent. increase over the two years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para4">
For the five years between 2002&#150;03&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, allocations to primary care trusts will increase by more than 56&nbsp;per cent. In terms of real people, by 2007&#150;08, &#163;1,388&nbsp;will be allocated per head, compared with &#163;907&nbsp;in 2002&#150;03&#151;an increase of 53&nbsp;per cent. in allocated resources for every single man, woman and child in England. We have done more than just increase our investment; we have made the distribution of resources more fair than ever before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para5">
A key factor in distributing funding fairly is the count of the number of people served by each primary care trust. Since the last allocation round, the population 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1504</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>data based on the 2001&nbsp;census has been revised, so we now have a more accurate population count. In addition, the allocations that I am announcing today include projected increases in populations. That means that we are properly taking account of the challenges faced in areas of rapidly increasing populations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para6">
If allocations are to be fair, they must also be based on need. Following advice from the independent Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, I am making some improvements to the formula to provide the same access to health care where there is the same need, and to support the reduction in health inequalities. I have also changed the way in which funding for primary medical services is distributed to make that fairer. For the first time, the majority of funding for GP services will be allocated according to the relative need for primary care services. The formula that we are using reflects the most up-to-date and best measures of differences in need for those services. The House will be glad to hear&#151;many hon. Members have made representations to me&#151;that I have also tackled the unfairness inherent in some areas being significantly under target in terms of the previous resource allocation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para7">
Following the introduction of the new formula in 2002, we realised that, despite progress, some areas were still not receiving their fair share of funding. At that time, some areas were more than 22&nbsp;per cent. below their fair share. We made some progress in reducing that unfairness in the previous allocation round, but despite that, in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;some primary care trusts are more than 5&nbsp;per cent. or 10&nbsp;per cent., and in one case more than 15&nbsp;per cent., beneath their fair share. Such a disparity is unfair and unacceptable, so I have decided in the 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;allocations to accelerate progress towards a fair-share distribution. To reach that outcome, primary care trusts at the greatest distance beneath their fair share will receive more than those who were already receiving their fair share or more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para8">
With the allocations that I am announcing today, based on need and fairness, by 2007&#150;08, no primary care trust in England will be 15, 10&nbsp;or even 5&nbsp;per cent. below target. Indeed, I am able to tell the House that under today&#039;s allocation no primary care trust will be more than 3.5&nbsp;per cent. away from their optimum fair share of the allocation. That is as substantial a move as I can make commensurate with the stability of the whole system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para9">
Our general approach, therefore, has been to balance a significant and substantial increase in resources for every area, and for the PCTs of every Member throughout the House, with an even greater improvement in funding where there is greater need. No primary care trust in England&#151;north, south, east or west&#151;will receive an average increase of less than 8.1&nbsp;per cent. Over the two years, that is an average increase of 19.5&nbsp;per cent. for every one in England. That will ensure that all parts of the country will receive sufficient funding to see considerable further improvements in their health services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para10">
At the same time as providing a 19.5&nbsp;per cent. average and an 8.1&nbsp;per cent. a year minimum, the funding formula rightly moves more funding to where it is most needed. I have already identified 88&nbsp;primary care trusts as those that need the most urgent action. Since those are the most needy areas, they will receive a higher level 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1505</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of funding than other areas. By 2007&#150;08, the funding per person in a spearhead primary care trust will be &#163;1,552, compared with a national average of &#163;1,388.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para11">
I can also tell the House, however, that by 2007&#150;08, as a result of the fairer distribution, the 5&nbsp;per cent. most needy areas and those facing the greatest need for funding, in both the north and the south of the country, will receive an average of &#163;1,710&nbsp;per person. The 5&nbsp;per cent. most well-off areas with less need for funding will receive an average of around &#163;1,190. That means that I am putting additional funding where it is needed to reduce health inequalities. That should help to ensure that by 2010&nbsp;there will be a 10&nbsp;per cent. reduction in health inequalities, as measured by infant mortality and life expectancy at birth. We will also see further reductions in killer diseases. We have already reduced premature deaths from heart-related disease and from cancer by 27&nbsp;per cent. and 12&nbsp;per cent. respectively in the past six years. By 2010, there will be a fall of at least 40&nbsp;per cent., from 1997&nbsp;figures, in death rates from heart disease and stroke, and a 20&nbsp;per cent. fall in death rates from cancer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para12">
We also want to improve the experience throughout the NHS for all patients. By the end of 2008, for their planned hospital care, as a result of these allocations, all patients will be able to choose between a range of providers, including NHS foundation trusts and NHS and independent sector treatment centres. And because the investment announced today will be matched by the reform in working practices undertaken by staff, patients will be admitted for treatment in England within a maximum of 18&nbsp;weeks from their first appointment with their GP to the door of the operating theatre, with no hidden waits. Having halved waiting times, we will halve them again and halve them once more for patients in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para13">
In addition, we can move away from treating illness and towards preventing it and encouraging health improvement. These resources will also allow us to make progress on prevention towards the original vision of the NHS as a true health service, rather than just a sickness service. Today&#039;s allocations include public health funding of &#163;211&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;342&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;to help make that happen. All areas will receive their share of this funding, but again, a higher proportion will go to the most deprived areas, including the spearhead PCTs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para14">
Of course, this is not all the funding available to deliver the health improvement agenda, but it is a significant proportion of it. It is being allocated directly to front-line PCTs to allow them to implement key initiatives such as improved school health and improved sexual health services. For example, we are providing funding so that by 2010, every PCT in England will be resourced to have at least one full-time, year-round qualified school nurse working with each cluster or group of primary schools and related secondary schools. And not before time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para15">
Our public services must respond to what the public want by giving quality care at the public&#039;s convenience. Under this Government, the NHS&#039;s founding principles will remain firmly in place and will be enhanced by today&#039;s investment, thus giving equal access free at the point of need. But the way in which the services are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1506</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>organised is being transformed, giving patients a more convenient, personalised and responsive service within a system that is not only fair to all, but personal to each of us. That is a key aim for today&#039;s NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-04_para16">
The biggest ever investment in our national health service, the fairest ever distribution of resources and a massive programme of continued reform by staff will together give the increased capacity and diversity of provision that will offer patients faster access to better quality health services than ever before, all free at the point of need under a Labour Government. All those improvements are opposed by the Conservatives, who plan to divert money away from the NHS and to introduce for the first time into NHS commissioning charges for operations. Let the people make the comparison between the two offers and let them make their choice. I commend the statement to the House.
</p>

<p><a name="50209-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 I am of course grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight&#151;a typically generous 30&nbsp;minutes&#151;of the statement. It consisted of 25&nbsp;paragraphs but he could have said it in one, because in fact, there is no extra money when compared with known planned NHS expenditure through to 2007&#150;08. This is simply an attempt by the Secretary of State to divide the cake differently and&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;there is an election coming, so we are to have &quot;spearhead&quot; primary care trusts. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I wonder whether those trusts are located in the Labour-held seats that the Government are worried about.
</p>

<a name="50209-05_para0">
One pity&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="50209-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I have said it before and I will say it again: Members who shout are damaging only themselves, because I shall simply say that the Minister has delivered his statement and that the Opposition have responded. Those Members who want to ask supplementaries had better be quiet. I will be watching.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. One of the pities is that we did not get an opportunity to see the text of the statement, which includes sub-headings that the Secretary of State did not read out, until he had finished delivering it, because the sub-heading before paragraph 18&nbsp;contains an important truth:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;What the funding will deliver&#151;inequalities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para1">
Yes; inequalities between different parts of the country. To defend Labour-held seats, the Secretary of State will take away money from primary care trusts that are running deficits today in order to promise jam tomorrow for his spearhead primary care trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para2">
The overall level of allocations to PCTs reflects the increase in NHS budgets, and to that extent no new money has been announced today. The NHS needs the assurance that under a Conservative Government or a Labour Government substantial increases in NHS budgets are planned. My right hon. Friends and I have committed ourselves to an increase of &#163;34&nbsp;billion by 2009&#150;10&nbsp;compared with the levels that we would inherit in the next financial year. We have made that commitment because we support the NHS and its values, which include the provision of comprehensive, quality heath care for all on the basis of need, not on the basis of ability to pay. We value the work done by NHS 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1507</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>staff, and we intend to give them not only the resources, but the support and freedoms to ensure that they deliver the highest standards of care for patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para3">
A key point is not only to promise, but to deliver high quality care for the 17.5&nbsp;million people who live with long-term conditions. That will require substantial investment in primary care services, and as we set out to the House in our debate on 11&nbsp;November, family doctor services are at the heart of that delivery. The Secretary of State said nothing about opportunities to develop family doctor services. Genuine reform is required to back up the development of standards with resources and to give general practitioners the power to commission services and to support patients&#039; right to choose. At the same time, we should ensure value for money by cutting bureaucracy, which currently consumes many resources that should be in the front line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para4">
The Secretary of State&#039;s statement fails the test of reform. Over the next three years, for example, scheduled care in hospitals should increasingly be determined by patient choice, and GPs should exercise choice on behalf of patients, with money following the patient. Why does it make sense for that funding to form part of the PCTs&#039; unified allocation in 2007&#150;08? If GPs cannot manage the budget, they should not be expected to hold it, and if they have the power to commission services on behalf of their patients, they should receive their budgets directly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para5">
Through the development of the general medical services contract, we have learned that GPs have populations with long-term conditions, like the asthma and diabetes registers. Should we not progressively move money from the general demographic assumptions that underpin the Secretary of State&#039;s proposal to specific factors determining GP budgets? The Secretary of State discussed assumptions about need rather than actual need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para6">
The Secretary of State discussed cancer services, but the lack of progress in commissioning cancer services, which has been illustrated within the past fortnight by the Public Accounts Committee and Doctors for Reform, demonstrates that PCTs are not necessarily delivering progress on cancer services. A combination of clinical networks, GP commissioning and patient choice should deliver services more effectively. Those budgets also do not need to be routed through PCTs. The Secretary of State has failed to set out how NHS funding flows will be reformed. Instead, we have seen an old-fashioned exercise in dividing up the cake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para7">
I have a number of specific questions for the Secretary of State. The previous intention was to move to target allocations by 2010. Is that still the Government&#039;s intention? In this financial year, the combined distance from target of PCTs is &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion. How much does the Secretary of State propose to reduce that total figure by in 2006&#150;07? How much will PCTs that are currently above target be expected to contribute? The Secretary of State implied that there is no ceiling, and therefore every other PCT must contribute to the floors. Will he tell us the percentage contribution towards floors from other PCTs?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para8">
Last week, we heard that the Government are not incorporating 2001&nbsp;census data in the local government finance settlement until 2006&#150;7, but the Department of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1508</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Health proposes to do so in the next financial year. Why are the Government taking one view on local government and another on health?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para9">
As the Secretary of State will know, many areas have fast-growing populations. The removal of type 2&nbsp;funding for general practice left a serious gap that the Department had to plug. The Secretary of State did not refer explicitly to the growth area adjustment, which is contained in the new formula. Will there be an ability to fund the costs of infrastructure not only in the growth areas designated by the Deputy Prime Minister, but wherever large increases in population occur; and will the money arrive in time to match the population growth? In Milton Keynes, the infrastructure has been insufficient to deal with the increases in population experienced up to now, and the PCT is running a projected &#163;6&nbsp;million deficit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para10">
The Secretary of State did not discuss the market forces factor, which continues to fail accurately to reflect NHS costs of provision in all areas. Has the Secretary of State considered moving from a general labour market approach to one based on benchmarked costs of efficient providers once the doctors&#039; contracts and the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; have been fully introduced? The Secretary of State should understand that promises of jam tomorrow are all talk, if at the same time NHS trusts are running deficits and the money that the trusts need is being eaten up in bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para11">
The administrative costs of strategic health authorities are more than &#163;600&nbsp;million, and of PCTs, more than &#163;700&nbsp;million. By cutting bureaucracy in both, we can get sufficient money through to the front line to meet the &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion distance from target of PCTs today. Putting resources and accountability into the front line is essential if Government-imposed cost pressures are not to mean continuing deficits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para12">
Since the new year, one third of SHAs have published their forecasts for the end of this financial year based on figures from the end of December. The total forecast deficit from just nine SHAs is &#163;227&nbsp;million: all 10&nbsp;PCTs in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are forecasting deficits; North East London SHA has a &#163;22&nbsp;million deficit in the year to date; Thames Valley SHA has a &#163;41&nbsp;million deficit; and Surrey and Sussex SHA is forecasting a &#163;33&nbsp;million deficit, half of which results from the working time directive, new contracts and the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para13">
In my area, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA has forecast a &#163;56&nbsp;million deficit. That deficit includes PCTs such as my local one, South Cambridgeshire PCT, which is currently 8&nbsp;per cent. above target. It is forecasting deficits and is above target, but in the Secretary of State&#039;s fantasy world it has more money than it needs. Across the country, PCTs are running deficits, demonstrating that the formula is way out by comparison with actual need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-05_para14">
The Secretary of State is promising money tomorrow while the NHS has deficits today. We could clear the deficit if the billions eaten up in bureaucracy got through to the front line. The Department of Health is imposing costs on the NHS with no idea of the effects. The statement does not deliver reform or urgently needed value for money, which it will be for us to do.

<p><a name="50209-06_spnew0"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I have waited a long time to hear with what ingenuity someone could turn a 10&nbsp;per cent. expenditure increase into a bad news story. Today we have heard an attempt at that. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that it is not Labour that is out of touch either with addressing people&#039;s needs or with improving the national health service; I fear that it is the Conservatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para0">
I shall deal with some of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. As usual, there was a dig at vast administrative costs, bureaucracy and waste. There is always a sting in the tail, with an attack on the staff of the NHS&#151;but Labour will defend them. I shall give a couple of figures. In fact, PCT management costs are 1.5&nbsp;per cent. of total expenditure. The costs of senior managers in the NHS, who number about 38,000&nbsp;out of 1.3&nbsp;million staff, are between 3&nbsp;and 5&nbsp;per cent., which is about a quarter of the management costs in private health care and about one fifth of the administrative costs in the American health care system, so is it not time that we praised the NHS for its efficiency?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para1">
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of deficits, as he has done before. I have two things to say to him on deficits. The first is that they are forecasts: every year for the past few years there has been a forecast deficit in the NHS, but in fact over the past four years the NHS has been in financial balance at the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para2">
The hon. Gentleman wants to talk about forecast deficits, but I can tell him that the problem occurs when there are actual deficits. The last time there was a significant actual deficit&#151;&#163;500&nbsp;million, twice the size of those forecast deficits, in a budget half the current size&#151;was in the last year of a Conservative Government. In other words, the actual deficit then was three times higher than the forecast deficit the hon. Gentleman is worrying about now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para3">
The hon. Gentleman asked me if we would reconsider the market forces factor. We keep it under review, but as he knows, the market forces factor was identified by the resource allocation working party as far back as 1976, so it is not new. Its development is overseen by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, and it is the result of many years of analysis by academics. The population figures from the 2001&nbsp;census that we are using are, first, more accurate and, secondly, adjusted to pay some degree of attention to forward projections. There are four areas, including that of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) and the Thames gateway area, and they will be glad to know that we are taking account of that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1510</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>projected need. I was asked whether deprivation would be taken into account. The answer is that the projections take account of actual as well as assumed need. I could go on at length about that but I do not think that we need to take up more time, because for the past five years we have taken independent advice on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para4">
I finish on this point: the hon. Gentleman started off by challenging the methodology for, and thus the legitimacy of, the allocations. Does that mean that he intends to revisit them? Is he going to tell Members that these huge increases may be taken away from them? If so, he should say that today, because that will be another reason for people to be extremely careful about even considering voting Conservative when the election comes along. The truth is that under the plans of a Conservative Government, &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion will be removed from that expenditure: &#163;4&nbsp;million will be taken from every single PCT to subsidise the relatively well-off to jump the queue and go to the private sector if they can afford half the cost of their operation. That is an attack on the founding principle of the NHS, and I am sure that people out there will recognise the difference between investment in the NHS and an Opposition party committed to the virtual destruction of the ethos of the NHS.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam) (LD):</b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement. As ever with these statements, the devil is in the detail. In broad terms, the Liberal Democrats welcome the allocations announced today and the increased investment that they imply. We see it as our task to continue pressing the Government to make sure that the investment going into the NHS is spent as wisely as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para5">
The Secretary of State talked about primary care trust allocations. Can he tell us when he plans to make announcements about central allocations, too? He had a lot to say about improving public health and tackling health inequalities. In earlier proposals, he set out his plans for a partial ban on smoking in public places. If the intention really is to protect people&#039;s health, why does the health of customers and workers in pubs not need protection unless they are consuming food? How will that policy close the health gap between the richer and poorer areas of our country, which is, it seems, a Government priority?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para6">
Given that the latest National Audit Office report found that many GPs were seriously worried about the effects of the Secretary of State&#039;s patient choice policy on equity in the NHS, can he tell us what measures will be taken to address the real concerns of practitioners up and down the country? Does he agree that the NHS at local level should have the maximum possible freedom to decide how best to meet the health needs of local people, and that meeting those local health needs rather than hitting politically dictated targets should be the priority?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para7">
The Secretary of State said that there would be no more hidden waiting lists, but when will that be? Will he agree to publish, before the election, the hidden waiting times for scans and tests so that people can judge the Government&#039;s record for themselves? Will he also confirm that his target is that by 2008&nbsp;up to 15&nbsp;per cent. of procedures paid for by the NHS will be undertaken by the private sector? Does that not mean that in future 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1511</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the private sector will no longer simply be adding extra capacity to the NHS but replacing existing quality NHS provision?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para8">
What assessment has the Secretary of State made of his targets for PCT budgets? Will he confirm that the guaranteed contract payments for independent treatment centres mean that they will be paid regardless of the work they do, and that that is why 73&nbsp;per cent. of NHS chief executives say that that does not offer good value for the taxpayer? Will the Secretary of State tell us why he thinks that after eight years of Labour Government, top NHS managers describe his approach as political, prescriptive and bullying?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para9">
More people are getting sicker in the NHS because of superbugs. More people are having difficulty in finding dentists on the NHS. More people are struggling to get appointments with GPs when they want them, and more people are waiting on hidden lists for scans and tests. That is the Government&#039;s real record, and that is what will count with our constituents.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-06_spnew2"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 The estimate that up to 15&nbsp;per cent. might be added to capacity, or might be private operations, is just that&#151;an estimate; it is not a target and it is not being driven. It will depend on patient choice. We are expanding the NHS and diversifying the type of treatment, making it much more efficient. It is free at the point of need, and in addition we are buying in bulk to push the price down and to give the patient the choice of quicker access to services. That is precisely why we have halved waiting times, and why we have taken 340,000&nbsp;people off the waiting lists that we inherited from the Conservatives. Ultimately, it will be the choice of the individual&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I cannot hear what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) is saying from a sedentary position. If he is asking whether that is a substitute for NHS operations, I can tell him that when the Government came to power NHS operations were below 5&nbsp;million, and that about 6.5&nbsp;million operations will be carried out directly through the NHS, so we are not taking anything away. In addition, there will be another 500,000. That is good for patients. For heaven&#039;s sake, I wish that for once the Liberals would think of these things from the patient&#039;s point of view, rather than always from the producer&#039;s or the provider&#039;s point of view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para10">
For 60&nbsp;years, no Government of either party have measured hidden waits, and we do not have the mechanisms to do so at present; but I have pledged that if the Labour Government are re-elected not only will we ensure that the maximum wait is 18&nbsp;weeks, as opposed to 18&nbsp;months under the previous Government, but that that will be the time for the whole patient journey. Previously, one third of the journey took up two years, we shall now pledge the time right through from the GP to the door of the operating theatre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para11">
The hon. Gentleman asked about local decision making. At present, 75&nbsp;per cent. of all money is distributed to PCTs, and they take responsibility for it. He asked about GP front-line engagement. Yes, we need more GP engagement in a range of areas, including the introduction of IT, which is why, recently, I put not only more effort but &#163;95&nbsp;million into that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para12">
The hon. Gentleman asked about workers in restaurants and pubs. They will be protected to the maximum where smoking is banned completely. No 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1512</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>restaurants will allow smoking, but even in the minority of pubs that continue to allow smoking, there will be restrictions around the bar area to protect all workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-06_para13">
Finally, I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he said when he started: he appreciated the 8.1&nbsp;and 8.2&nbsp;per cent. increases in his constituency&#151;&#163;35&nbsp;million followed by &#163;37&nbsp;million. He was not in the least bit churlish, and he should not be, because he is getting an 8.1&nbsp;per cent. increase. To put that in context, the person who was churlish&#151;the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the Opposition spokesman&#151;is actually getting a bigger increase: 8.2&nbsp;per cent. I thank the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam for his charitable and non-churlish response.

<p><a name="50209-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Kevin Hughes  (Doncaster, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I warmly welcome the statement and wholeheartedly congratulate my right hon. Friend on what he is doing with the fair shares initiative&#151;it shows the clear difference between us and that lot on the Opposition Benches&#151;but do the increases contain any special recognition for areas such as mine that are having difficulties in recruiting GPs?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew1"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Not for the first time, we have extended the integration of the moneys provided for primary care services, including GPs, and I hope that that will help my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. He may wish to know that in his case, the increases are 9.4&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&#150;07, and 9.3&nbsp;per cent. in the following year, producing an additional two-year cumulative increase of 19.6&nbsp;per cent., so his local services will have &#163;21&nbsp;million more. Those are the figures for the Doncaster, North area, and over in Doncaster, Central, there will be another &#163;25&nbsp;million&#151;an even bigger compound increase of 19.7&nbsp;per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Malcolm Moss  (North-East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 It would be churlish not to welcome these increases, particularly in my constituency, but does the Secretary of State not accept that if my local PCT, the East Cambridgeshire and Fenland PCT, had received its proper funding allocation&#151;it had a shortfall of &#163;8&nbsp;million last year alone&#151;it would not now be colluding with the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mental health trust in closing a 16-bed mental health in-patient unit at Alan Conway Court, Doddington hospital? Perhaps my constituents can take some comfort from the Secretary of State&#039;s statement today when he said, &quot;We must give the public what they want.&quot;
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew3"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for going so far as to say &quot;thank you&quot; at one point. One of his PCTs is getting the third largest increase in the country.

 Long overdue.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew5"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Yes, it may be long overdue, but for 20&nbsp;years under the Conservative Government, such an increase was never given. The hon. Gentleman is now being given a 31.2&nbsp;per cent.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall repeat that, lest he miss it: one of his PCTs is getting a 31.2&nbsp;per cent.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ronnie Campbell  (Blyth Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend never mentioned dentistry. He will be aware that there is more dentistry in the private sector than in the health service, so can he tell us whether he is encouraging dentists to return to the national health service?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew7"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Yes, indeed, I can. My hon. Friend is kind enough to point out that even the fairly huge aggregate figures that were allocated today do not include the &#163;368&nbsp;million extra that is being put towards our attempt to cope with the huge challenge of dentistry, particularly the fact that although there are more dentists, few of them want to do NHS work. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) has been tackling that issue robustly. We do not pretend that it is easy, but I hope that it will be made easier by the fact that in my hon. Friend&#039;s area, Northumberland PCT will receive a &#163;69&nbsp;million increase over two years, which represents increases of 9.1&nbsp;and 8.9&nbsp;per cent.&#151;18.8&nbsp;per cent., when compounded over two years&#151;so there are 69&nbsp;million reasons why he and his constituents should feel that improvements in the NHS will continue in his area.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew8"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire) (Con):</b> 
 Like my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), I welcome increased commitment to the NHS from whichever political party it may come. Is the Secretary of State aware that the two PCTs in my constituency are running at a substantial deficit, which is why, in turn, two hospitals were unable to become foundation trusts? Is he concerned about the gap between the rhetoric in Westminster and the reality on the ground in constituencies such as mine, where ill people read of financial recovery plans, ward closures, closed GP lists, fewer NHS dentists and a worse out-of-hours service? Is he not concerned that the increased allocation that he has just announced may simply be used to pay off the accumulated deficits?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew9"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 No, I am not concerned about that. I thank the right hon. Gentleman&#151;I thought that I caught a &quot;Thanks&quot; just at the beginning of his remarks&#151;and I am sure that he will welcome the extra &#163;30&nbsp;million for the Mid Hampshire PCT, which represents a compounded increase of just under 17&nbsp;per cent. There is also another &#163;34&nbsp;million for the North Hampshire PCT, which represents a 17.7&nbsp;per cent. increase. I do not believe that those increases will be spent on the deficit&#151;I have talked about the difference between forecast and actual deficits&#151;but I ask the right hon. Gentleman to contemplate what the local management in his constituency would have to think about if they knew that instead of getting such an increase, they were facing the equivalent of &#163;24&nbsp;million being taken away to subsidise the Conservative party&#039;s policy of the patient&#039;s passport, which would go to about 8&nbsp;per cent. of his

</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew10"><b> Mrs. Lorna Fitzsimons  (Rochdale) (Lab):</b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for this continued investment in the increased health care provision in the health economy in Rochdale. He will know that Rochdale has one of the&nbsp;most profoundly difficult areas in terms of poverty. The new hospital and the recent announcement of &#163;35&nbsp;million under the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;project represent much needed increased investment. However, in relation to the uplift going to the spearhead areas under the accelerated fair share scheme, are the Government looking at the areas that have been historically underfunded for the past 50&nbsp;years that did not gold-plate their services but undertook them at cost, and at the effect that that is having on issues such as investment in mental health?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew11"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 As for whether we can help to compensate for historical deficits built up by decades of under-investment, even with the huge amount of money that we are investing based on deprivation, need, population growth and projected population growth, it is not possible to compensate everyone for what was effectively underfunding during the years of the Conservative Government. I am sorry that I cannot wave a wand and do that, but we are now giving fair shares. For example, my hon. Friend will find that her constituency is within 0.5&nbsp;per cent. of the PCT target, because of a 19.6&nbsp;per cent. increase, resulting in an accumulated &#163;33&nbsp;million extra over the two years 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. I hope that that will at least go some way, under this Labour Government, towards tackling the previous underfunding under the Conservative Government&#151;although Conservative Members are apparently criticising this large investment today.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew12"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD):</b> 
 I agree with our Front-Bench spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) that these increases are welcome, and far more generous than we ever received in Kingston, or elsewhere in south-west London, under the Conservative Administration. However, does the Secretary of State accept that Kingston is yet again at the bottom of the growth league for spending increases? For example, if Kingston hospital&#039;s budget had increased in line with health spending across the country, it would have &#163;10&nbsp;million more than it now has. He talks about fairness in health spending, but is he taking into account the massive increase in population in areas such as Kingston and the rest of south-west London? When will we get the health funding to match that increase in population?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-07_spnew13"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his thanks, but he should have pointed out that his area will still be about 8&nbsp;per cent. above target. If we compare the need, the population and the projected population of Kingston with those of others, the people there are better off because many others live in areas that are up to 3.5&nbsp;per cent. beneath target.

It will now be about 8&nbsp;per cent. above the target for identified need, and as it will get 8.1&nbsp;per cent. increases in both years, he would be churlish to try to pretend that his constituents are not doing rather well. No doubt while he is complaining about that here, he will claim the credit for it back in his constituency.

I have no problem with that&#151;apart from one small niggling issue. As he knows, my town is developing and has been accepting increased population numbers for many years. Our population will rise again this year. When he talks about money per head of population, is he talking about this year&#039;s population, or the population five years ago?

I have never pretended that we have perfection in the NHS, despite all the progress that we have made. We have a shortage of dentists, radiologists and radiographers, and we could do with more midwives. We have only started our building programme, and we still have long waiting lists, although they are almost 500,000&nbsp;below their peak.

He is right to point out that the figures are based on the 2001&nbsp;census projection.

Of course, Central Manchester is receiving 26.4&nbsp;per cent. There will be an additional &#163;113&nbsp;million over the next two years for those areas, which I hope will be welcomed by my hon.

 The Secretary of State&#039;s statement said that the figures accommodated both current and future projected housing growth.

May I tell him, without rancour, that given the massive house-building programme envisaged for the Thames gateway by the Deputy Prime Minister, the increases, while welcome, are nowhere near enough to provide&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] They are not enough to take account of the scale of house building that will be required. May I, in all sincerity, ask the Secretary of State to reconsider?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-08_spnew7"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 When the hon. Gentleman refers to the bare minimum, I take it that he means the 9.1&nbsp;per cent. and 10.1&nbsp;per cent. increases that he is getting. It is news to me that that is the bare minimum, especially compared with the amounts handed out in the years of the Conservative Government. I hope that he welcomes the &#163;35&nbsp;million extra for Castle Point and Rochford PCT and the &#163;17&nbsp;million for Maldon and South Chelmsford PCT. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I think that there was a nod over there, Mr. Speaker.

I hope that he is being honest enough to tell his constituents that that &#163;24&nbsp;million would be taken away from the money that the PCTs already have. Additionally, NHS Direct would be closed down, as would the primary care trusts, as far as I can see from the James report. All the work done by primary care trusts would thus have to be done by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local general practitioners, but they would receive no extra money. Has he told his GPs that?

Thankfully, that prospect is diminishing almost by the day, if we look at the opinion polls, so perhaps we can turn to the good news, which is that there is &#163;69&nbsp;million extra for my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents, or an increase of 22.3&nbsp;per cent. over two years. That money will go to an area that badly needed it, because it was 6&nbsp;per cent. beneath the assessed need expressed in the target. I would have liked to bring the figure on to target, but that was not possible. The area will be 3.5&nbsp;per cent. beneath target, however, so I hope that that goes some way towards recompensing the efforts that my hon. Friend and his constituents have made to meet me and convince me of the need in their area.

 Many surgeries in my constituency operate from cramped and outdated buildings. Does the allocation that the Secretary of State announced today include money to help GPs expand and improve their premises? If it does not, when will they receive such funding?

 We are making &#163;1&nbsp;billion available for that. The hon. Gentleman will know that the LIFT scheme is now in full swing after a slow start, although I would have liked it to move quicker. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), is overseeing the refurbishment occurring throughout the country, and I think that some 2,000&nbsp;to 3,000&nbsp;premises are being refurbished. The hon. Gentleman can tell all who are interested in their local health care, quite apart from the GPs who are integrally involved in it, that there will be an 11&nbsp;per cent. increase in the first year and a 13&nbsp;per cent. increase in the second year, which is compounded at 20.3&nbsp;per cent. There will be &#163;23&nbsp;million extra, so although the area will be in roughly the same

 May I remind my right hon. Friend that my constituency has the highest level of disability of any constituency? More than one in three households contain at least one disabled person, which is quite clearly a legacy of the former mining industry. I thank my right hon. Friend for today&#039;s announcement and the improved funding situation for health provision in Barnsley. I remind him that historically, under the previous Government, Barnsley was the worst funded health authority in the whole Trent region, despite having some of the highest levels of health problems not just in the Trent region but in the UK as a whole.

<p><a name="50209-09_spnew0"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Yes, indeed; and I can tell my hon. Friend that Barnsley, for instance, is now closer to target than it was previously. It is just 3.5&nbsp;per cent. beneath, and a &#163;61&nbsp;million increase is going in over the two years; that is a 21&nbsp;per cent. increase for Barnsely. I hope that that will assist in an area where there has been terrible deprivation. I know that there are a series of one-stop primary care centres, which have improved health care in my hon. Friend&#039;s area, and there are other developments. For instance, I think that some additional GPs have come into the area recently.

<a name="50209-09_para0">
We must never forget that although we have spent a lot of time today talking about the allocation of moneys, which is what this is about, at the end of the day this is about improving patient care, and there is no doubt in my mind that all the signs on the ground now are showing that, month by month, we are getting much better patient care. This morning I was in Newham, where five years ago there was one consultant in accident and emergency; there are now five. Where there were 50&nbsp;nurses there are now 80. Where they were waiting 10&nbsp;months for a scan only two years ago, now they are waiting less than a week. That is where this money is going&#151;it is going to the patients, and that is as it should be.

<a name="50209-09_time0"><h5>1.32&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209-09_spnew3"><b> Tom Levitt  (High Peak) (Lab):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I should like to raise a point of order, of which I have given your office notice. Anyone who reads the third report of the Standards and Privileges Committee and the debate that was held on the Floor of the House last night cannot fail to conclude that the subject of that report, the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed), did not properly apologise to the House for his conduct as the report required. Indeed, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), who chairs the Committee, said as much in his report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-09_para1">
The response of the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire was, effectively, &quot;I did not do it but I will apologise anyway&quot;. Surely that was a discourtesy to the House. Is this a matter on which you will rule or on which the House needs to take a stand? If it is referred back to the Standards and Privileges Committee, does there have to be a complaint of its own standing or can the Committee carry on the investigation?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I notice that in his speech during the debate, the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee made the following comment:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Committee on Standards and Privileges will need to reflect on whether&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-09_para3">
I am content to leave this matter to the good judgment of the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and his Committee.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Have you or your office received any requests from the Prime Minister&#039;s office for the Prime Minister to come to the House and make a statement on the subject of the wrongful convictions of those who were blamed for the IRA bomb attacks in Guildford and Woolwich? You may be aware that it was widely reported on television this morning that the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) would be seeking to catch your eye, and apparently after discussion with the Prime Minister&#039;s office anticipated that such an apology would be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-09_para4">
The hon. Gentleman was not able to catch your eye&#151;we all know that it is not always possible&#151;but we now learn that the Prime Minister has made such an apology. It is reported on the BBC website that Mr. Blair said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-09_para5">
and that this apology was made in a statement recorded for television. Surely, if apologies of this nature are to be made, they should be made here, in the House. The House deserves rather better treatment than this.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew6"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am sure that I speak for many in the House in saying that you handle these matters impeccably. Nobody should be

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1520</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>able to announce on the radio that a certain question is to be asked to the Prime Minister and answered in a certain way, and I would like to thank you for upholding the dignity of the House.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Can I ask you to confirm, in ruling on the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), whether there is in fact no procedural obstacle to the Prime Minister notifying you that he would wish to make a statement on this subject at the close of business today, or indeed later this week during Parliament&#039;s proceedings? May I suggest to you, Sir, that many of us in all parts of the House would welcome the opportunity to listen to the Prime Minister make such a statement and to question him on it afterwards?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Trimble  (Upper Bann) (UUP):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I endorse entirely everything that the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) has said, but also make the point that had such a statement been made by the Prime Minister in the House, that would have enabled other hon. Members with constituents and people they know who have also suffered from injustices to question the Prime Minister as to why he has been so selective in his recollection of matters?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North) (DUP):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I follow up the matter raised by the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)? I agree with that, in the sense that there are thousands of victims of IRA terrorism and other terrorism in Northern Ireland whose cases are going by default and whose voices are not heard. A statement as suggested would have allowed the opportunity to question the Prime Minister on the continuing delay in the appointment of a victims commissioner.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-09_spnew10"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 What I can say to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) on this point of order is that the Chair is now being drawn into the argument as to whether the Prime Minister should make a statement or not. It is for the Prime Minister or any Minister of the Crown to seek to make a statement before the House, and as right hon. and hon. Members know, when a Minister seeks to make a statement, the request is rarely refused. I therefore do not want to say any more on this matter. The Prime Minister will be able to read <i>Hansard</i> in the same way as everyone else and will have heard what has been stated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-09_para6">
I thank the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) for his support in this matter. Perhaps it is an opportunity to say to hon. Members that no one is entitled to demand to speak at Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time except when I call them, so no one is entitled to make a statement, prior to PM&#039;s Question Time, that they are going to raise this, that or the next thing. I think that we can safely end the matter at this point.

I promise you it was on the basis that there was going to be an announcement anyway.

<p><a name="50209-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. At the heart of my point of order are value for money in Government contracts, the suspicion that the Government have unfairly subsidised Swan Hunter, and their frankness in answering questions on the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para0">
The matter is well known&#151;I raised it on the Floor of the House on 4&nbsp;November in debate and four Labour Members criticised me for my comments. Indeed, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence &quot;utterly rejected&quot; my comments. So the issue of subsidy to Swan Hunter is known to Ministers and the House. I tabled a parliamentary question asking for the amount of support given by the Government to Swan Hunter. The Minister of State&#039;s reply was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Ministry of Defence does not provide financial support to the defence industry.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 11&nbsp;January 2005; Vol.&nbsp;429, c. 381W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para1">
The response to a separate question to the Department of Trade and Industry said that the DTI had given just one grant of &#163;1.2&nbsp;million to Swan Hunter. There the matter may have lain had there not been further discussion and questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para2">
The Government are now saying two different things. To my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howarth), the Minister of State repeated his statement:


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1522</b>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Ministry of Defence does not provide financial support to the defence industry.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4&nbsp;February 2005; Vol.&nbsp;430, c. 1178W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para3">
But in reply to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock), he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I regret that a clerical error in the Ministry of Defence led to an answer being laid which had been overtaken by events.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para4">
We now know that on 10&nbsp;December the Government agreed to give a further &#163;84&nbsp;million to Swan Hunter. One has to ask: when is a pre-election bung not a pre-election bung? I am afraid that the answer seems to be when it is an

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para6">
The fact is that the Minister told me, on the record, that the Ministry of Defence has not supported Swan Hunter, yet it has, in fact, given it a further &#163;84&nbsp;million. Would it not be appropriate for the Minister to come to the House to respond to this point of order?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of his point of order. I have examined the answers given to him and other hon. Members. It is clear to me that the original answers to the two questions asked by the hon. Members for Gosport (Mr.&nbsp;Viggers) and for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) did not give a full or up-to-date picture of the facts relating to the contract in question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para7">
I remind Ministers of their duty to give accurate information to this House and to correct any errors at the earliest opportunity. I also remind them that pursuant answers should be used only to correct errors of fact or printing errors in an earlier answer. They should not be the vehicle for a wholly new answer. I have asked the Table Office to check closely with Departments the nature of the correction to be made before authorising the use of such pursuant answers in future.

<p><a name="50209-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,

<p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about protective helmets for children riding on motor cycles as pillion passengers; to make further provision about motor cycle construction and use in relation to pillion passengers; to make it an offence to carry a child as a pillion passenger without parental consent; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para8">
My constituent Sean Pearce-Weston was only eight years old when he was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident in May last year. It happened on the Pevensey bypass. He was riding as a pillion passenger on a 750cc Honda motorbike owned by a friend of the family. The bike collided with a Ford Fiesta. Sean suffered serious head, neck and back injuries. He was airlifted to the local district general hospital, and later transferred to King&#039;s college hospital, where ultimately his life support machine was turned off. His parents were unaware that he had gone for a ride. He was wearing a helmet that was either ill fitting or with the strap undone. In any event, I understand it was not a specially designed child&#039;s helmet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para9">
I was contacted by Sean&#039;s mother Cassie and her friend and neighbour Clare Lacey. Despite the terrible grief suffered by family and friends, Cassie&#039;s main priority since the terrible accident has been to campaign for better regulations to try to ensure that what happened to Sean cannot happen again to anyone else&#039;s son or daughter. I pay tribute to Cassie and the whole family for their bravery and determination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para10">
Cassie started a petition in my constituency. It rapidly attracted not hundreds but thousands of signatures. Currently it has more than 7,000&nbsp;signatures. There were very strong feelings on the matter in my constituency, especially in the Langney area. I was left asking: how did Sean come to be on this pillion seat without proper protection and without his parents&#039; knowledge or consent? Would a change in the law help to avoid a similar tragedy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para11">
I have to admit that my initial reaction was to press for a blanket ban on children being carried as pillion passengers. I am still of the view that very young children have no place on motorcycles. I have delved into the legal and practical issues very carefully, and I met a range of organisations and bodies. I would like to pay particular thanks to the British Motorcyclists Federation, in particular Mr. Richard Olliffe. It is a responsible organisation that has been working hard through the Advisory Group on Motorcycling to develop a national motorcycle strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para12">
I do not wish to demonise motorcyclists. During this campaign, I have received e-mails and letters from bikers across the country&#151;indeed, across the globe. As the BMF says in its mission statement, motorcycling is a legitimate means of personal transport and form of recreation. About 1&nbsp;million motorcycles are registered for use on our roads.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para13">
I recognise that the vast majority of bikers are responsible people who take particular care when carrying their own children on their pillion seat, but the case of young Sean suggests to me that there is a minority who are less responsible and that some changes 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1524</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the existing law are required. From the outset, I was determined that any change in the law should be fair, proportionate and enforceable. I am not interested in empty gestures and neither are Sean&#039;s family. Some accidents are unavoidable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para14">
Among the other organisations I consulted were the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, Brake&#151;the road safety charity&#151;the Motor Cycle Industry Association and Sussex Police. I am grateful for all the expert advice that they have given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para15">
The existing laws of direct relevance to this case can be summarised as follows: a motor bike must be equipped with suitable supports or rests for the feet of the pillion passenger; pillion passengers must be capable of sitting astride a proper seat securely fixed to the motorcycle; a pillion passenger must wear a safety helmet; and the decision to carry a passenger remains with the rider, who is legally responsible for ensuring that the passenger is safely supported.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para16">
On 21&nbsp;July last year, I went to the Department for Transport with Cassie and her daughter to present the petition. A few days earlier, I had sent a letter setting out my concerns following the accident and asking Ministers to review the legal position. The Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), who is on the Front Bench, was otherwise engaged, but was good enough to write the following day expressing his condolences to the family. In his letter he stressed that the Government were concerned about motorcycle safety and made the point that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Motorcyclists are our most vulnerable road users and are some 30&nbsp;times more likely to be killed on the road than car users and 4&nbsp;times more likely to be killed than cyclists.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para17">
However, he concluded:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government believes that present regulations do not make it necessary to amend the legislation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para18">
The Minister&#039;s review of the legislation cannot have been too comprehensive because that was in reply to my letter of 8&nbsp;July. Very prompt, but suggesting, perhaps, a not too deep and long-standing review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para19">
I have concluded that rather than a blanket ban, three things are required. First, there should be a clear legal obligation that where a child is to be carried as a pillion passenger by anyone other than a parent or legal guardian, the consent of a parent or guardian must be obtained. That should be backed up by stiff penalties. Had that obligation existed and been enforced before this tragic accident, it is more than likely that Sean would not have been on the bike in the first place. Parents have a right to know that their children will not be placed in possible danger without their knowledge and consent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para20">
Secondly, it should be crystal clear that a child must wear a properly fitting and specially designed child&#039;s helmet. The best information I have been able to obtain is that Sean was wearing a full-face adult lady&#039;s helmet. It was the smallest size available, and although it probably fitted the diameter of Sean&#039;s head reasonably well, the differences in the jaw of an adult female and a child meant that the strap did not fit properly, so the helmet came off on impact. So wearing a helmet was of no use at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para21">
It must make sense for the law to require that specially designed children&#039;s helmets are worn. I understand from ROSPA that it plans to seek funding to create an advice 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>leaflet for parents on taking their children on their pillions, which would look at all these issues. The BMF tells me that it would support moves to ensure that helmets approved to current UK and EU standards are readily available in child head sizes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para22">
Thirdly, the regulations governing the design of foot rests, or &quot;pegs&quot;, must make it clear that the very youngest child could not legally ride pillion, and that the manufactured position of foot rests cannot be modified. At present, as I have explained, the law requires that the passenger must be able to reach the foot rests. But certain sports bikes have the rests in more accessible places, and there seems to be some evidence that owners may modify their bikes, including the position of the rests. In fairness, I should say that the BMF does not support a ban on modifying the position of foot rests, but in a constructive spirit, it has told me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The BMF is however concerned that riders may not be aware of their obligations to pillion passengers and would therefore support a Department of Transport publicity campaign to ensure that riders and pillions are aware of their obligations under the current regulations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-10_para23">
What has been the legal aftermath of this tragedy in my constituency&#151;the very sad death of young Sean Pearce-Weston? The rider of the motorcycle has not been prosecuted. The driver of the car was prosecuted and admitted driving without due care and attention, rather than dangerous driving. He was fined &#163;500&nbsp;and banned from driving for six months. Sean&#039;s mother pointed out in the local paper at the time that &#163;500&nbsp;was less than the cost of organising Sean&#039;s funeral.

I understand that the coroner&#039;s court in this case is due to reconvene on 5&nbsp;April. Only after that final hearing does the Coroners Act allow the release of the formal police report on this tragic incident. It will, I am sure, make interesting reading. It is quite possible that the coroner may decide to make recommendations relating to the carriage of child pillion passengers on motor bikes. I hope that he does, and if he does, that the Government will seriously consider acting on those recommendations and on mine.

The Bill has two linked purposes: to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the European Union constitutional treaty, and to decide that ratification can take place only if there is a positive vote in a United Kingdom referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para4">
Before coming to the Bill itself, let me first put it in context and explain why the new treaty is needed. The European Union&#039;s institutions and rules were designed some 50&nbsp;years ago, for just six members. Since then, a succession of amendments in overlapping treaties has been agreed by the EU&#039;s member nations. But with the EU&#039;s biggest enlargement last year taking its membership to 25, and with the prospect of further expansion, it was clear that those successive treaties had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1527</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to be consolidated and clarified. In addition, there was a need for reform of the European Union to make it more effective, efficient and accountable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para5">
When the first draft of the treaty was produced in the Convention, I published a detailed White Paper setting out the changes that would be required by the Government and the House if we were to sign up to the treaty. Over the following 10&nbsp;months of intensive negotiations, we achieved every one of our negotiating objectives&#151;a success that was widely recognised across Europe. The French newspaper <i>Le Monde</i> called the treaty &quot;a British victory&quot;. <i>Corriere della Sera</i> in Italy declared that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the British won the day&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para6">
Laurent Fabius, leader of the French &quot;No&quot; campaign, said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the British concept has won&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para7">
Those comments reflect the nature of the new constitutional treaty&#151;a framework for our kind of Europe, which gives us a strong role in a Union of free and sovereign nations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para8">
The new treaty spells out in clearer terms than before that this is an organisation of freely co-operating nations&#151;free to decide where to work together, free to stop doing so if they agree that it no longer makes sense, and free to take at any time a sovereign decision to pull out of the EU entirely. The constitutional treaty puts Europe&#039;s members firmly in control. It replaces the current system of six-monthly rotating presidencies of the European Council, the body in which the EU&#039;s member countries set the organisation&#039;s priorities, with a full-time Chair to ensure that it is we, the nations, who set the EU&#039;s agenda and get it implemented. That is a widely supported reform, and its supporters include, I am pleased to say, the new leader of the Conservative party in the European Parliament. The only opposition to the reform appears to have been led by the former European Commission, not the present one, and the British Conservative party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para9">
The new treaty slims down the size of the European Commission. It states that the EU&#039;s common foreign and security policy will remain fully under the control of Europe&#039;s nations, who can agree a common approach only when every one of those nations wishes to do so. One person, accountable to the EU&#039;s members and taking orders only from them, will implement this policy, replacing the disjointed system that we have today involving a high representative and a member of the Commission whose loyalties are ambiguous and are to the Commission, not to the European Foreign Ministers of nations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para10">
The new treaty ensures that national Parliaments must ratify any future changes to the EU&#039;s arrangements. The Bill gives that statutory effect in clause 2. For the first time, the treaty gives national Parliaments the power to send draft EU legislation back for review if one third of national Parliaments believe that the draft law infringes the principle that the EU should act only where it adds value&#151;the so-called subsidiarity principle. That is an important and welcome reform, to which the Bill gives further statutory effect. It is not directly reflected in the treaty, but in the Bill I have added to the provisions of the treaty so as better to assist Parliament in that task. Under clause 3, the relevant Minister will have a statutory duty to lodge 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1528</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a written statement with Parliament certifying whether or not a given draft EU law, in the Government&#039;s view, complies with the subsidiarity principle.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b> 
 We have that power at present, as we can object on subsidiarity grounds. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee. The Commission can ignore our objections, and that will also happen under the constitution. The Commission already has to justify its proposals on subsidiarity grounds. It can overrule our objections, and it will be able to do so under the draft constitution. What, therefore, is the advance?
</p>





<p><a name="50209-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 There is a big advance, because there was a power on paper in the Maastricht treaty, but it did not have any procedure behind it. As every lawyer in the House knows, if we do not have procedure, we cannot access rights. By making provision for one third of national Parliaments to raise a yellow card to a proposal, the treaty ensures that in future there will be a proper procedure. Moreover, with help from Members from all parts of the House, I have sought to strengthen the role of the House and Parliament in scrutinising EU legislation. In my judgment, legislation is always improved if there is effective scrutiny, and that is as true of EU legislation as it is of domestic legislation. I wanted to introduce a duty on Ministers, and therefore officials and Departments, to check EU draft legislation to see whether or not it accorded with the subsidiarity principle. That is what we will have under the Bill, but we do not have it at the moment.

<p>
<a name="50209-11_para11">
The treaty provides Europe with a fairer and clearer voting system for making decisions, giving the larger member states relatively more power. One of the many improvements that we achieved during the intergovernmental conference was the raising of the thresholds for qualified majority voting from 50&nbsp;per cent. of EU member states and 60&nbsp;per cent. of the EU population to 55&nbsp;per cent. of member states and 65&nbsp;per cent. of population, which helps this country. The treaty sets out arrangements known as &quot;enhanced co-operation&quot; to allow groups of member states within Europe to work together more closely in certain areas without everyone having to take part, but it ensures that there is a level playing field. Such co-operation is allowed only if it does not harm the interests of those nations not choosing to participate. Last year, that policy was advocated by the Leader of the Opposition.
</p>

<p><a name="50209-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West) (Con):</b> 
 The Foreign Secretary said that the House would have far more power to refer matters under subsidiarity, but when I asked the Leader of the House a question just a couple of weeks ago, I was told that no such proposals are yet in place and that the Government do not have any idea about the way in which that would operate. The Foreign Secretary is trying to suggest that we have new procedures and would have more power, but the Leader of the House made it clear that that is not the case.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is misinformed. First, the Bill makes provision for a new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>procedure and, secondly, I have already made proposals to the House, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and the European Scrutiny Committee about ways in which the House can better improve scrutiny arrangements. It is not for the Government to tell the House how it should exercise its scrutiny responsibilities. That is a matter for the House, and I look forward to receiving its recommendations. I simply say to the hon. Gentleman that he is pushing at an open door.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para0">
On immigration, asylum and frontier controls, the new treaty sets out effective provisions for working together across borders, but it gives Britain the choice to opt in to those measures in which we want to participate and to stay out of those in which we do not. The new treaty extends the application of qualified majority voting in the EU in that area and others to ensure effective decision making where it is in our interests. I am unapologetic about that extension, and I hope that that is the case, too, for the whole House, including Members who served as Ministers in previous Governments such as the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). It was Baroness Thatcher who, as Prime Minister, spelled out the case for qualified majority voting when it is in our interest. Majority voting stops individual countries blocking vital reform. If the status quo is against us, we must be at the head of reform. That is exactly what we have done with reform to the common agricultural policy, which we could never have achieved if countries with a vested interest in the status quo were able to veto any changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para1">
There are about 50&nbsp;so-called improvement changes resulting from the change from veto to majority voting. Most are frankly trivial. They extend from procedures for repealing measures relating to the past division of Germany to the appointment of the executive board of the European Central Bank, neither of which affects the United Kingdom. At the end of the documents that have been laid before the House there is a complete table of such changes. Changes have also been made on asylum and immigration, although most of those were made under the Amsterdam treaty, and on criminal procedural law, but we have an emergency brake in certain areas and an opt-out in others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para2">
Crucially, the new treaty sets limits on the European Union&#039;s powers and, for the first time, they are listed clearly. The powers of the EU are limited to those given freely by its members. Again, for the first time, there is a procedure to modify or reduce the exercise of those powers. The treaty guarantees that the national veto is maintained on crucial issues on which we need it, such as tax, social security, fundamental aspects of criminal law, the financing of the EU, treaty changes, foreign policy and defence. By incorporating the charter of fundamental rights, the treaty includes a consolidation of existing rights, freedoms and principles, thus limiting the scope of the EU institutions. The charter makes it clear that the EU must respect the fundamental liberties of our citizens whenever it acts. The treaty itself spells out the fact that the charter is not, and cannot, be used 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1530</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>as a source of new human rights in this country. My right hon. and noble Friend the Attorney-General put it well when he described the charter in a speech last year as
</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>





<p><a name="50209-12_spnew2"><b> Sir Michael Spicer  (West Worcestershire) (Con):</b> 
 The Foreign Secretary is suggesting that increased national powers are involved. Surely, however, the whole point of the new constitution is that it will remove Parliament as the root of our legal system.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised that, and I invite him to look at the treaty, the White Papers that I have produced, the evidence that I have given and the detailed commentary. There is absolutely no provenance for his statement. Remarks by hon. Members sitting next to him and by his Front-Bench team show that part of the Conservative party is trying to pretend that the proposed treaty changes the position of the primacy of European law in relation to the United Kingdom. It does not. The primacy of obligations laid out in international treaties arises in principle not from the treaty or previous EU treaties but from article 27&nbsp;of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties. I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House to consider this: if a country entered into solemn treaty obligations but could then ignore them, there would never be any point in agreeing international treaties. Some countries have to incorporate every single part of international treaties directly into their domestic law&#151;that is the case in the United States&#151;but other countries, including the United Kingdom, take a dualist approach. The issue of primacy is present in international obligations. It was present when we joined the European Union, and it was at the heart of the argument during the 1975&nbsp;referendum campaign. The position has not changed, and as one of the first articles in the treaty makes clear, European law, in respect of European competences but nothing else, has primacy. It is made clear that that is simply a restatement of the existing jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-12_spnew4"><b> Tony Wright  (Cannock Chase) (Lab):</b> 
 Does not this exchange reveal that in practice the proposed referendum will not be about the terms of the constitution but will be a vote about whether or not we want to be a member of the European Union? In that sense, it will be a defining moment for this country and our relationship with Europe.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 One can never tell exactly the basis on which individuals vote in the privacy of the ballot box. I hope very much that the vote will be about the merits of the treaty. I am confident about its merits, and the fact that it works for Britain and makes a European Union that is much more in the image that we seek. My hon. Friend is right to imply that some in the Conservative party&#151;by no means all of them&#151;wish to use a no vote in the referendum on the treaty as a Trojan horse to drive the United Kingdom towards withdrawing from the European Union altogether.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para3">
The new treaty fulfils every one of the commitments that I set out in the Government&#039;s White Paper in advance of the negotiations. All the institutional changes are beneficial to Britain and to the British people: a limit on the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1531</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>European Union&#039;s powers, a better-managed European Union, greater say for national Governments and Parliaments, and flexible arrangements to allow some members to go at a different speed from others. All those changes are proposals for which the Conservatives have called separately, but to which they now, incredibly, object, as illustrated in the rambling, rather oxymoronic reasoned amendment that they have tabled. That is why we have heard a litany of distortion and inaccuracy from them about what is in the text.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para4">
Let me be clear about what the new treaty will not do. It does not change the United Kingdom&#039;s position with respect to joining the euro. It does not hand control of our borders, foreign policy or armed forces to the European Union. It does not take away our seat at the United Nations, and nor&#151;perhaps the most absurd claim of all&#151;does it replace Her Majesty the Queen as Head of State. I can understand that the British public are concerned when they hear such claims about the treaty, but as discussion has gone on, so the myths and distortions have been exposed. People can increasingly see the reality, which is that the treaty will set a stable, predictable and limiting framework for the European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-12_para5">
Let me now turn to the second purpose of the Bill: a referendum in the UK and in Gibraltar to decide whether to ratify the constitutional treaty. I should point out to the House one of the many manifest absurdities of the so-called reasoned amendment tabled by the official Opposition. It asks that we decline to give the Bill a Second Reading. If there is no Second Reading, there is no Bill, and if there is no Bill, there will be no referendum. Having called for a referendum for months and months, the Conservatives have manoeuvred themselves into the extraordinary position of deciding to vote against it the moment they are actually offered one.

The Bill presents a choice on whether to approve the new constitutional treaty. It is important to be clear about the nature of that choice. If Parliament and the British people approve the treaty, we will fix the framework for our sort of Europe, with the reforms that I have described, but if we reject it, we are in unknown territory, and I suggest that we will be weak and isolated in Europe. We would have no option but to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask our partners to start all over again, reopening negotiations in which we had secured such a good result. If we got any deal at all, it would be a worse and not a better one, negotiated from a position of weakness, not of strength. The long-term effect would

If the Conservative party&#039;s policy on Europe reflects nothing else, it reflects a deeply felt pessimism about its own future and the future of this country. The Conservatives say that their policy is about sovereignty, and that that is the purpose of their reasoned amendment, but it is not so. Their policy could represent only an inexorable weakening of Britain&#039;s power and influence. The Conservative party mistake isolation for sovereignty. By definition, a castaway on a desert island is sovereign, but he has no power. By playing a strong role in the EU, Britain strengthens the power of this nation. The alternative, offered by the Conservative party, is exactly the isolation and weakness that would be so damaging to our power and prosperity.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">That this House declines to give a second reading to the European Union Bill because, whilst it enables the broadly-supported and necessary Referendum to be held on the Constitution for Europe, it also provides for the implementation into UK law of that Constitution for Europe; it enshrines the primacy of European Union law and puts in place many of the elements of a state; it transfers further powers to the European Union institutions and further promotes the concept of a common foreign and security policy and a common economic policy; it further encourages the over implementation of European regulations; it extends the powers to legislate by order; it extends the competences of the European Union in many areas including asylum and immigration, criminal and civil law; and it therefore further diminishes the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.</p>

Despite the welcome provisions in the Bill for the holding of a referendum, our amendment shows clearly why we will decline to support this Second Reading today.

First, it seeks to import into our own law the provisions of the constitution for Europe, and, secondly, it enables the referendum to be held. There should have been two separate Bills. As with devolution, it would have made sense for Parliament to know the public&#039;s mind before legislating to implement.

 I asked a question on how widely that had been circulated, to which I received an answer, and if the Minister looks that up, he will find that not a lot of people in Britain will see that particular document. In an earlier debate I challenged the Minister to send a copy of this constitution to every elector, and on that occasion he was very encouraging in his reply, but I see that that has now disappeared from the Government&#039;s agenda.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is getting to one of the core problems here, which is that we started with a treaty, which is essentially a deal between various Governments, and have turned it into a constitution. Some of us favour a written constitution. We think that written constitutions are so good that they should not just go to Iraq or Europe, but to the UK as well. But will the right hon. Gentleman accept that there is now a contradiction, because instead of trying to win people to an inspiring written constitution for a very large project, whether he agrees with it or not, we now have a highly technical, treaty-oriented, Euro-babble-ridden document that will make it even harder for those of us who support a written constitution for Europe to sell it to the British people?

 I have a great deal of sympathy for the hon. Gentleman in the difficulty that he will have in selling this to the British people.

That is why we have to deal with it in terms of it being the constitution that the Government seek to implement, and deal with it in its detail.

Will there be a full parliamentary process before a referendum is held, and would that parliamentary process be conducted on an altogether more sensible timetable than is suggested for this, or is it the Conservative Front Bench&#039;s policy that we have no parliamentary process and go straight to a quick referendum on the whole thing?

<p>
<a name="50209-14_para3">
The taxpayer should wake up to the extent to which they will be fleeced to pay for this shameless one-sided propaganda exercise. The Minister for Europe said that the Government plan to spend &quot;serious money&quot; promoting the EU constitution, and we now discover that for once he was not joking. A written answer on 17&nbsp;January revealed that the Government have tripled their budget for spending to promote the EU constitution from &#163;200,000&nbsp;last year to more than &#163;600,000&nbsp;this year. What on earth has happened to this recommendation by the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government of the day in future referendums should, as a government, remain neutral and should not distribute at public expense literature, even purportedly &#039;factual&#039; literature, setting out or otherwise promoting its case&quot;?</p>

when the treaty itself refers to &quot;a Constitution for Europe&quot;, but so far I have received no answer. It is vital that there is no ambiguity in the question, and it must therefore be logical that it uses the same descriptive terminology as the treaty, namely: &quot;A Treaty to establish a Constitution for Europe&quot;. Indeed, this week the Electoral Commission commented that it

It notes that the proposed question is a modification of the treaty title rather than the exact title. Its own model question, produced in October 2004, uses the correct name.

I will come shortly to the reasons for our objections to the constitution and to the myths with which the Government have sought to surround it, but I want first to deal with several points arising from the Bill.

In addition, the fundamental provisions of the constitution, including those relating to legal primacy&#151;to which we have long objected&#151;will be given legal effect within our law. There is also a major extension of the Government&#039;s power to legislate by statutory instrument. Ironically, that extension of bureaucratic power at the expense of Parliament is not mandated by the adoption of the constitution. It is simply a Whitehall power grab; it is gold-plating the constitution on a grand scale. That from the Foreign Secretary who told us a year ago:
</p>

On top of that, parliamentary approval for constitutional changes in the EU, such as extending qualified majority voting still further, which until now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has required primary legislation, will now only require an abbreviated procedure.

The Bill is certainly not the inoffensive measure that the Government would have us believe.

I had thought that their assertion that the real choice facing the British people is whether they want to be in or out of Europe&#151;the Foreign Secretary was rather less assertive about it today, but the Minister for Europe keeps returning to it on the radio&#151;was pure propaganda. I am beginning to conclude that they have become the victims of their own spin and that they genuinely believe it.

However, the most worrying aspects are in the detail of the constitution&#039;s effects.

In this country, we are currently debating which party has the best policies to deal with the problems of asylum and immigration. Under the constitution, that debate would be redundant.

 My right hon. and learned Friend has mentioned asylum and immigration policy several times. I find some difficulty in following his argument and, indeed, the argument in the reasoned amendment, to which he put his name. As I read the document, the protocol on page 130&nbsp;removes from the United Kingdom the application of the new provisions on asylum and immigration law. In other words, we are completely protected and allowed under the protocol to go on legislating about that for ourselves. In what way and why are provisions that explicitly do not apply to this country on asylum and immigration a reason for not acceding to the treaty?

Let us face it, the European Union is not performing as it should. If it had the same record as the United States on creating jobs, 28&nbsp;million more people would be in work in the European Union today. It is time to take a fresh look, and rejection of this constitution would allow us to go back to the drawing board. The reality is that a European Union of 25&#151;and possibly more&#151;member states can work only if it is generally recognised that different countries want different levels of integration. Why should we not let each country find the level of integration with which it feels comfortable? We need a new, imaginative structure for the European Union, and a flexible approach would ensure that we could create a made-to-measure Europe in which the institutional arrangements comfortably fitted national interests, rather than an off-the-peg Europe that is ill fitting and, as we now know, splitting at the seams.

So the Government&#039;s argument that there is no alternative to the constitution, and that it is absurd to call for powers to be brought back to the nation state, is simply bunkum.

And it is because we want our fisheries to thrive like Norway&#039;s rather than continue to endure an unsustainable plundering that we believe that national and local control should be restored to our fisheries. By rejecting this constitution, and through negotiation, we can develop a European Union that works better for Britain and better for itself.

Europe is facing relative decline. The constitution embodies the ossified thinking that lies behind it, and it is time for a fresh start. The new Commission President&#039;s call for jobs and growth to be the priority is welcome evidence that at last new thinking is emerging. Our view is that the European Union is worth renewing. The single market has, despite its faults, been a force for wealth creation. Our air is cleaner as a result of European co-operation on pollution. Old enemies have been reconciled and young democracies have found a stable home through the European Union. We actually want the EU to succeed. But it will not succeed if it is railroaded by a political elite with an overweening ambition to create a European superpower, clinging to an outmoded social model.

I heard the shadow Foreign Secretary on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning, which rather interfered with my concentration on brushing my teeth. He claimed that we were once again on the one-way escalator towards giving greater power to Brussels. I have to say to him that that is not what is in the treaty. The treaty ought to be welcomed by those who want to put a limit on the creep of competence to Brussels. It specifically defines, limits and sets down what the competences of Brussels 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1547</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are. Indeed, if the right hon. and learned Gentleman cares to look up article I.13, which lists the exclusive competences of Brussels, he will find that they are modest and short. There are only four such exclusive competences, and only three of them apply to Britain because we are not a member of the euro. There is no substantial expansion of competence anywhere in the constitution. That is why I can understand that Romano Prodi expressed disappointment with the outcome. I cannot, however, understand why those who are worried about powers creeping to Brussels should be disappointed by an outcome that not only places a limit on those powers, but places a limit on them where they already are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-17_para7">
The shadow Foreign Secretary spoke about paving the way for a country called Europe, but this constitution does nothing of the kind. It is explicit that the power of the European Union comes from competences that are conferred by the member states. That is in the first sentence of the first paragraph of the first article of the constitution. One does not need to read 500&nbsp;pages, just the first sentence, to grasp that elementary principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-17_para8">
One of the big shifts in the balance with Brussels that the constitution will bring is the result of one of the new big beasts in the Brussels jungle&#151;the full-time President of the European Council. Until now, we have had a deeply unsatisfactory system, with presidents who not only changed every six months&#151;just when they were getting a grip on strategy and direction&#151;but tried to run Europe in the spare time left over from running their own countries. Now we will have something totally different. There will be a full-time president, permanent for two and a half years, probably for five years because it is renewable, based in Brussels with his or her own staff&#151;someone who will actually provide a change in the focus of Brussels to keep tabs on the Commission, initiate proposals and, as it says in the constitution, &quot;drive forward the agenda&quot;. For the first time, the member states in the Council will have a full-time, permanent figurehead to set the agenda on behalf of the member states. That is a major shift away from the present balance held by the supranational institutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-17_para9">
It is also very welcome, I have to say, that we will now know what goes on in the Council of Ministers. For the first time, as a result of the constitution, the Council of Ministers will meet in public whenever it passes legislation. I would have thought that everyone in this Chamber could welcome that, because it ends what was, frankly, an embarrassment. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the only legislative body left in Europe that met in secret was the Council of Ministers. It will now meet in public and we can see what is done there, which will make it more accountable, in turn, to the national Parliaments.

My hon.

My right hon.

In those circumstances, they would not cut off their noses to spite their faces.

I want to return to a point that was implicit in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on the Single European Act. Much of it is indeed consolidated inside this text, but although there some new matters are included, I would stress that 80&nbsp;per cent. of it comprises the existing five treaties to which we have already signed up. Those who want Britain to vote no must be honest and tell people that they would not be voting no only to the new matter, but to the whole basis on which we have been a member of the EU for the last 30&nbsp;years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-18_para2">
I listened carefully to what the shadow Foreign Secretary said about renegotiation, but when he claimed that Mr. Bot would agree with him to renegotiate, I would point out to him that Mr. Bot signed this constitution. His name appears in the early pages of the document; the idea that he is now going to start renegotiating something that he has already authorised and signed seems to me to be pure fantasy and delusion. In the end, if another dozen European countries have referendums and vote yes, we should not imagine that their Governments are then going to settle cheerfully down and have a look at renegotiating the terms that they commended to their own people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-18_para3">
Lastly, I want to say that when I was Foreign Secretary, I was impressed by the extent to which we live in an interdependent world. Our prosperity, security, freedom from organised crime&#151;even our weather&#151;depend on our success in achieving common approaches with the rest of our continent. The EU is an intelligent progressive model for trying to achieve such agreement. Of course, it is a condition of membership that compromises have to be accepted and that the option of going it alone has to be given up, but those are not just the conditions of membership of the EU, they are conditions of life in our modern interdependent world. In trying to reject the conditions of the EU, those hon. Members who are saying no to the constitution are also seeking to say no to modern reality. That is the case for voting yes to the constitution&#151;for the sensible improvements that it makes to sensible arrangements for the modern world.

Those two especially well written sentences contain the essence of the document that we are invited to consider today. I welcome this Bill, and I especially welcome its provisions for a referendum. When Mr. Bryan Gould, as he was then, introduced what I think was new clause 51&nbsp;of the Bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty&#151;the new clause called for a referendum on that treaty&#151;my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I, and other hon. Members from all parties, voted to support the proposal.
</p>

<a name="50209-18_para5">
As I have said often in the House before, I believe that it is right, for constitutional and political reasons, to seek the endorsement of the people of the UK when the intention is to change the relationship between Brussels and Westminster. I very much hope that the Bill will pass into law before what we understand to be the date of the general election, although I have some doubts whether sufficient legislative time is available in both Houses of Parliament. If the general election is called for 5&nbsp;May, I believe that it would be right to fight it on the provisions of this Bill, and in particular on the proposal that the constitution should be ratified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-18_para6">
As far as I know, at no time in history have any British Government signed a treaty that has not been ratified subsequently. However, the logic of those who would reject the Bill and the constitution seems to be that there are no circumstances in which this country would ratify a treaty entered into by our Government. That would be a very novel constitutional position to adopt. It would almost certainly put into very sharp contrast our relations with our EU allies. Therefore, rejection of the Bill would immediately provoke something of a constitutional impasse with the EU, and perhaps worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-18_para7">
Many people say that the debate on the referendum, when it takes place, must be on the terms of the constitution itself, but I think that they are guilty of wishing for something that cannot be achieved. Does anyone seriously believe that the debate on the referendum, once it begins, will be conducted both in the country and in those newspapers that are most violently against the EU on anything other than the question of whether membership is good for us or otherwise? It will be beholden on us to argue for the principle of EU membership, as well as for the terms and merits of a particular document.

<br>&nbsp;<br>The aim was to avoid the continent of Europe being subjected to the destruction, war and loss of life that had disfigured it three times in the preceding 80&nbsp;years. War between EU member states is now inconceivable. That is neither incidental nor fortuitous; it is a consequence of the EU&#151;and, yes, of NATO as well. It is something of which I think that we are too often careless. We too often forget the genesis of the EU, and what it has achieved.

<a name="50209-18_para9">
The Foreign Secretary said earlier that our membership of the EU allowed us to join France and Germany in seeking to influence the policies of Iran, in an area that is of vital importance for our security. The remarkable handshake that we saw yesterday may presage a new chapter in the relations between Israel and the Palestinians. The EU, collectively, will have an enormous influence on the outcome of the journey on which Israel and the Palestinians appear to have set out. That influence will stem from what we can contribute and from the political influence that we can bring to bear.

<a name="50209-18_para10">
The argument for the EU that will inevitably form part of a referendum campaign must not be allowed to go by default. It is also worth reminding ourselves that only a few years ago eight of the new members of the EU were satellites of the Soviet Union, and that three member states&#151;Spain, Portugal and Greece&#151;were dictatorships. It is inconceivable that those countries would revert to dictatorships, or that the former Soviet satellites would do anything other than adhere to the principles of democracy and open markets that we in this country have taken for granted so long but to which they have sought to aspire.

For example, <i>The Sun</i> would have us believe that 2&nbsp;million people would be unemployed, that we could not have acted in the Falklands or the Gulf without President Chirac&#039;s approval, and that we would lose our seat on the UN Security Council.

I hope that we will not conduct our discussion on these matters as if we are engaged in some grand ideological contest, or a form of political combat in which victory is always equated with the successful defence of sovereignty in what is essentially a 19th-century concept, or even older.

In a modern and connected world, sovereignty is not preserved by disengagement. It is undermined by isolation and enhanced by co-operation.

As the recent United Nations high-level panel report observes, there has been globalisation not just of opportunities, but of threats and challenges, and only co-operative action will equip us to meet those challenges. Some say&#151;perhaps portentously, but there may be some truth in it&#151;that those challenges have the capacity to damage the very values upon which our nation is based.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-19_spnew5"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 I pause to think, but I cannot immediately bring to mind areas in which the veto has been given up.

Moreover, if 45&nbsp;per cent. of national Parliaments&#151;national Governments&#151;tell the European Union that they do not like a proposal, there is a veto.

 In support of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s point, may I add that had we involved this House in more detail with certain areas in which there was a red card, pro-Europeans would have liked that because it would have removed many of the problems&#151;some of which are justified and some of which are merely found by Conservative Members&#151;and undercut the argument against a written constitution.

In answering the point made by the hon.

 On the accounting procedures of the European Union, if the hon. Gentleman had been present on previous occasions, he would have heard me criticising the fact that the accounts were not signed off. However, a more effective system of auditing the EU&#039;s accounts would have some implications. The auditors do not, at the moment, have the right to go to individual countries, but a more effective system would mean extending the auditors&#039; powers to enable them to examine the books here in the United Kingdom. So far, there has been no particular enthusiasm for that. If the hon.

My starting point is the opinion poll published in <i>The Times</i> yesterday, which showed that Europe was well down the list of issues that people felt were important. Indeed, it was in ninth place, with apparently only 10&nbsp;per cent. of voters citing it as important. I was pleased that the Labour Government&#039;s approach was more popular with voters on this issue. None the less, despite the excitability of large sections of the press, the public do not seem to be very engaged with the issue, which should cause us concern given that those of us who are present for this debate are keen to give a wide public airing to issues on which the public will ultimately have the responsibility to judge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-20_para3">
I understand the public attitude as cited in the opinion poll, however, because despite all the alarmist comments, it seems that many of the issues that are uppermost in the public&#039;s mind at the moment&#151;health, education, crime and other matters&#151;are ones on which the European role is almost non-existent. In Prime Minister&#039;s Questions today, even though Members knew that the rest of today would be devoted to the European Union, Europe was hardly mentioned if at all, whereas identity cards, crime, the importance of British science and many other issues were much more prominent. We must recognise that, and realise that all of us, despite our own interest in this subject, will have to rise to a huge challenge to make it interesting to the public. Certainly, I hope that the constitution will be disseminated widely, although I sometimes worry that it might become a national cure for insomnia in the process.

Many comments have been made, especially in interventions, about the referendum question. I have not changed my attitude on that&#151;I feel that this particular constitutional treaty was not an appropriate subject for a referendum. It is no different from Maastricht, Nice and other treaties on which we have not held referendums. I sometimes worry, given the increasing number of referendums that we are holding in our country, whether we should at least have some ground rules about the principles according to which we proceed to holding a referendum. After all, we have welcome legislation on the conduct of referendums, but nothing on the statute book&#151;of course, we have no written constitution&#151;to say in what circumstances it is appropriate to hold national referendums. I feel somewhat uncomfortable about the way in which we are proceeding in that respect.

 On this issue, I generally support the provisions contained in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2004, which provide a fair framework. Having been on the wrong side of a referendum in the north-east of England recently, I am well aware that both sides in that referendum felt that they at least had equal access to the media and that they were able to raise funds on an equal basis. There were not many grumbles about the conduct of the referendum, even though, to my mind, the result was a great disappointment.

: Does the right hon.

 The hon. Lady should reflect that Government policies are continually tested in the House and in the media, and a wide public debate always occurs, as we found on the devolution question.

This is a difficult subject for a referendum, however. I strongly support the idea of a referendum on the single currency, but that is on a fairly straightforward principle, with a fairly straightforward choice to be made. This constitutional treaty, which includes so many different aspects and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston pointed out, is 80&nbsp;per cent. dominated by the existing treaties, is a particularly difficult issue on which to hold a referendum.

Ideas have already been put forward in the debate as to whether the referendum is about whether we should be in or out of the European Union or what issues will be involved.

Having accepted that we are having a referendum, however, and that there is little point in crying over spilt milk, those of us who support the constitutional treaty will have to consider ways of making the arguments to the public and of trying to give as realistic and accurate a picture about what the treaty involves as we can. In that respect, I follow the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and the Foreign Secretary. I believe that this treaty, in so far as it makes changes, makes sensible and welcome ones. It simplifies some of the existing text, delineates the areas where the European Union can and cannot act, provides for an increased role for national Parliaments and generally involves sensible institutional changes as a result of the welcome enlargement of the European Union.

It also gives us the opportunity to debunk the various myths about the Queen being replaced as our Head of State. In that respect, I was interested that <i>The Spectator</i> said way back in 1972&nbsp;that if the Queen signed the then European Communities Act, she would be signing away her birth rights. Thirty or more years later, there seems no danger of that happening or being likely to happen in any kind of foreseeable future.

Indeed, some of the scare stories about taxation need to be debunked. It was established in the treaty of Rome that the European Commission has the power to make taxation proposals, but in reality, such matters still require unanimity. Rather than steamrollering towards a common taxation system, progress down that route&#151;for those who want to make such progress&#151;has been incredibly slow.

I hope that we will discuss today the regional considerations relating to the EU and the constitutional treaty. In my own area, the debate on Europe is sometimes somewhat different in tone from that in certain other parts of the country, perhaps partly because one of the major employers in my constituency is the Nissan car plant, which does most of its export trade with Europe and thinks along very European lines. The attitude towards the EU of my constituents who work in that plant is often different from that of others. It is important that we discuss during the referendum campaign not just the importance of Europe to our economy in general, but the way in which such importance breaks down in different areas of the UK.

In reality, on most issues, most of the time, we have many allies.

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin), who has further illustrated that this issue always causes divisions within parties, as well as across them. There are Members who are in favour of the treaty but against a referendum, while others take the opposite view. Reference has already been made to many British traditions being under threat, but this debate shows that the splendid British tradition of being utterly inconsistent and unpredictable, as the right hon. Lady has pointed out, on the question of when to hold referendums is fully alive, as it will be at the conclusion of this debate and when the Bill completes its passage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para4">
That said, I welcome the fact that the Government have concluded that there should be a referendum. Like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), I believe that the matter should have been dealt with in a Bill separate from that implementing the treaty, but it is good that the Government have executed this handbrake-turn just before the European elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para5">
I want to draw our attention to people outside this House, who will be puzzled by the criteria that we apply to this issue, to the question of the constitutional treaty. It is common ground in this House that there is a great deal of public disaffection with the political process, and that disillusionment with politics has grown greatly in recent decades. To the shame of all of us who were candidates or leaders of our parties, the turnout at the last general election was 59&nbsp;per cent. Comparable figures in polls today show that the percentage of people who are certain to vote at the next election is perhaps in the lower 50s. Such great disaffection is partly the result of the increased gulf between the people of this country and the decisions that are made in their name.The increasing integration of political power in the EU, which is a key part of that process, is a fundamental part of my objection to this treaty and a fundamental test against which constitutional change should be judged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para6">
We must ask whether, at a time of disaffection, such change makes matters better or worse. This constitution will make matters worse. Those who have followed the

<br>&nbsp;<br>political debates of the past few weeks will have noticed that powers have been transferred to the EU in an alarming number of areas. When my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition proposed a limit on the number of immigrants to this country a couple of weeks ago&#151;there will be different opinions in the House about the merits of that proposal&#151;the European Commission made it clear that he would not have the power to implement such a limit. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister appears to be contradicting that interpretation, which would be important news.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 I think that the Commission simply pointed out that under the 1951&nbsp;convention, to which we are committed, Britain cannot limit the number of refugees. It was talking not about economic migrants but purely about the terms of the 1951&nbsp;convention, by which we are treaty-bound.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hague: </b> 
 There is clearly a difference of opinion between Government and Opposition Front Benchers on this issue, which it is important to clarify. As I understood it, despite all the assurances about opting out, because the Government had signed the qualifications directive, thereby opting into the latest EU arrangements, this country was now committed to the additional immigration policies adopted by the EU.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory </b> 
: What is beyond doubt is that the constitution would make it permanently impossible to leave the 1951&nbsp;convention; indeed, such a principle is entrenched not only in the constitution itself, but in the EU charter of fundamental rights. So from that point on it would be impossible for any incoming Government, after winning a general election, to do anything about that convention.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hague: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has immense knowledge of this subject, and that sounds like the correct interpretation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the Minister listened to it, although he is not showing much sign of having done so.

Let us consider other subjects, small and large. A couple of weeks ago, we debated in this House the European food supplements directive, of all things.

Now, if people ask their Member of Parliament to do something about that issue, the answer is, &quot;We cannot do anything about it.&quot; Even if we vote against the measure, it will still take legal effect.

This country did not agree to the working time directive. This country would never have initiated the directive, which was dreamed up by officials who do not live in this country and who know nothing of the circumstances in our health service. Although the Foreign Secretary can give assurances on occasions such as this, more and more power has been given away across a wide range of policies. The situation is dangerous, and the constitution will give away more power&#151;the President of the European Court has said that the charter of fundamental rights will open new areas and subjects to the Court. The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) knows the charter very well because we often tease him about it. A few years ago, he said that it would have the legal force of the <i>Beano</i>.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para13">
Large parts of the constitution are, of course, incomprehensible, and one cannot know what it will mean in the future. However, we know from our experience of the working time directive what such legislation can come to mean over time. The separation between the people, who are meant to exercise their democratic rights, and the institutions working in their name continues. In the United States&#039; constitution, the separation of powers means the separation of the Executive, the judiciary and the legislature. In the European constitution, the separation of powers means the separation of the right to make laws from the people, who should decide democratically the laws that are made in their name. That separation will result in catastrophe in due course.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para15">
Subsidiarity has been described as a &quot;yellow card&quot;, which sounds like a forceful sanction, but there is no referee to exercise it. Instead, one must get members of the crowd to agree to show the yellow card and to get other members of the crowd from other countries to show the same yellow card at the same time, as a result of which nothing can happen. A blocking provision&#151;a red card&#151;would have been better, but that would conflict with the destruction of the veto across a wide range of policies, so it is clearly impossible to introduce a blocking provision within the framework of the constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para16">
We have been told that a new safeguard will be introduced against the abuse of European Union power, but it is unlikely to be used in practice in this House. It is highly unlikely that a majority in this House, which would normally mean a majority over the Government of the day, would object to an EU directive at the same time as the same thing is done in the Bundestag or the French National Assembly. Even if it were to happen, under the constitution the European Commission could turn round and say, &quot;No; we maintain our previous opinion. You can all go away.&quot; Where will our country&#039;s democracy stand when we arrive in that situation?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para17">
Those are fundamental objections to the ever-growing power of European institutions, but there are many other objections. For example, those European institutions have a scandalous inability to control expenditure. That point has already been referred to, and when I raised it in this House a couple of months ago, the Minister for Europe shrugged his shoulders and said that a lot of the fraud occurs in the national Governments of the European Union. However, some of the worst fraud occurred in EUROSTAT, which is under the direct control of the European Commission. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife compared the European Commission to Birmingham council in its time, but if the district auditor had come back here and told us that for 10&nbsp;years running, 95&nbsp;per cent. of the expenditure of Birmingham city council had been open to fraud, corruption and abuse, we would have shut down Birmingham city council by now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para18">
It is absolutely intolerable that this situation exists and I want to know from the Minister&#151;as I asked him two months ago&#151;when he winds up the debate, what he has been doing about it in the meantime, and when a British Minister will go to the Council of Ministers, bang the table and say, &quot;If you want money from the hard-working British taxpayer, you have to show how it is being spent.&quot; It cannot be right to give more power to European institutions; this is the latest example of a string of treaties that do so, and they are not even fit to exercise the power and the money already placed in their hands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-21_para19">
There is a long list of other important objections, but I shall rest on that one and the more fundamental one that I have put forward&#151;that a separation between the people who live in a democracy and the way that they are governed and the laws made in their name will be deeply damaging in the long run, and we will regret it.

<p><a name="50209-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bill Tynan  (Hamilton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I am delighted to follow the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). I have listened to the speakers from both sides of the House; I am in exalted company today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para0">
I believe that the constitutional treaty was a success for the Government, and I think that we were successful because we led from a strong position, because we are integrated with Europe. A treaty is necessary simply because when there are 25&nbsp;states&#151;when there is an enlargement of that degree&#151;there is no choice but to look at the constitution and the existing treaties. The intention was that the treaties would be used to bring government closer to the people and bring Europe closer to the people. If we can effectively implement the treaty as has been suggested, I think we will give clarity to the European Union and could help to reduce people&#039;s disenchantment with Europe. Taxation, foreign policy, public services, the economy and defence were separated out, and in each case that separation was maintained by the Government. There were red lines that we decided we would not cross, and they have been secured; that was of the utmost importance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para1">
The new treaty is important in itself. I accept that it establishes a constitution for Europe. I had some doubt about whether we should hold a referendum; I did not think that we needed to, because I did not believe that the changes were significant within the treaty itself. But we have taken a decision. We will have a referendum and we should move in that direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para2">
Much of the content of the new treaty is already set out in the existing treaties, and basic principles, such as the primacy of the treaty and the law made under it, remain the same. The primacy of Community law has been with us since 1964, and it is not a novel doctrine, as far as I am concerned, since a state has never been able to plead a provision of its own law as a reason for not complying with a treaty obligation. The 1964&nbsp;provision existed, but we are not changing it in any significant way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para3">
I believe that the new treaty is less integrationist than the existing treaties. For example, the new treaty confirms unambiguously that the Union has only the competences conferred by the member states. That point has been made by a number of speakers. The European Court, it is generally accepted, has been reluctant to develop any concept of &quot;implied powers&quot;, and I believe that the new treaty may well discourage that further. Secondly, the new treaty makes express provision for a state to leave the Union, and the point is made that if we are so concerned about the powers of the European Union, the opportunity is still there for us to withdraw if necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para4">
It may have been implicit in existing treaties that states had a right to withdraw, and I think that that will be confirmed. The new provisions confirm that member states are principal actors. The case of Costa <i>v.</i> ENEL in 1964&nbsp;spoke of the permanent sharing of sovereignty. That would no longer be the case with the new treaty. It is also clear that no state could be forced to accept it against its wishes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para5">
Much has been said about how bad the treaty will be for Britain and how we should be greatly concerned about it. We have to deal with the myths that have been

They are: the EU should be named the united states of Europe; the EU should have certain competences organised on a federal basis; there should be EU-wide taxation; the Commission President should be elected by EU citizens; there should be majority voting for deciding EU foreign policy; there should be majority voting for treaty amendments and an end to ratification of treaties by national Parliaments; the Commission President should chair the European Council, with his presidency and the European Council presidency merged into one; there should be a European mutual defence guarantee, separate from NATO; unanimous voting should be abolished and replaced with qualified majority voting; and the EU Foreign Minister should be accountable to the Commission, not national Governments.
</p>

We have to deal with the issues before us today and those that are important to the people of this country. We talk about human rights.

In response to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, we should be deciding whether the constitution makes things better or worse. I think that it will improve matters for this country.

Going back to my point about the referendum, I support the treaty and I believe it is an important document, but I do not believe it makes such important differences to our relationships with Europe as did the European Communities Act in 1972, the Single European Act in the late 1980s or the Maastricht treaty in the early 1990s. They were all far more significant pieces of legislation determining our constitutional arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-22_para11">
Parliament had more than one day for Second Reading on most of those. There was huge resistance to the idea of guillotining even a day&#039;s debate, let alone timetabling the whole thing, which was all taken on the Floor of the House of Commons. I took an active part in all that. I was one of the two Whips designated to be in charge of the original 1972&nbsp;Bill, so I listened to hours of debate, even if I was silent during it. A huge, protracted, important, high-quality debate took place about the principle of the primacy of European legislation over British legislation in areas of European competence. That is what it was all about, and similar debates took place thereafter.

<a name="50209-22_para12">
There was a free vote in 1972. Here we all are, proud parliamentarians, and what are we saying? The vote in the House is not going to decide the issue at all. At the general election, people can freely vote for their party, regardless of their views on Europe, because the general election vote will not determine a damn thing. We can have, if we wish, a treaty negotiated by the British Government, and we can have it ratified by the British Parliament, but the decisions on this treaty will be determined by a popular plebiscite in which the national media will endeavour to play as large and as influential a role as possible. I cannot allow that to pass without comment, even though it takes part of the 10&nbsp;minutes which, under our present arrangements, we are allowed to express our views on the future of our relationships with the European Union.

Far from strengthening the hand of a Minister, it is my judgment, and the former Foreign Secretary, the right hon.

 In my experience, referendums did not strengthen the position of Irish or Danish Ministers. Whatever they were arguing for, we knew they would have considerable difficulty in getting anything past their public when they got home. They were asked to go back and persuade the public to change their mind. It is a pity that the British, who have one of the strongest traditions of parliamentary democracy in the western world, are moving towards that position. I am resigned to fate. Such is the power of the media that all three major political parties have endorsed enthusiastically the idea of a referendum. The last to agree was the Prime Minister, and his was the weakest gesture, because he

The importance of the treaty has been hopelessly exaggerated. I am genuinely surprised that it has become the centre of controversy, but the referendum is likely to prove a cathartic moment in this country&#039;s relationship with the European Union. I did not see it coming, because every supporter of the enlargement of the EU always assumed that there would have to be a revision of the treaties. There was an unsurprising declaration in Nice that we would have to readdress fundamental aspects of the consolidated treaties once enlargement had taken place. We all supported enlargement and noted the need for subsequent constitutional change to improve the efficiency of the union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-23_para1">
Enlargement is, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the most dramatic political events of my lifetime. One of the objectives of the EU, which no longer needs to stop wars breaking out between us, is to consolidate parliamentary democracy, liberal values and market economics across the continent. Just as the three former fascist states of Spain, Portugal and Greece were admitted to entrench those values among their populations so, most importantly, eight former members of the Soviet empire have joined for the same purpose. That is the great political objective of most of the other 24&nbsp;member states and, I hope, ourselves. The orange faction in Ukraine and the popular Government in Turkey aspire to join the EU while we debate the constitutional changes made to facilitate its enlargement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-23_para2">
I shall not go back over the efficiency gains that are the obvious and desirable consequence of enlargement. The end of the rotating presidency, for example, is an advantage. We could not have 25&nbsp;six-monthly presidencies changing the agenda all the time, although that would be the result if we rejected the treaty. There will be one foreign affairs spokesman rather than two, and foreign policy, according to the treaty, will be determined by the Governments of member states and their Foreign Secretaries in council. I faithfully supported the extension of majority voting when it was proposed by Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister, and I advocated it when the Single European Act was passed in the late 1980s. The extension of majority voting to all the new areas is essential, otherwise there could be a Maltese or Latvian veto on details of business that we are trying to administer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-23_para3">
Most of the treaty restates the consolidated treaties. As the right hon. Member for Livingston said, 80&nbsp;per cent. of it is simply a restatement of the great previous treaties, each and every one of which I supported. Most of them were supported by the Conservative party and negotiated by Conservative Governments. The treaty also makes it clearer than ever before that this is a union of nation states, not a superstate, that power is devolved to the union by the member states, and that there is an enhanced and clearer role for national Parliaments on subsidiarity.

I want finally to comment on the merits of the treaty in response to all the extraordinary negative claims, most of which I have heard voiced before, every time we have had a European treaty over the years. It has always apparently meant the end of our monarchy, the beginning of higher taxation, the end of our control over our criminal justice system and all that other stuff. The reinforcement of the Union of member states and of the market economy is the concept that has caused the biggest reservations elsewhere. Recently, I met Laurent Fabius, the former socialist Prime Minister, who makes me look like a Eurosceptic, and I expressed my astonishment about his proposal to vote against the treaty.

It was because of the frustrations that I and other former Ministers for Europe witnessed that I welcome the European constitutional treaty.

The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe mentioned Romania and Bulgaria, which will join in 2007. Croatia is set to begin negotiations on 17&nbsp;March, subject to the conditions laid down, and there is a possibility that Turkey will begin negotiations later this year. The right hon. and learned Gentleman also mentioned Ukraine. All those countries are desperately trying to join the European Union, but there are still those in the House and the country who want to take us out of it. It is therefore vital that we have this referendum and that we have a discussion about the way in which the EU can perform better. By reforming the way in which it operates, we will get better results for the British people.

One thing that we foresaw was possible tension between Javier Solana and Chris Patten, but the fact is that that never happened, because both gentlemen carried out their jobs with great distinction. It is absurd, none the less, to have two people speaking on foreign policy on behalf of the EU. The then American Secretary of State said that if he wanted to find out Europe&#039;s view on foreign policy he had to ring 15&nbsp;Foreign Ministers. Now, an American Secretary of State will be able to talk to one person. It will, of course, be up to the member states to decide what that foreign policy will be, but it is essential that we have some kind of strategic approach to the way in which foreign policy is worked out. That began, not at St. Malo, but with Maastricht, the treaty signed by Opposition Members. They signed up to the start of the common foreign and security policy, which is now represented in this constitutional treaty.

That was not because of a personal interest in leather and footwear industries; it was a constituency interest that he shares with me, and look how well he has done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-24_para4">
The point about the charter is that it was negotiated by our present Attorney-General. He had conduct of that policy. When he went into those negotiations, he was on his own, and he managed to convince all the other people and countries represented to turn towards this country&#039;s point of view. The point that I made at that time, many years ago&#151;I remember where I was when I made it&#151;was that the charter, like any other legal document or any other publication, can be produced before any court in the land.

Europe does not have an indelible character, and it does not have a predetermined route. It is a product of member states that have joined at different times with different cultures, political traditions and priorities. So those who say that they want to know where the train is going before they are accused of missing it will never have a permanent destination on the engine, because it goes to different places simultaneously. That is the nature of the beast. People who are looking for the sort of coherence that we hope for in national politics will never find it in the European Union. It is an absolutely unique organisation with its own chemistry, and we have to apply different rules to it. Of course, some rules must be the same, such as the rules of sound accountancy, but it is very many years since the Department for Work and Pensions was acquitted by its auditors, so we might look at the motes in our own eye as regards finance.

I understand the criticisms that the constitution reflects what people believe to be too inward-looking an institutional regulatory attitude on the part of the European Union, and that it fails to establish clear enough frameworks to compete in a global world. However, by and large those are much more failures of the member states than of institutional arrangements in Europe. They call for political will. The painful steps that the French Government are taking to liberalise the 35-hour week and the flak that Chancellor Schr&#246;der has taken in Germany for what we regard as relatively modest steps to free up the pension system show how difficult that is.

Those who advocate voting no have not demonstrated to me that any of those problems will be solved by doing so. My own Front-Bench spokesman talked of going back to the drawing board. It is fantasy to think that the European Union will go back to the drawing board in response to a British no in order to fashion a treaty that many of them think reflects British priorities even more than we do.

Voting no would risk the Franco-German creation of an inner core and I do not subscribe to the view that it is in Britain&#039;s interests to encourage a sort of implicit disintegration or fragmentation of the European Union through everybody doing the bits that they like at their own pace, and ad hoc movement. That would lead progressively and incrementally to the United Kingdom&#039;s being on the margin of more and more activities until we were on the margin of the entire institution. Such fragmentation would also lead to the absorption of the EU in internal repair and maintenance at the expense of promoting the very policies&#151;the economic liberalism&#151;that we want, which at last are beginning to come from the Commission.

The second reason to vote yes is to enable the United Kingdom to seize the historical opportunity to change the terms of trade in an EU of 25. Enlargement has tipped the scale against French hegemony. It is no use our trading individual quotes from French politicians. What do people expect President Chirac to say about the treaty? If we examine the continuing dialogue and commentary in the French press, it is clear that France is preoccupied with its decline. That is the current debate in the political class and it dates from the treaty of Nice, when the French used the expression &quot;the end of the French hegemony.&quot; A no vote would therefore betray the new member states, many of which look to Britain for their ideas. They bring a liberal economic model and an Atlanticist attitude to the EU, which we welcome.

I do not believe that a no vote would somehow liberate the United Kingdom from what some perceive as the chains that are forged in Brussels.

I see no shadow of a superstate. Too often, the EU is incoherent and disunited. Frankly, a few more of the attributes of coherence would have been welcome in past years. The primacy of Governments and the increasing favour of intergovernmental models of co-operation are reinforced, not challenged in the treaty. Of course, I would prefer a treaty that did not contain the charter of fundamental human rights, but the charge that that will enable Luxembourg judges to rewrite the entire body of national labour laws represents an unjustified elevation of current fears into what Milton called &quot;horrible imaginings.&quot;

An awful lot of idiotic claims are made about Europe, both for and against.

The rooting of democracy in Europe and the establishment of civil society in previously dictatorial and communist regimes represent a colossal achievement for Europe.

Such countries increasingly see the European Union as the anvil of their modernisation. In Britain, however, we are still impaled on the ambivalence resulting from a resentment at what Brussels does to us and a fear of exclusion.

If we are in favour of that&#151;as I said, we should be by definition, as agreement has to be unanimous&#151;surely we want that foreign policy to be expressed with the greatest possible force, so it makes sense to deliver it in that way on behalf of the European Union as a whole. That is what the treaty says and any claims that it goes beyond that are simply myths generated by the tabloids.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-25_spnew6"><b> Mr. Davidson: </b> 
 It is very helpful to hear the yes side clearly support the idea that the EU should be able to borrow, when it so desires, Britain&#039;s UN seat. We would never be quite sure when we could get it back again, but giving it on a temporary basis is the thin end of the wedge and will end with us giving it up altogether. It is very helpful to have that view put on the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-25_para6">
I return to the issue of the myths peddled by the yes side. Those who are against the constitution&#151;on the Labour party side, at least&#151;are not in favour of withdrawal. If we were in favour of withdrawal, we would say so. We are not in favour of it, so those on the yes side should stop peddling that suggestion. They should also stop peddling the suggestion&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) raised it&#151;that there are 3&nbsp;million jobs at risk. More jobs in the EU are dependent on trade with Britain than British jobs are dependent on trade with the EU. Under World Trade Organisation or other world trading rules, there is no suggestion that we could be cut off from access to those markets, so let us not have that myth peddled either.

<a name="50209-25_para7">
I believe that the constitution is about the creation of a European superstate. It is not an isolated event, but part of a wider process, as those who drew up the constitution have made clear. Another constitution or a revised version of this constitution will be along in a while. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania lies ahead: a degree of renegotiation will be necessary, and then another constitution.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Minister for Europe whether he proposes amending the constitution or producing a wholly new constitution, going through the same sort of process as this one. There are important implications and people need to know what they are letting themselves in for. Is a vote on Turkish accession included or will it be the subject of a separate parliamentary vote later?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-25_para9">
We have to be very careful about how the Government run the referendum. Every opportunity will be taken to influence and manipulate it. Mention has been made already about how the question is to be worded. It will be interesting to hear from the Minister for Europe whether the wording resulted from focus group research or opinion polling, or whether it was merely plucked out of the air at random. It is clear that it has been chosen to try to manipulate the outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-25_para10">
It is interesting too that the Bill allows the referendum to be held as a joint vote, perhaps on the same day as local elections. That is a deliberate attempt to blur the division between the yes and no camps in the constitution argument by means of the partisan battle that will take place during the local elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-25_para11">
My final point in respect of the referendum has to do with propaganda. Recently, the Minister for Europe gave me a wonderful answer to a question about Government propaganda. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office works to ensure that all information it issues on the subject of the EU and the EU Constitutional Treaty is objective, explanatory and is in line with and supports Government policy.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 19&nbsp;January 2005; Vol. 429, c.&nbsp;1020W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-25_para12">
That Government propaganda can be objective and at the same time support Government policy is a claim that belongs in some sort of Orwellian world, where it is assumed that anything said by the Government is objective and that politics applies only to what other people say. We must be careful about that, just as we must be careful about the extent to which the EU is free to spend enormous amounts of money, either directly or through the various front organisations that it funds.

 I am listening intently to my hon. Friend. He has made it clear that he is robustly against the European constitution, but I am having difficulty in understanding exactly why. The only reason that he has adduced so far is that it might put our seat on the UN Security Council at risk, and I believe that he is mistaken about that. He has produced no other argument to explain what is wrong with the treaty. What is it he objects to? Is it the charter of fundamental rights, or something else?

I and others have three main reservations about the constitution, and they can be headed Thatcherism, militarism and centralisation. The constitution is Thatcherite in that it is formulated in such a way as to open up free markets and drive down the social wage,

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1576</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and it does not give trade unions and other organisations extended powers. It is militaristic in that it clearly favours the establishment and use of a European armed force, and it is centralising in its approach to taxation and immigration, as we have heard already.

 The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) and I do not agree on many issues.

It follows from what he said&#151;I agree with him here&#151;that all that will be at risk if those decisions are transferred to another jurisdiction so that the link between choices and outcomes is fractured for ever.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para3">
Constitutions have gone in and out of fashion over the centuries. Napoleon said that a constitution should be short and obscure, so the European constitution is only half right: it is certainly obscure, but at more than 500&nbsp;pages long, it breaks the first rule of a constitution&#151;that it should be comprehensible to the public. The European constitution is not; it is a document written for politicians by politicians, and there is no chance of our electors reading or understanding it, let alone giving it their allegiance. The instruction given to the Convention, which drew up the constitution, to close the gap between the rulers of Europe and the people of Europe has been ignored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para4">
The constitution should never have been. The Government did not want it and said so, but when the Convention started to it draw up, the Government said that they wanted one after all, provided that it was short. When it became a long one, the Government tabled more than 200&nbsp;amendments, only a fraction of which were adopted. It is odd that we are getting a written constitution in this country for the first time since the 17th century, and we have not even written it ourselves. It was written for us by others.

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1577</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para5">
Surely, the first job of any constitution is to solve the problem of who does what and to draw a distinction between what Europe does and what member states do. It should also overcome the wide perception, which happens to be true, that the European Union obtains more powers with each treaty, and that we have an activist Court in Luxembourg, which always interprets documents in a way that is in favour of more centralisation. The first job of a self-respecting constitution is to solve that problem, but this one does not. I shall give just one example. Most of the familiar policies that make up the daily work of this House are listed in article XIV of the constitution, but they will be so-called shared competences, which is Eurospeak for shared powers. The definition of &quot;shared&quot; is that when the European Union legislates in those areas in future, we will lose the right to legislate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para6">
What is more, only the principal areas have been listed. Anyone reading the constitution will not have the slightest idea of who does what in five years or so, particularly when almost all those policies will be decided by qualified majority voting. It may be news to the Liberal Democrats that 63&nbsp;new areas will be subject to majority voting, but it is a fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para7">
Another point that the Government have ignored is that the definition of majority voting has been changed in the constitution, which makes it much easier for a majority vote to be obtained. That means more legislation, more regulations and more interference. The European Scrutiny Committee, on which I serve, examined more than 1,000&nbsp;new measures last year. That will accelerate and we will have more legislation, but less chance of stopping anything.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para8">
We heard again the tired argument about this new power for national Parliaments over subsidiarity. That is not new; we can object already. It is certainly not a power, as we can object all we like, and the Commission can go on ignoring us. All that we get in this constitution is a new right to be ignored. The Government know that, as they tabled an amendment to try to upgrade the power for national Parliaments to a so-called red light, and were overruled and ignored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para9">
We have heard about the EU charter of fundamental rights, and I will not have more fun at the expense of the Government about how they promised that it was only of declaratory value and no more important than the<i> Beano</i>, whereas they must now make the best of it, as it will not only be legally binding but form the whole of part II of the European constitution. Another point about the charter is the uncertainty. The European Scrutiny Committee has received witness statements and taken evidence from constitutional lawyers about the charter. They agree that the ambiguities in the charter make it quite impossible to know what the future European Court will make of it. What they say is that the so-called safeguards trumpeted from the Treasury Bench, in order to prevent the charter seeping into national laws, will be inoperative and no safeguard whatever.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-26_spnew5"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Does not my right hon. Friend also agree that those same witnesses were extremely concerned that our judges, when faced with competing jurisdictions 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>





<p><a name="50209-26_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 Yes, that is the so-called primacy point, which asserts unconditionally that everything in the constitution, all the laws flowing from it, and the charter, have primacy over the laws of this country. There has been a stand-off, which nobody has resolved&#151;but if a Parliament and a people sign up voluntarily to that assertion, it is certain that national courts will start to interpret national laws as inferior to everything that comes out of the constitution. What this charter does, at the very least, instead of ending an uncertainty, is to extend and create one.

We have heard today about the need for reform in Europe. Some criticism has been expressed of my party&#039;s position that we will seek a renegotiation of the treaty. Why should that be such a shock? We are engaged in a colossal renegotiation. The Convention on which I served was undertaking the most fundamental reform of the European institutions ever attempted. All the existing treaties are repealed by this constitution. We are therefore engaged in an enormous renegotiation. The point, however, is that that reform and renegotiation failed. Instead of creating that democratic simple Europe which was to be closer to its citizens, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created a centralised, technocratic, legalistic, undemocratic Europe. If we say no to this constitution, the brief will return to the drafters of the constitution&#151;but next time they will have to listen to the instructions given to them, instead of creating a Europe in their own image. Today, however, this House will have to decide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-26_para11">
Of course we will have a referendum. I notice that the Government have already rewritten the rules on funding to ensure that they can go on spending taxpayers&#039; money up to a month before the referendum, whereas the rest of us will be limited. The wording on the ballot paper refers to the constitution for the European Union, which implies that it is simply a rule for the existing Union&#151;which, incidentally, simply gets abolished if the constitution comes into effect. They do not like the idea of the true wording, which is &quot;a constitution for Europe&quot;, which perhaps sounds more ambitious and threatening. They cannot even get the wording right on the ballot paper.
</p>

<a name="50209-26_para12">
Our task today is to decide what this House does. It is not our power that we are giving away, but that of the people whom we represent. What is British history if not a long struggle to get power under the control of people who are accountable to the electors, and who can be removed by those electors? What is British history but a long struggle to secure a parliamentary democracy, so that policies can be changed after elections and people can give effect to their democratic choices through a political system?

Indeed, we heard a very good example concerning asylum and immigration. It really is outrageous, but when my party win the next election on a clear pledge to do something different about asylum and immigration, we will be told that doing so is illegal even under the existing treaties, because of everything that the Government have signed up to. Such action will be constitutionally illegal once we have adopted and ratified a constitution, because the UN charter on refugees is embedded in that constitution, and withdrawal will not be possible. So people will not vote at all. Why vote&#151;why express choice?&#151;if such choice cannot, by constitutional law, lead to different outcomes? That is the democratic reality that we must face up to today.

<p><a name="50209-27_spnew0"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell  (Great Grimsby) (Lab):</b> 
 This is a very curious Bill; in fact, it is a Bill of two halves. Five clauses deal with the referendum and just five with the treaty&#151;the constitution is actually a constitution masquerading as a treaty&#151;thereby establishing the treaty in British law. Today is the only opportunity that we will get to discuss this issue, because today is the only opportunity to pass legislation on the new European treaty before the referendum. In effect, if we pass the Bill, we pass the treaty. We have prepared the way for implementing it in British law, if the people give their consent in a referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-27_para0">
That is a very curious way to proceed, because as a result the House is not contributing its skill and knowledge, testing the argument or debating the issues. Nor is it examining the treaty at the same length or in the same detail that we examined the far less important and less substantial Maastricht treaty, which had far weaker effects on British polity and did not pose as a constitution. We are being asked to accept something that will change this country&#039;s constitution, and which establishes a European constitution affecting this country, on the basis of this Bill and three days&#039; discussion on the Floor of the House. Frankly, that is not good enough for a major change such as this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-27_para1">
Those of us who do not like the constitution and who will oppose it are being asked to vote for it because we will then get a referendum&#151;which we should have been given anyway from the start. The powers that are being handed over and the roles that are being imposed on us are matters for the people to decide on. They should be able to decide whether to give their consent in any case, so the blandishment that we will get a referendum&#151;if we vote for the treaty&#151;means nothing. A referendum on an issue as big as this is essential. We are talking about the people&#039;s power, and they have to give their consent before any of it is handed to Europe, or any other changes are made.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-27_para3">
I support the provision to hold a referendum, but I have some doubts about the wording. A referendum is a conservative device that supports the status quo, and the Bill presents the constitution as the status quo:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-27_para4">
That suggests that the constitution is a fait accompli, that it is pristine, new and gleaming in the distance, that everybody else is accepting it, so it would be churlish to turn it down. It would be better to ask the people whether they want Britain to accept the &quot;proposed&quot; European constitution&#151;a more honest wording, which would favour my side of the argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-27_para5">
It is crucial that the referendum include equal funding and equal time for both sides of the argument. That period of equal funding and equal time should be extended, because I do not want the Government telling a series of half truths and distorting the argument in the long period before the referendum. A balance must be maintained for a longer time than just the simple campaign. We do not want my hon. Friend the Minister for Europe rampaging around the country in his red socks putting across an incorrect view of the constitution. I do not want to see a massive outpouring of Government propaganda, and the votes should be published by constituency at the end of the referendum.
</p>

<a name="50209-27_para6">
The constitution is an unnecessary, unwanted, unloved product of the European elite that has been foisted on the electorates of Europe, who are being conned into accepting it. The Convention on the Future of Europe started out loaded with Euro-enthusiasts, which was a condition for membership. The American constitution proudly states &quot;We, the people&quot;, but all the European constitution can say is, &quot;We, the Euro-enthusiast Euro-elite&quot; think that this or that is self-evident.

I cannot accept the constitution, which is strengthens the centre and is another step towards ever closer union.

Many new clauses have been added to the constitution. One trivial example concerns the common fisheries policy, which originally concerned the marketing of fish. The policy then became a matter of equal access to a common resource, and under the constitution it would become an exclusive competence over the marine biological resources of the sea. The Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament rejected that as unnecessary, but the provision remains. Why? Why should seals or jellyfish, vertebrates or invertebrates, be part of a constitution? Why do they have to be there? Is it some extension of power? What is it all about? It is simply madness on the part of those drafting the constitution.

Fortunately, he did not come back saying &quot;Game, set and match&quot;, as people have said before him.

It also puts in place the apparatus and trappings of statehood.

People ask me why Europe has not cleaned up its act with regard to fraud. I was in the European Parliament when we decided to put the former leader of the then Labour Opposition in charge of that. I had every confidence that he was a man of integrity and strength who would certainly do a good job, but he had to return and tell the European Parliament that he had come to an impossible impasse because the Governments of Europe were not prepared to face up to their own folly. So if the Governments are not prepared to face up to fraud, who will face up to it? That was not because of any non-diligence on his part and those associated with him, but because a blockage was put in the way, yet that is where we are asked to put our faith.

We know that, as we look upon the present situation, the devolution of powers to Europe reduces the powers of national Parliaments. More and more, we have creeping out of the national Parliaments those items and business that should be strictly under the sole authority of the nation, but outside interests from Europe seem to be able to exercise a strange, mystic power over those who attend to represent the various nations, and Brussels becomes stronger and stronger each day. We need to face up to that.

On the powers that we had, I remember that when we heard about going into Europe, everyone said that all was well because we had the veto, and if Britain did not like what was going to be done, just one vote and Europe could not do it&#151;it would be stopped. Now, we have the wonderful words, &quot;qualified majority voting&quot;. One has only to look at the list of matters where the previous rule of unanimity does not apply: the election of the President; the election of the Foreign Minister; setting conditions for control by member states of the Commission&#039;s exercise of implementing powers; approximating national laws to achieve an area of freedom, security and justice, which is vital to asylum control&#151;that is an interesting one; authorising annual expenditure; and proposals to promote social and economic cohesion. There is a whole list more: freedom of movement for migrant workers; measures necessary for the use of the euro; matters of particular interest for economic and monetary union; the prioritising of structural funds; measures on border controls, and so on. Those matters will all be covered by the new rule of voting, but qualified majority voting makes it impossible for one Government with strong views to stop such measures.

 After a European debate a few months ago, the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)&#151;I still think of him as an hon. Friend&#151;remarked to me that it was interesting that the supporters of the measure that we are considering always refer to the &quot;European constitutional treaty&quot;, while its opponents refer to the &quot;European constitution&quot;. That theme has emerged extensively during the debate, not least in the speech 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>made by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). For myself, I say that it is just another European treaty, and I am glad that the question to be put in the referendum brings that out clearly. We have had the treaty of Rome, the Merger treaty, the Single European Act and the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. We now have the latest treaty in the series. In typical European language, it will probably end up being called the treaty of Rome bis, and I can well understand that the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) would oppose it for that reason, if no other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para0">
Each of those treaties moved the European furniture around in different ways, and as it has been pointed out, some did so more drastically than the one now before us will. For example, the Single European Act, which was passed under Margaret Thatcher, extended qualified majority voting more widely than this treaty will.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 There were extensions into 12&nbsp;areas under the Single European Act, but the constitution goes into 63&nbsp;new areas.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jackson: </b> 
 I shall be happy to discuss that point with the right hon. Gentleman. Of course we must consider not only the number of areas, but their weight and significance. He must accept that qualified majority voting on nominations to the European Court of Auditors is not quite as serious as other matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para1">
The Maastricht treaty gave a treaty base to various forms of interstate co-operation among member states, and thus did more than this treaty will to extend the sphere of European responsibilities. But the basic reason why I regard this as just another treaty, rather than a constitution, is that it leaves many constitutional questions unresolved, which is why I think that the language of the Opposition, particularly in their amendment, is unwarrantedly exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para2">
The fundamental constitutional question must be whether the European Union is to remain as it is&#151;an association of sovereign states, pooling their sovereignty in certain limited areas&#151;or whether it will become a new political entity, somehow transcending the member states and reflecting a new European citizenship. On this fundamental question, this treaty maintains the radical ambiguity of the earlier treaties, going back to the treaty of Rome. To put the point more positively, this treaty preserves intact the unique hybrid nature of the European Union: not a federal state, but using shared supranational institutions for certain limited purposes. As long as this radical ambiguity&#151;this unique hybridity&#151;persists, none of the arrangements for shared decision making upon which the member states may from time to time agree by treaties between them can accurately, in my opinion, be described as a &quot;constitution&quot;. Nor, therefore, can they be rejected in the fundamentalist terms that have been adduced by, for example, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who seemed in his remarks to discard the possibility even of common rules to apply to a common market. I thought that that at least was part of the acquis communautaire accepted by the Conservative party, but the right hon. Gentleman now seems to reject it.

Indeed, those provisions are embodied in the treaty that is now before the House. It is notorious, however, that they are not being observed by France and Germany, for the simple reason that it does not suit them to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para4">
In 1992, the Maastricht treaty introduced legally binding requirements for mutual consultation and common action in the field of foreign policy. Those are retained in the current treaty, and its opponents make much of the constraints that that will supposedly impose on foreign policy. For example, we have had a discussion about Britain&#039;s Security Council seat.

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para5">
Two years ago, we saw no evidence of such constraints having any effect at all when the chips were down over Iraq. There were no such constraints either on the foreign policy of the majority in the enlarged Union led by Britain, which supported the war, or on the foreign policy of the minority, led by France, which opposed it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para6">
Europe will have a &quot;constitution&quot; only when it has acquired a real-world identity of its own&#151;an identity that is more than the limited fiction of &quot;legal personality&quot; contained in this latest treaty. It will have a &quot;constitution&quot; only when there are genuine European citizens, as opposed to citizens of member states carrying a common-format passport. Neither of those things is actually happening, and with each successive enlargement of the European Union the prospect becomes more and more remote. The Opposition&#039;s fantasies about &quot;a country called Europe&quot; are simply that&#151;fantasies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para7">
In conclusion, let me sum up the question that the country will have to decide in the referendum, as I see it. The Leader of the Opposition has told us that Britain has no interest in the political development of continental Europe. He says, &quot;If they want to federate, let them get on with it&#151;so long as Britain is not involved.&quot; What an abdication! What ignorance of the lessons of history! Will the country heed that siren voice luring us on to the rocks, or do we want Britain to go on as it is now, exerting a growing influence from within a European Union in which the balance of real-world forces is steadily moving in the direction that suits Britain and Britain&#039;s historic national interests? That is the choice that the British people will have to make in the referendum on the treaty, and I am confident, in the words of what used to be a Conservative slogan, that they will once again vote for &quot;a strong Britain in a strong Europe&quot;.

<p><a name="50209-28_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex) (Con):</b> 
 I would love to debate this subject at length with the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson), and I am grateful to him for mentioning me. The fact that I am not able to do so underlines the extremely unsatisfactory way in which his new party is handling the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para8">
I believe in the basic principle of democracy: that a people have the right to govern themselves. Article I of the UN charter sets out the principle of &quot;self-determination of peoples&quot;. It is not envisaged as something that requires the permission of a higher authority; it is an absolute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para9">
Only three fundamental questions are raised in the context of a constitution for the EU. First, what constitutes &quot;self-determination&quot;? Secondly, what constitutes &quot;a people&quot;? Finally, does the constitution respect the self-determination of peoples? The Opposition&#039;s reasoned amendment is absolutely right to lay emphasis on the question of primacy. Ultimately, government is not about identity or particular issues, events or interests, but about the framing and implementation of laws. Therefore, to have self-determination, the people must have the means to frame and implement their own laws and system of government. In turn, that system of government must have the means to sustain and protect itself. That means it must be sovereign&#151;it cannot be subject to a higher authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para10">
I note that my hon. Friends&#039; reasoned amendment uses the term &quot;sovereignty&quot;. This is very basic stuff, but let us define our terms because the word has been misused. Sovereignty is not power, as the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) suggested. It is a different quality from power. It is not authority. Power is the ability to produce intended effects. It need not be legal power&#151;to exercise power legally, one requires authority. The various written and unwritten laws of this country grant authority to our Ministers to exercise power legally. Where does that authority come from? The sovereign authority is the ultimate source of our law. Sovereignty is, therefore, a narrow legal concept. It is another absolute&#151;it cannot be shared or limited. We either have it or we do not. Legal self-determination rests on the ability of a people&#039;s absolute authority to frame their own laws and to have the final say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para11">
The second question is: what constitutes &quot;a people&quot;? Clearly, the EU is made up of many peoples. There is no such thing as a European people. I have always considered that the credibility of the so-called European People&#039;s party is somewhat undermined by its insistence that the apostrophe is in the wrong place. The flaw in the idea of the European Parliament is that politics remains national. At European elections, people elect MEPs on the basis of national political considerations, which is why the European Parliament remains such an utterly obscure and irrelevant institution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para12">
The many peoples of the EU are properly represented by the Governments and Parliaments of its member states. It is the nations of Europe that are the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1587</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>democracies. To comply with the UN charter, therefore, we must strive to maintain the self-determination of the peoples of Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para13">
Whatever the EU is or may become, it is not a democracy, but a bureaucracy. Governments from the Single European Act onwards have been much too eager to hand over more and more powers without regard to proper democratic scrutiny. Every time we do this, we take power from democracies and give them to a bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para14">
Despite that, I have never had a problem with the principle behind the existing legal basis of our membership of the EU. That is the principle of the delegation of national powers to the EU institutions. However problematic our relationship with the EU has become, it has only ever been a voluntary association of sovereign nation states. In the context of this debate, the only question that we must answer is whether the EU constitution represents a fundamental change to that principle of voluntary delegation of powers. Of course it does. Article I-6&nbsp;states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Constitution and law adopted by the institutions of the Union in exercising competences conferred on it shall have primacy over the law of the Member States.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para15">
The Government will say&#151;we have heard this already&#151;that that merely reflects the existing precedence of the European Court of Justice, whose views on primacy are intended by the constitution to have full effect. The ECJ&#039;s view is that EU law has primacy over all national law, including national constitutional law. However, our courts rejected that idea, as recently as the &quot;metric martyr&quot; case in 2002. Our courts do not recognise the primacy of European law. By ratifying the constitution, the United Kingdom would effectively be committing constitutional suicide. Everything becomes subjugated to the ultimate sovereign authority of the EU. That is the intention that our courts will read, because we have enacted it on our statute book. It is utterly untrue for Ministers to claim, therefore, that the constitution is not a fundamental change. A secession clause needs to be added to the European constitution, because the present implicit right of secession would be compromised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-28_para16">
If the Government allow an honest debate on the subject, there is no possibility that the British people will vote for the constitutional treaty, but I fear it will fall to opponents of the EU constitution to make that explanation. Of course the Government will try to frighten people into believing that this is some kind of &quot;in or out&quot; debate, but the Minister for Europe has contradicted the Foreign Secretary by insisting that the constitutional treaty is not the final resting place of the European Union and that there will be further treaties. Why did he contradict his right hon. Friend?

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1588</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mr. Ancram). After telling us about Geronimo scalping the taxpayer for propaganda purposes, he made an extraordinary statement. He criticised the Government for not allowing enough time for discussion, debate and scrutiny, but in answer to an intervention from the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), he made it clear that in the unlikely eventuality of the Conservative party being returned at the next election, there would be no scrutiny of any sort. That leads to a great deal of confusion not only in the minds of right hon. and hon. Members, including Opposition Members, but outside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para1">
In another intervention we heard that in the Scrutiny Committee the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) had legitimately asked whether the Bill could be used as the basis for a future referendum. I assume that implicit in that question is the belief among at least a section of the Conservative party that whatever is done as a result of the Bill will be undone at some future time. That underlines an almost visceral opposition to the European Union in any form that it might take.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para2">
I was equally taken by the exchange between the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that they go round the country and debate these matters, and I do not doubt the sincerity with which their opposing views are held. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said he did not understand why they could never get to the basis of the argument. That is because of the difference in their visions of the future of Europe. They are so different that it is like trying to compare the vision of Michelangelo with that of Hieronymus Bosch. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe and the right hon. Member for Wells see the world from totally different perspectives, and that colours their outlook on everything to do with Europe and the EU.

Those who oppose the Bill always fail to draw attention to the irreconcilable tail that is wagging the Conservative dog. They fail to say what they would put in place of a United Kingdom which, in their heart of hearts, they want out of Europe. Will we no longer be the bridge to America? Are we supposed to be a dwindling and irrelevant piece of real estate floating off the edge of Europe? Will we increasingly become a client of America, and will the notion of the United Kingdom as an American aircraft carrier hold true? All the Opposition&#039;s views are vague and indeterminate, but they stem from a visceral antagonism towards the European Union and things European.

That is not to deny Europe&#039;s failings and failures. I acknowledge them, but I also take on board the overwhelming advantages of the European position.

There are obvious benefits, as has been said, in not having two representatives to deal with foreign affairs. Preconceived notions are not endangered by the proposal that Javier Solana should be, for want of a better description, the first Foreign Minister under the constitution. Qualified majority voting on measures against criminal activity is also desirable. I just wish that the previous Government had introduced proposals on better co-operation with Europe, as that might have prevented leading criminals from being able to escape jurisdiction and being held to account before 1997.

<p><a name="50209-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. David Trimble  (Upper Bann) (UUP):</b> 
 Once again, we have a thoroughly unsatisfactory procedure whereby a new 500-page constitution will be made part of our law in just five clauses. We can only debate those clauses and not the 500&nbsp;pages. I repeat that it is thoroughly unsatisfactory that agreements made through the exercise of the treaty-making power deal with Europe as if it were a foreign country on the other side of the Pacific. That is not appropriate, and it is using the royal prerogative to change our constitution. That is quite unacceptable in this day and age, and I hope that the Government will reassess such matters in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para5">
There are clear differences of opinion on the construction of parts of the measure. It is no longer purely about consolidation. The Government argue that they are moving things back towards the nation state, but others regard it as yet another step in the long trail towards a federal state. When the original statement was made, I said that it does not matter what view the Government or others express because, at the end of the day, the European Court of Justice will decide these matters, and we know what its bias and approach are. After I made those comments, a Government supporter told me that I should not worry, because the Government had managed to remove the phrase &quot;ever closer union&quot; from the new treaty. Because they were no longer committing themselves to ever closer union, the European Court would cast a different eye on things. After finally getting hold of the text, I can confirm that &quot;ever closer union&quot; has gone, only to be replaced with the phrase &quot;united ever more closely&quot;. If that does not make it clear that there is an absence of significant change, there is an express reference to continuity in the acquis communautaire. That continuity will be accompanied by continuity in the drift towards greater federalism in these provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para6">
When we were presented with the treaty, I told the Government that they had missed a huge opportunity. What we really need in Europe is fundamental reform, but we do not have it in the treaty. There is a little tinkering around the edges, but that will not stop the progress towards a federated Europe. If the Government had plucked up the courage to veto the constitution, they could have started to argue for fundamental reforms, as they would no longer be trammelled by the report from the European Convention.

<br>&nbsp;<br>is not democratic. For example, we have a situation in Europe where a group of unelected people have a total and absolute veto on legislation; that is another way of describing the European Commission&#039;s exclusive right of initiative. The only legislation that can be enacted is legislation proposed by the Commission, which in itself shows the absence of democracy.

I concur entirely with the comments of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) about the danger we are in when there is a gap between the people and those who make laws affecting them. That is why we need reforms to make European institutions more democratic and more democratically accountable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para9">
I shall just touch briefly on economic matters, which is another area in which we need huge changes. How many years ago did the Union commit itself at Lisbon to making changes? Has it made any? Is Europe more competitive or productive? No. The economic failure of the European Union gets worse, and it is important to realise that we are dealing today with economic failure. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr.&nbsp;Curry) was worried that a British no vote would lead to a Franco-German inner core. France and Germany are economic failures, and their failures are getting worse because of their failure to change their economies. The lower performance in those countries&#039; economies dates from 1992&nbsp;and it flows from Maastricht. The Minister may shake his head, but that is the case, and until major economic changes take place there, particularly with regard to the euro and the European Central Bank, the economic failure of Europe will get worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-29_para10">
The Bill also provides for a referendum, and I welcome the fact that we will have a referendum, and that it will give whoever is in Government at that stage a second chance. I believe and hope that the people will reject the constitution, and flowing from that rejection will come an opportunity to look at the matter again. Europe cannot afford to treat the United Kingdom in the dismissive way it has treated Ireland and Denmark by telling people to go back and think again.
</p>

A rejection of the constitution will provoke the opportunity for some real changes in Europe, which are clearly needed.

On balance, I welcome the treaty. I say &quot;on balance&quot; because there are still some flaws in it, some of which were created by the Conservative Government. There were good arguments for shared competence on fisheries, for example, which we did not press for because the issue was not covered by any of the original treaties, but it might have been a useful move forward.

What worries me most is the combination of what I would call the anti-European zealots&#151;those in my party and the group led by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and his colleagues, with their &quot;Be afraid; be very afraid&quot; argument about the European Union&#151;and the humbug and hypocrisy that I hear from those on the Conservative Front Bench. Is it opportunism rather than fear that I smell from them? Is it fear of the United Kingdom Independence party that is making them take the position that they have taken? We should never forget that the Opposition, when in government, not only signed up to a treaty that sold out the UK fisheries policy, but later, under Mrs.&nbsp;Thatcher, traded much of the Irish box to get the rebate, destroying a lot of the British and Scottish fisheries.

I was disappointed in some contributions. I will refer again and again to the attack by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) on the working time directive when I speak to trade unionists and working people in this country. The EU led the way in the working time directive, and it should not be forgotten that it has been a great improver of the working conditions of many people in Britain.

The right hon. Member for Wells sadly is not here. Again and again the European Scrutiny Committee discusses these matters, and shifting the balance of power of co-decision making to Members of the European Parliament will be welcome. They made it plain in their evidence to the Committee when I chaired it that they saw the constitution as a very positive thing. They included Members from Finland, born only 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years ago, and two Members from Hungary, who were born in 1939. They all had a vision of the constitution as a way forward for a balanced Europe.

It is important that we counter all these scary stories about the EU courts. The evidence that we received showed that it was still a matter of balance. With regard to primacy, if the European courts think that our laws are not compatible, it is for us to amend our laws; we are not overruled. The override that is referred to in both amendments, one selected and one not, will not undermine the will of the UK Parliament, contrary to what the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) said, and it will not further diminish the sovereignty of the UK, because eventually we in this Parliament must decide what we do when there is a conflict between our laws and interpretation of the laws in the EU.

But even the most obviously Eurosceptic witnesses, some of whom were quoted today, said that the UK Parliament would have the right to decide if and how to respond to any of those decisions in the courts.

<a name="50209-30_para7">
I come now to some Labour Members who are opposed to the measure. It is new words for old arguments; new weapons to fight old battles; and, unfortunately, old warriors dressed up in new uniforms. The treaty and the referendum that will follow are not about holding back the free-market process, or the common market process as it used to be called. They are not about challenging the right or the left-wing balance of opinion within the Commission. They will not be about the UK rebate. All those matters will be trotted out, rather than there being an argument about the constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para8">
The Bill is not about the euro, immigration or the common fisheries policy, but, in the view of the hon. Member for Stone and his colleagues, it is about the possibility that if the Government are defeated in the referendum, the European Communities Act 1972&nbsp;can be renegotiated and we can pull out of the EU. That is the real agenda for those on the Eurosceptic wing, and the official Opposition are in serious danger of being trapped into that argument because it is the only argument that they have to play towards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para9">
I do not believe that the British people will respond to that. They realise that this is a mature and difficult treaty between countries, all of which want to hold on to their sovereignty as much as we do and to build a balanced, strong EU. I am not afraid of the fact that in treaties one has to give to receive, and in most cases QMV in the 53&nbsp;areas that we are talking about will be to our advantage, as has been the case in more than 95&nbsp;per cent. of cases to date. This is a treaty that I look forward to taking to a referendum and to supporting in the country. I support the Bill tonight.

It is clear that with the referendum during the next year or 18&nbsp;months Britain will face a defining moment in our history. Over that time, 25&nbsp;Governments will be going through the ratification process. It is virtually certain that 23&nbsp;or 24&nbsp;of them will achieve ratification through their Parliaments, or, many of them, through referendums. The idea that when they have achieved ratification and have democratic mandates, including in many cases through a referendum, those countries will simply be prepared to tear up the whole project to accommodate this country is absurd. It would also be extraordinarily arrogant to assume such a thing.

<a name="50209-30_para11">
Those who talk about renegotiation cannot therefore mean renegotiating this treaty but the EU&#039;s continuing on the basis of this treaty and our renegotiating something other than full membership. We might be able to get back into the European Free Trade Association or to negotiate the kind of special associate status that the French recently proposed for the Turks, and which the Turks rejected because it was so insulting, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I am always amazed when colleagues say, &quot;Well, we could always negotiate some access to the single market.&quot; They appear to be happy with a situation in which we would have to observe the rules and the laws decided by the European Union while playing absolutely no part in it. We would find ourselves paying over taxpayers&#039; money without any representation, as do current associates in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Switzerland and elsewhere. The prospect of taxation without representation seems to worry my colleagues not at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para13">
The European Union is a formidable achievement. I need not dwell on the single market, because even Eurosceptics admit that it is vital that we remain part of that, whatever happens, but we do not talk about the human importance of the Union&#151;the fact that it provides a larger stage for all of us, and our children, to conduct our lives and to exercise our liberties: not merely to trade, but to work, live and study on a much wider field than merely on this island.

Over the years, it has proven a remarkable engine of peace. Let us consider some of the sources of conflict and bloodshed over centuries that it has dissolved over the past generation or two, such as Alsace-Lorraine and Alto Adige. As shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I came to the view that the only way of reconciling the views of those who want to remain part of this country and those who think it absolutely essential that they become part of the Republic of Ireland was within the context of a successful European Union, where the precise line of the frontier is no longer an existential matter, and certainly not one to die for.

<a name="50209-30_para15">
The EU represents the only way in which we can exercise any influence in the world on key issues for the future such as world trade, international stability, sources of tension and potential conflict, nuclear threats, terrorism, and sources of migration. We cannot possibly influence those things standing alone in this country, and it would be absurd to think that we could.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para16">
Should we really walk away from all that because of this constitution? It would be completely crazy to do so given that 80&nbsp;or 90&nbsp;per cent. of it is a consolidation of what we have already signed up to, leaving six key changes, all of which seem to be very much in our favour. There are two substantive changes, the first of which is the mutual defence pact. We already have such a pact with 21&nbsp;out of the 25&nbsp;countries&#151;it is called the Washington treaty. This simply removes the anomaly whereby we do not currently have a mutual defence pact with the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para17">
The second substantive change concerns the common foreign and security policy and the Foreign Minister. This is triggered under the treaty only by unanimity. It makes no sense at all to say that we want to leave the mainstream of the European Union because of a common foreign policy, because we have a veto on every occasion before a such a policy can emerge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-30_para18">
In addition, there are four procedural changes. On the two-and-a-half-year presidency, we all know that it does not make sense to continue with the six-month

The constitutional treaty is, at its heart, hostile to social democracy. The thrust of today&#039;s EU is deeply anti-socialist and the neo-liberal philosophy is being driven forward.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-31_para13">
I do not regard the treaty as just another European treaty, and I certainly do not regard it as benign. We have to look at the end agenda. There are legitimate debates to be had on both sides of the argument. I say &quot;both sides of the argument&quot;, rather than &quot;both sides of the House&quot; because this is not a party political issue. It is a matter of national importance involving our future relationship with the European Union. I have no problem with people who do not share my view that we have already gone too far down the road of European integration. However, I say to the Government&#151;and I reflect on this in regard to previous Governments&#151;that I have difficulty with the fact that, over the years, politicians have not spelled out clearly what they were signing up to in the name of the people. That has caused the feeling that we, as a nation, have lost control of our right to govern ourselves in many important areas of policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-31_para14">
I do not share the view that signing up to the common market, as it then was, led to peace in mainland Europe at the end of the last century. I respect the views of those who genuinely believe that, but I personally do not think that the common market prevented France and Germany from tearing each other apart as they have done in previous centuries. I believe that it was the presence of the Soviet bloc, the cold war and the formation of the NATO alliance and the link with north America that kept the peace in mainland Europe.

We are talking about the type of relationship that we want with Europe. I fully share the views of those who have flagged up the additional powers in the treaty&#151;the euro-creep, as it is euphemistically called. These significant powers are being given to people who have not been elected by the people of this country, and who are not answerable to us as our elected representatives.

I know that this subject is not the public&#039;s idea of a hot political topic. They have more important things to concern them. However, if we do things by stealth in one treaty after another, and if we erode people&#039;s right to elect through the ballot box every four or five years those who make decisions on their behalf here, when they suddenly wake up to the fact that that right has gone, it will not simply be a matter of their not turning out to vote in general elections. Voter apathy will not be the only price that this country pays for such stealth; I believe that there will be a reaction on the part of the public when they realise that their democratic rights have been taken away from them. Yes, we all take our democratic rights for granted and it is already possible to see in some countries what can happen when extremism feeds on the lack of democratic accountability. It is a very dangerous path to go down.

The phone rings in the office: it is another small business; it is another person who wants to know why they have to do such and such, why they are bound by various rules.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para1">
The problem with the constitution, as I have said many times before, is the question of primacy. I do not need to repeat the argument today, as I have already explained it in my own terms over and over again. The plain fact is that the Foreign Secretary is blatantly wrong about the effect of the constitution on the United Kingdom. He mentioned the Vienna treaty, particularly article 27, but it is inconceivable that the people of this country could be governed on the basis of a decision taken by a treaty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para2">
I return to what the Foreign Secretary said about 18&nbsp;months ago&#151;that international treaties took precedence over national laws. That led to an exchange of correspondence, and a series of questions, between myself and him. At the end of that 18-month period, on 8&nbsp;or 9&nbsp;September last year, he effectively conceded in a debate that it was true that statute took precedence over treaty&#151;as, indeed, Lord Diplock had made absolutely clear in an important case in 1967. It is good law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para3">
The way in which the Foreign Secretary replied to me yesterday in the European Scrutiny Committee is also inconceivable. I put it to him that the treaty could receive a no vote when the referendum is called and I asked him whether, if that happened, he would repeal the legislation that is being pushed through Parliament now because of the massive majority. He said that he would not repeal it, and then said&#151;twice&#151;that to do so would be a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para4">
What arrogance. The Foreign Secretary would not repeal this legislation, even though it had been rejected by the British people. He relies on his prerogative powers to tell the country what laws will govern it and the extent to which Parliament will be governed by the new EU constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para5">
The hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson) suggested that this treaty was just one in a series. That is arrant nonsense. Article 1.6&nbsp;of the treaty states clearly that the EU constitution will take precedence over the laws of member states. When I put it to the Foreign Secretary that that precedence also included this country&#039;s constitution, he said that of course it did.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para6">
On the question of European Court of Justice case law, the treaty makes it clear that article 1.6&nbsp;reflects the Court of Justice&#039;s existing status in that respect, and of course it does. Yesterday, I discussed with the Foreign Secretary the matter of the competing jurisdictions that flow from the European Communities Act 1972. Evidence from distinguished academics on constitutional law makes it clear that our judges are duty bound to give effect to decisions made by the House of Commons on behalf of the British people. However, the European Court maintains that existing case law&#151;such as Enel <i>v.</i> Costa, or the Simmenthal verdict&#151;means that it has the right to decide questions of law in this country.

The Bill should be rejected. The referendum should be the subject of a separate Bill so that we can ensure that this country is governed by legislation passed by this House, whose composition is determined by the will of the British people as expressed in general elections.

<p><a name="50209-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset) (Con):</b> 
 Some intriguing polls have been published in the past few days. In <i>The Times,</i> a Populus poll showed that 36&nbsp;per cent. of people would say yes to the question whether we should approve the treaty, with 29&nbsp;per cent. saying no. However, an ICM poll showed that 39&nbsp;per cent. of people would respond negatively to the official question and that the same proportion&#151;39&nbsp;per cent.&#151;would respond positively. When the same poll asked people whether they would sign up to the European constitution in a referendum held tomorrow, 54&nbsp;per cent. said no and 26&nbsp;per cent. said yes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para9">
A poll by the Institute of Directors found that 49&nbsp;per cent. of its members intended to vote no in the referendum, with only 29&nbsp;per cent. planning to vote yes. That caused IOD director general Miles Templeton to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Business leaders remain ready to hear the case for both sides.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>

I shall use that as my starting point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para11">
I have been a great supporter of Britain&#039;s membership of the EU ever since we joined 30&nbsp;years ago. However, I am seriously concerned that in that time we have failed to take the people with us on the journey that has been the EU&#039;s development and evolution. We have now reached the stage where most people have little understanding of, and little confidence in, what is being done in their names.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para12">
Euroscepticism is not unique to Britain. It exists throughout Europe and the democratic deficit seems to be worse in some other European states, where people feel that it is inevitable and that they can do nothing about it. However, they will have the opportunity in referendums on the constitution to send a message to the political elites of Europe saying that they would like an explanation of what is going on and what has been done in their names during the past 30&nbsp;years in this country, and somewhat longer in some other member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para13">
For all the Foreign Secretary&#039;s spin on the treaty, it does not provide the answer. When I read the Laeken declaration back in 2001, I thought that we were beginning to go in the right direction and to pose some of the right questions. However, when I read the treaty&#151;all 511&nbsp;pages&#151;I remembered one phrase from the Laeken declaration, which mentioned
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Simplification of the Union&#039;s instruments&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para14">
There is no simplification in the constitution, and it contains so much detail that it can hardly be described as a constitution; it is a management textbook. The explanatory commentary, which runs to 500&nbsp;pages, is supposed to explain it to anyone who does not understand the first 500&nbsp;or so pages. The constitution is nowhere near being a simplifying treaty. It contains minutiae of management detail that one would expect those responsible for looking after our interests to come up with as their modus operandi.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para15">
Much of what is in the document could soon be out of date. What we now need is what the Laeken declaration referred to&#151;the creation of European institutions that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1600</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are closer to their citizens. The right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) referred to the fact that the Council will make decisions in public. That goes some way towards making the institutions more transparent and accountable. However, what is the point of making the decisions in public, but not holding the general proceedings of the Council in public? That is rather like putting cameras in the Division Lobbies here but taking them out of the Chamber, so that we can carry on our business in secret.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para16">
Most of our citizens support the broad aims of the Union, but they do not always see the connection between those goals and the Union&#039;s everyday actions. We all know that Europe has changed and is changing. With the 10&nbsp;new countries that joined last year, it now has 25&nbsp;member states. The enlarged Europe needs to be more effective and democratic, so we need a simple and transparent constitutional treaty, which is what the document was supposed to provide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para17">
An effective European Union is in Britain&#039;s interest and it is in our national interest to be a member of that Union, because we have so many aims in common. We need a new treaty that spells out in black and white the powers of the various parties. It should state explicitly that the EU has only the powers that member states choose to grant it. It should clarify what the EU can and cannot do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-32_para18">
The constitution is unacceptable, but that does not mean that I have become anti-European, that I do not want the European Union to succeed, or that I want us to be relegated to the position of Norway and Switzerland, with an expensive, subservient and passive relationship with the European Union. That is not an option for the British people. We need a tidying-up and simplifying treaty, but that is not what we have. I can happily say that the leaders of Europe should go back and reconsider the constitution.

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), who put his pro-European case against the constitution before us. It may be helpful if, at the outset, I put on the record the reference for which the Father of the House asked my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). It was a reference to comments made to the European Scrutiny Committee by Professor Sir David Edward. On the subject of the so-called emergency brake, he said in reply to a question from the hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan):
</p>
<ul>

We have had a splendid debate, with a good tone to all the contributions. We enjoyed particularly the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) revealing the&nbsp;secret about the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) frothing at the mouth during difficult EU negotiations on the treaty of Nice, and the right hon. Member for Livingston saying that the treaty did not involve any significant extension of competences. As he must well know, however, the list of 63&nbsp;extensions of qualified majority voting is on the record. It includes 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1601</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>such things as social security, structural and cohesion funds, agriculture and fisheries, transport, space policy, energy, culture, tourism, sport, civil protection&#151;and much more that I do not have time to read into the record. Those are all new transfers to qualified majority voting&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that they are not new competences&#151;but they are new to qualified majority voting. I hope that he now accepts that point.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robin Cook: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s reference is accurate in that I said that there was no substantial extension of competence. None of the list that he has given argues that I was in any way wrong about that. He is talking about something entirely different: an extension of qualified majority voting. In the European Union, 85&nbsp;per cent. of all decisions are already taken by qualified majority voting, primarily because the 12&nbsp;extensions of qualified majority voting under the Single European Act, passed by a Conservative Government, are the basis on which the great majority of decisions are taken in the Council of Ministers.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Brady: </b> 
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for making it clear that we are both talking about an increased transfer of powers from the House and the United Kingdom to the European Union&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He is starting to froth at the mouth again; he really should try to contain himself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para2">
The right hon. Member for Livingston also made much of the public meetings that the Council of Ministers will hold. I heard the Foreign Secretary&#039;s comments in front of the European Scrutiny Committee yesterday, however, and he made it clear that decisions must still be made behind closed doors, and that the decision-making process would not work if it was in public. We are therefore hearing different things from different Labour Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para3">
The right hon. Member for Livingston also said that a vote against the constitution was a vote against the modern world. In 1999, however, on 25&nbsp;May, at column 184, he also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;For the record, we are not proposing a constitution of Europe.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 25&nbsp;May 1999; Vol. 332, c. 184.]</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para4">
Was he then saying no to the modern world?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para5">
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) seemed to suggest that Parliament could not exercise powers not to follow the decision taken by the Executive to endorse this treaty, putting the Liberal Democrats firmly under the royal prerogative and apparently denying the right of the House to make such decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para6">
One of the greatest pleasures in the debate, however, was the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) who spoke about public disaffection with the political process and the extent to which the public see a gulf between the people and the institutions of Government. As he said, this constitution will make it worse, citing instances from food supplements to asylum policy.
</p>

<a name="50209-33_para7">
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) spoke of his strong opposition to referendums. We differ from his views but respect his

<br>&nbsp;<br>principle and consistency in these as in other matters. He put the view that Ministers are weakened by the use of referendums. All that I would say on that is that Ministers are weakened only if they are out of tune with the views of the people. We are in tune with the views of the British people, and we will be strengthened by the referendum if we see that no vote, whenever it may come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para8">
The House has, in the short time allowed, been discussing a momentous decision. Contrary to the Government&#039;s claims, the new constitution would be a decisive step towards political integration. If we talk to politicians or diplomats anywhere in Europe, they will tell it to us straight: the constitution is part of the process of creating an economically and politically integrated Europe. Only in Downing street or the Foreign Office is the pretence maintained that this is a mere codification of existing treaties.

But even as the Government try to flog this outrageous porkie to the British people, they cannot get their own story straight. On the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning, the Foreign Secretary said that the constitution

The Government maintain that the constitution is a great triumph for Britain, but as we heard earlier, the French are giving the game away. We have heard the views of President Chirac and of Alain Lamassoure, both of whom have made it clear that the constitution is regarded as a victory for the French vision of Europe over the Anglo-Saxon vision. Nicolas Sarkozy, leader of the UMP, said:

There is emerging evidence that the referendum question may need changing, but we welcome the fact that the Bill does provide for a referendum. Indeed, the British people are being allowed one only because of the pressure being applied by the Opposition. This Government saw no lofty principle in the idea that the voice of the British people should be heard. They struggled, blustered and resisted, but then, as the Minister for Europe told the <i>New Statesman&#151;</i>I am paraphrasing, but one can imagine the scene as he and

Now we have the Government&#039;s grubby attempt to push the referendum back to autumn 2006&#151;the very last moment&#151;to prevent the people from having their say. What rich irony there is in a Prime Minister who once boasted of wanting Britain to lead the way in Europe now being found cowering in a corner, hoping and praying that the French vote no and get him off the hook. Even now, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has said, the Government are trying to pull a fast one by smuggling the 448-article European constitution through Parliament via five clauses of an incomprehensible Bill that is supposedly about the referendum.

<p>
<a name="50209-33_para17">
In promoting this constitution, the Government are missing the real challenges for Europe, including sorting out the mess of the EU institutions, which are riddled with financial mismanagement and fraud and have not been approved by the auditors for 10&nbsp;years. Moreover, Britain&#039;s net contribution to EEC institutions is projected to rise, according to the Chancellor&#039;s own figures, from &#163;2.4&nbsp;billion in 2003&#150;04&nbsp;to &#163;4.5&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08.

 My hon. Friend is right in at least one respect, in that I do not propose that idea.

Indeed, it was one of the most startling instances of financial mismanagement and malpractice. Amazingly, the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to talk to Marta Andreasen, the whistleblower who exposed EU fraud and who was fired for her trouble.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The yellow card issue is for national Parliaments. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there is a procedure known as a Sewel motion that allows the Scottish Parliament to take forward relevant matters under the treaty. I hope that we can have a full discussion of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para0">
I have some good news for the Conservatives. Yesterday, the Conservative&#151;believe me, it is very conservative&#151;party in Denmark won a thumping victory in their national elections. The new Prime Minister, Mr. Fogh Rasmussen, who is a very conservative European gentleman, said that the first priority for his new Government was to get the constitutional treaty through in Denmark. I am sure that all Conservatives in the House will join us in wishing him full speed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para1">
There are three broad questions we have to consider. This has been a wide-ranging debate, but, my goodness, it has not actually been on the Bill itself. We have been up and down the highways and byways of the problems of Europe: how Europe is run, the economies of Europe, and the fraud and mismanagement of accounts in Europe. Those are all important issues, but they are not remotely relevant to what we shall have to vote on shortly.

<a name="50209-35_para2">
The second part of the Bill relates to the referendum, while the first part gives effect to the part of the treaty that requires a change in our domestic law. That is normal in treaties. The question of &quot;the question&quot; has been raised. I am glad that, in a statement to the Press Association on 26&nbsp;January, the Leader of the Opposition said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We do accept the question.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para3">
On the same day, the shadow Foreign Secretary said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The referendum question seems straightforward.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para4">
I am glad that we have their agreement on that.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ancram: </b> 
 I have written to the Foreign Secretary to ask about the terminology that describes the treaty. Why does the treaty refer to the establishment of a constitution for Europe, when the question refers to the establishment of a treaty for the European Union? I am sure that there is a very simple explanation&#151;it would be nice to have it.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew5"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman seems to be resiling from what he said a few weeks ago.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ancram: </b> 
 Answer the question.
</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew7"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 I will answer the point in my own way. The Electoral Commission has considered the intelligibility of the question against its published guidelines, and it said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Commission welcomes the brevity of the proposed question&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Commission is content that the question is structured in such a way that it prompts an immediate response and encourages each voter to interpret it in the same way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Commission is satisfied that the referendum question makes it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. clear what decision the voter is being asked to make.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para5">
If the right hon. and learned Gentleman turns to article I-1&nbsp;of the treaty, he will see that it says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;this Constitution establishes the European Union.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para6">
So it does seem fairly sensible to put that question to the British people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para7">
The third point is that this is a treaty under international law. Winston Churchill notably said that jaw-jaw was better than war-war, but in a sense what we have been developing in the United Kingdom, particularly since 1945, between the parties is the idea that there is obviously one thing better than war-war&#151;jaw-jaw&#151;and that there is one thing better than jaw-jaw, and it is law-law: we can shape the rule of law that governs many of our international relations. Churchill himself signed 162&nbsp;multilateral treaties. Lady Thatcher signed 316&nbsp;multilateral treaties&#151;she really was a treaty queen&#151;and the present Prime Minister has signed only 153&nbsp;multilateral treaties, but he has a number of years in office to continue, and that 153, of course, includes the new treaty of Rome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para8">
Let me now turn to what is actually on the Order Paper. Forgive me, Madam Deputy Speaker, if I refer to what we must vote on tonight. The Conservative party in the amendment in the name of the Leader of the Opposition says that the treaty
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;provides for the implementation into UK law of the Constitution for Europe&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50209-35_para9">
The right hon. and learned Gentleman is perfectly right: every time that we have signed a treaty, we have had to change domestic law. The amendment continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;it enshrines the primacy of European Union law.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para10">
Again, he is perfectly right: that has been the case since 1972. As is made clear in article I-6&nbsp;of the treaty:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Constitution and law adopted by the institutions of the Union in exercising competences conferred on it shall have primacy over the law of the Member States.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a name="50209-35_spnew11"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 I am trying to reply to the points made in the speeches. A number of colleagues referred to fisheries policy, which has been included in all the treaties since 1972.
</p>

 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>





<p><a name="50209-35_spnew13"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 Other colleagues have referred directives under the Single European Act. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) made a powerful point, but he was talking about what is contained in the Single European Act. As other hon. Members noted in the speeches that they made after he left the Chamber, the thrust of his speech was very much against the Single European Act. That shows the huge danger that we now face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para12">
The Conservative party is embarked on saying no not just to this treaty, but to the treaty before it, the treaty before that and, above all, the crowning jewel of Lady Thatcher&#039;s achievement under the Single European Act, which was to make market economic relations the norm in the European Union. That is buttressed by the social chapter, and in a powerful speech that set the tone for our debate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) cited the treaty at length and showed the extent to which it contains references to what citizens want to hear: the guarantee of their social rights and the guarantee of full employment.
</p>

 Order. The Minister has made it clear that he does not intend to give way.

<p><a name="50209-35_spnew16"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The amendment contains the extraordinary allegation that the new treaty
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;promotes the concept of a common foreign and security policy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para13">
What a surprise! That has been in every treaty since Maastricht. The whole idea of a common foreign and security policy was first put forward by Lady Thatcher 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1609</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in a famous speech in 1984. Here we are, 21&nbsp;years later, and the Conservative party finds that the new treaty refers to a common foreign and security policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para14">
May I especially pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin), who will be leaving us after the election? In a characteristically calm, measured and steady speech, she showed just how much she has contributed to the House for a number of years on Europe&#151;we will miss what she has to say. Similarly, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) will not be coming back to the House after the election. He spoke by representing his trade union, Amicus&#151;it used to be known as the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union&#151;which has always taken a constructive and positive position on Europe. We have heard the opening shots of the giant campaign on whether we say yes or no to Europe through the referendum, and I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will play a part in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para15">
I cannot let the speech made by the shadow Foreign Secretary go by. Most of it was a kind of Lord Rothermere rant. The right hon. and learned Gentleman would have been a perfect Chamberlain-ite during the 1930s with his obscure conversion to isolation, because we know that he is a pro-European and a one-nation Tory. Although the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) might have to toe the party line today and say no, the Marquis of Lothian will say yes when the referendum comes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para16">
The right hon. and learned Gentleman prayed in aid Ben Bot. I agree with Mr. Bot because I think that we need more power for Parliaments&#151;there is a way forward for that in the constitution. However, Mr. Ben Bot, the Dutch Foreign Minister, of course signed the constitution. The right hon. and learned Gentleman also prayed in aid Mrs. Thatcher&#039;s sturdy work to secure the abatement, but she achieved that only because she won a majority set of votes in the then Council of Ministers and the measure was not written into the treaty. That shows exactly why we have to keep negotiating on the many great interests that we must defend in Europe, but we would not be able to do that if we followed the advice of the Conservative party and isolated ourselves permanently from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para17">
I pay tribute to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell). He located the debate in history and recalled why the European Coal and Steel Community was founded. Some dismiss the question of peace, stability and democracy as irrelevant, but is it not interesting that Lithuania, Slovenia and Hungary, the three member states that have already ratified the treaty, are all countries that know the effect of the absence of the European Union, the rule of law and democracy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para18">
The House must make a decision tonight. I am grateful for the measured tone of much of the debate, although I cannot address all the issues raised by hon. Members. I am especially grateful for the tone of those who said that we should vote for the referendum tonight and perhaps leave debate on the constitutional treaty itself for another day. Tonight the House must fundamentally decide whether it wants to move Britain 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1610</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>forward, not back. Forty years ago, a Labour leader announced that entering Europe would mean the end of 1,000&nbsp;years of English history.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para19">
Rab Butler, a Conservative leader, said that while he respected the reference to 1,000&nbsp;years of history&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He was the best Prime Minister the Conservatives never had. He said that while he respected the reference to 1,000&nbsp;years of English history, the Conservatives believed in the future. That was then; today they do not. Like the fantasy island where all the asylum seekers will be placed, they believe in a fantasy Europe&#151;a Europe to which they can say no, and then the rest of Europe will quietly say yes to the demands of the Conservative party. To read the Conservatives&#039; language and to listen to some of their contributions today is to enter a world of make-believe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para20">
Reference has been made to the length of the treaty. I have it here in a reduced form. It is about 150&nbsp;pages long and quite readable. It is half the length in words of the excellent biography of William Pitt by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks and a lot shorter than the latest book by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;, in which he discusses the view that, in negotiating with Europe, the threat of withdrawal should be used only as a last resort. He writes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I liken it to the use of nuclear weapons before you have tried invasion by conventional forces.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para21">
What a remarkable metaphor. His friend and fellow European, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heathcoat-Amory), who has taken part in this debate, goes a step further. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If we vote &#039;no&#039; in a referendum on the constitution, the world is at our feet. We could unilaterally call for the repatriation of the Common Fisheries Policy and dictate to the rest of the EU&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para22">
Dictate to the rest of the EU? Even if there is a no vote, it still leaves us with the existing constitution of Europe, a mishmash of treaties, so we could repatriate the fisheries or other policies only by being in breach of existing treaty obligations. But I leave that for a later debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para23">
What an amazing language this is: the nuclear option from the right hon. Member for Wokingham and the world at the feet of the right hon. Member for Wells: pressing the nuclear button and dictating to Europe. Wokingham and Wells, the Ant and Dec of the anti-European movement. At least Robert Kilroy-Silk, our former colleague, was honest when he described&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;What?&quot;]&#151;when he described the people that he worked with in the United Kingdom Independence party as a bunch of right-wing fascist nutters. UKIP responded by putting out an immediate statement saying that it was true that UKIP had a right-wing fascist nutter element, but Robert Kilroy-Silk had now left the party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para24">
What, alas, we have heard today in too many speeches from the main Opposition party is language to appease UKIP and not promote Britain. I would say to the Conservative party, appeasement and isolation is never the way forward. Every other mainstream Conservative party in Europe understands the need to support this new treaty. I have to say, on the day after President Bush sends his Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to open, as she put it, a

the United States and Europe, we hear from Conservative Front-Bench Members only arguments about isolating ourselves from Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-35_para26">
What a message to send to the world&#151;to the investors who want to come here and to those who have already ratified the new treaty. The Conservative party wants to plunge Britain into a feast of hostility to Europe over the next few months and the next year. Little wonder that the Leader of the Opposition is totally unwelcome in Washington, just as he is unwanted in Europe and unelectable in Britain. This party, this Government, and I believe a majority of us in the House and the nation, will not allow the Tories to turn the clock back to their vision of Europe&#151;a Europe of conflict instead of co-operation, of beef wars and empty chairs, of rejecting partnership.
</p>

This treaty is good for Britain. We will defeat the isolationists. We will move forward with Britain and not back to the anti-European isolationism of the Conservatives. I commend the Bill to the House.

</p>





<p><a name="50209-39_spnew0"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the A14&nbsp;in Cambridgeshire and I am pleased that my hon. Friends the Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr.&nbsp;Lansley) and for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) are in their place this evening. I hope that they will be able to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, because the road runs through their constituencies as much&#151;in some cases more&#151;than mine and it affects all three of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para14">
Before dealing directly with the main issue, I want to express to the Minister in the strongest possible terms my anger at how I have been treated by the Highways Agency over the last few days. On Monday, I requested the latest information on traffic volumes to prepare for this debate. After several prevaricating and clarifying conversations, my office was informed at nearly 5&nbsp;pm this afternoon that the Minister&#039;s office had refused to release the information&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister seems to be suggesting that that is untrue, but if he listens, I will tell him exactly what happened. That fact was confirmed to me by his office as being in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Subsequently, his office claimed that he had given permission for the information to be released, for which I am grateful, but I shall show that I have been given only partial answers to some of my questions. I have to question the basis of a freedom of information Act that apparently relies on a Minister to decide whether or not information should be released.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para15">
The critical issue to all three of us&#151;it has been for many years&#151;is the A14. Prior to 1997, most of the route from the Suffolk border almost as far as Huntingdon was in my constituency. Now, my patch includes only the section east of the Girton interchange. This debate is primarily about the sector from what is known as the Spittals interchange at Huntingdon to the A10&nbsp;junction in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para16">
The road is of local and national significance. It is the main commercial route between the west midlands and our biggest container port in Felixstowe. It is the main north-south route to east London, docklands and the channel crossing. Indeed, it is signposted as such on the A1. Within a few short miles, six lanes become four, then two&#151;yet the traffic does not diminish. The stretch eastward from Girton is also the Cambridge bypass, but it is also a local road, which people have to use to get to and from Cambridge to work or study.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para17">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has decided that we must have 47,500&nbsp;new homes in the Cambridge sub-region, including a new town at Northstowe, a few miles east of the A14. That development cannot go ahead without A14&nbsp;improvements. That is not just my view; it is the considered view of Cambridgeshire Horizons, the organisation representing all the local authorities, businesses, the university and others who are taking the development forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para18">
On the matter of the road conditions, anyone using it will, anecdotally, testify to the problems, particularly daily traffic jams at peak times, often stretching for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1625</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>several miles. Local and national radio traffic flashes feature the A14&nbsp;probably more than any other road in the country. One constituent wrote to me over the weekend:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para19">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The journey time to Peterborough can now take anywhere from 1&#150;2&nbsp;hours. I never know what time I will arrive at the office or what time I will arrive home&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para20">
Those anecdotes are supported by the few statistics that I do have. Traffic volumes between the Hinchingbrooke and Girton interchanges&#151;not quite the whole length that we are discussing&#151;have increased from 63,000&nbsp;in 1997&nbsp;to almost 72,000&nbsp;in 2003. It worries me, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the Government and the Highways Agency are so anxious not to publish all the figures, presumably because the picture is so awful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para21">
What I can tell the House, as the county council kindly provided me with the information, is that, sadly, there has been an increase in accidents over the last nine years&#151;not a politically significant period. Particularly on the stretch to which I referred, the number of accidents has risen by almost 40&nbsp;per cent. I understand that it was particularly bad for two years, in 2000&nbsp;and 2001, and it improved a little after that. It is now worsening again. Last year, there were 106&nbsp;accidents in which, sadly, four people lost their lives, 232&nbsp;were seriously injured and 148&nbsp;slightly injured. The accident figures show that the accident rate per million vehicle kilometres on this critical stretch of road has increased from 0.13&nbsp;in 1997, to 0.15&nbsp;in 2003. That means that the road has become 15&nbsp;per cent. more dangerous over that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para22">
Behind those statistics lie some very personal matters. One of them is the huge cost and distress inflicted on people caught up in the aftermath of accidents. It is not unknown for the road to be closed for many hours; it was closed for a whole day on one occasion last year. I received an e-mail from a consultant working in the accident and emergency department at Addenbrooke&#039;s hospital. He said:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para23">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;As an A and E consultant at Addenbrooke&#039;s hospital&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sadly see all to frequently the so many badly injured people from the notorious A14&nbsp;motorway. A large number of us doctors, nurses and other staff spend hours, days, weeks and months putting their shattered bodies back together again and hopefully their lives too. Unfortunately, many succumb, leaving behind their families to pick up the pieces.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para24">
The consultant continues:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para25">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I believe that if the A14&nbsp;is improved, we will see a dramatic reduction in the number of motor vehicle crashes, with an associated reduction in the number of deaths and seriously injured patients. There is robust scientific evidence that such road improvements and other preventative measures make a difference and lead to fewer and less serious injuries.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para26">
That consultant sees the real impact of what has not been achieved. However, there is also environmental damage. We all know that slow-moving traffic is a serious cause of pollution. There is also the impact on all villages in the area. The county council is spending thousands of pounds on traffic calming measures to deter the many drivers who use the villages as rat runs to avoid the A14. The county council itself is seriously affected in a direct way because it is prevented from making plans to improve various other roads locally because it does not know what is happening to the intersections on the A14.

<a name="50209-39_para27">
A former roads Minister said:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para28">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the No. 1&nbsp;priority for East Anglia has been the A14. That dual carriageway trunk road all the way from the M1&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Felixstowe is one of the key strategic routes for the region&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The A14&nbsp;is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one of the 14&nbsp;Christopherson priority projects for the European Community and it is eligible for some funding from the trans-European networks budget.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14&nbsp;February 1996; Vol. 271, c. 1117.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para29">
That was John Watts, in 1996.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para30">
The present Government inherited a scheme between junction 14&nbsp;on the M11&nbsp;and the A1-M1&nbsp;link&#151;that is, to Huntingdon&#151;and &#163;122.3&nbsp;million was allocated to meet the standard cost. By 1998, the scheme had been downgraded from &quot;scheme in preparation&quot; to one that was
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para31">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;subject to further studies and/or consultation by regional planning conferences.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para32">
In 1996, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire held an Adjournment debate on the A14. The then Minister, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson), replied by previewing the multi-modal study that was finally completed in 2001. It recommended extra lanes for most of the existing dual carriageway, with a new southern bypass for Huntingdon. It also recommended a public transport system along the lines of the old St. Ives railway, to take some commuter traffic off the A14&nbsp;and to serve Northstowe. The present Minister is aware that the county council has proposed a controversial guided bus system, and we await the outcome of the public inquiry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para33">
The Secretary of State for Transport announced a project worth &#163;490&nbsp;million to build a three-lane carriageway and a southern bypass for Huntingdon. That was on April Fool&#039;s day, 2003&#151;and perhaps that was no coincidence&#151;but we all cheered, and there is no getting away from that. He said that the improved road was expected to open around 2010, and added that the Highways Agency would develop the scheme to the stage where the public could be consulted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para34">
That was almost two years ago. Just before Christmas 2004, the present Minister said that the public consultation had been put back to allow more time for the Highways Agency to consider an alternative proposal&#151;as if the multi-modal study had not had time and opportunity to consider all options.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para35">
Replying to questions from me and my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, the Minister said that the consultation could start in spring 2005, and that he hoped that slippage would be slight. He told the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) that it was incumbent on the Government to &quot;tackle the worst first&quot;, and that the greatest problem had to be dealt with first. But when the <i>Cambridge Evening News</i>, which is rightly campaigning for the improvements, phoned the Highways Agency, it was told that there was no priority list and that the agency could not name another A road in more need of upgrading than the A14. That statement was confirmed to me by the Minister&#039;s office today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para36">
It is now February 2005&nbsp;and, as far as my constituents are concerned, we are getting nowhere. In the view of the <i>Cambridge Evening News,</i> it is &quot;Delay, delay, delay&quot;. I look not for pleasantries from the Minister tonight, but for real commitments. He may wish to dismiss my comments as electioneering and seek to reassure us that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1627</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>all is on track. Frankly, nobody will believe him. Every local authority involved in Cambridgeshire Horizons, the chamber of commerce, the local papers and all the businesses in the area are convinced that no progress has been made. As a constituent said to me in an email:
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para37">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;No-one in the Highways Agency appears to be taking control of this matter. This would not be allowed in a PLC, heads would roll and so they should.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-39_para38">
Will the Minister tell us when the public consultation will begin? He should by now be able to be absolutely specific&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has some detail of previous promises on that point. Will a public inquiry be necessary or can the Minister assure us that that can be avoided? If we must have one, when will it be and how much delay would it involve? Most importantly, when will we see some action? Can the Minister confirm that the announcement of &#163;490&nbsp;million in 2003&nbsp;is still in the programme? When does he expect soil to be shifted and work to begin? When does he expect the new road to be open? Given the delays that have occurred and the increasing problems that I have described, I believe that the people of Cambridgeshire are entitled to the answers.

Friend and I have fought for the multimodal study on the Huntingdon to Cambridge corridor to be put into tranche 1, because the Government were going to put it into tranche 2. After it came out of tranche 2, we had to fight for the right route to be selected. Then we had to fight for it to be put into the targeted programme of improvements. As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, we thought&#151;given the Government&#039;s rhetoric&#151;that the targeted programme of improvements equalled a commitment to proceed with a small number of projects on the fastest possible timetable, so that something would actually happen.

<a name="50209-40_para1">
My hon. Friend rightly said that some villages are deeply affected by this issue. He knows that because he represented them in the past. I have represented them since 1997, and they include Bar Hill, Lolworth, Conington, Longstanton and Oakington. It is virtually impossible to leave those villages or to travel south or north when the A14&nbsp;is blocked&#151;and that is often the case. That makes life in those villages intolerable and it is vital that we have a public consultation on the route as quickly as possible, so that the people living in those villages can see an end in sight to the blight on their lives.

My hon. Friend said that I had more detail on the date of the public consultation and indeed I do.

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para11">
The people of Huntingdonshire are tired&#151;tired of constantly hearing of the accidents and deaths on the A14, tired of their inability to get around Cambridgeshire, tired of diversions, tired of A14&nbsp;accident traffic running through their villages, and tired of this Government&#039;s consistent shilly-shallying, delaying and false raising of hopes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para12">
I have written more letters to Ministers and asked more written and oral questions on the A14&nbsp;than on any other issue. Much good it seems to have done anyone. Every few months, there is a new reason for delay and some lame excuse from Ministers. In December, the Minister wrote to me that the consultation was delayed from January to spring 2005. He has not, however, seemed in much of a hurry to set a date.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para13">
In demanding action on behalf of my constituents, I make three brief points. First, last Saturday, I talked to a pre-eminent research doctor who lives in my constituency. He works in Cambridge, but is now considering moving because of his inability to commute on the A14. Thus we see the ripple effect out from Cambridge&#151; which is meant to be a regional priority&#151;going into reverse. We all have big plans for the eastern region, but if this road is not sorted out, those plans are next to useless, as will be this Government&#039;s plans to build thousands more houses in the region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para14">
Secondly, the Government must start to put the A14&nbsp;plans in the context of the separate plan for the A1&nbsp;and the A428. I have been shocked at how disjointed the Government are on what is meant to be multi-modal transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para15">
Thirdly this is a national problem. If every local car between Huntingdon and Cambridge were taken off the road, traffic would decrease by less than 5&nbsp;per cent. on the A14. Therefore, while better local public transport is

 I congratulate the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) on securing this debate, and on giving the House an opportunity to discuss this section of the A14. Unfortunately, the hon.

He requested some information in an e-mail&#151;I have it here&#151;that arrived at 6.19&nbsp;pm on Monday.

At 6.19&nbsp;pm on Monday, the hon. Gentleman requested some information via a complex set of questions, and my officials set about putting the information together for him the next morning. The information arrived in my office at 2&nbsp;o&#039;clock today, and as soon as possible I made sure that the information was provided to his office in a fax that went out at 5.34&nbsp;this afternoon. Had the hon. Gentleman put in his request in good time, we might have been able to get him more information, and more complete information. As it was, I had to make sure that the information that had been provided to me was properly and fully checked. We were not sure whether some of the information provided by the county council was entirely accurate, so we wanted to check that, too.

 There are words that one is not allowed to use in this House, but if I were, I would use them. What the Minister is suggesting is totally untrue.

This afternoon, his office&#151;I could name the individual in his office, but I will not&#151;stated clearly to me that he had personally ruled that the information could not be released to me because of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. That is absolutely clear.

Fortunately, that was done later in the afternoon and it was then given to him. He was told that under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, there could be a delay of up to 20&nbsp;days before he received it.

The A14&nbsp;was established as a trunk road in 1994&nbsp;following completion of a new high-standard dual carriageway between the M1&nbsp;and M6&nbsp;junction at Catthorpe and Huntingdon. It is a route of strategic national importance, connecting the midlands with the ports of Harwich and Felixstowe. As the House will know, it is a mixture of dual two-lane and dual three-lane carriageway and has a variety of junction types, some with flyovers and some without. Congestion at peak hours at the Milton and Histon junctions caused by traffic queuing into Cambridge affects A14&nbsp;through-movements. Average daily traffic flows on the A14&nbsp;in Cambridgeshire range from 40,000&nbsp;at Ellington to 72,000&nbsp;between the St. Ives interchange and Bar Hill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para20">
We are concerned about the casualty rate on the A14. Records for the period 2002&#150;04&nbsp;show an average of 200&nbsp;personal injury accidents per year. Although the number of accidents is relatively high&#151;any accident is unacceptable&#151;the rate is below the national average for similar dual carriageway. That said, I do recognise that any accident is regrettable and involves human misery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para21">
Following the Government&#039;s strategic review of the roads programme in 1998, we announced our intention to carry out a study of the problems on the A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon. The Cambridge to Huntingdon multi-modal study&#151;known as CHUMMS&#151;reported in August 2001. The East of England local government conference, the predecessor to the East of England regional assembly, concluded that the preferred plan was consistent with the emerging regional transport strategy for the east of England and represented an integrated package that should form the basis for resolution of transportation problems in the corridor. The Government accepted the Conference&#039;s view that the package was a sound basis for pursuing integrated transport solutions, and asked the Highways Agency to take forward the recommended A14&nbsp;improvement scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para22">
The multi-million pound A14&nbsp;Ellington to Fen Ditton improvement was added to the Government&#039;s targeted programme of improvements in April 2003. I should remind the hon. Members for South-East Cambridgeshire, for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) that this scheme includes the widening of the A14&nbsp;between the M11&nbsp;and the A10, and that such a scheme was withdrawn by the previous Conservative Government in 1996. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said with mock indignation that the situation is a disgrace, but if his party were in government, there would be no such scheme at all. The 2004&nbsp;spending review has confirmed that the scheme is of national importance and will be progressed for future construction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para23">
But there is much that we are doing in the short term, and the Highways Agency is also doing a lot to improve safety. Measures to improve traffic signing and white lining are programmed for completion before the end of this March. Such measures, combined with the

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1631</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>installation of closed circuit television cameras and incident detection equipment&#151;the latter has already been installed&#151;are elements of the CHUMMS preferred plan. The agency is also in the early stages of planning other safety improvements for later in the year, including a further extension of the existing CCTV coverage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para24">
The Highways Agency has also undertaken in-depth analysis of the accidents at the Spittals and Brampton Hut junctions, and it is developing short-term and medium-term measures to reduce the number of crashes at these locations. A scheme to provide improved traffic signs and road markings at the Spittals interchange is programmed to commence later this month; it will take about a week to complete. That will be complemented in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;by the installation of traffic signals, which will bring safety and journey time benefits. Many other improvements are being made to that stretch of road, but I do not have time to expand on them this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para25">
Following a tragic accident on the A14&nbsp;last year, the chief constable of Cambridgeshire asked representatives of the Highways Agency to travel the A14&nbsp;with him and undertake an audit to address safety issues and driver behaviour. In September 2004, the agency assisted Cambridgeshire police in a multi-agency operation to monitor safe driving practice along that section of the A14. Special patrols spent a week monitoring drivers in a bid to put a stop to tailgating, needless overtaking and other offences involving mobile phones and seat belts. That survey exposed many instances of poor driving behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-40_para26">
Returning to the Ellington to Fen Ditton improvement, I acknowledge the support for the scheme, but whatever the level of support, it is important to ensure that all opinions are properly invited and considered. Hon. Members will be aware that as a result of consultations with local authorities in preparation for the public consultation about the scheme, an alternative proposal, which differs from the strategy proposed by CHUMMS, has been suggested by the residents of Buckden in the constituency of the hon. Member for Huntingdon.

 No.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-41_para0">
One reason why the delay has occurred is because we have listened to local residents and are examining the alternatives. The alternative proposal would retain the existing A14&nbsp;past Huntingdon operating as a dual carriageway trunk road with a new route from Fenstanton to Ellington as a two-lane dual carriageway. The net effect would be to provide four lanes in total in each direction, instead of the three provided by the CHUMMS option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-41_para1">
An initial examination of the alternative proposal has concluded that it is essential that its merits and impacts are fully and properly assessed. At an early stage, CHUMMS assumed that the existing A14&nbsp;past Huntingdon would carry local traffic only. I believe that it is important that work at this stage is carried out in sufficient detail to enable the proposals put forward for public consultation to be robust and to minimise the risk of lengthier delays to the scheme later in its programme. Public consultation on proposals for the scheme has therefore been put back a little to allow the Highways Agency time to consider the alternative.

I am very pleased indeed that the Liberal Democrats have called for this Opposition day debate. I acknowledge that they have used such debates to introduce such matters in the House, whereas the Government have been rather remiss in providing debates on climate change. The usual suspects are in the Chamber. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, people can see for themselves where there are gaps on the Benches. We have reached consensus on the science of climate change, but we do not have consensus on the political tasks needed to deal with the problem. I shall get the political bit over before I address more consensual matters. If any party, MP or member of a party thinks that we can achieve a carbon-free future without using wind energy they are shutting the door on a solution to climate change. Anyone who thinks that that is a realistic prospect will let down severely the people of this country, the environment and future generations.

The Conservative party has said no to any wind farms whatever in Wales. That is totally unsustainable and I simply cannot accept it as a policy with which to tackle climate change. It is possible to discuss the right mix and the need to invest in wave, solar and other forms of renewable technology, but it is impossible to talk seriously about achieving the 20&nbsp;per cent. renewable target without including both onshore and offshore wind power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-41_para7">
I also have to say that there have been no significant wind farm proposals for Wales that the Liberal Democrats&#151;whether a parliamentary candidate in my own constituency, a Member of Parliament or an Assembly Member&#151;have failed to oppose. Indeed, Liberal Democrats of some significance and seniority have opposed all those plans. The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) is not in his place now, but I acknowledge the important work that he has done on these matters. I hope that he can lead his party in securing a more proactive acceptance of the need to use wind on our journey towards the carbon-free future. The wonder of wind energy is that, if we do not need it in 20&nbsp;or 30&nbsp;years&#039; time, we can take the structures down and leave the environment as it was&#151;virtually, though not completely, unchanged. That aspect is so different from other forms of energy generation that we need to swallow the pill. I am prepared, and have long been prepared, to swallow it in my own constituency in Wales, and I hope that: other parties will, too.

Let us consider what is happening with the environment at present. The public at large, newspapers and the media tend to talk about climate change as if it is something that is going to happen, but it is important to emphasise that it is happening now. We are already very close to the tipping points&#151;the points at which climate change becomes disastrous. A UK voluntary network is run by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, and it observes changes throughout the calendar year. It is easy to see from that research over the past 30&nbsp;years that spring is definitely arriving earlier. I had roses in my garden at Christmas, and a fig tree that is starting to shoot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50209-41_para9">
We all know what is happening, but it is good to have confirmation. Swallows are arriving a week earlier than they did 30&nbsp;years ago, and butterflies are also appearing much earlier. One consequence is that species, particularly bird species, are hatching after the glut of caterpillars has gone. The birds are unable to capitalise on the caterpillars, as it were, that have already been and gone in the early spring. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has provided figures, and it puts in context the occasional bird strike against the wind farms. That happens occasionally, and there are sometimes bird strikes against my house. At least one bird a year dies flying into my windows&#151;more than died in the wind farm recently in Ceredigion. Mass bird extinction under climate change has to be placed in the context of the occasional bird strike.

The latest report on climate change has come from the international climate change taskforce, chaired by the previous Secretary of State for Transport, and I was pleased to hear him repudiate&#151;on Radio 4&nbsp;when he launched the report&#151;many of his transport decisions.

Just a week after the publication of that report came the report from the British Antarctic Survey, showing that the west Antarctic ice sheet is indeed in danger of collapse. If an international taskforce argues that 2&#176; is the tipping point, and if the figures on Wales show that we are already 1&#176; higher, we are already very close indeed to some disastrous changes taking place within the United Kingdom. That demonstrates why political parties should be placing these issues on top of the agenda, irrespective of whether the press want to talk about it in the context of posters, images or dirty campaigning. This issue should, in 2005, be the focus of all our political campaigning. We must do what we can in our constituencies, but hon.

One important issue that has not been mentioned&#151;we have mainly talked about political and public responsibility&#151;is business and corporate responsibility. It is crucial to understand that we all have to pull together in tackling climate change. We have already heard a little about Shell and BP and their massive profits&#151;bigger, together, than the entire budget for Wales in a year. Let us consider Shell&#151;described by the hon. Member for Lewes as one of the better companies on the grounds that it had accepted the science of climate change. The company posted massive profits, yet is still asking for UK Export Credits Guarantee Department and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development support to help it develop oil and gas pipelines in Sakhalin in Russia. Shell is still involved in gas flaring in Nigeria, which produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the rest of sub-Saharan Africa put together. These &quot;goodies&quot;, then, have accepted the science of climate change, but continue to exploit developing countries by using technology that we would not allow in this country, producing greenhouse gas emissions that offset any savings that the companies are making in this country.

The Government have made some progress in respect of the overall basket of greenhouse gases, but as we have already heard, they are seriously short of targets on CO <sub>2</sub> &nbsp;reduction.

Aviation is not included in the national greenhouse gas inventories. If aviation were included, we would be talking about figures about 5&nbsp;per cent. higher. I hope that the Minister will deal with the problem in his winding-up speech. I understand why international agreements mean that we cannot go ahead now and tax aviation fuel, but I also understand that it is possible to tax emissions. What are the Government doing in respect of emission taxation, which would help to drive better technology within the aviation industry without necessarily hugely increasing costs? The costs of the aviation industry need to be put on record. Research shows that the richer people in society are the ones who benefit from cheap flights, often to their second homes in Bayonne or the Navarre valley or wherever. Less well-off people do not benefit much from cheap flights.

Climate change is a huge challenge for political parties and the political consensus in this country, but there are also huge opportunities. This island is the part of Europe with the greatest renewable energy resources.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Our solar energy may not be so good, but the wind, wave and tidal energy available to us is very great. We could power the whole of western Europe with energy from wind. The installations would not look very nice, but we have that potential, and we need to start finding creative ways to benefit our communities in that way.

For example, we could allow people to put small turbines on their homes. That would accommodate those who oppose wind farms. If we chose to do that, we should not make people fill out a 19-page form from Ofgem so that they could sell energy back to the network. Another possibility is to give council tax rebates to people who install renewable energy equipment in their homes. We should try and incentivise people in a different way. It is too complicated to convince people to go for the Clear Skies initiative. That is too remote: if we want people to choose renewable energy in their daily lives, we have to make it much easier for them.

Time is short so I shall end with a myth&#151;the myth of Cantre&#039;r Gwaelod. This Welsh folk tale harks back to a time when there was no sea between Wales and Ireland, and it is true that at one time the two countries were not separated by water. The relevant area was flooded as a result of the neglect of a politician, whose name has come down over the centuries. He was not called Blair or Howard, but Seithennen. If we politicians do not want future generations to think of us as the ones who neglected our environment, and if we do not want those future generations to live in caves remembering a time when a civilisation existed before the flood came, we need to be aware of the myths and stories of the past.

Climate change is no myth. What is happening to our environment is no folk tale. We should work to ensure that our reputation in history is a good one and we are recalled with approbation. To do that, we must tackle climate change now.
