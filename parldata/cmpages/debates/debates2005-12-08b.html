 (Lab): What recent assessment he has made of the economic effects of reducing long-term youth unemployment. [35531]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51208-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 It is because of measures we have taken and the new deal that youth unemployment has fallen 90&nbsp;per cent. since 1997, with large falls in almost every constituency. At a cost of &#163;140&nbsp;million, we will now pioneer new learning agreements for teenagers, with a grant for training in return for undertaking courses. At the same time, we will offer activity agreements to move teenagers from unemployment back into the world of training and then into work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51208-01_spnew0"><b> Mrs. James: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his answer. In my constituency we have seen those successes. Some 1,300&nbsp;young people and 1,080&nbsp;lone parents have found work as a result of those schemes, benefiting the local economy. Will he ensure that schemes such as the new deal continue to support our local economy and stop young people being put on the unemployment scrapheap?

<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51208-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 In the mid-1980s, there were nearly 400,000&nbsp;young people out of work for more than a year. Today, the figure is less than 6,000&nbsp;throughout the whole country. It is because of the new deal that we have achieved that, and that is why we will not abolish the new deal as the Opposition would do: we will strengthen the new deal with our measures.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51208-01_spnew2"><b> David Simpson  (Upper Bann)</b> 
 (DUP): What progress is the Chancellor making on funding for the young enterprise programmes across the UK, as the budgets have been cut dramatically?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51208-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I take a big interest in the enterprise insight programmes. They have been held in England and there are additional programmes in Scotland and Wales, and of course there is a special programme in Northern Ireland, which has been very successful. I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman to talk about the enterprise programme in Northern Ireland. During enterprise week, only a few weeks ago, hundreds of thousands of young people were involved in the activities and there were 2,000&nbsp;special events, which ranged from master classes in enterprise to competitions, including one for the young entrepreneur of the year. It is that interest in enterprise and starting businesses among young people that we want to encourage, especially in areas that have seen slow growth in small businesses in previous decades, such as the area that the hon. Gentleman represents. We are determined to do more and I am happy to talk to him about the issue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51208-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Brian H. Donohoe  (Central Ayrshire)</b> 
 (Lab): While I praise my right hon. Friend for the massive drop in youth unemployment in my constituency, I am concerned that statistics are not available for the new constituencies north of the border, as he will know. Can he correct that situation so that we can see just how good the figures are for the new constituencies?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51208-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am happy to take up that issue with the Scottish Administration, if necessary, so that we can have the full statistics on the decline in youth unemployment, long-term youth unemployment and unemployment generally that has taken place under our Government. I can give him a rough estimate: the decline in youth unemployment in his constituency is of the order of 90&nbsp;per cent. since 1997.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51208-01_spnew6"><b> David T.C. Davies  (Monmouth)</b> 
 (Con): Would the Chancellor agree that the surest way to reduce youth unemployment would be to follow the Irish example and reduce corporation tax, instead of imposing ever more costs, bureaucracy, red tape and taxation on our businesses and stifling their opportunities for growth?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51208-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I thought that with the new Conservative party we would have heard some concern about the unemployed&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> We have cut corporation tax by 3p, from 33p to 30p. We have cut small business tax from 23p to 19p. We have cut capital gains tax from 40p to 10p for long-term assets. If the hon. Gentleman is telling me that the solution to long-term youth unemployment is to abolish the new deal, he is living in the world of the 1980s, not 2005.

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the proposals that he announced on Monday to make banks give up unclaimed money for the benefit of youth and community programmes will also help long-term youth unemployment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51208-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I thought that we might have had a strong welcome for our proposals on the new deal and to put more money into youth and community services through the use of unclaimed assets. The banks and the Government have signed an agreement about what will happen once the figure for unclaimed assets has been agreed. The money will go to financial education, but mainly to youth and community services. That gives us a chance to do something in an area in which we have failed to invest for decades&#151;the provision of facilities in all our constituencies, be it internet cafes, youth facilities generally or sports facilities. It is important that we do something so that the good, decent majority of young people have facilities to enjoy. I hope that we will receive all-party support for the development of youth facilities through the use of unclaimed assets.

<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="51208-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Jim Devine  (Livingston)</b> 
 (Lab): How many new jobs have been created since 1997; and what assessment he has made of the effect of these new jobs on the economy. [35532]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51208-01_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 As a result of the new deal and other measures, 2.3&nbsp;million jobs have been created since 1997. British unemployment is half that of Germany and France and below that of America. I can also inform the House that, from April, the new deal will pioneer new compulsory interviews and intensive work preparation courses for those unemployed six months or over so that we can get more people back into work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51208-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Devine: </b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend aware that unemployment in my constituency last week was 2&nbsp;per cent.? When the Conservative party was in power, it was 26&nbsp;per cent. We were told that if it was not hurting, it was not working. I worked in primary care psychiatry and watched patients being prescribed anti-depressants and valium. If they could have been prescribed a job, they would not have been near the health centre. Does he agree that there is no such thing as compassionate conservatism?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51208-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 If Conservative Front Benchers had come in on the first question, we might have seen whether their attitude to the new deal had improved since the previous Administration. However, they have appointed a former party leader to run their commission on social action and he is already committed to the abolition of the new deal for young people and the unemployed. My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Conservative Members may have some reason to be grateful to the Government, as unemployment in most of their constituencies has halved as well. We will continue to create more jobs. There are 600,000&nbsp;vacancies in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 976</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>economy&#151;and this economy has created 300,000&nbsp;jobs in the past year. We should be congratulated by the Opposition on our policies, not criticised or condemned.
</p>

 (Con): If the Chancellor were to read out the names of the constituencies where unemployment was now higher than it was nine months ago, how many would he name?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51208-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I do not have a list of 650&nbsp;constituencies. We have created 330,000&nbsp;new jobs during the past year. Those, including the Leader of the Opposition, who prophesised that this year we would be unable to create the jobs that we have managed to create will find that we have created 6,000&nbsp;jobs per week, and that 3,500&nbsp;new small businesses have been created a week. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that Conservative Members cannot congratulate us or feel happy that the economy is creating 330,000&nbsp;jobs. We are not seeing much evidence of a new Conservative party today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51208-01_spnew14"><b> Andrew Gwynne  (Denton and Reddish)</b> 
 (Lab): As well as the 2.3&nbsp;million new jobs in the UK, unemployment in my constituency has fallen by 51&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. Does my right hon. Friend agree that our resources are best used to continue supporting people in finding work, rather than on the waste of the cost of unemployment that we had when 3&nbsp;million were unemployed under the Tories?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51208-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 People will see that when we mention unemployment and the creation of jobs, Conservative Members in this new anti-Punch and Judy show that they are trying to operate are laughing. The fact is that we have created 2.3&nbsp;million jobs since we came to power in 1997, and 330,000&nbsp;jobs have been created in the past year. Some 6,000&nbsp;jobs have been created on average every week. This has affected almost every constituency in the country. I believe that we are showing that with low inflation, we can create high employment in a modern economy and that we do not have to pursue the polices of the 1980s where, to get inflation down, unemployment was at 3&nbsp;million. That is the difference between a Labour philosophy and a Conservative philosophy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51208-01_spnew16"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): While the Chancellor&#039;s figures are encouraging, and I congratulate him, does he accept that the situation facing manufacturing industry is very grim? Many tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in manufacturing, which is the only source of non-inflationary sustainable growth. Is there nothing that he can do to give further encouragement and support by creating the right environment for a growth in manufacturing jobs, which is essential to this country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51208-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has taken a long-term interest in manufacturing industry. I think that he would agree that the first foundation for industrial strength is low inflation and economic stability. That has been achieved over recent years. What is happening in every advanced industrial country is that the number of manufacturing jobs is declining. America and Japan have each lost 3&nbsp;million manufacturing jobs. America has lost 1&nbsp;million manufacturing jobs in the past 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 977</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>two years. That trend is happening right across the world&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry; again, the Conservatives must face up to facts. If America and Japan each lose 3&nbsp;million manufacturing jobs, all advanced industrial economies are affected. What we are trying to do&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman will be interested in this&#151;is to provide greater support for research and development in manufacturing, greater support for the development of new skills, new investment allowances for small businesses and support through the Small Business Service and the regional development agencies. We are trying to help our modern, high skill and high-value-added manufacturing become more competitive across the world. We will continue with that policy, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will support it even if those on the Conservative Front Bench do not find it at all interesting.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51208-01_spnew18"><b> Mrs. Madeleine Moon  (Bridgend)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my right hon. Friend confirm that our economic success is a result of his commitment to the TANSTAAFL principle&#151;&quot;there ain&#039;t no such thing as a free lunch&quot;&#151;and that economic growth comes from investment in jobs, skills, education and communities, not inflation-busting tax cuts?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51208-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Our policy is to invest in both jobs and skills in the economy. At some point, the Conservatives must face up to this issue. If we want employment and modern skills, we must invest in the new deal and education. Their policy to cut &#163;12&nbsp;billion from public expenditure would damage jobs, skills and education.

 (Con): What proportion of the new jobs since 1997&nbsp;are public service jobs? Why will the Chancellor not give the House the current estimate of the public service pension liability that arises from those new jobs and must then be paid for by the private sector?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51208-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman knows that two thirds of the new jobs are in the private sector and that almost 1&nbsp;million jobs have been created in small businesses alone. If he wants to cut public sector jobs, perhaps he should look at his election address, in which he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o4">&quot;I want more money to go to the front line for more nurses, doctors and clinical staff.&quot;</p>

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend recognise how successful the policy of getting down unemployment has been so far, especially in my constituency? Will he give the House some indication of how he intends to take that success further, particularly with skills, so that we can ensure that the jobs that are created in the future for my constituents will be ones that can support families, that are well paid and that are not bumping along the bottom of the labour market?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51208-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps there could be all-party support for the extension of the national employer training programme, which was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 978</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>announced on Monday, to all areas of the country, where employers will get help so that they can train their workers and get time off, with some support for the wage costs in doing so. That new partnership between the Government, employers and employees involves some public money&#151;&#163;47&nbsp;million to help small firms to give time off to their workers. We are prepared to make that public investment. The question is whether the Conservative party is prepared to support the public investment that is necessary for the skills and training that we need in the economy.

<p><a name="qn_o2">3. <a name="51208-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): What estimate he has made of the number of people entitled to claim tax credit who do not do so. [35533]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51208-02_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 Analysis of the number of those entitled but not claiming tax credits is ongoing and will be completed by the end of 2005&#150;06. Initial estimates are that 80&nbsp;per cent. of those entitled to the child tax credit in the first year claimed it. That compares with a take-up of 57&nbsp;per cent. for family credit and 62&nbsp;per cent. for working families tax credit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51208-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her answer. Although it is encouraging that the percentage take-up is improving, does she share my concern that up to a fifth of potential claimants&#151;some of them the most vulnerable members of our society&#151;are not getting to the tax credits to which they are entitled?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="51208-02_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I assure the hon. Gentleman that take-up of tax credit appears to be across the board, particularly focusing on those in the greatest need; for instance, 1.4&nbsp;million receive an average entitlement of &#163;5,795&nbsp;a year. In his constituency, about 8,800&nbsp;families are benefiting from tax credit. Even with take-up of child tax credit as high as it appears to be, it is important that we focus on ensuring that we continue to advertise it and to encourage people who are entitled to apply for it. I hope that he will campaign for that and support tax credit, to ensure that it is welcomed and supported.

 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend will be aware that at the Treasury Committee meeting yesterday we asked her officials for a paper on the implications of the latest changes in tax credits. Although the disregard on earnings from &#163;2,500&nbsp;to &#163;25,000&nbsp;is a huge step forward, will she inform us whether it will be revenue neutral, and before her next appearance before the Committee will she work with her officials to ensure that innovative ways are found to increase that 80&nbsp;per cent. take-up?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="51208-02_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend refers to specific issues and discussions about the package of measures announced on Monday for reform of tax credits, ensuring flexibility but also greater certainty for claimants. He will know that the package as a whole was scored in a particular way in the pre-Budget report statement. I will ensure&#151;I think that my officials gave this undertaking to the Treasury Committee&#151;that a detailed answer specifically on costs is not only made

</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="51208-02_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon.

He will also be aware that at the end of the first year, 2003&#150;04, specific figures, which are being prepared, will indicate the success of the policy in deterring fraud. Because of the announcement, he will be aware that there are specific investigations into fraud against the tax credit system involving the DWP.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="51208-02_spnew7"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The combination of measures through the tax credit system has contributed to about 1.4&nbsp;million children being lifted out of poverty. That is crucial and a central part of the Government&#039;s measures to eradicate child poverty, especially the record level created under the previous Conservative Government. Without the presence of tax credits, should the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) feel tempted to abolish them, as the Conservatives say they will do, we would see a massive rise in child poverty.

At the same time as the announcement on Monday that the disregard of increased pay would be raised so that people earning more than &#163;90,000&nbsp;could continue to receive their tax credits in full for up to 12&nbsp;months, the pre-Budget report showed that the Government intend to spend &#163;200&nbsp;million less on tax credit in 2007&#150;08. If people whose income increases will be better off, and the Government plan to spend less on the total package, who will be worse off?

 I will send the hon. Gentleman another copy of the statement that was released as part of the pre-Budget report that was announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on Monday. Let me help him by reminding him that there were a series of reforms that were in favour of claimants because they made the system more flexible. One part of that was the increase to the disregard. There were reforms to speed up the reporting of changes in circumstances to ensure that it would be less likely that overpayment would

Taken together, they give claimants greater flexibility while reducing the risk of overpayments. That is how the entire package hangs together and how the costings are developed. If the hon.

Two thirds of them are girls, who suffer both from discrimination against girls and the lack of resources for education. The world could come together over the next few years with the fast-track action plan for education to speed up the offer of primary places, in particular, to girls as well as boys.

<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="51208-04_spmin1"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 The Treasury consulted extensively with the industry on the proposed new film tax between July and October this year. The consultation informed the announcements on film tax in the pre-Budget report. They included allowing films costing up to &#163;20&nbsp;million a guaranteed minimum benefit worth 20&nbsp;per cent. of qualifying production costs and a benefit worth 16&nbsp;per cent. for films costing more than &#163;20&nbsp;million. The incentives will be even more valuable for profitable films. That can help achieve our goals for greater sustainability for the British film industry. The industry has warmly welcomed the announcements.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="51208-04_spnew20"><b> Mr. Whittingdale: </b> 
 When I tabled this question, I intended to be critical of the Chancellor, but, in keeping with our new spirit, I warmly welcome the measures that were announced in the pre-Budget report. However, the Minister will be aware that the uncertainty that has surrounded the fiscal arrangements for the industry has already led to some major film productions being made abroad. Will she confirm that the new measures will not be subject to change, so that the industry can now plan ahead with total certainty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="51208-04_spnew21"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s conversion to supporting the Government. In fairness to him, he has taken an interest in assisting the development of the British film industry for a considerable time. I can confirm that the measures will produce a stable regime for the industry, and that they will be effectively targeted to ensure that we support the producers. If the hon. Gentleman has time to look again at the pre-Budget report, he will also see the announcements regarding the transition from the present regime to the new one. Consultations with the&nbsp;industry are still going on, which is important, but there is general agreement that the measures will offer a stable regime to help the development of the industry.

It is, however, almost impossible to anticipate the creativity of the avoidance industry. The film industry has welcomed the proposals, saying that they are the best news in five years. They will ensure the security of the regime. I would say to my hon. Friend, however, as I have said to the industry, that if there are any signs of avoidance, we will clamp down on them immediately.

 (Lab): What assessment he has made of the impact of the level of skills in the work force on the level of employment. [35542]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="51208-05_spmin0"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey): </b> 
 A highly skilled work force is one of the important drivers of economic growth, and people without skills are much less likely to be in employment. The Leitch review of skills, which was published in the interim report on Monday, set out the evidence on the links between work force skills and employment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="51208-05_spnew0"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is never to late to learn new skills, and that, as well as training our young people, we should also provide retraining opportunities for older people, so that they, too, can take advantage of the employment opportunities in the high-skills sectors?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="51208-05_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 I do indeed. When one in six adults do not have the literacy levels of our 11-year-olds, when 5&nbsp;million people in the work force today have no qualifications, and when 70&nbsp;per cent. of our work force of 2020&nbsp;have already left school, the imperative for greater investment in training, particularly for adults, becomes very clear. We must better direct that training to produce the skills that people need and that employers need, and to help people to become more productive at work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="51208-05_spnew2"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister believe that it is the level of skills in the British economy that has caused the continuous rise in unemployment over the past eight or nine months?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o102"><a name="51208-05_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 No. All the evidence suggests that an increase in the level of skills increases people&#039;s employment opportunities. Any Government who were not prepared to invest in the skills of the work force would simply be failing in their duty to equip our companies and our people for the future. Any Government who were prepared to allow spending to grow at a slower rate than the growth in the economy 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 991</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would have to make huge cuts in public spending, and would not be able to support the skills that our economy needed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="51208-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Si&#244;n Simon  (Birmingham, Erdington)</b> 
 (Lab): The Leitch review showed that the total proportion of the work force with skills had risen to 86&nbsp;per cent. Presumably that has something to do with the fact that the number of jobs in the economy has risen by 330,000&nbsp;to a record level&#151;and that, presumably, has something to do with the fact that the level of growth remains positive, as it did not under the Tories. As the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) has made it clear that he does not understand what is going on, can we ensure that I do? Is it possible for the Government to build on all those developments by scrapping the new deal?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o104"><a name="51208-05_spnew5"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The new deal has helped more than 1&nbsp;million people into work, but we must make it a new deal for jobs and skills. The employment prospects of people who can now expect to change jobs seven times during their working lives mean that they will have to train and retrain. Unless we have a skills programme to help our people through the changes that our economy faces increasingly in a global context, we shall fail the future of the country and, more important, the people of the country.

That will bankrupt many regional orchestras, such as the Ulster orchestra.

 I repeat that there have been no recent changes in the application of the rules on national insurance contributions to freelance musicians and singers. The last set of changes occurred in 1998. I do know that, as a result of a compliance check, it has been revealed that some employers have not been paying their class 1&nbsp;national insurance contributions in respect of some musicians and singers. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs is holding discussions with the Association of British Orchestras, the Musicians Union, the Arts Council and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to find out exactly how much may be in question, and how to resolve the issue so that our orchestras can continue to provide a fine service for our community.

It is now five weeks since the resignation of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the reshuffle of the former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but there has still been no appointment. Many people will see that as a major downgrading of the importance of the Cabinet Office, but if it is what the Prime Minister does intend, let it at least be reflected in the business of the House.

In this case, legislation that is widely supported in this House requires that an application be made before a demonstration can be organised. That legislation has worked remarkably well.

In the particular case to which the hon. Gentleman refers&#151;in rather hysterical terms, as ever&#151;such an application was not made. There was no good reason for not making an application, other than simply to challenge the law. There is a strong tradition in western democracy of people seeking to challenge laws with which they disagree, but of course, those people recognise that the consequence of doing so is that they then face criminal penalties.

 May I ask whether it might be possible to have a debate about the way that local authorities close primary schools? In my constituency, Dudley&#039;s Conservative-controlled council plans to close two very good schools, Highfields primary and Sycamore Green. The consultation process has been very unsatisfactory, to say the least. The council has failed to consider any alternatives, such as Sure Start schemes, children&#039;s centres or other community facilities, and it has not even replied to letters and petitions submitted by parents and governors who, together with councillors Ridney, Finch, Davies, Aston, Mottram and Johnson, have fought such a great campaign.

 The right hon. Member will know, given his careful attention to such matters, that the process is a long one.

In the spirit in which the issue has been raised in recent weeks, it is right that right hon. and hon.

That is all set out in the inspector&#039;s report, which I am sure that he has read in detail, and which is about a recommendation from senior police officers that there is a necessity&#151;an absolute requirement&#151;to improve the equipment and facilities available to our police forces across the country, and that must after all be in the interests of our constituents. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will look at the report and contribute to the debate on 19&nbsp;December, when I shall take careful note of whether all the colleagues who called for the debate are in the Chamber to participate, as it is important that Members have the opportunity to set out their views. This process is in the interests of our constituents and to their benefit. That is why leading police officers have put it forward.

 Will the Leader of the House urgently find Government time to address the problems of identity fraud that are occurring throughout the country? Last year, it is estimated that 135,000&nbsp;people had their identity stolen and had to pay up to &#163;8,000&nbsp;to have it legally returned. Will the right hon.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51208-09_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The Government share entirely the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about identity fraud. It is a problem for both the public sector and, crucially, the private sector, which is one of the reasons why the Government are bringing forward proposals for a system of identity cards. So on the next occasion that we debate the matter in the House, I look forward to the hon.

 Will the Leader of the House urgently investigate, or allow a debate on, the guidance and procedures for ministerial travel? The reason for that is that I have twice asked the Prime Minister when he last travelled on the London underground; like me, the Leader of the House will be aware that the matter is of great public interest. The 1997&nbsp;code, item e, &quot;Public Accountability&quot;, states:

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51208-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is referring to guidance issued for judgments made by individual prosecutors in individual cases as to how particular types of offence should be prosecuted. That is always a matter for the discretion of prosecutors and police officers. As I said in answer to an earlier question, it is not right that Ministers should make observations about that type of individual discretion. It is an essential part of our criminal justice process that such discretion lies in the hands of those who exercise it.

Given that meeting the millennium development goals on reducing maternal mortality and child mortality will cost $6&nbsp;billion a year and that the richest nations on earth subsidise their agriculture to the tune of $6&nbsp;billion a week, does the Leader of the House agree that a debate in the House would allow colleagues to argue passionately&#151;as I certainly would, if I caught your eye, Mr. Speaker&#151;that reforming wholesale the socialist subsidy system in international trade is not only fiscally desirable but morally imperative?
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51208-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman regularly raises those issues with considerable effect, and in a way with which, generally, Ministers agree. The Government have taken precisely the type of action he describes. We negotiate vigorously in all international organisations to promote freer trade and justice.

<a name="51208-10_head0"><h3 align=center>Hercules Crash (Board of Inquiry)</h3>

<a name="time_1">
<a name="51208-10_time0"><h5>12.21&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51208-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (John Reid): </b> 
 I am able to inform the House today of the findings of the Royal Air Force board of inquiry into the tragic crash of the RAF Hercules XV179&nbsp;in Iraq on 30&nbsp;January 2005. May I say at the beginning that I very much regret that some of the details appeared in two newspapers this morning? Some information was accurate, some was inaccurate and some was speculative. I apologise to you for that, Mr. Speaker. The only consolation is that the families had already been met and briefed before the reports appeared this morning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">I first pay tribute to the 10&nbsp;service personnel who tragically lost their lives aboard the Hercules while carrying out their duties: Flight Lieutenant David Stead, Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel, Flight Lieutenant Andrew Smith, Master Air Engineer Gary Nicholson, Flight Sergeant Mark Gibson, Chief Technician Richard Brown, Sergeant Robert O&#039;Connor, Corporal David Williams, Lance Corporal Steven Jones and Squadron Leader Patrick Marshall. I am immensely proud of our armed forces and the work that they undertake on our behalf, as I am sure the whole House is. This was the biggest single loss of life in a single incident to enemy action in Iraq. Those 10&nbsp;brave men lost their lives while working in support of the coalition operation in Iraq. We owe them, and all the other personnel who daily confront danger, our respect and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">We must not forget the families and friends of those men. I am sure that the House will join me in offering our sympathy and deepest condolences. The Ministry of Defence, the Royal Air Force and RAF Lyneham, especially, continue to provide those families and friends with support while they come to terms with the tragedy. I recognise that the board of inquiry report will be painful reading for them, but I hope that they will take some comfort in finding answers to the many questions that arise after such an incident. I felt it important that the families were given time to prepare for the inevitable media interest, so they were briefed by an RAF team yesterday on the conclusions of the board of inquiry. Notwithstanding the prerogative of the House to be informed about such an event, I hope that everyone understands and supports the steps that were taken to inform the families first. They will be able to rely on the support of their friends and colleagues in the Army and the RAF, both formally and informally, for as long as they need it. I also pay tribute to RAF Lyneham. Its close community was hit very hard indeed by the tragedy, yet it managed to maintain its magnificent support for our deployed forces, both at the time of the crash and subsequently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">Turning now to the report itself, I remind hon. Members that the purpose of a board of inquiry is to establish the circumstances of a crash and to learn lessons. It does not seek to apportion blame. The board of inquiry was convened the day after the event, on 31&nbsp;January, and has considered a mass of evidence. The board established that, on 30&nbsp;January 2005, an RAF Hercules C-130K took off from Baghdad at 13:24&nbsp;Greenwich mean time en route to Balad, which is to the north of Baghdad, on a routine operational passenger and freight flight. Six minutes later, at 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1010</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>13:30&nbsp;GMT, a radio message was received from the crew stating that the aircraft was on fire. At 13:55, the Hercules was confirmed as missing&#151;that was the time of its expected arrival at Balad. At 14:15, the crash site was found by a US helicopter formation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_31">On our behalf, US forces established a cordon around the crash scene and maintained it for as long as it was considered safe to do so. They did that at risk to themselves, and I am very grateful to them. The board of inquiry was convened and took on the task of recovering the bodies of the deceased and examining the aircraft wreckage for evidence. I commend the professionalism and dedication of all those involved in that difficult and harrowing work. The task had to be completed as swiftly as possible because of the ever-present threat of hostile attack. Much of the wreckage could not be retrieved in the time available before the cordon was lifted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_32">Despite the loss of physical evidence, the lack of credible witnesses close to the crash site and the absence of an accident data recorder, the board of inquiry has nevertheless conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation. The board examined all possible causes, eliminated those not supported by the available evidence and then thoroughly analysed the remainder until the most likely cause was identified. Throughout the process, the board was assisted by other agencies, including a senior air accident investigator from the air&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accidents investigation branch&#151;the AAIB&#151;of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department for Transport. The experienced investigator independently investigated the crash in parallel with the board and his findings fully support those of the board. Furthermore, the AAIB investigator has stated that he was impressed by the approach adopted by the RAF team given the exceptionally difficult circumstances of the investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_33">On 7&nbsp;March, my predecessor&#151;now the Leader of the House&#151;made a written statement to the House about the inquiry&#039;s interim findings. The interim statement ruled out a number of possible causes for the crash. After exhaustive analysis, the board of inquiry has concluded that the aircraft crashed because it became uncontrollable after hostile ground-to-air fire caused the outboard right-hand wing to explode and separate from the aircraft. The crash was not survivable. The board identified three contributory factors: flying at low level in daylight made the aircraft vulnerable to some types of ground-to-air fire; the lack of a fuel tank inerting system in the wing fuel tank meant that it was possible for an explosive fuel-air mixture to develop; and the flow of intelligence information regarding ground-to-air fire was not as robust as it might have been.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_34">I remind the House that the purpose of the inquiry in identifying those factors is to learn for the future, rather than to apportion any blame. The board made a number of recommendations that we will study closely. We have, indeed, acted on many of them already. During the course of the inquiry, as the findings were emerging, the commander-in-chief of RAF Strike Command instigated a number of steps. C-130&nbsp;tactics have been reviewed and low-level flying in daylight is now avoided wherever possible. However, it has not been prohibited as it can sometimes be the safest way of achieving an operational objective. We need to allow operational commanders in theatre the flexibility to choose the safest effective tactics to achieve their mission. The fitting of a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1011</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fuel tank inerting system is being investigated as a matter of urgency and we have made changes to our ground-to-air fire reporting and dissemination system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_35">Now that the board of inquiry has concluded, the full contents of the report will be thoroughly considered and acted on as appropriate. While we have to accept that any deployment of UK troops involves a degree of risk&#151;sometimes considerable risk&#151;the security of British servicemen and women deployed to Iraq and elsewhere remains our highest priority. We owe it to our personnel to do everything we can to ensure their safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_36">This is a very comprehensive report. A military aircraft accident summary will be placed in the Library of the House and on the internet site of the Ministry of Defence. In addition, a redacted version of the main body of the board of inquiry report will be available on our internet site. As the House will appreciate, the safety of our people is a principal consideration and we have rightly removed from the report any information that might endanger the security or capability of UK and coalition personnel or that might be of use to an enemy. That is the purpose of the redaction. For example, we have, for operational reasons, removed the detail of the exact weapon type used against the Hercules. To divulge that information might give the insurgents what they need to replicate the attack. It would be unhelpful to our forces and our coalition partners for the media to speculate on the weapon deployed. That is not a theoretical risk; it is very real. We have, however, tried to be as open as possible under all the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_37">Our forces have made a significant contribution to the creation of the right conditions for wider peace and stability in Iraq. They have done, and continue to do, an excellent job in difficult conditions. Our deepest sympathies go out to those who have lost loved ones or who have been injured in operations. I can only speak in the highest terms of the qualities of all personnel who serve, and have served, there&#151;qualities that I know from my own visits and discussions with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_38">In conclusion, therefore, the board of inquiry into the crash of Hercules XV179&nbsp;is now complete. I repeat my gratitude to the president of the board and his team for their painstaking work. I am sure that the House will join me once again in expressing deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims of this tragic incident. We must never forget, nor will we ever forget or underestimate the courage and professionalism of our service personnel in carrying out the tasks required of them.

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51208-11_spnew0"><b> Dr. Liam Fox  (Woodspring) (Con):</b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. We welcome the results of the inquiry and its thorough nature. We will study its conclusions in great detail. On behalf of the Opposition, may I again send our sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed in this tragic incident?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">It is true that such tragedies are unavoidable in warfare, so we pay tribute to the bravery and professionalism of all our armed forces involved in the Iraq conflict. It is worth reiterating and remembering why they are there, and why they are making those sacrifices. They are doing so to help the people of Iraq

<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1012</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_40">I agree that it is not appropriate for the House to ask detailed operational questions that could compromise the safety of our troops, but the families of the crew, Hercules passengers and the British public more widely will have concerns with which the Secretary of State may wish to deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_41">There are four specific areas of concern. How many similar incidents were identified before this particular one involving British or American forces in Iraq or Afghanistan, and what changes were implemented as a result? On alterations to aircraft, the Secretary of State said that the fitting of a fuel tank inerting system was being looked at as a matter of urgency. What time scale does that involve? I entirely understand and agree that it would be inappropriate&#151;in fact, dangerous&#151;to speculate on the type of weaponry involved but, without giving details that might compromise the safety of our forces, can he tell us how widespread is the availability of such weaponry and what is its origin?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_42">Finally, the Secretary of State said that the flow of intelligence information on ground-to-air fire was not as robust as it could be. Does that mean that, on that occasion, intelligence about the specific threat in the area was available but not passed to the flight crew? That would indeed be a tragedy. Fatalities are inevitable in armed conflict, but the House looks to the Government to minimise the risk to our brave and professional armed forces.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51208-11_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments, and congratulate him on his new post. This is not the first time that we have shared views across the Dispatch Box, but I know of his commitment to his country and I am sure that that will be reflected in his&nbsp;commitment to the armed forces. I only regret that his first appearance at the Dispatch Box is marked by such a sombre subject. I thank him for the way in which he phrased his questions and for his recognition that we cannot be as open about everything as we are required to be on other subjects. I thank him, too, for the tributes that he paid to the armed forces and for his reminder of the purpose that brings us to Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas, as well as the high ideals that motivate that purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">The hon. Gentleman asked several legitimate and important questions, including how many similar incidents had taken place. Ground-to-air fire incidents are quite frequent. In the previous 18&nbsp;months or so in Iraq, there were over 800&nbsp;such incidents, none of which resulted in a tragedy of these proportions. In a sense, therefore, there was an element of chance or bad luck on this occasion. That casts light on other questions, such as why an inerting system was not fitted to the C-130K. Until relatively recently, the Hercules was not routinely deployed to areas of such danger. It has been used on specific occasions, but it has not been routinely deployed as a transport plane, although that has become more frequent after 11&nbsp;September and the events in Afghanistan and Iraq. There has been a wide range of incidents in which Hercules and other planes have been fired on, but never with this result until now. That is one of the reasons that we carry out such investigations. I will comment on two local incidents in the context of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s important last question.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1013</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_44">On the time scale for reviewing whether we should have a new system that would have assisted, that will be done as urgently as is possible. I discussed matters this morning with the Chief of the Air Staff and I know that some recommendations about the tactics have already been put in place and that urgent consideration will be given to whether measures should be fitted to the wings and fuel tanks to suppress the possibility of such an incident happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_45">The RAF goes to great lengths to fit defensive suites of arrangements. The C-130K is the older version of the Hercules, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it has been updated already with such defensive suites as directional infrared counter-measures, missile approach warning systems, radar warning receivers, counter-measures dispensing systems, flight deck armour and a series of other modifications. I would not want anyone to believe that sufficient attention was not paid to these matters. A considerable range of defensive suites have been added, but this is the first example of such an incident happening. The RAF will therefore consider the matter urgently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_46">The hon. Gentleman asked whether I could give any indication of the ground-to-air weaponry, without being specific. The indications are that a range of weaponry may have been used against the aircraft. That is precisely why I do not want to be specific about which one might have caused the explosion. Given that a range of weaponry was apparently used, the answer to his question about how widely available such weapons are in Iraq is that they are pretty widely available&#151;the types of weapon that were used, though not necessarily the type of weapon, which I do not want to indicate, that may perchance have been successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">The hon. Gentleman asked about the flow of information. What appears to have happened is that there were two attacks in roughly the same area that day against United States helicopters. They occurred within 1&nbsp;km and 3&nbsp;km of where the attack on the Hercules took place. This information&#151;which was collated within about three hours of the flight, so there was not a great deal of time in any case to pass such information to the pilots and crew of the Hercules&#151;nevertheless did not reach them because the route of the Hercules was not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known to the Americans. There was a compartmentalisation of information as regards the Hercules precisely for security reasons. On a need-to-know basis, there was no need for the multinational forces outside our own preparations for the deployment of the Hercules to know of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_48">That was done for security reasons. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better in terms of risk had that compartmentalisation not taken place on that occasion. However, the House should understand why it was done at the time. Even if the information had been available to the crew and pilots before they took off, it may not have changed their decision to proceed. It may or may not have affected the route that they took, but in any case the balance of risk involved was such that, in general terms, the fewer people who know about a particular route, the smaller the risk is considered to be.
</p>

<a name="stpa_50">Finally, the hon. Gentleman referred to the tactic of low flying. As I said in my statement, that is being reviewed. Daylight low flying is not being prohibited, because there is a balance of risk. On a short journey, if the normal trajectory rising to a given height and then coming down constitutes almost all the activity, the exposure to certain types of ground-to-air fire becomes greater and far riskier than if the aircraft were flying at a low level, which is why on that occasion that method of travel&#151;low level covering flat ground&#151;was chosen. Nevertheless, that can open up another risk, as we have seen. It re-emphasises the singular point that in an operational theatre such as Iraq, there is no risk-free flying, which is a testimony to the courage of our soldiers.

 I thank the Secretary of State for the advance copy of his statement. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches join him in his expressions of sympathy and condolence to the families of those who lost their lives in this tragic incident. The loss of any life in conflict is to be regretted, but he will know, as I do from my constituents&#039; interests, that when several people from one military base die in a single incident the impact is much greater. I also join him in paying tribute to the military authorities in the UK for all the support they are giving to the families of those who lost their lives, and also to the American personnel in Iraq for all their support and bravery at the scene of the crash.

<a name="stpa_51">The Secretary of State drew attention to the fact that the board of inquiry undertook an exhaustive analysis and produced a comprehensive report containing a number of recommendations. He mentioned that some of those had already been acted upon. It would not be appropriate to press any of those issues too strongly today&#151;there should be other ways of doing that away from the full glare of publicity&#151;but can he give an assurance that, bearing in mind how exhaustive the analysis has been and how comprehensive the report is, all those recommendations will be implemented as soon as possible?

 Yes, I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, with one little caveat. The people who are best placed to make the final decision about prioritisation of the recommendations are the Royal Air Force. I discussed the matter this morning with the Chief of the Air Staff, who will be handling all press inquiries today, as is appropriate on such a subject, rather than a politician. I know that he will give the matter the urgency that is required.

I spent the afternoon with the families and remain scarred by that experience. However, I know that the families will be glad that this announcement has been made before Christmas, which will be difficult for them, and I am sure that they will welcome the fact that the Secretary of State chose to brief them before today&#039;s statement, which was sensible and proper.

 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s words are apposite. I know that he has provided assistance and support to families both in this specific case and over many years.

Once the incident occurred, the aeroplane became uncontrollable&#151;it could not have been controlled once it was hit, and the wing was severed after the explosion. I thank the hon.

 It is wise that the RAF and the MOD have not prohibited this kind of flying. It is important that the response is measured and we should not introduce so much protection that people cannot do what is required. Will the Secretary of State ensure that the flow of intelligence continues to go upwards towards those in the air? Although one can understand why a particular flight path is not given to those on the ground, the flow of information should be faster when incidents occur.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51208-12_spnew4"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment and for both of his points. Although we are now aware of a nuance in the balance of risk, it does not mean that there is a risk-free route for such operations, which is why we have not reacted by immediately banning tactical low flying, even during the day. We are aware of the risk and will try to avoid low flying, but it is up to the commanders in theatre and the pilots themselves to decide whether they want to use that tactic. As I have said, there are risks in taking the normal trajectory on a short flight, which exposes people to greater risk for a greater part of such journeys.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_58">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about intelligence flow and the appreciation of aspects of intelligence by those who fly. While maintaining a degree of security of information to protect the operations of those who fly, we are trying to bridge the gap between the collection and dissemination of information to people who will appreciate what it means for their flying and for the risks attached to their flying. We are trying to improve the bridge between the collection of information, whether by ourselves or by others, and its dissemination to those who can judge it appropriately. Those skilled and trained professionals had a pre-deployment briefing and considered all the aspects of the information that was at their disposal. For reasons that I have already explained, the aspect about incidents in the area was not at their disposal.

<a name="51208-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">I understand that we cannot discuss lots of details today for operational reasons and because of the sensitivities. Does the rest of the Hercules fleet, and particularly the C-130H and J aircraft, have fuel tank inerting systems, which would make our servicemen around the world safer? The Secretary of State may be considering fitting the C-130K with such a system.

<br>&nbsp;<br>filled theatre, such as Basra or Baghdad. Those of us who have put on body armour, put out the lights and flown at night at an angle of descent that is calculated to terrify most people outside the RAF while swerving, understand the risks inherent in such operations. We often forget that such flights are daily occurrences. That particular crew had already flown perhaps four times between Balad and Baghdad before the tragic incident occurred, and they had flown day-in, day-out since their deployment two or three weeks before the incident. Most of the crew were very experienced: between them, they had 19&nbsp;operational deployments, so they were people who got on with the job as a matter of course and took those risks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">The hon. Gentleman asked why a fire suppressant system was not fitted to the C-130&nbsp;and what the position is on the other aircraft. As he knows, the K variant was first developed and built in the 1960s, when that technology was not available. Systems to upgrade the aircraft are now available and we are examining as a matter of urgency whether the technology can be successfully fitted to our aircraft. I must repeat my earlier point that, before the incident, the C-130&nbsp;Hercules was not thought to be particularly vulnerable to that form of attack. We now know that it in certain circumstances it can be very vulnerable.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_62">We shall examine this as a matter of urgency. I merely point out that it is not always an easy thing to do. A data recorder, for instance, can be fitted relatively easily into a modern digitised cockpit, but the C-130K was built in the 1960s. Although we can put in a lot of defensive aids, it is not that easy to put in a data recorder where there are multi-faceted, sometimes clockwork, indicators and no central terminal from which to draw the information. There may be difficulties, but we are considering it as a matter of urgency.

<a name="51208-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">My question concerns the search and rescue capability of our forces in theatre. I note from the statement that the last radio message was at 13.30&nbsp;and that the crash site was not discovered until 45&nbsp;minutes later. Is it the procedure that search and rescue missions are launched before aircraft are formally reported missing; and do British armed forces have their own independent search and rescue capability in theatre?
</p>








<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51208-13_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Let me go through the chronology for the hon. Gentleman, and then I shall answer his question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_64">The Hercules took off at 13:24&nbsp;GMT. Iraqi local time was about three hours in advance, but I shall use GMT. Six minutes after taking off, the crew relayed the information that there was a fire on the plane. Some of this morning&#039;s press reports said that the plane had been enveloped in flames. That is not accurate, but, as we now know, there was a fire on board on the right-hand wing. That information was picked up not by an air traffic controller, but by other British forces. There was no communication subsequently. At 13:55&nbsp;GMT, which was the expected arrival time at Balad, the aircraft was officially declared missing. There were a number of eyewitnesses, but they were a fair distance&#151;some kilometres&#151;away. In addition, there were United States forces in the area, who, after looking for the site, discovered it 20&nbsp;minutes later at 14:15&nbsp;GMT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">I understand that that is the precise chronology. It has been explained to me that the message at 13:30&nbsp;was not picked up by an air traffic controller, so there may have been a slight delay. I emphasise, however, that it is the strong and unanimous view of the board of inquiry, under Wing Commander John Reid, that following the incident the aeroplane was uncontrollable. Whatever happened after the time at which it was hit, the explosion separated the wing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">Whatever had happened as regards search and rescue, assistance or aid would not have averted what ultimately, tragically, transpired. After that, there was nothing that the crew could do, highly skilled and highly trained though they were. They were put in a position whereby nothing would have prevented the plane crashing in the way that it did.

 On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Today&#039;s ruling by the Law Lords that information obtained by foreign countries through torture cannot be used in evidence in British courts is of enormous importance. Have Ministers made any requests to make a statement on this important issue? If not, will you use your good offices to impress upon the Government the importance of having it discussed in the House of Commons?
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51208-13_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b> 
 I have no knowledge of such a statement being made, but the points that the right hon. Gentleman makes are now on the record, and no doubt everybody concerned will have noted them.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I wish to raise the issue of the increasing tendency of Northern Ireland Ministers to avoid coming to the House to make important policy announcements. I refer in particular to the written ministerial statement issued on Wednesday of this week by the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith), who is responsible for education in Northern Ireland. The announcement had already been made to the press and the public in Northern Ireland on the previous day, and it was reported at length in all the media, including the newspapers, on Wednesday morning. Is it not a grave discourtesy to Members of this House that a statement was not made on the day on which the announcement was made to the media and the public?
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51208-13_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>

During Prime Minister&#039;s questions on 30&nbsp;November, the Prime Minister indicated, as recorded in column 264&nbsp;of the <i>Official Report</i>, that from the end of November there will be a six-month maximum waiting time for an NHS operation. On 1&nbsp;December, 437&nbsp;patients at my local hospital had been waiting for more than six months. This morning, I received a letter from the Secretary of State for Health in which she states that the maximum six-month wait is only a target and in any case does not come in until the end of 2005. Can I have some advice and guidance on how the Prime Minister&#039;s statement could be corrected?

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As I am sure you are aware, in the past few weeks there have been several false fire alarms in Portcullis House. On Tuesday, when three were going off, large numbers of members of staff, members of the public and Members had to leave the building through the front entrance. There are specialised fire doors there, and as a former fireman I know what should happen: the revolving doors should automatically swing open so that we can get people out as safely as possible. Those doors were inoperative on Tuesday. When I approached the excellent security staff, they told me that that has been reported several times but nothing has been done. Do we have to wait for people to be injured getting in and out before those doors are fixed?

 First, I declare an interest in that I am currently a lay member of the General Medical Council and it is mentioned with other regulatory bodies and related associate bodies once in the report. I should put that on the record. This is my maiden speech as Chair of the Health Committee and the attendance resembles that for my maiden speech in 1983.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">The Committee&#039;s report on the influence of the pharmaceutical industry raised questions about how it is regulated and how it regulates itself. As hon. Members know, the pharmaceutical industry is the third most important United Kingdom industry economically after tourism and finance. The report acknowledged its valuable contribution to patient health and the economy. Although I shall mention some problems and some hon. Members might view the industry negatively, I shall put the debate in context by reminding hon. Members of the Health Committee&#039;s first conclusion in its report. Paragraph 336&nbsp;states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;The UK-based pharmaceutical industry is large, profitable and highly competitive; it has understandably been described as &#039;world class and a jewel in the crown of the UK economy&#039;. The industry has an outstanding record in developing new medicines, and is a major source of funding of medical research. The industry&#039;s products include many life-saving and important drugs which greatly benefit many people and contribute substantially to national health.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">That is absolutely right. Although I am about to say, &quot;however&quot;, that paragraph places the industry in the context in which we should all view it: its contribution to the nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">However, the Committee had several concerns about medical research, the conduct of clinical trials, medicines marketing, the information provided to patients and prescribers and the independence of the regulatory system. Overriding themes of the report included the lack of transparency in medicines research and regulation, and the potential effect of that on patient safety.

 I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his introductory remarks. He is absolutely right to place the debate in the context of the world-wide demand for pharmaceutical produces. Is not it the case that Britain can hold its head up and be proud of its contribution to improving people&#039;s health around the world?
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="51208-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 That is correct&#151;and in doing so, the amount of money that the industry makes in exporting around the world substantially enhances our economy. That is good for all.

<a name="51208-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_70">Patient safety is paramount in the use of drugs in this country and it goes to the heart of the Committee&#039;s report. If a patient is prescribed one drug rather than another, similar drug, the negative effect on the patient is likely to be minimal. If, however, a patient is prescribed a drug that is linked with negative physical effects of which the doctor is not aware, the results may be far more serious. The regulators, industry and health care professionals have a role to play in ensuring that potential side effects are picked up early in drug testing, made known to doctors and monitored after licensing.

The yellow card system of reporting ADRs is now being rolled out to include patients and all health care professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, health visitors etc. Previously, only doctors could report suspected drug side effects. Pilot schemes were already running at the time the report was published and final systems will be in place by 2006. A new IT system will improve the detection of signals of a problem with a particular medicine.

 It has come to light that one of the problems is repeat prescription provision, especially in the care of the elderly, particularly those with dementia. Although they initially get the right drugs, the repeat prescriptions do not necessarily help them and, indeed, have a negative effect. There is no proper procedure for reviewing those prescriptions at least every six months.
</p>








<p><a name="st_106"><a name="51208-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 Repeat prescriptions are sometimes numerically limited so that one has one, four or five out of six. After that, it is doctors&#039; clinical responsibility to ensure that they see the patient before any further prescribing of the drug. However, what happens in the real world is not always consistent with that. Occasionally, that is at great cost to the individual concerned, but it is always at great cost to everyone because safety incidents cost the NHS approximately &#163;2&nbsp;billion a year in bed days in our acute sector. They are problems for clinicians and everyone.

We need that information to determine certain interactions, perhaps with public health promotion or with people getting assistance in the acute sector. We need to determine whether any great changes have taken place in the level of use of certain families of drugs over the years. We need a big national picture of the use of those drugs in society, because this relates to the money that we, as taxpayers, spend&#151;and the taxpayers&#039; money that the Department of Health spends&#151;to try to improve the nation&#039;s health.

<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1025</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food and Drug Administration in America has claimed that there were 144,000&nbsp;cases of heart attacks and strokes due to the use of Vioxx. However, in answer to a parliamentary question asking how many bad reactions had been discovered here under the yellow card system, I was told that there were never more than half a dozen a year, and that they amounted to no more than 12. There is evidence of 4&nbsp;million prescriptions for medicines of this type being prescribed, and if America had not discovered the terrible, fatal side-effects of Vioxx, we would still be using it, and British patients would still be being killed by it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51208-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 Vioxx is an issue for everyone here, and the Health Committee asked for a public inquiry into the matter, saying that when a drug is withdrawn in the way that Vioxx was, there should be a public inquiry. The Government did not agree, and I have to say that I have some sympathy with the Government on that. However, the public should have more information on the way in which the drug was licensed and came into use, so that they can be satisfied that we understand the issues surrounding it. My hon. Friend mentioned half a dozen cases. He will be aware that there is the potential for litigation on this matter either in this country or the United States. Reports in <i>The Lancet</i> have put the number of cases in this country of people who have been affected long-term in relation to taking Vioxx at far higher than half a dozen. Perhaps my hon.

The Committee&#039;s proposal for maintenance of the register by an entirely independent body was rejected, as was the recommendation that information regarding clinical trials be available at drug launch, so that prescribers could access information during the period when the promotion of a new medicine was at its most concentrated.

If that were to happen, the terms of reference would remain to be decided. I remind the House that the terms of reference should consider methodology, timing and other issues. If the Government adopt that approach, as I think they should, it would be useful if there were a parliamentary input into exactly what the terms of reference should be, either on the Floor of the House or at least from the Health Committee.

That issue was not covered in the Government&#039;s response, but I believe that it is a very good idea. On a daily basis in clinical trials, consultants and doctors throughout the country, working alongside the pharmaceutical industry, give advice about what is happening within the NHS. We do not know much about it, as it is not often discussed, but most drugs are developed in situ in our hospitals and sometimes in the primary sector. The more collaborative we can make the process, the better. We want people to have confidence in NICE and what it

<a name="stpa_104">I have brought up many issues in my speech and I am sure that hon. Members who were Select Committee members at the time will have further issues to debate. The investigation into the pharmaceutical industry&#151;the first since 1914&#151;was wide ranging. I am pleased that the Government responded well in certain respects, but they could have made a fuller response in other respects. My final comment&#151;to the Minister, hon. Members or anyone else who is listening to or reading the debate&#151;is that the Health Committee will be looking into the developments emerging from this report and response for many years to come.

 I should like to declare an interest in that I have a slight cold at the moment, so I am probably benefiting from some pharmaceutical products.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_105">Today&#039;s debate comes off the back of a report from the Health Committee that was released in 2005&#151;just ahead of the general election, but before the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) became Chairman of the Select Committee and before my time in Parliament. Although the report listed a series of concerns and made a series of recommendations, it carefully highlighted the importance of the pharmaceutical industry to our economy. That importance is well understood by Members, because, in some cases, literally thousands of their constituents are employed by that industry. We know that the pharmaceutical industry&#039;s contribution to the nation&#039;s economy is ranked third only to tourism and finance. We also know that investment made by UK pharmaceutical companies represents 65&nbsp;per cent. of health-related research and development in the UK, and 10&nbsp;per cent. of global research and development expenditure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_106">The industry makes such a marked contribution to the economy because the development and production of drugs has truly revolutionised our lives. The discovery, development and use of drugs has had a revolutionary effect on our lifestyle, life expectancy and our ability to cure and to cope with illness. About 650&nbsp;million prescriptions are issued each year at a cost of &#163;7&nbsp;billion to the NHS. Today, it is increasingly believed&#151;I share that belief&#151;that for every ill we suffer, there is a pill that we can pop to cure it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_107">Despite recognising the important and revolutionary contribution of the pharmaceutical industry, the report highlighted a series of concerns that ultimately stem from the fact that certain issues have been ignored for nearly 100&nbsp;years and from the imbalanced approach that the Government have adopted to the pharmaceutical industry on the one side and the patient on the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_108">As we have already heard, allegations were made about badly designed and biased clinical trials&#151;trials biased towards showing drugs in the best possible light. There is evidence of selective publication of evidence relating to those trials, in which the negative evidence was not made public or full data sets were not published. Allegations were also made about ghost-writing, with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1031</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the names of third-party so-called &quot;independent&quot; academics being added to papers not authored by them. Sometimes their names were added, but they did not have full access to the full data sets on which the reports were based.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_109">Finally, the report highlighted the ever-increasing intensity of the promotion of new drugs that provides incentives for prescribers that are totally unrelated to health outcomes. Press coverage referred to incentives that ranged from winning an iPod if a drug is prescribed to entertaining nurses and doctors at very nice hotels or restaurants. There were justifiable concerns that such practices could end up having a negative impact on patient outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_110">One problem is the fact that NICE licensing relies on published evidence, but we have already seen that the full data sets are not always published. If negative evidence is not made available, surely NICE is being constrained in its ability to make evidence-based decisions. There are concerns that the lack of an evidence base could lead to the unsafe use of drugs, and that the level of brand awareness has resulted in extension beyond appropriate prescription because of pressures from patients and prescribers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_111">In response to these concerns, the Select Committee recommendations centred around the need for transparency in the licensing process, for greater independence of assessment, and for greater research into the potentially adverse effects of prescribed drugs, given that up to 5&nbsp;per cent. of hospital admissions are the result of adverse reaction to drugs. Its final recommendation was as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;In view of the failings of the MHRA, we recommend a fundamental review of the organisation in order to ensure that safe and effective medicines, with necessary prescribing constraints, are licensed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_112">So the Committee felt that there needs to be much greater balance between promoting the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, and promoting the health of the public and the effectiveness of the NHS. It was felt that those recommendations would help to redress that imbalance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_113">Unfortunately, in many respects the Government&#039;s response, published in September this year, reflects the perpetuation of this imbalance. Many of the recommendations were not acted on, and in many cases the justification given was that the Government did not recognise or acknowledge the problem identified by the Health Committee report. They said that current guidelines and measures are already, or are about to be put, in place to deal with these problems. The result is that the fundamental balance between the patient and the industry has not shifted, although some welcome concessions have been made to improve the MRHA&#039;s marketing material.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_114">The industry itself has also sought to improve its practices. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry recently issued new guidelines to help encourage best practice. These are voluntary guidelines that represent a gold standard; they are not backed up by the law. While the ultimate sanction for breaking the code is expulsion from the ABPI, that has never 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1032</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>happened. The board has never required a company to publish a corrective statement for a breach of those guidelines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_115">Some of these guidelines are rather vague. For example, although delegates sponsored by companies to attend meetings can travel there and back only on economy flights and must not stay in &quot;lavish&quot; accommodation, it is not clear what is meant by that or what the extent of their stay will be. Of course, many companies will follow these guidelines for reasons of reputation, but the fact is that if they are voluntary, they ultimately lack teeth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_116">Recent evidence in the press indicates that such problems are still arising. However, they are being dealt with by the MRHA on a case-by-case basis, without any significant strategic or systemic changes being made. A piece in last Sunday&#039;s edition of <i>The Observer</i> refers to allegations of ghost-writing; the academic concerned apparently did not have full access to the data sets that the report put his name to. As I have said before, evidence emerged last month of perks for prescribers. They could win an iPod if they prescribed gum disease medication, and some doctors and nurses were entertained at the Groucho club.
</p>








<p><a name="st_124"><a name="51208-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Walker  (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> 
 Am I not right in thinking that the new ABPI code of conduct specifically limits the maximum value of these awards and gifts to &#163;6&nbsp;excluding VAT?
</p>








<p><a name="st_125"><a name="51208-17_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I was not aware of that. I am not sure how the ABPI could provide flights to and from seminars at that low value, even given the existence of some very low-cost carriers. There may still be some devil in the detail and of course this code remains voluntary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="51208-17_spnew3"><b> Paul Flynn </b> 
: The new code of practice is entirely cosmetic and has been described by the British Medical Association as lacking teeth. The <i>Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin</i> describes it as fundamentally weak in all respects. It is purely window-dressing to hide the drugs industry&#039;s continuing close collaboration with the MHRA, which has been so detrimental to patients.
</p>








<p><a name="st_127"><a name="51208-17_spnew4"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns, but of course, although the problems associated with patient safety and access to drugs can in some respects be dealt with through improved regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, that is not the sole determinant. It is clear that the Government&#039;s behaviour has had a significant impact, and stories in the media have a fundamental impact on the public&#039;s awareness of drugs. Moreover, the Government have a major influence on the ability to get new drugs to patients quickly.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_117">We have heard much this afternoon about NICE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blight and the delays in the licensing programme, but to what extent are those delays due to NICE? My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) recently tabled written parliamentary questions on this issue, and the answers show that it takes the Government nine to 10&nbsp;months to produce the list of drugs that is subsequently sent to NICE for licensing approval. That is another part 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1033</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the delay in getting drugs to patients who may need them as quickly as possible. I should be grateful if the Minister explained the reasons for this delay and what measures his Department are implementing to speed up the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_118">There is also the apparently contradictory position whereby drugs need to be licensed by NICE before they become widely available, yet in some cases&#151;such as the recent and well-known one involving Herceptin&#151;statements have been made implying that there should be widespread uptake before the licensing process has been completed. What assessment has the Minister&#039;s Department made of the immediate and long-term financial implications of making such drugs available? On Herceptin, we know that it is not a question simply of the cost of the drug; there are also costs associated with echocardiograms and ongoing monitoring. Herceptin will of course make a huge difference to some women with early-stage breast cancer, but how do the Government envisage that these costs should be met, given the existing pressures on many budgets? The cost of such drugs is only rising, so what is the long-term sustainability of their prescription? There is a real concern that post-2008, when the increase in NHS funding tails off, funding for many such drugs will experience a hard landing.

: We have not heard the hon. Lady&#039;s proposal on Herceptin. On the face of it, Herceptin has significant beneficial effects as disclosed in clinical trials, but a licence application has yet to be made in respect of it. In France, there is explicit recognition that in certain circumstances, certain drugs can provisionally be made available for use, pending licensing and approval. Is that not the right mechanism? If not, what does the hon. Lady propose?
</p>








<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51208-18_spnew1"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 It is of course important to make such drugs available as quickly as possible, but certain systemic problems have been highlighted, such as NICE blight. We need to take steps to prevent such exceptions from having to be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_120">Finally, given moves to increase the transparency of data relating to clinical trials, why do negotiations with the Treasury on the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme take place in such deep secrecy? Do the Department plan to make this process more open?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_121">I turn finally to other potential dangers and difficulties for patients&#151;

: I thank the hon. Lady for giving way before she moves to her final, final point. She focused on costs, but does she agree that although the work that NICE does is very important, it is also important that it be done quickly? In many cases, it is a matter of life and death as to whether or not a particular drug gets to the patient quickly. Does she also share my concern at the fact that, rather than the budget increasing, it has just been reduced by &#163;3.5&nbsp;million? That will surely cause more problems than even the difficulties relating to Herceptin.
</p>








<p><a name="st_131"><a name="51208-18_spnew3"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Gentleman is right. What will happen once the funding structure changes and what the impact will be on the availability of certain drugs are important issues to consider.

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_122">Reference has already been made to the shift to cheaper generic drugs and the practice of drugs bought in other EU countries being repackaged and relabelled through parallel trading. In both cases, I understand that while the medication itself remains the same&#151;I have discussed the matter with an hon. Friend who is a pharmacist&#151;excipients such as additives for colour might change or vary in the medication. That can cause unfortunate side effects, particularly in the case of epilepsy drugs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51208-18_spnew4"><b> Dr. Iddon: </b> 
 I must challenge that statement. Evidence was given at a meeting in the House last night that packages of parallel traded products contained drugs that were not the same as the drugs made by the professional company that had discovered them. Such products contained impurities that could cause serious side effects and in some cases death in the patient.
</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51208-18_spnew5"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point. I was just coming to that. The issue is not simply a question of different additives that might be used in different countries, but the possibility that such trade might be a soft underbelly for the counterfeit trade. There have been examples of counterfeits, such as those for Viagra, Cialis and Reductil, entering the legitimate supply chain, as the hon. Gentleman said. That is a significant cause of concern, and action to counteract it is outside the strict regulation of the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">The extent to which the Government truly appreciate the scale of this problem is also an issue. Recent answers to questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam reveal that the Government have made no estimates of the level of counterfeit medicines circulating in the legitimate supply chain and available on the internet. If they have made no estimate of the scale of the problem, how can they deal with it properly?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_124">Further problems include the possible misprescribing of medication due to lack of training. Not all the problems lie at the foot of the pharmaceutical industry, but we have heard plenty of evidence this afternoon that more effective regulation of the industry will help to establish a clear balance&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51208-18_spnew6"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 I apologise to the hon. Lady for pressing her in her ill health, but can she be clear about what solutions she is suggesting?
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51208-18_spnew7"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. We support many of the recommendations outlined in the report, which seem to be sensible proposals to redress the balance between maintaining a successful pharmaceutical industry that continues to develop life-changing and potentially world-changing drugs, and maintaining and representing the best interests of the patient and the NHS. Regulation will help to ensure a more equitable balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_125">I am concerned however, that the Government have not even recognised adequately that that imbalance exists. They also seem to display a similar attitude to other, greater potential threats to public health and the available, appropriate and effective medication to deal with them. Let us hope that today&#039;s debate will help the Government to take the first steps towards recognising those problems and addressing them, so that the public can be confident that their health will remain at the heart of the issue of when and why they are prescribed drugs.

 I believe that this report is among the three best that I have seen in my 20&nbsp;years in Parliament. I believe that it required a response from the Government that reflected the courage and thoroughness of David Hinchliffe and the other members of the Committee. Sadly, the Government&#039;s response is lamentable. Not only did they not respond to the Committee&#039;s clear and important calls, but they ignored many of them altogether.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_126">I will go along with what has been said about the enormous, miraculous progress in pharmaceuticals in the past 100&nbsp;years or so. Tens of thousands of people would be dead today were it not for drugs, particularly the recent advances in cancer drugs. I make no criticism of the science involved or of that part of the work of the industry whatever. We and the Committee, however, should be very critical of the dark side of the industry&#151;the disease-mongering, the medicalisation of society, and the way that it abuses all the dark arts to encourage all of society to believe that we are ill and need a pill every day. Recently, the greatest increase has been in the incidence of depression, for which prescriptions have risen by more than 400&nbsp;per cent. in a decade. In the great majority of cases people are suffering from mild depression, but we are taught to believe that if we are sadder today than we were yesterday, we are ill, and we need medication. That is useful for the pharmaceutical industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_127">The worst aspect of that was contained in report that came out of America less than a week ago, which suggested that many two to five-year-olds need Ritalin or anti-psychotic drugs. As a consequence of this view, in America one in seven children are on Ritalin&#151;similar to amphetamines in some ways&#151;and worse drugs. The ambition of the pharmaceutical industry is to get us all taking those drugs, which are of questionable value.

About an hour and a half ago in this Chamber, a Member called for the acceleration of the supply of Velcade, I think, which my constituents can get, but many other Members&#039; constituents cannot, because it can be obtained in Wales but not here. There was warm support and almost universal approval for accelerating NICE&#039;s processes. I briefly pointed out the results of that in an intervention.

I noticed that the e-mail came from a well known lobbying company. I therefore got in touch with it and I asked it who was paying its wages. It turned out to be a group of people called the obesity council. Who pays the obesity council? It is the drug industry&#151;the people who sell slimming aids.

Increasingly, MPs are being approached to use our office here to put forward a case for the drug industry. That is a thorough abuse of our position.

The MHRA, the regulatory body, is funded 100&nbsp;per cent. from the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry calls the tune. We could give numerous examples of that. Perhaps the worst was Seroxat, on which I have had two debates in the recent past, before its problems were discovered. The MHRA set up a sub-committee to look into the issue, but it had to disband after some nine months because the majority of the members had a financial interest in the company that produced the drug. The sub-committee had to be re-formed and progress was very slow.

An example that applies to Seroxat and the treatment of mild depression was revealed in a book that I sent to all the members of the Committee before it started its work on the issue. The book is called &quot;Medicines Out of Control?&quot; by Charles Medawar. It asks what would have happened if we had gone to see Sigmund Freud when he practised as a doctor. He gave all his patients and friends, and took himself, a medicine he knew that was believed to improve people&#039;s mental health and stability. That medicine was cocaine: it was the popular drug of the time. A later popular drug was bromide, which creates its own form of psychosis, called bromism, which was a scourge of society at the time of the first world war.

There was also the experimental period of the mental health industry in the 1950s, with the inducement of deep psychosis, lobotomies, leucotomies insulin coma therapy and electroconvulsive therapy.

When the campaign against Seroxat was mounted by a few courageous people outside the drug industry, the drug companies mounted a ferocious campaign to ensure that the voices who were protesting about the dangers of Seroxat were muffled. For example, Depression Alliance, a patient group that is virtually a creature of the pharmaceutical industry and gets 80&nbsp;per

<a name="stpa_135">The organisations that emerge with great credit are those that take not a penny from the pharmaceutical industry, such as MIND, which continues to act in the patients&#039; interests. Many so-called patient organisations still receive instructions from and carry out the work of the pharmaceutical industry, and some otherwise splendid organisations are affected. For example, on the day that Vioxx was banned, I went on to the Arthritis Care website. I greatly respect that organisation and it does fine work in encouraging the use of non-drug interventions such as exercise in the treatment of arthritis. On that day, its website told people not to panic if they were taking Vioxx. That drug has been identified as causing 144,000&nbsp;heart attacks and strokes in the US. I would have thought that reasonable advice in such circumstances would be to panic, if people were taking such a drug. The website also advised people to visit their doctor and follow their advice about changing to another drug. However, it is significant that the website of that respectable organisation contains a notice saying that the site has been refurbished with help from Merck Sharp and Dohme, the company that makes Vioxx. Even a worthy, conscientious organisation such as Arthritis Care must be influenced in some way by the fact that if it upsets the pharmaceutical companies or fails to do their bidding, it will lose some of its staff or funding. Understandably, the Committee recommended action on those patient groups, which should declare all significant funding. It also recommended that the Government should make changes to charity law to ensure that that happens. Unfortunately, the Government have stated that self-regulation should be the first resort in improving fundraising standards, so no action has been taken, although the Home Secretary maintains reserve powers.

<a name="stpa_139">This element of ghost-writing, raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) in opening the debate, is a matter of great concern, and it is continuing. We saw the accounts given by Dr Blumsohn in last week&#039;s edition of The<i> Observer</i>. I met this gentleman and heard what had happened in his case. People talk about life and death; often, it is death and death. The number of people who have lost their lives from an adverse reaction to drugs is enormous. In America, it is claimed that the fourth-largest cause of death is adverse reactions to drugs.

<a name="stpa_140">The Leemon McHenry Hastings centre report pointed out that the companies first select the data that promote the drugs. They file away the results that are unfavourable and buy the right academic credentials to sign a ghost-written article produced by marketing department staff or by public relations agencies employed by the company. What are we to regard as the fundamental science, the authoritative work, to which doctors and physicians look if they want to approve a new drug? We know these articles are being ghost-written and the case of Dr. Blumsohn, published last week, made it clear that the companies refused to give him the data on an article to which his name was attached. They claimed his authority for the article and he had not seen the data.

 We all hope so. Like many, I thought that having a rational and genuinely independent body to look at these matters was a fine reform. The difficulty is the pressure that we all feel as human beings. If a member of our family or a close constituent wanted a drug, we would go along with it, even if there was only a 1&nbsp;per cent. chance of success, and would want to hurry NICE along. But if we as politicians take a decision, as we should, we should look at what happens with rushed approvals. The reason that Seroxat caused problems was that it was approved off-label for people under 18&nbsp;when it had not been trialled.

A balance must be made&#151;this is often impossible&#151;when patients who suffer from terminal diseases demand drugs that might have even a very slim chance of postponing the inevitable.

She rightly made the point that the ABPI has never expelled a member. It has never even forced one of them to publish any corrective statement, although there are dozens of examples of misleading advertising and products that should not have been marketed as they were.

 I agree entirely; we could continue to record such successes at great length. Indeed, I think in my opening remarks I used the word &quot;miraculous&quot; when talking about the industry. I am trying to separate the job creation and the benefits to humankind, which have been enormous, as my hon. Friend said, from the marketing side of the industry.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) said, enormous strides have been made in the work of the drug industry over the years, but there is still an awful energy in the industry that is used with malign effect&#151;disease-mongering by inventing diseases and then a cure for them. The medicalisation of society has proceeded at a great rate and is looting huge amounts of money from the national health service to the detriment of other services. The drug budget increases constantly. Some of those drugs are essential and life-saving but others are not; in fact, they are life-damaging.

After hon. Members have heard my speech, they might say, &quot;Hang on, that is exactly what the hon.

<a name="stpa_151">There is an argument that the regulatory burden on developing new medicines has increased markedly over the past two decades and that the balance between risk and benefit has been tipped a little too far in favour of the former. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is an important body, and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) has referred to it several times today. However, our report said that the recent cut to its budget might have a significant impact on the speed at which new medicines reach patients. The Government&#039;s recent moves to extend the prescribing power of nurses and pharmacists, which many of us welcome, might render it more difficult to restrain the growing influence of the pharmaceutical industry and the increase in the medicalisation of our society.

<a name="stpa_152">I hope that I will not regret making this statement, although it will please the hon.

All the new products on the market to make us look more wonderful and feel better pressurise people to think, &quot;It&#039;s out there; let&#039;s have it.&quot; However, as the hon.

<p>
<a name="51208-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_154">The phenomenon is symptomatic of the pharmaceutical industry. It can be argued that the industry has been left to its own devices for too long. That was the thrust of the Health Committee report. The industry can target not only general practitioners, hospitals, treatment groups, medical journals and professional bodies in distribution campaigns, but individuals as well. The Health Committee thought that that practice put genuinely ill and vulnerable people at risk to some extent. Everyone, including patients and consumers, should be protected from pharmaceutical companies&#039; persuasive product pushing. As a Conservative, I am certainly not in favour of the nanny state, but a balance must be struck and there is a role for Government, which is why we are genuinely disappointed that more of our recommendations were not accepted. The powers of the statutory regulator&#151;the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#151;should be strengthened to ensure that the evidence produced by pharmaceutical companies truly reflects the findings of their clinical trials. That research should be undertaken in a professional manner, and the disadvantages as well as the benefits of licensed drugs should be well known to people who prescribe and use them.

<a name="stpa_155">I welcome the revised and updated Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry code of practice, which was announced on 16&nbsp;November. It will govern the UK-based pharmaceutical industry&#039;s relations with health care professionals from January next year. It highlights the key priority of patient safety, and sets guidelines and restrictions on pharmaceutical companies&#039; advertising strategies. It bans promotional competitions, including one cited in the Library briefing. In September 2005, a dentistry magazine featured a promotion for the drug Periostat that included a competition to win an iPod Mini. I have not entered the competition, but I am tempted to encourage my children to do so, as they all want iPods for Christmas.

<a name="stpa_156">Responsibility for ethical practices should not lie with the pharmaceutical industry alone. The Health Committee strongly recommended that doctors should be obliged to declare significant sums of money or gifts that they receive as hospitality, and that they should register them with their professional bodies. The profession will say that only a tiny minority is involved but, even so, we believe that those gifts should be registered. Likewise, the ABPI code tightens the rules on hospitality, stating that delegates to company sponsored events, as we have heard, should only be flown economy class. However, it does not go as far as banning provision for five-star hotel accommodation, which is a shame.

This is why, quite wisely, the Committee concluded that a key recommendation of its report would be that the sponsorship of the industry be passed from the Department of Health to the Department of Trade and Industry, so as to avoid that conflict of interest.

I am worried that people may be putting themselves at risk by self-medicating in this way. I am told that some of the information associated with these products that is given on the internet can be inaccurate. People should therefore use it with caution. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider that.

<a name="51208-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_175">Parallel trading is of even greater concern to me. Britain is one of the leading research countries in the discovery of new medicines. We have a very proud record, going back to the early sulphonamides and leading up to some of the most advanced anti-cancer drugs of today. That fine record continues to thrive, for various reasons. We have a good science base. The universities produce excellent scientists and medical people who do the research. We have tremendous hospitals that carry out excellent clinical trials, despite what has been said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_176">The whole environment in Britain is conducive to the discovery of first-class medicines. The pharmaceutical industry is of course profitable, as we have just heard. The pricing structure for the purchase of drugs by the national health service aids in the discovery of drugs in this country because medicines are sold at a higher price to the NHS than they are in many other countries throughout the world, including in Europe. Products that are available in this country can also be bought in Greece, but a country such as Greece does not contribute to the research and development of drugs to anywhere near the degree that Britain does. A product will be on sale in Greece, and in many other countries, at a much cheaper price than in Britain. The pharmaceutical companies in, for example, America, Germany and Britain export their products to countries such as Greece and Bulgaria with foreign-language packets and foreign-language inserted leaflets, so that the patient knows about all the side effects. An entrepreneur can therefore pick up those products in Greece much more cheaply than he or she can buy them in this country. The entrepreneurs then trade them back to Britain, where many may have been made in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_177">There is a requirement to repackage the product if the box and the leaflet inside it have been printed in a foreign language. Therein lies the difficulty. The boxes are reopened, the leaflets are removed, new leaflets are put in, sometimes new labels are stuck over the French or Greek on the box and, often, even the boxes are reprinted. The product is then sold through the outlets that are commonly available in this country. That might appear okay, but there are problems.

<a name="stpa_178">Earlier this year, the Science and Technology Committee visited the small African country of Malawi. We split up into two teams&#151;an agriculture team and a health team&#151;and I joined the health team. We visited hospitals in Lilongwe and elsewhere in the country. I visited a small district hospital in the centre of Malawi, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1047</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which orders its drugs for some very sick patients from the central stores in Lilongwe. They are supposed to reach the hospital on the back of a wagon. Unfortunately, corruption is rife in many African countries as in many countries throughout the world. Many drugs do not reach the patients; they fall off the back of a wagon into the hands of a criminal entrepreneur. Consequently, patients die of tuberculosis, AIDS, HIV and all sorts of tropical diseases. They die as a result of parallel trading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_179">The entrepreneur trades the product that has been exported from a western country to Africa back to the western country because it is available much more cheaply in the African country than it is in, for example, Britain. Those parallel traders cause immense damage. In repackaging the products and sticking in another leaflet, mistakes can be made. For example, the drugs can be mixed up. However, I am even more worried about parallel trading from what I heard recently. As I said earlier, my great worry is counterfeiting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_180">The trade in counterfeiting drugs is growing at an enormous pace. People are copying drugs all over the world. Last evening, at a joint meeting of the all-party group on the packaging manufacturing industry and the all-party group on pharmacy, I heard that the counterfeiters are professional and are even buying the same packaging material as the professional companies use&#151;for example, Pfizer in Kent. Obviously they do not have the same careful production processes and, in particular, they do not have the same quality control processes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_181">Last night, we were shown pictures of drugs that had been counterfeited. They had been made chemically, using the same processes, but there are impurities in all chemical processes. Our pharmaceutical companies have good quality control to ensure that there are no dangerous impurities in the drugs on the market in our countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_182">So, what happens? A drug is counterfeited, often with impurities in it, and placed in packaging identical to that produced by firms such as Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca. We were shown examples of those packages last night. When they were placed side by side with the real ones, we could hardly tell the difference. Inside the packages, the leaflets and blister packs also looked authentic. When we in the audience were asked which was the authentic drug and which was the counterfeit, or parallel-traded, drug, it was very difficult to tell the difference.

 Pharmacists often do not know where the box has come from. Last night, we were shown a trick that the pharmaceutical companies have introduced. They have invented a new kind of print that is stuck on to the box. In the example that we were shown, the name &quot;Pfizer&quot; was used. The pharmacist is provided with a device that allows them to match an example of the print with the print on the box. If the print on the box is not authentic, it is possible to see the difference. However, it will not be long before the criminal entrepreneurs are doing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_183">Last night, we discussed how we could prevent the counterfeiting of drugs and the use of the parallel trading system. One suggestion was that electronic tags could be placed in the boxes. I suggested to the meeting&#151;and I suggest to the House today&#151;that when a pharmaceutical product leaves the factory, it goes out with a transport audit. For example, if it had been manufactured by Pfizer, it would come out of Kent and the transport audit would follow it through every stage of its journey. Perhaps, however, I have not thought the idea through; criminal entrepreneurs could find a way round that, too.

In other inquiries, such as the one into obesity, the Health Committee has recognised that self-regulation of the food industry was probably a more practicable measure to aim for than strict regulation from outside.

<a name="stpa_202">An example of the rapid uptake of a new drug causing problems is of course Vioxx.

It was introduced in 1999&nbsp;and withdrawn in September 2004&nbsp;when work in America showed how dangerous it was from the point of view of causing heart attacks and strokes.

<a name="stpa_203">To express a slightly different view, we lost what was thought to be a potentially useful drug due to the unpredictable side effects brought to light by very widespread, very rapid prescribing. I have spoken to drugs firms about this and they claim that in fact, it was a good thing that Vioxx was prescribed so widely, because doing so brought the side effects to light much more quickly. I do not quite follow that argument.

Because members of those trusts are on the committee, it is also well accepted by the GPs in the area. Its prescribing levels of Vioxx&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;were lower than the nationwide average because it had careful guidelines. It took the view that this is a new drug and no one knows entirely what is going to happen, so we should be careful with it, please.

Examples of that would include the new treatments for cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, for instance, as such drugs would be prescribed only by consultants.

I was brought up to be extraordinarily careful with new drugs, because doctors do not, and cannot, know what they do.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate. I thought that I would need to have my boxing gloves on, metaphorically speaking, to take on the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn), but as I listened to his excellent speech, I found that I agreed with much of it.
</p>

<a name="51208-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_224">I must first declare an interest in that Merck Sharp and Dohme is based in my constituency. I am pleased to have that company there, it is a good employer and I hope that it continues to operate out of the UK as well as other countries. The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK. It employs many hundreds of my constituents and across the country it employs many tens of thousands of people. It spends a vast amount of money on research&#151;it should be remembered that only one or two in 100&nbsp;drugs on the drawing board reach fruition. Of course, pharmaceutical companies need to make returns on those one or two to fund future research. I have no objection, therefore, to pharmaceutical companies marketing more aggressively than perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to see them do, or to their making a profit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_225">Before I became a Member of Parliament, I worked in health care as a PR person. That is why I listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman. At the tender age of 27, I was responsible for promoting certain diseases, one of which was osteoporosis, and 11&nbsp;years ago, it probably needed promoting. The system works as follows. Some motivated and passionate charities are connected with certain diseases, and they have very little or no money. In such cases, generous pharmaceutical companies with a treatment for one of those diseases come along and sponsor some of the charities&#039; activities. As I said, we needed to promote osteoporosis because so many people, especially women, were afflicted with it, and politicians&#151;we had a Conservative Government then&#151;did not take it seriously or see it as a priority.

<br>&nbsp;<br>SSRIs are useful drugs for treating it, I am concerned that too many doctors, for whatever reason, prescribe SSRIs without taking the time to understand the causes of their patients&#039; problems. I understand, from talking to many of the same charities to which the hon. Gentleman has talked, that sometimes a patient gets less than five minutes and to get them out of the door they are prescribed SSRIs, which can have serious side effects for some people and cause great discomfort. They can also be very difficult to come off. I hope that as a result of this debate the Minister will take away the concerns about SSRIs. Perhaps we need a process of education for GPs to ensure that they take more time to understand the root causes of people&#039;s problems before prescribing a pharmaceutical solution.

<a name="stpa_227">I am glad that the ABPI recognises some of the concerns about support for patient groups and paid-for doctors writing in support of drug companies&#039; solutions to an illness. Coming from a PR background, I am aware that there was always a difference between an advertorial and an editorial, and perhaps we have seen editorials that should have been branded as advertorials. There should be greater transparency. Pharmaceutical companies should make it clear which groups they support, be they academic or charities, and when a doctor or professional writing in support of a treatment is in receipt of funding from the company producing that treatment, that should be made clear.

<a name="stpa_228">This was intended to be a short speech, so I shall conclude by agreeing with the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) on the danger of counterfeit medicine and internet pharmacy, 99.99&nbsp;per cent. of which is unregulated and operated from places such as Tonga in the Pacific. Drugs that are sold back to the UK may be as harmless as sugar but, for example, if a woman were to take Propetia, it could have severe, possibly even life-threatening, implications for her health. I hope that I can join the hon. Gentleman, perhaps in a future debate in Westminster Hall, to explore that problem, which was not covered by the report.

 It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. We should be thankful to the pharmaceutical industry, which, over the past couple of hundred years, has introduced cures and treatments for ailments that affect many people. We should be thankful to the Select Committee for its excellent report and recommendations. We should also be thankful to Parliament for establishing the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which does good work in regulating what comes on to the market as an acceptable treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_230">The Select Committee report and the Government response are concerned with life-and-death issues, particularly with regard to the speed with which treatments reach the market. I should like to raise three brief concerns, the first of which is the funding available to NICE. There was a clear recommendation that its 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1056</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>funding should be increased. The Government response was fairly clear: they would look at the matter in the round in the future. It is slightly more urgent than that. If we expect NICE to do its work, the fact that so many drugs are coming on to the market and so many clinical trials are taking place mean that its funding needs to be increased, and soon. The &#163;3.5&nbsp;million that was withdrawn resulted almost directly in one of the appraisal panels being closed. Perhaps the Minister can say a few words about that in his response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_231">My second concern relates to the recommendation from the Secretary of State that Herceptin be fast-tracked and that PCTs should begin allowing women with early stage breast cancer to use the treatment. I welcome that decision&#151;by all accounts, the drug is effective&#151;but it raises concerns and questions. On what basis should a Secretary of State for Health intervene in the process? On what basis should the Secretary of State select a drug or treatment for fast-tracking? Surely there should be overt, rational and robust guidelines that are open for everyone to see, so that any decision is not made as a result of public pressure or, dare I suggest, PR pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. Although the decision raises some questions, I was delighted with the recommendation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_232">My third concern is that medicines reach the market on the basis of robust evidence. I said earlier that if NICE is unable to see all of the evidence, clinical trials and data on a treatment, it is not necessarily in a position to make a sound judgment. If it sees only the published reports of clinical trials, it is not seeing the full picture and it cannot necessarily make a fully informed judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_233">The House and the Government have a duty to protect people from unsafe medicines, and NICE does a good job in the circumstances. However, I urge the Minister to take a good look at, first, the guidelines for NICE to ensure that it can consider all the evidence involved; secondly, the basis on which the Secretary of State for Health can circumvent or intervene in the process of drug prescription; and thirdly, the funding available to NICE, so that, as patients and the pharmaceutical industry make more demands in the future and the evidence becomes clear that certain medicines look useful, those medicines can be processed, examined and reviewed very quickly by an excellent institute.

I am sure that the Health Committee will help to guide and press for action in the future. As the Chairman of the Select Committee said, it will return to the issue and rightly so, and it would be very useful if it did precisely that in one or two instances that I might mention during my remarks.

<a name="51208-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_235">I want to say a special word of thanks to David Hinchliffe, the former Member for Wakefield, who was Chairman of the Health Committee when I was a member of it in the early part of the 1997&nbsp;to 2001&nbsp;Parliament. He did a remarkable job. Many people across the NHS very much valued his work, and the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) will be a distinguished and equally competent successor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_236">The right hon. Gentleman was quite right to point to the importance of safety, which is a central issue. I was surprised, particularly during the discussion of Vioxx, that there was little mention of the subsequent actions by the pharmaceutical industry to promote the publication of all clinical trial data. That is an important matter. The Select Committee considered the origin of the problems with Vioxx, and they were substantially related to the failure of transparency on clinical trial data, as well as, arguably, the company responses. If we are to deal with those problems, we require not only ethical responses on the part of pharmaceutical companies, but the sort of transparency that allows early indications of effectiveness to be challenged by others using the data.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_237">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) rightly illustrated the fact that it is terribly important to use the data properly. However, if he is right and there have been instances where conclusions reported in medical journals are not consistent with the data&#151;that would be entirely wrong&#151;it is absolutely essential that other researchers have access to the data in a form that allows them to engage in the scientific method and to challenge the conclusion that others have reached. That is what science is about. We applaud scientists for what they are doing, so we should give them the maximum opportunity to use their method in that way.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51208-24_spnew0"><b> Paul Flynn: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Eliot Spitzer in New York took GlaxoSmithKlein to court and the company was fined? That revealed a truly shocking picture of falsified research: negative results were ignored; results showing that new drugs were not as effective as placebos had been buried and not published; and the results of trials during which people had died had been suppressed. That is a dreadful record and although I tried to congratulate the drug companies on having changed their act, the past is one of deception, errors and manipulation on a scale that most of us could not imagine.

 I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman has been making and I do not doubt his long history of work on the subject. He does an important job and I do not dispute that. We need people in this place who come at the arguments from many different angles, but his argument seems to be that the bottle is one tenth empty. We must remember that the bottle is nine tenths full; the pharmaceutical industry has made and continues to make a remarkable contribution to the public benefit by improving our health.

<a name="stpa_238">One of the Government&#039;s central messages is about the reduction in mortality from coronary heart disease, but they know perfectly well that that has occurred throughout the world as a consequence of the introduction of statins.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rightly gave the hon. Member for Newport, West a short lecture on the range of benefits that the drug industry has brought us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_239">The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East was also right to point out the risks associated with both parallel trade and internet trading, which are not necessarily the same thing. Parallel trade is not illegal. It is a consequence of the fact that we do not have a single market in pharmaceuticals, nor are we likely to. I am certainly not saying that we should leap to that situation. We have to acknowledge that large price disparities, especially in parts of Europe, can have a substantial impact on trade and can dramatically undermine the intentions behind the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. We need to be aware of that and, if necessary, adapt the PPRS in response. I shall return to the PPRS later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_240">Counterfeit trade is illegal and extremely harmful. Everything I hear confirms that the scale of internet trade in counterfeit drugs is rising. Whenever there are questions about the preparations for pandemic flu and the availability of Tamiflu, the counterfeiters try to trade on that public concern and satisfy the demand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_241">We have not talked much about the necessity for public information. There is a range of possibilities for better informing the public about the availability of drugs and about why some medicines should be prescription-only. We need to think hard about the circumstances in which they should become pharmacy medicines. That has been advantageous in the case of statins and the same may be true of antiviral drugs in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_242">We must also consider the public understanding of risk, about which we could talk for a long time. If the public become direct participants in reporting adverse drug reactions and adverse events, as they will under the yellow card scheme, they need to be much more aware of risk and the kind of adverse event that we anticipate. I am sorry that there was not more discussion during the debate of the Government&#039;s response to the yellow card scheme, which is important, although we should not get too carried away. The yellow card scheme in the UK did not disclose the problems with Vioxx, nor did the Medwatch scheme in the United States. As the Select Committee pointed out, they were largely disclosed during large-scale, long-term trials, designed to establish the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of other conditions. That illustrates that the longer one continues the process, the more trials one does and the more patients who are exposed to a drug, the more likely one is to establish safety data. I am not a scientist, so I cannot explain how the procedure works, but I am confidently assured that although trials that establish efficacy, safety and quality for licensing purposes are immensely expensive, there are many reasons why their scale is not necessarily sufficient to establish safety against a range of untoward events. Such trials disclose immediate safety events in controlled populations, but they do not reveal less common events that could occur in larger populations. That explains why we must think about post-licensing surveillance, which is important, as the Committee and the right hon. Member for Rother Valley rightly pointed out.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_243">There are several factors that could help us to achieve that. The national health service could be an important international organisation in the process. It would help the pharmaceutical industry in this country if we could use effectively the connecting for health programme, the electronic patient records and everything that goes with them to create population-wide databases that would give us good information about adverse events. We have the general practice research database, but if that were to expand and migrate into the connecting for health programme, it would help us enormously. Although we have prescription-event monitoring at the moment, I understand that about 30&nbsp;per cent. of GPs do not participate in it. We need something that will be effective across the board and not likely to be affected by any distortions and biases that might occur due to the self-selection of participants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_244">The document &quot;Safer Medicines&quot;, which was published by the Academy of Medical Sciences only two weeks ago, makes interesting reading. I do it an injustice by picking out only one or two aspects of it, but it addresses useful matters that have not been mentioned. The document refers to conditional approval, which would occur if licensing meant not simply saying that a firm could market a drug without any further conditions, but saying that there were as yet unproven safety considerations that would have to be addressed through the subsequent use of the drug. If a company were able to extend the life of patent protection while it continued to acquire data, it would be in its commercial and economic interests to undertake much of the larger-scale work that would be necessary to acquire data from a wider population who were using a drug that was effective for their needs, rather than only those involved in clinical trials. It would thus be understood whether any contraindications associated with the drug would affect its final licensing approval. The academy did not recommend such a scheme, but as it discussed it, I thought that it would be an interesting matter to put to the Minister for further debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_245">Secondly, the academy referred to the importance of using European data. Of course, the sooner one arrives at a point at which a large population is using a drug, the more likely one is to identify adverse events that might occur. The academy refers to the need for an international co-ordinating centre on drug toxicity and the ability to undertake DNA sampling. The beauty of such an approach is shown by the fact that we increasingly find that drugs might be especially effective in circumstances in which people have a genetic predisposition. For example, Herceptin is likely to be effective for the 20&nbsp;per cent. of women with breast cancer who are HER2-postive. Equally, there may be genetic predispositions towards adverse drug reactions, and we must focus as much on that possibility as on the positive opportunity to find drugs by understanding people&#039;s DNA responses. If we can do so, that will provide another positive benefit.

<a name="51208-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_246">My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West made a good point about tuberculosis testing and the Mantoux test. If we are to have a NICE mechanism whereby the NHS undertakes evidence-based appraisals of clinical and cost-effectiveness to inform its clinical activity and priority setting, and if vaccines are available 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1060</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>as alternatives to drugs and chemical compounds for the treatment of prostrate cancer and other cancers, I can see no reason why those vaccines should not be subject to NICE analysis. Indeed, that would have a positive benefit, as it would be more transparent. I have voiced the persistent complaint that the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation fails to give transparent advice. Its advice is subject to delay, and all the papers submitted to it are effectively invisible, because it is only the minutes of meetings that appear on its website several months after the meetings themselves are held. My constant plea is that we should have more transparency, as vaccines will become increasingly effective treatments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_247">Another major issue raised in our debate is the take-up of drugs and the extent to which the NHS, through NICE, can access information about new drugs and their cost-effectiveness. My hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) is right that there have been reductions in NICE funding, which has reduced the number of its appraisal committees from three to two at a time when their work load is increasing. For example, 29&nbsp;new cancer drugs, a proportion of which will be fast-tracked, have to be submitted for appraisal. I shall not even consider the number of clinical guidelines that NICE should use, as it is important to focus on appraisals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_248">We have urged Ministers to make good the reduction in NICE&#039;s resources, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Government will do so. The aim of the review of arms-length bodies associated with the Department of Health was not to cut bureaucracy but to try to focus resources on those that would be of the most value to people working on the front line in the NHS. The Health Committee emphasised the need for NICE to gain access to all the data accompanying licence applications to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. As NICE will increasingly conduct appraisals alongside the MHRA, we may need to consider incentivising the acquisition of the appropriate data for NICE purposes while ensuring that companies are aware that they must produce data for MHRA licensing approval. Very often, those things happen in series, because the data required by each body are not the same. Companies are not sure whether NICE will make an appraisal, so any work that they undertake at an early stage may be costly and abortive. As the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said, they do not know whether Ministers will refer a drug to NICE, or whether there will be a delay.


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_249">We need greater independence in the process of choosing what should be referred to NICE and when. For the purposes of appraisal and issuing clinical guidelines, I accept that it is Ministers&#039; responsibility to determine what should be referred to NICE. The structure for the appraisal of new drugs should be straightforward and independent. If they are likely to be a cost-effective response to existing NHS requirements to provide treatment, should that not be communicated to the NHS as soon as possible after independent assessment?

 Indeed.

 The hon. Gentleman keeps touching a raw nerve. I have corresponded with the Medical Research Council for some time on that matter. The working group that decided that the National Institute for Medical Research should be in central London 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1062</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rather than Cambridge because of the institute&#039;s international obligations was deluding itself. The work of the National Institute for Medical Research relates to the work of the institute of stem cell biology, which will be in Cambridge, and of the laboratory of molecular biology, which is in Cambridge, and I could go on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_254">Although Cambridge university was not that fussed&#151;plenty of candidates want to be on the Cambridge biomedical campus&#151;it would have been justified in objecting, and I certainly felt that a peculiarly blinkered view was taken on where medical research can be carried out. However, University college and University college London will provide a fine home, and I will have nothing said against them. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I had to get there eventually. I also want to echo the remarks by the right hon. Member for Rother Valley about the importance of safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_255">We must decide whether we believe in the process that NICE undertakes. We cannot believe in NICE and the independent evidence-based analysis of what is clinically effective and cost-effective, and then simply throw the results out of the window. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley and I share that view on infertility treatments, because if one asks NICE to produce guidelines, one cannot suddenly pop up and say, &quot;Let&#039;s do something different.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_256">I acknowledge that Herceptin raises a completely different question. The matter does not rest with NICE, because the licence has not been applied for. That prompts the question on what basis is Herceptin being prescribed. I know the answer, because Cambridge university oncologists, who are convinced of its effectiveness, have written to me. Across the country, there are instances in which clinicians can prescribe drugs before licensing on the basis of their own judgment of emerging clinical evidence. However, that is a judgment by clinicians rather than by the Secretary of State or by a professional executive committee. Individual clinicians examine the data and take responsibility for such prescription.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_257">Before 2001, my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), suggested the creation of an exceptional medicines fund to help to accelerate the take-up of novel but potentially effective medicines in the NHS. I am not advocating that route&#151;if we are devolving responsibility in the NHS, it is probably not appropriate&#151;but it is one way to think about the problem. Even if we are devolving responsibility, we must examine, for example, the French system and understand more explicitly the circumstances in which such prescription should take place through the NHS. Perhaps we should involve NICE at an early stage in considering emerging evidence through clinical trials, even if the licensing process has not been completed. However, we should be aware that Herceptin, by its very nature, cannot be regarded as a precedent, and my party will not seek to use it in that way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_258">The rest of the debate has concerned how we can support the industry while achieving effective self-regulation. Hon. Members disparaged the new code of practice promulgated through the ABPI, but we have to view these things with a bit of discretion. Frankly, if one sends a senior consultant who might be earning &#163;150,000&nbsp;to Kuala Lumpur, one can try to put him in a three-star hotel but I am not sure that he will stay there. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1063</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody has been expelled from the ABPI. However, I wonder whether we would conclude that the new standards and privileges arrangements brought into this House in recent years must be defective because nobody has yet been expelled. I am not sure if that is the right basis on which to judge such matters. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am probably tempting the hon. Member for Newport, West again. Self-regulation is a better way to proceed. Let us ensure that we work with the industry. If we can see reasonable enhancements to the code of practice that are likely to have an impact, let us by all means propose them, but I heard no such substantive proposals today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_259">We should think hard about how we support the pharmaceutical industry. We put an enormous burden on it as regards deciding where resources should go. An immense amount rests on its shoulders in terms of our futures. What would happen if those companies were to leave the UK? The disaster scenario would be GlaxoSmithKline deciding that it would be better off locating all its research and development activity in the United States. I do not suppose that it will happen&#151;I fondly hope not, touching wood. That would have enormous consequences for this country, not only economically but in terms of our whole research base.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_260">I want to mention two areas: first, NHS research and development activity; and secondly, the role of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. The Government&#039;s document, &quot;Best research for best health: A new National Health Research Strategy&quot;, confidently asserts:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;A summary of responses, including the next steps, will be published by 30&nbsp;November.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_261">As it is now some time after that, this is an excellent opportunity for the Minister to tell us what conclusions have been drawn from the consultation so far. Since 1991, when a director was first appointed, NHS research and development has grown in its scope and ambitions. I am pleased about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_262">The additional five areas of clinical research networks will be terribly important, but we wait to see what scale of resources will flow into them. The clinical research network on stroke requires there to be corresponding levels of NHS research funding, because in comparison with cancer a very small amount of money is spent on supporting stroke research, notwithstanding that stroke is the third largest killer in this country and the major cause of adult disability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_263">Creating a network therefore needs the resources to support it. I hope that NHS research and development will take seriously the possibility of accepting more responsibility for the costs of clinical trials so that the NHS is in a position to undertake a higher proportion of such trials with patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_264">The Under-Secretary knows that one of the major factors that differentiate five-year survival rates in Britain from those in, for example, France is the extent to which patients take part in clinical trials. The National Cancer Research Network was established in 2001&nbsp;and the number of patients in clinical trials doubled but we remain some way behind France. Of course, we have only one national clinical research network. Clinical trials with patients should be conducted in the NHS. However, the costs of clinical 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1064</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>trials in this country have doubled and the regulation has increased dramatically. I cannot dissociate myself from some of the responsibility for that because, when we considered the Human Tissue Bill, we added to the regulatory burdens. After many discussions with the Department of Health, we managed to reduce them, but they remain. The clinical trials directive and the Mental Capacity Act 2005&nbsp;also added to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_265">Many people who work on clinical trials and try to set them up tell horror stories about the number of bodies that they have to approach to set up a clinical trial. They include funding bodies, local hospital research approval bodies, distant research and ethics committees, and data protection committees. The list appears endless. Approaching all those bodies is not only expensive but can provide a major disincentive to clinicians, whose time is valuable to them and to the hospital when deciding whether to devote time to clinical trials. We need more patients in clinical trials.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_266">Let me consider the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. I made it clear before the election that, if we had the chance to do so, we would consider the range of matters that support a strong biomedical research capacity in this country. That includes the NHS research and development strategy and I am pleased that the Government have published a document about that. However, we should also consider the cost of clinical trials, which I have just mentioned, and the action that we can take against animal rights terrorists. The further legislation that the Government have proposed is right but the industry will tell them that it is important to ensure that there is a drive behind enforcement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_267">We should consider the economic framework through the PPRS. Although the report is excellent, the Committee described the PPRS and made a passing reference to reform in the context of marketing allowance, which, in the grand scale of things, is trivial, but did not tackle the central question of the purpose of the PPRS and whether it is a fit-for-purpose scheme. I do not suggest that it is not fit for purpose and no one in their right mind would suggest simply abandoning it and letting the industry charge what it liked for drugs that have intellectual property protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_268">However, many other countries have alternative mechanisms and we need to consider carefully what happens on a European-wide basis. Too many other countries buy in a centralised system but benchmark themselves on an international basis and increasingly choose to benchmark their prices below the average. If that continues, one or two major markets&#151;the US and Japan&#151;will overwhelmingly provide the profit to the pharmaceutical industry while Europe progressively reaches a point where it pays much less. That will not be a sustainable basis on which the industry can regard Europe as its second home for drug research and development. We must understand how to incentivise the conduct of research and development in this country in circumstances whereby we increasingly expose the industry to competition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_269">I personally do not regard rate-of-return regulation as the right long-term solution, because it does not deliver genuine competitive pressures. The Government imposed a 7&nbsp;per cent. cut, and no doubt that will deliver a reduction in the drugs bill. However, there is a lack of participation in the negotiations of the scheme by small drug companies and biotechnology companies, and this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1065</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>last review of the PPRS has exposed the way in which small companies, often those bringing just one product to the market, are severely disadvantaged. The big companies that negotiate the PPRS are able to change their prices between branded products; there is no real constraint in that regard. So if they have a competing product in a particular treatment area, they can respond through their price structures in ways that a small company with one product simply cannot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_270">I still think that the PPRS provides an export disincentive. If companies are making major profits as a consequence of the exploitation of their drug in other markets, the price that they get from the NHS could be a disadvantage. There should be real incentives for exports, rather than disincentives. Although the research and development allowance went up, and although it can be an effective floor, I fear that it can also be a ceiling. Companies such as Pfizer have demonstrated the value of high levels of research and development activity in relation to their turnover, but our R and D allowance sets a benchmark and perhaps underplays the benefit of allowing companies to take a strategic option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para20">
<a name="stpa_271">The Office of Fair Trading is engaged in a review of these matters. I believe that the House, whether through the Select Committee or some other means, should examine the health and NHS purposes of the PPRS. I am an advocate of what the OFT does, and Members will recall that it quite rightly tries to drive towards competition outcomes. It needs to understand, however, what the health and NHS purposes of the PPRS are, in the course of its review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para21">
<a name="stpa_272">When the OFT considered the control of entry regulations in regard to pharmacies, it went away and thought about competition, and came up with a set of solutions. There was then a big row about the consequences because it had not taken fully into account the NHS purposes involved. Perhaps the answer is that we should derive all the competition benefits and, if the NHS wants other things, such as research, to happen, we might just have to pay more for that. Perhaps we should pay much more through the science and technology budgets to encourage companies to undertake their R and D here, and defray many more of the costs that they would otherwise meet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para22">
<a name="stpa_273">I am absolutely sure that because the PPRS is not a statutory scheme&#151;it is all voluntary&#151;it is very difficult for us to get a handle on anything that happens in it. That is not necessarily because the Government and the industry are secretive; it is because there is no mechanism for the scheme to be examined. I am asking for a mechanism&#151;perhaps operated through the Select Committee&#151;by which we can examine the fitness for purpose of the PPRS. We should do this over the next year, not in three years&#039; time, when any such examination would become confused with the question of the negotiations. It would be better to examine in theory what the PPRS is intended to do, before we arrive at the next PPRS negotiations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-25_para23">
<a name="stpa_274">Having said all that, I believe that the Select Committee has done an excellent job that has resulted in real, positive benefits in terms of the reporting of adverse events and the promotion of a new code of practice throughout the industry. I hope that the report will also lead to the more open and responsible use of clinical trial data and to the establishment of a scientific community 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1066</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is able to give us a much better idea of what works and what does not, because we depend dramatically on the output of the industry.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to this excellent debate. I, too, congratulate former and current members of the Select Committee on its report. I should like to add my own words of praise to those of the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) about the Committee&#039;s former Chairman, David Hinchliffe. Mr. Hinchliffe was very generous with his advice to me after I got this job, and I hope to be able to benefit from some of it this afternoon. I want to put on the record my thanks and praise for him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) rightly began by saying that the House should be interested in an industry that develops new medicines from which we all benefit, and on which the national health service spends about &#163;10&nbsp;billion a year. Thousands of patients survive diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease from which they would probably have died in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">The industry is in no small part responsible for the extraordinary advances that the chief executive of the NHS was able to mention in his report, which was published yesterday. He was able to state, for instance, that over the past few years mortality rates for cardiovascular disease had fallen by more than 31&nbsp;per cent., and that those for cancer had fallen by 14&nbsp;per cent. I am sure that the whole House will wish to congratulate the staff of the NHS on the way in which they have harnessed our investment and reform to produce such remarkable results, with the help of Britain&#039;s pharmaceutical industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">My right hon. Friend presented an excellent summary of an excellent report, but before I respond to his points in detail, I want to deal with some of the points made by other Members. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) is a direct beneficiary of some of the pioneering developments produced by the pharmaceutical industry. She referred to a number of issues involved in drug promotion, such as ghost-writing, regulation and Herceptin. I was pleased to learn of her concern about some of the future financing implications for the NHS. Fiscal rectitude does not commonly feature in Liberal Democrat speeches, but I welcome its emergence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">The hon. Lady made an important point about inappropriate promotion of medicines. The MHRA can and does take action against the practice. She mentioned the inappropriate promotion of iPods. In that case the MHRA took action to stop the offer and require corrective statements to be made by the publication in which it appeared. Like a number of other Members, the hon. Lady mentioned the ABPI code. The code has been strengthened, but the key point is that it is underpinned by statutory controls, including criminal sanctions for breach of advertising regulations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) made an important contribution. His speech was well informed, well argued and backed by good evidence, as&#151;I have come to learn&#151;are all his speeches. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1067</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>He also spoke with great passion. He presented a powerful argument about the medicalisation of society. The Government made their position clear in the public health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health: making healthier choices easier&quot;. In the White Paper, we emphasised the need for the NHS to become a health improvement and prevention service. We are tackling that in a number of ways, putting health and prevention at the centre of our national service frameworks but also giving primary care trusts real means with which to tackle health inequalities and improve health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">My hon. Friend highlighted a dilemma. On the one hand, speed is needed in the licensing of drugs&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, in particular, mentioned that&#151;on the other hand, there is the need for safety. In that context my hon. Friend cited Vioxx, with which I shall deal later. There are real conflicts and dilemmas, and it was right for my hon. Friend to draw our attention to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">The hon. Member for Southend, West made a fascinating speech. I cannot wait to see those photographs: I look forward to the arrival of the December edition of <i>The House Magazine</i>. He mentioned issues relating to the ABPI code, with which I shall deal in a moment. He also referred to NICE funding, MHRA statutory controls and industry sponsorship. Let me deal first with the NICE budgets, which were also mentioned by the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">The Government created NICE for a reason, and recognise the value of its work. Its contribution to the health debate has been extraordinary over the past few years. The NHS and international medical science have benefited from its work. Like all arm&#039;s-length bodies, however, it has been asked to make savings in its back-office and accommodation costs. We have taken great care to protect the budget for its core work: the budget for 2004&#150;05&nbsp;is some &#163;30&nbsp;million. We are confident that NICE can deliver its challenging work programme within the existing envelope of those resources. It is, of course, for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider future spending in the spending review that will start next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">The issue of statutory powers is important. From 1&nbsp;January 2005, the MHRA has required pharmaceutical companies to provide all the evidence. The powers have always been robust, but the new requirement to notify the MHRA without delay of all new information impacting on risks and benefits is, I think, very important and the Select Committee will welcome it. Failure to provide such information is a criminal offence to which the sanction of unlimited fines and imprisonment applies. It was right for the Select Committee to highlight that matter. The new measures introduced from the beginning of this year will go some way to addressing some of its concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">The hon. Member for Southend, West mentioned Herceptin, as did the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Windsor. As we know, it has received considerable publicity from our constituents and also in the media. The drug is already licensed for women with advanced breast cancer, but not yet for those with early breast cancer. As the hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for South Cambridgeshire said, a number of oncologists have pointed to its quite extraordinary potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">It is already possible for clinicians to prescribe a drug outside licensing indications. It is then down to individual clinicians to decide whether it is suitable to prescribe a specific drug after discussions with patients, taking into account the potential risks, not least those suggested by the patient&#039;s medical history. Primary care trusts then have to be involved, as they have to decide whether to support a clinician&#039;s decision and supply the drug at NHS expense. They will have to take a range of factors, including the circumstances of the individual patient, into account in taking those decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">The position that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State sketched out is really threefold. At the moment&#151;pre-licence and pre-NICE&#151;it is for individual clinicians to consider with patients whether Herceptin is an appropriate course of treatment. Secondly, PCTs should not rule out treatment in principle, but should consider individual circumstances in taking their decisions. Thirdly, PCTs should not refuse to fund Herceptin solely on the grounds of cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) made a number of important points about parallel trade. It is, of course, a legitimate trade that is allowed under EU law, but there are controls on it. If safety concerns arise out of parallel trade, I am sure that the MHRA will be keen to know about them and will subsequently investigate. My hon. Friend trained as an organic chemist, so I know that he is well qualified to comment about the risks in the process of counterfeiting. I completely agree that it is a growing concern. The MHRA is working with regulators worldwide to combat what is an international problem. Evidence at the moment suggests that incidence in the UK is low, and tools are in place, carrying criminal sanctions, to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">We certainly cannot afford to be complacent about that problem, particularly in the light of growing internet sales. I completely share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East about the potential risk to the public. Public and patients are well advised to exercise great caution in purchasing medicines on the internet. My hon. Friend will know that the MHRA has had considerable success in taking action against illegal internet sales, which has been extensively covered in the media this week. It remains a difficult area to police and the MHRA continues to find new ways of impacting on illegal sales. I am sure that, as the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) suggested, that matter will benefit from our further attention on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) talked about many matters, particularly highlighting the need to align industry research priorities with NHS public health aims. As we are spending about &#163;10&nbsp;billion a year, that is not an unreasonable expectation. The Government found the Select Committee&#039;s conclusion extremely helpful. One of the ways in which we are taking its recommendations forward is through the UK&#039;s clinical research collaboration. As a first step, we have asked that a futures forum be held, to bring together many of the key stakeholders to advise Ministers on the future priorities for innovation in health care. The forum will be held in 2006&nbsp;and it will be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1069</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>informed by the results of an ongoing strategic analysis of current research, funded by partner organisations. The pharmaceutical industry will be included, and the report will be available next spring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_290">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest spoke about Vioxx with some import. Vioxx is an important part of the debate, particularly if we contrast the associated issues with those associated with Herceptin. There is a central dilemma and we are very grateful to the Committee for highlighting it. My questions, and those of other Ministers, are essentially the same as the Committee&#039;s. Why did pre-licence clinical trials not illustrate some of the problems? Were the trials long enough? Why did spontaneous adverse reporting not show up some of the problems post-introduction? As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West asked, what lessons can be learned to mitigate the possibility of such problems occurring again?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_291">Like Herceptin, Vioxx was seen as an incredibly important drug. It had the potential to provide an important level of pain relief and it did not have the side-effects associated with many existing drugs. The pre-clinical trials did not show up all the various problems and although there were differences with the placebo group, they were on a pretty shallow curve. Indeed, it can take up to 18&nbsp;months for some of the side-effects to become apparent. That said, patients were obviously anxious for this new and potentially very valuable drug to come on to the market as quickly as possible. Adverse reporting was not going to help because many of the associated side-effects can be attributed to underlying patient conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_292">Since then, an extremely important change has occurred. From the end of October this year, the licensing requirements for new drugs include the requirement for a risk-management plan, which must be agreed with licensing authorities. It can stipulate a range of requirements to monitor the effects and side-effects of new drugs, so for the first time, regulators have a degree of latitude in specifying, for example, the long-term clinical trials necessary in the new drugs field. That was an important issue for the Committee to highlight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_293">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest also discussed the promotion of new medicines. The ABPI code now restricts promotion on the launch of new products, but to underpin that code the MHRA is vetting the advertising material for new drugs. However, we will monitor the new measures and if they do not deliver the change that the Committee and the Government are looking for, we will have to look again at the current controls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_294">Expert advisory groups is another important issue that was raised. The Committee on Safety of Medicines will have expert advisory groups&#151;some 14&nbsp;of them&#151;and they are in the process of being appointed. As Members know, the Government adhere very closely to the Nolan principles, so the appointments being made&#151;from some 400&nbsp;to 500&nbsp;candidates and from every area of expertise, including lay members&#151;will take a little longer. In the meantime, however, the committee can call on the expertise of an external panel of experts in order to cover specialist areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_295">The hon. Member for Broxbourne, who has worked at the coal face of many of the issues that we have discussed today, raised the question of SSRIs, as did my 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1070</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West. The UK has gone further and has acted much faster in reviewing SSRIs than any regulator worldwide. The CSM&#039;s expert working group&#039;s report, which was published a year ago almost to the day, has been recognised as the most thorough review of a class of medicines ever undertaken. It resulted in new advice&#151;backed by an unprecedented release of summaries of clinical trial data&#151;which was published alongside NICE guidelines. The MHRA continues to monitor the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and this week issued new advice on the use of Seroxat in pregnancy. I do not think that that is a record of complacency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_296">I turn now to the points of substance contained in the Select Committee report, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley spelled out with great eloquence. If I may, I shall take a slight detour through the vexed question of how many conclusions and recommendations the Government have accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para22">
<a name="stpa_297">From what I understand, the Select Committee report grouped a number of recommendations into one overall recommendation. The Government responded to all the recommendations, and to the sub-recommendations that they contained. Of the 32&nbsp;recommendations, 26&nbsp;were accepted in full or in part. I know that the Government response took some time, but the Committee took 10&nbsp;months to write the report, and it was felt that the response needed proper consideration. After all, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley said, this is the first such report for many years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para23">
<a name="stpa_298">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley raised various points, and I shall try to deal with each in turn. First, he asked about MHRA governance arrangements, an issue also highlighted by the hon. Member for Southend, West. When it was reviewed by the National Audit Office, the MHRA&#151;which was then known as the Medicines Control Agency&#151;was found to be a major contributor to public health in the UK. That was a welcome finding, as was the assessment that it was a world leader in some respects, such as in the field of drug safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para24">
<a name="stpa_299">The agency is tackling directly some of the issues raised in the NAO report, and the Government response strongly welcomes the Select Committee&#039;s suggestion that there should be a further review once current reforms have bedded in. In addition, and as is to be expected, Ministers continue to monitor the MHRA&#039;s performance. The agency has been strengthened by the adoption of many new internal controls of its own, which will ensure that the agency remains independent and its staff free of conflict.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para25">
<a name="stpa_300">Nevertheless, I welcome the suggestion from my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley that the House should monitor the agency&#039;s progress closely. I am sure that his proposal that the House and the Select Committee should provide input in respect of the review&#039;s terms of reference will be of great interest to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para26">
<a name="stpa_301">As part of the ongoing reform process, the MHRA recently revised its medicines advisory committee structure. The Commission on Human Medicines came into being on 1&nbsp;November. It is not a direct result of the Select Committee report, but it does deal with some of the issues raised in that report. For example, each 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1071</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>advisory committee now contains two lay members, to ensure that wider judgments are made about risk benefit as well as about medical and scientific matters. Importantly, the new structure allows the patient voice to be heard in the regulatory process, and the rules on the interests of committee members have also been strengthened. As a result, the new committee&#039;s chairman and members will not be allowed to hold financial interests in the pharmaceutical industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para27">
<a name="stpa_302">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley also raised issues to do with promotion and industry information, both pre and post-licensing, and six or seven points are relevant in that context. First, since the Government&#039;s response was published, much progress has been made on ensuring high standards in the promotion of medicine. For instance, initial advertising is now vetted before publication.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para28">
<a name="stpa_303">Secondly, the agency has delivered on its commitment to agree a memorandum of understanding with the prescription industry&#039;s self-regulatory body, which was published last month. Thirdly, and as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire pointed out, the ABPI code has now been strengthened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para29">
<a name="stpa_304">Fourthly, a great deal of progress has been made in improving the quality of patient information, about which the hon. Member for Wyre Forest spoke most cogently. I have not had the benefit of visiting Australia to see how matters are handled there, but if I behave myself that opportunity may be afforded me at some time in the future.


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para30">
<a name="stpa_305">The issue of promoting information to patients is important, especially in a world in which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) mentioned, people are beginning to buy products on the internet. The new requirement for user testing of information in patient information leaflets came into force in the UK in July, ahead of the time frame in European law. That will deliver potentially the most powerful tool to ensure that the needs of patients are properly met. In the same month, the expert group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines published its report, &quot;Always read the leaflet&quot;, with new guidance on user testing, risk communication and, importantly, the usability of patient information leaflets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para31">
<a name="stpa_306">The fifth measure was on the safety monitoring of medicines, to which many hon. Members referred. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley mentioned, patients and members of the public have been able to report suspected adverse drug reactions through the yellow card scheme since January 2005. Since then, around 750&nbsp;yellow card reports from patients and members of the public have been received. Since the Committee reported, the UK-wide patient reporting pilot was launched in October, developed on the basis of considerable engagement with stakeholders, and supported by a major promotional campaign.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para32">
<a name="stpa_307">The sixth area, which many hon. Members on both sides of the House will welcome, is the registration of clinical trials. The Health Committee argued in favour of the registration of all clinical trials and the publication of the results of trials. The Government largely accept that argument. We fully support the case for transparency and accountability, and we are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1072</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>working nationally and internationally to get the principles applied in practice. A number of important developments have taken place in the past year, and it is now clear that the movement towards registering trials and providing much better public access to research evidence about safety and effectiveness is unstoppable. Much of the momentum comes from a shared aim of the Government and the industry to build public confidence. International pharmaceutical industry associations have made public commitments, which have been strengthened by the understandings in the UK. At the same time, the World Health Organisation is working on standards for trial registration and international agreement on systems to give easy access to information, and the European Medicines Agency is about to launch a public database called EuroPharm. We very much welcome all those developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para33">
<a name="stpa_308">To go further, however, the Government strongly support more openness and transparency in the regulation of medicines. The MHRA is making good progress in that field, as we highlighted in our response. A communication strategy is now in place, which considers how we raise the profile of the agency and increase the understanding of medicines-related issues among the general public. In our published regulatory information, all newly licensed programmes will be accompanied by a UK public assessment report, which will be posted on the MHRA website. The agency also regularly publishes summaries of clinical trial data to support key communications on drug safety, along with all details of adverse drug reactions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para34">
<a name="stpa_309">Several Members, such as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne and my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, mentioned the report in <i>The Observer</i> a week or two ago about the alleged case of research misconduct involving a comparative study of two drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis. The MHRA is investigating that at the request of the chief medical officer. The aim of the investigation is to establish whether there has been an abuse of the regulations governing clinical trials, but it will also seek to establish whether legislation requiring companies to submit immediately to the MHRA any new information that might affect the risk-benefit balance of the product has been breached. The Government view that as a very serious matter&#151;false research can lead to the wrong treatment being given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para35">
<a name="stpa_310">For academics who might be involved, who are not part of a profession, criminal sanctions are not yet available. At the moment, we rely on employers to take action. That is why we warmly welcome Universities UK&#039;s initiative in setting up a UK panel for research integrity in health and biomedical science. One of its functions will be to help research employers, including universities, the NHS and industry, to take effective action against allegations of scientific misconduct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para36">
<a name="stpa_311">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, in his concluding remarks, highlighted the need for speed in introducing drugs to market. That is something that is being addressed in part through the ministerial industry steering group, which brings together leaders from the pharmaceutical industry and Ministers to consider issues that might impact on the industry. One of those issues is how regulation can be adopted to accelerate the pace of introduction of new drugs to market, including what kind of controls are needed and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1073</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>how can we gather safety data to avoid scares such as the withdrawal of Vioxx. We have to keep in mind the balance between public safety and the difference that new drugs can make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para37">
<a name="stpa_312">The issue of NICE is part and parcel of that. I have dealt with the question of its funding and it is now out to public consultation on fast-track assessment on single therapies. Those assessments will sit alongside full appraisals. NICE is now prioritising its work plan to ensure that new needs are met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para38">
<a name="stpa_313">I welcome much of the Committee&#039;s report, but I also welcome much of what the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said. He was right, in particular, to say that connecting for health has extraordinary power to help. I know that I am not supposed to say this in the new mood of consensus that has broken out on the Floor of the House, but connecting for health is not free. Its future rests on investment&#151;the kind of investment that is precluded by policies such as the patient&#039;s passport. After the events of the past two days, I look forward to hearing about its future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-26_para39">
<a name="stpa_314">We have had a useful, lively debate this afternoon. The pharmaceutical industry brings enormous benefits to this country, to patients and the NHS and to the economy.

 If we are going to break the consensus, I shall ask the Minister this question. The Prime Minister at one point pledged that 1.5&nbsp;per cent. of the NHS budget would be devoted to research and development. When will that happen?

 I am sorry to see that the consensus has collapsed as quickly as a souffl&#233;.

It is an issue of great importance not only to the NHS, but to the country, which is why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced such bold proposals to increase funding in that area by, potentially, more than &#163;1&nbsp;billion over the next few years.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_315">It is important that the relationship between the health service, the Government and the pharmaceutical industry is transparent. It is also important that continued investment goes into new drugs. Those drugs will be vital as we put record investment into the NHS over the next two or three years so that we can continue to make the advances that we have made in the battle against big killer diseases.

<a name="51208-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_318">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) mentioned all-party groups. Had this debate taken place six weeks ago, I would have had to declare that I was the chairman of the all-party group on the pharmaceutical industry, which I was for eight years.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_319">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West will know that the ABPI provides the secretariat of the all-party group. In all the years that I have had dealings with the ABPI, I never thought that it was trying to get me to come here and argue its case. If that is what it was after, it failed quite miserably in many areas. But over the years it has given me, and many other hon. Members of this House and the other place, the opportunity to discuss issues relating to the industry, whether animal testing or any of the other things that have happened. We were able to question it and the professionals involved on issues related to what is, and will always remain, I hope, a very important sector of the British economy and an industry that looks after the health of many hundreds of thousands of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_320">Over many years, as my hon.

<a name="stpa_321">I declared that I am a lay member of the General Medical Council, the regulatory body for doctors. I was at the GMC on Tuesday on Euston road and had an exchange of letters with the chief executive about this debate. I was not able to have a long discussion with him, but he wrote to me on the recommendation to keep a register of members&#039; interests, for want of a better expression.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1075</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_322">There are about 230,000&nbsp;doctors registered with the GMC and we think that about 130,000&nbsp;have an active role. Many have retired but remain on the register, as that was a big part of their professional career and they would like to keep their names on the register. The chief executive, Finlay Scott, said that the GMC as a regulatory body&#151;unlike the Royal College of Nursing, which is a membership association, or trade union, for want of a better expression, without the GMC&#039;s statute&#151;lays down conditions under which doctors have to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_323">The publication &quot;Good Medical Practice&quot;&#151;often described as the doctors&#039; bible&#151;clearly states what doctors should and should not be doing. The chief executive reiterated the section to me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;You must act in your patients&#039; best interests when making referrals and providing or arranging treatment or care. So you must not ask for or accept any inducement, gift or hospitality, which may affect or be seen to affect your judgment. You should not offer such inducements to colleagues.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_324">If doctors breach those rules, they go before a fitness to practice committee, with the likelihood of action being taken against them&#151;they could even be struck off the medical register&#151;but that has not happened during my six years&#039; experience of serving on the GMC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_325">The new ABPI code of conduct has been mentioned. The ABPI is a trade organisation that works well with the Government, but it is not a statutory body and therefore cannot issue statutory codes. Given all that is said about Members of Parliament enjoying BA upgrades, kettles calling pots black come into mind, so I shall move on from that because a lot has been said about patient safety and drug efficacy that does not hold water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_326">I shall briefly deal with what the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said about the PPRS. Paragraphs 113&nbsp;to 120&nbsp;of the report explain in reasonable detail what the PPRS does. That is the most transparent translation of the PPRS that I have seen in over a decade of being involved in one way or another in the House with the pharmaceutical industry. We have gone about as far as we can go with the PPRS. If we were to make it totally transparent, the companies would be looking over their shoulders asking why one of them receives more on one scale and less on another than the others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_327">The PPRS is not the most transparent scheme and it is not a statutory one. The Government and the industry sit down together, and they have recently reached another decision that will benefit the NHS, inasmuch as they agreed that more money will come from it. I am not tempted by the suggestion to take a further look at the PPRS that was made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. I may have to be tempted by members of the Committee if they decide that we should take a further look at it. However, making the scheme more transparent would probably destroy something that no one argues is detrimental to their case. I have spent a decade visiting pharmaceutical companies and having dialogue with them, and I have never yet met anyone with any weight in the pharmaceutical industry debate who says that we should get rid of the PPRS.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1076</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="51208-27_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I have not suggested getting rid of the PPRS either, but irrespective of whether the right hon. Gentleman thinks that there should be greater openness about the PPRS, frankly, the Office of Fair Trading will ensure that that happens. I was particularly concerned about the fact that past experience has demonstrated that the OFT will do a thorough job on the competition aspects, but it is very important that the Department of Health, the House or somebody thinks very hard about the NHS aspects.
</p>








<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51208-27_spnew9"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 If the OFT drives that, it will happen. The report suggested that the Department of Trade and Industry, not the Department of Health, should be the sponsoring Government organisation, but the Government did not agree with that either. I have some sympathy with the Government&#039;s response, because we get a lot more via the PPRS than we would if accountants considered the industry on the basis of how many pounds it is worth to the United Kingdom. The OFT may take us down that road, but we will have to wait and see. If it does so and the Government respond, the Health Committee will consider what should replace the scheme, but it has great benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_328">I visited Pfizer about 10&nbsp;years ago and was shown the big second phase of its research and development in the UK. The company beat off Pacific rim institutions to bring that work to this country. We chatted about the UK&#039;s science base and what our universities were delivering at that time. Why did Pfizer want to come to this country and invest such massive amounts of money, especially on the north Kent coast? It is not the most attractive place on earth. Apologies to the people who live there&#151;they would probably think the same about my home town. There are reasons why the UK has been so successful&#151;as successful, if not more so, than most European countries&#151;in attracting inward investment for research and development over recent decades and the PPRS has something to do with it, although what is happening with the OFT may overturn that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_329">Some people argue that the scheme is wrong. People who are not aware of the full R and D picture might think that small manufacturers, for example, would be better off without the PPRS, but I think that it is of great benefit. It is no coincidence that the pharmaceutical sector is the third largest in our economy. We shall see what the future brings, but that is my feeling at present. As well as the PPRS, the industry has much wider engagement with the Government.

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="51208-28_spnew1"><b> Andrew Selous  (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 I am especially grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate, which deals with serious issues of public safety. I hope that the Minister will realise how serious these matters are, and that in his response he will be as positive as possible about how to deal with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_338">The problem of multiple road traffic offences, which involves vehicles registered at false or incorrect addresses, has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents. Vehicles that they have never owned and about which they know nothing have been registered at their addresses, with the result that the police have been in contact with them on many occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_339">I want to pay tribute to Bedfordshire police for their persistent action to try to deal with this problem, and specifically to PC Sean Quinn and PC Graham Dunn, who have worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Bedfordshire in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_340">The problem, in essence, is the police&#039;s complete inability to prevent and successfully prosecute repeated road traffic offences of an extremely serious nature. Let me give some examples.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_341">In the case of excessive speed, I have recent documented examples, with photographic evidence, of drivers doing 98&nbsp;mph in a 50&nbsp;mph limit, 117&nbsp;mph in a 50&nbsp;mph limit at night, 73&nbsp;mph in a 30&nbsp;mph at night, and 82&nbsp;mph in a 30&nbsp;mph limit in the middle of Dunstable, a major town in my constituency. The highest recorded speed that has come to my attention was of a vehicle doing 119&nbsp;mph in a 50&nbsp;mph limit, on 4&nbsp;September this year on the A505&nbsp;between Leighton Buzzard, Dunstable and Houghton Regis in my constituency. As I shall explain shortly, such vehicles have been doing those sorts of speeds in those conditions time and again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_342">There is a problem not just with speed, but with vehicles jumping red lights, in some cases up to six seconds late. We know that one vehicle has done that on nine separate occasions, but the police are powerless to do anything about it. The reason that the police are powerless is, as I said, that vehicles are incorrectly registered to false addresses, or cloned, whereby a vehicle of a similar description to that which the perpetrator wants to register to a false address is registered to a law-abiding person&#039;s address. Farmers are often coerced into having their property used as a false postal address. One property in Chelmsford&#151;25&nbsp;Duke street&#151;is notorious among not only Bedfordshire police but Essex police. I understand that it is no more than a drop-off postal address at which many vehicles are registered, apparently legally, but the police have no ability to contact the owners or do anything about the perpetrators of such offences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_343">As well as excessive speeds and going over red lights, there have been examples of extremely dangerous driving, such as people driving with their hands over their face at 64&nbsp;mph at night, people taking their hands completely off the wheel even at night in a 30&nbsp;mph zone, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1080</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a child in the front seat on an adult&#039;s lap with no seat belt, and many offensive gestures made by drivers of vehicles at cameras. In the village of Kensworth in my constituency, which has a speed camera, a photograph was taken of a driver with one hand on the wheel while giving a thumbs up gesture out of the window to the camera with the other. All three other adults in the car are grinning at the camera. That shows that people who behave in such a way know that they can break the law, are flaunting their law-breaking and are taunting the police, who, they know, are powerless to act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_344">The Minister will agree that the danger to the public from the examples that I have given is huge. How would he like people driving in that manner to come close to the vehicle in which he was travelling with his family?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_345">The problem is significant, and the incidents are not isolated. As at 7&nbsp;April this year, the police have evidence of 1,004&nbsp;such offences in south Bedfordshire alone. Of those, 466&nbsp;were current and due to have fines paid of just under &#163;28,000, and 538&nbsp;offences were lost under the six-month rule, so the police had no ability to recoup more than &#163;32,000&nbsp;of fines that will not be paid. Therefore, there is also a public expenditure implication, and I am sure that the Minister would want all fines that have been properly levied to be paid and to come in to the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_346">The powers that are needed to do something about this problem are as follows. The police need to be given the ability to seize a vehicle that is incorrectly registered and involved in multiple offences. The police should then have the power to retain that vehicle until the owner or offender is correctly identified and, if necessary, to dispose of the vehicle by suitable means, not least to pay off any fines levied on it. The police also need a further power of entry to land and/or garages&#151;not dwellings, as people obviously do not keep cars in their houses&#151;to seize such vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_347">As I said, these are repeat offences. Moments before the debate, I was told that one van still on the road in South Bedfordshire has just clocked up its 73rd offence and a motorcycle has clocked up 61&nbsp;offences. When I say &quot;multiple offences&quot;, that is the order that I am talking about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_348">Bedfordshire police have done their homework on this issue and visited the Home Office on 15&nbsp;April. I understand that it was suggested to the police that section 59&nbsp;of the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;should be sufficient for them to be able to address the problem. Bedfordshire police then contacted another five police forces to discover whether they were in the same position of not being able to apply section 59&nbsp;in practice on the ground. Thames Valley police replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;To have power to seize vehicles showing multiple offences, if granted, would indeed be a useful tool in increasing road safety, if the safeguards required did not blunt its effectiveness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can say that we rarely use the Police Reform Act because of the frustrations put upon us by the control room.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_349">Suffolk police replied that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;it could also be extended to cover vehicles owned by foreign nationals. We have a serious problem with transient workers in the food processing industry. They use a single base address to register their vehicle and then quickly move on.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_353">I understand that it has also been suggested that section 43(c) of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, which was put in place by the Serious and Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, has been suggested as a means of dealing with the problem, but I am again reliably informed by the police that that is not the case because that provision deals purely with driving without a valid driving licence and driving without insurance. Most of these vehicles are driven by people with licences and most are insured, so that legislation would not do the job that is required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_354">I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue recently to ask the Secretary of State to make a statement on the effect of the registration of false vehicle licence addresses on the ability of the police to combat multiple road traffic offences.

<a name="stpa_359">I hope that I have outlined the scale of the problem and how serious it is. It is not a party political matter. What can we do about it? The Minister will know that the Road Safety Bill is about to arrive in this House. I have looked carefully at the Bill with Bedfordshire police and I suggest that it should be possible to amend clause 15&#151;the clause deals with speeding, but we need to look at red-light issues and at dangerous driving&#151;on the power to seize, retain and dispose of vehicles. Could we insert in clause 36&nbsp;a requirement to prove one&#039;s address when a vehicle is registered? I know that the Government have looked at this and decided not to go down that route, but given the scale of the problem in my area alone, will the Minister agree to take the issue back, perhaps to a joint working party between the Home Office and the Department for Transport, and look at it again to see whether utility and council tax bills, or documents of that nature, should be required?

 I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) on securing the debate. He began by saying that it raised serious issues of public safety and I agree. Only last week at my advice surgery, I was dealing with a case of death by dangerous driving of a teenage boy in my constituency. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is not a great party political issue. Members on both sides want the police to have adequate powers to tackle irresponsible driving, which poses a danger to all of our constituents. There is a common purpose in wanting that to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_361">I welcome the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman introduced today&#039;s debate. Our responsibility is to ensure that the legislation on the statute book deals adequately with the problem, but is also proportionate. We believe that that is the case. He said at one point that the police were powerless to act. I hope that I can convince him that that is not the case and that the police do have powers to act. We keep those powers under review, but they are proportionate and balanced.
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51208-29_spnew0"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 I have just told the Under-Secretary that six different police forces in different parts of the country have said that, for all sorts of practical reasons that affect police forces on the ground, the powers currently on the statute book are not adequate. He will no doubt tell me what legislation there is on the statute book, but will he address those specific concerns raised by six police forces?
</p>








<p><a name="st_198"><a name="51208-29_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will know that we have changed the law in a number of ways in recent years in respect of irresponsible and dangerous driving, vehicle keeping and the powers that the police have to seize vehicles. The Home Office has received advice from the Association of Chief Police Officers that many forces are using the section 59&nbsp;powers extensively and effectively. I heard the comments from the forces that the hon. Gentleman read out, but some 43&nbsp;police forces have told us that those powers are being used and that they are very welcome in tackling antisocial driving.
</p>








<p><a name="st_199"><a name="51208-29_spnew2"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 I have given the Under-Secretary an illustration from my constituency, where there have been 1,004&nbsp;offences. I can assure him that I have extremely good officers in Bedfordshire who are desperately keen to enforce the law. They are not stupid people; they are very bright and follow the law very carefully. Why are they unable to use the current law to deal with a situation where one vehicle has 73&nbsp;offences charged to it and where there are 1,004&nbsp;in total?
</p>








<p><a name="st_200"><a name="51208-29_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Of course I was listening carefully to the comments that the hon. Gentleman read out. We would want to work through those issues with the forces

I do not doubt for a second the committed efforts of the officers whom he named during his speech and the general efforts of Bedfordshire police. He also mentioned my police force&#151;Greater Manchester police&#151;and I face issues in my constituency similar to those that he described, and I would want to pursue them with the force from my own perspective. I assure him that the advice that we have received via ACPO is that the powers are welcomed and that they are being used. If there are problems in certain areas, it is important that we work them out. We have a common interest in ensuring that the powers that the police have at their disposal are used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_362">I want to read out a comment from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s website with which I wholeheartedly agree. He gave notice on his website that he would seek a change to the Road Safety Bill that will soon come before us, but he also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;I would like the government to concentrate on enforcing the laws we have on the statute book, rather than continually passing new laws.&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_363">That is absolutely the right position with regard to this issue, and the important thing is to focus on fully implementing the laws that we already have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_364">Let me set out some of the background. The hon. Gentleman will know that the roads policing strategy statement was issued jointly by the Home Office, the Department for Transport and ACPO in January and that reducing the antisocial use of the roads is one of the five specific actions on which the statement envisages that roads policing should focus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_365">Before I deal with some of the specific issues that the hon. Gentleman raised about seizure and the use of false addresses, I want to stress that the key to enforcing the law is ensuring that we have an accurate vehicle register. He is right to focus on that. Vehicles that are registered with incorrect details or not registered at all are regularly used in criminal and antisocial activities. They are often subsequently abandoned or burnt out&#151;I am sure that he has experience of those problems, too&#151;with further costs to local authorities. For the police to track and take effective action against the perpetrators, there must be an accurate register for identification purposes. It is an offence not to supply the relevant details for correct registration, but, of course, we cannot rely just on the willingness of the people who behave in that way to comply with the law. That is why we steadily strengthened the accuracy of the register.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_366">A major step forward was the introduction of continuous registration, to which the hon. Gentleman referred and under which the registered keeper of a vehicle has statutory responsibility for licensing it and retains that responsibility until the DVLA is informed that the vehicle has been sold, exported, stolen or scrapped, or that a valid statutory off-road notification has been made. The registered keeper is therefore responsible for requirements in respect of the vehicle, such as the payment of vehicle excise duty, and cannot now evade them by claiming no longer to be the keeper. The DVLA also takes steps to ensure that false addresses are not accepted. I was listening carefully to

 The address that I mentioned was 25&nbsp;Duke street, Chelmsford, which is some way from my constituency, but it is well-known to the Essex police. It is curious that a number of vehicles in Bedfordshire are registered at that address. Will the Minister tell the House whether he thinks that the current laws on vehicle registration are adequate, given the problems that I have outlined? I am aware that the Government have gone further recently in that respect&#151;of course that is welcome&#151;but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Is the law working and helping the police to do their job?

 That is an important point. I hope that the DVLA will read in <i>Hansard</i> the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments about that address and be able to take some action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_367">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that a procedure introduced in October 2004&nbsp;means that known temporary addresses, addresses of convenience or post office box numbers are not acceptable for vehicle keepership details. When he introduced his remarks, he referred to strengthening the identity checking procedure when a vehicle is registered and he asked whether a utility bill or council tax bill could be used for that purpose. A utility bill does not prove much, however, and as the Minister responsible for identity cards and the national identity register, I urge the hon. Gentleman to think again if he, like his party, still opposes those measures. Linkage with the national identity register could bring real benefits in maintaining an accurate vehicle record. The register is a much higher proof of identity than a utility or council tax bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_368">Under a procedure introduced in January 2004, the DVLA undertakes identity checks for high risk vehicles, such as those that are being imported. The checks cover both the vehicle and the prospective keeper. A database of all vehicles with no confirmed keeper is available to the police and can be checked by their automatic number-plate recognition&#151;ANPR&#151;cameras. Once a suspect vehicle has been stopped, the police have access via the police national computer to the full drivers&#039; database to help establish the identity of the driver. The system is being improved&#151;I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we constantly look to improve it&#151;so that the police will have direct access to drivers&#039; details through a handheld device. Trials are scheduled for spring next year, and from 2007&nbsp;we expect the photographic image to be available through those devices in respect of drivers holding a photocard driving licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_369">We think that will be a significant step forward. It will support the already increased roadside enforcement through greater use of police ANPR cameras and through the DVLA&#039;s powers, working with local authorities, to wheel-clamp and crush unlicensed vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_370">In the remaining time for the debate, I want to discuss police powers on seizure, which is an important point and one that the hon. Gentleman wanted to cover.

<a name="stpa_371">If the Minister&#039;s case in the remainder of the debate is that the current powers are adequate, can he give me a simple, clear explanation why Bedfordshire police have been unable to do anything about that one vehicle that has 73&nbsp;serious offences recorded against it? That is the fundamental question. If the law is adequate, why have the police been unable to anything about that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51208-30_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I cannot discuss that case as I do not have the details, but if the hon. Gentleman will allow me to explain the law as it stands perhaps we can agree or disagree about whether the current position is adequate. New legislation is not always necessarily the answer; indeed, the hon. Gentleman himself says that we need to enforce our existing powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_372">Section 59&nbsp;of the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;gives the police the power to seize any motor vehicles being used antisocially and to release them only on payment of prescribed fees. The power exists where a vehicle is being driven both inconsiderately or carelessly on-road, or off-road without authority, contrary to sections 3&nbsp;or 34&nbsp;of the Road Traffic Act 1988, and in such a manner as to cause or to be likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_373">We believe that is a powerful tool. It enables the police to put an immediate stop to the antisocial driving, inconveniences the vehicle users, requires them to meet costs to get the vehicles back and provides a deterrent to further misbehaviour. It does not preclude a prosecution, but nor does it depend on one. Nor should the fact that the driver may be committing some other motoring offence for which he could be prosecuted rule out seizure. The requirement is only that there should be reasonable grounds for believing that he is driving the vehicle contrary to section 34&nbsp;and causing alarm; for example, he could be committing some other offence, such as speeding, at the same time, and could be charged with that in preference to a charge under section 34.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_374">There is a requirement to warn, to give someone a chance to stop misbehaving, which is after all the main purpose of the police intervention. That may be where there is a problem of interpretation in relation to some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. However, that requirement does not apply if it would be impractical to give a warning, and nor does it apply if an earlier warning had been issued on the same occasion to the same or a different person in respect of the same or a different vehicle. It does not apply if at any time during the preceding 12&nbsp;months the person has already been given a warning.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51208-30_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 There is not a great deal of time left. If I can, I want to touch on several other issues that the hon. Gentleman raised.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1086</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_375">To ensure that all forces realised the full potential of the powers available, we issued further guidance a few weeks ago together with examples of best practice&#151;I told the hon. Gentleman that we were doing work in this area. We also made several amendments to the regulations that the police had identified as beneficial by setting out detailed arrangements for seizure, storage and disposal. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the powers exist. The important thing is to ensure that all forces realise the full power of the measures at their disposal and to encourage them to use the powers fully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_376">The power of seizure under the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;is not the only power that is available. Many of the bad drivers who cause such concern are likely to be uninsured, as the hon. Gentleman said, or without a valid licence. Uninsured drivers are more likely than others to be involved in road traffic accidents, to be non-compliant with other road traffic requirements and obligations, and, perhaps, to be involved in other criminal activity. This year, we have taken action through the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005&nbsp;to deal with these problems. The offences are being more readily detected due to the increased use of police ANPR cameras. Until now, however, the only action that the police could take was to issue a fixed penalty notice or a summons. The police now have the power to stop such driving immediately. With effect from July, the police can seize a vehicle if a driver does not produce on demand a valid licence or proof of insurance and they have reasonable grounds for believing that the vehicle is being driven without either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51208-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_377">We are taking further action to address the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has rightly raised. He will know that we propose to create an offence of causing death by careless driving in a Bill that is soon to come before the House. I believe that the measure will be welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the House. We have a good range of powerful and proportionate measures to ensure that the sort of behaviour that we all deplore and that causes so much distress can be effectively addressed. At present, we do not believe that we need to add to those measures, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need to work hard to ensure that the powers that we have are fully used.
