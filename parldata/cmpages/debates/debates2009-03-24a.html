 Developing high-quality community children&#146;s nursing services is crucial to the provision of safe, integrated and comprehensive care in the home or close to home for children with complex or continuing care needs. We are embarking on a wide-ranging programme of action dedicated to transforming community services. Within this programme, we are taking forward a project looking at the benefits and the opportunities arising from investment in community children&#146;s nursing services.</p>

 I know that the Minister is aware that a reception was held in the House earlier this month that was sponsored by the Royal College of Nursing, of which the Minister was a member, and the WellChild charity, which was intended to encourage primary care trusts to employ community children&#146;s nurses in order to help not only children with long-term complex health needs, but their families. Will the Minister tell me what steps the Government are taking to ensure that these nurses are employed, as they will help children and their families to co-ordinate packages of not only medical but local care, which might help them to spend more time at home rather than commuting to hospital on a regular basis, as this is often painful to them?</p>

 It is quite difficult to get reliable figures on how many people withdraw from private health care, as it is obviously a matter for the private sector itself. A few months ago, Laing and Buisson said&#151;the hon. Gentleman may have picked it up&#151;that there has been a 10 per cent. reduction in people deciding to pay privately for their operations, but that actually preceded the economic downturn. Laing and Buisson believes that it has more to do with the very short waiting times on the NHS: there is now almost no difference at all between waiting times in the NHS and waiting times in the private sector. We are confident that, given the increase in investment that the NHS will receive over the next two years, even if all the people in this country choose to use NHS care&#151;I hope that they would like to do so, given the short waiting times&#151;the NHS will be able to cope very well.</p>

There has been a remarkable turnaround, so I would like to pay tribute not only to the management of the PCT in my hon.

 Yes. Labour Members certainly do not agree with the Conservatives that a recession is good for people&#146;s health. We know from experience both in this country and abroad that when it comes to such issues as mental health, more men consult their GPs if they are unemployed. That can be an advantage, as men are notoriously reluctant to seek health care and advice. However, as my hon. Friend will know, mental health funding has risen by 40 per cent. in real terms in the last seven years. We do not think that the recession should just take its course, we do not think that it is a price worth paying, and we will be there to ensure that the NHS supports people who may be affected by the economic downturn.</p>

 The national dementia strategy covers a range of services, but it emphasises the importance of early diagnosis. We intend every area in the country&#151;including the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency&#151;to contain memory clinics, to which suitably trained GPs will refer people who show early symptoms of dementia. There they can be given an accurate diagnosis and assessment&#151;as there are different forms of dementia&#151;and then receive the specialist help and intervention that they require. We know that early intervention enables us to help people with dementia and their carers, and to ensure that people live much better with their dementia and stay in their own homes for longer.</p>

He and the all-party group have made their welcome for the new dementia strategy public, and I am grateful for that.

It is right that we need to ensure that people, whether in hospitals&#151;nurses and doctors&#151;or in care homes, have the right skills, knowledge and understanding of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. That is why the dementia strategy states that a senior member of the hospital or care home should be responsible for ensuring that all staff in the hospital or care home know and understand the needs of people with dementia, so that they can ensure that the response that people get is the best response to meet their needs. It is certainly a matter for both the NHS and social care sector that staff be properly trained.

Interventions that help that to happen for as long as possible are always in the best interests of the patient. What we need to include, of course, is support for the carers. Respite care is critical. He is right to say that more money has been provided for the next two years. It has been put into PCT baseline budgets.

Therefore, it is important that front-line staff such as GPs are better trained to spot the early symptoms. If they are not a specialist themselves, and many of them are not, it is important that they refer people to the specialist memory clinics in their areas, which can conduct a proper diagnosis. It is not just about conveying the diagnosis but about the way in which that is communicated to people with dementia and to their family, which can be an important part of coping and living well with dementia.

I must press the Minister, however; he has just said that he will hold a summit in July, and that is very welcome, but the Government have already announced that there will be no new money for research into dementia. How can he justify that decision?</p>

 We had a good meeting with the Prime Minister, who takes a personal interest in these matters and who met Terry Pratchett. I must put on record the huge courage Terry Pratchett is displaying in allowing everyone to see how he is coping with the disease&#151;with the diagnosis and then with living with the early stages. Indeed, many public figures have now been talking about their experiences. That is an important part of the process of raising awareness among the professions and the wider community about this disease and its consequences, and how we can help people live with it. On research, the Wellcome Trust is spending &#163;30 million this year and more money is going into research. We need to ensure that before the summit we have done an analysis of all the research that is going on, and where the evidence base is insufficient or has gaps in it, so that we can plan and direct our resources to those areas where research will be most effective.</p>

 Whenever the chief executive of a failing trust, such as the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, is suspended it raises questions about where responsibility really lies.

Is that not particularly the case in the light of the letter in <i> The Times</i><i> </i>today from Dr. Howard Baderman, a retired accident and emergency consultant who wrote two reports for the Department of Health?

We put patient safety first&#151;we put it at the forefront of everything. I believe that the Patients Association will be reassured, not just with the Healthcare Commission report but with the three other reviews that are going on, and with the clear demonstrable fact that there is a very clear focus on finding out what happened at Stafford and why it happened&#151;there is still an awful mystery to much of that&#151;and on ensuring that we put the problems right, so that local residents can be assured that they have a safe hospital.</p>

 I ask the hon. Gentleman to look at the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report carefully. The difference between what happened in Stafford and in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, and the fact that the Healthcare Commission took into account those words and what others said at the time, is that as soon as commission staff went into Stafford and saw the problems&#151;in May 2008&#151;they immediately called the chief executive to a meeting, put their concerns to him, and started to see the process of improvement. That is the job of the Healthcare Commission while it carries out its inquiry. The staff cannot say at that stage that they have come to any conclusions, and it would be unfair, one day into an inquiry, to reach conclusions and say that heads must roll and recommendations must be made. We made that specific point to the Healthcare Commission at the time of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, so in Stafford staff immediately introduced measures to put things right, rather than wait for the end of the process and the report to be published&#151;as I said they should do in that quote.</p>

 I put it to the Secretary of State that he should look at the appendix to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report and the letter of 23 May 2008 that was received by his Department. If he meant anything by saying that incompetent chief executives should be got rid of at the point at which one becomes aware of them, it should have been done then, but the Department failed to do it. The Secretary of State has to understand that there was a failure, not just within the trust, but within the agencies charged with commissioning, performance management and performance assessment, up to and including the Department itself.</p>

 We discussed this last week and there was no mention of an independent inquiry by the Opposition. The hon.

Its decision&#151;as an independent regulator&#151;was not to do so. It would have been quite wrong of Ministers to rush immediately to dismiss or discipline a chief executive when we did not even have any evidence from the Healthcare Commission.

Stafford, but campaigners have drawn attention to many difficulties at the hospital over a very long period of time. The problem is that the board is stacked with accountants and solicitors who are not elected or responsible and who take no notice of what is going on. That is why we have ended up with what can only be called a tragedy. Will my right hon.

 I do not think that any neutral assessment of the Healthcare Commission report would conclude that the answer to the problem at Stafford would be to get rid of foundation trust status. However, my hon. Friend is right that the manager and the board at Stafford were seeking foundation trust status. To achieve that, incidentally, they had to put the trust into a proper financial position and save &#163;4 million. They decided to save &#163;12 million, and that is why there was one consultant and not four in the accident and emergency department, and why the hospital had three rather than 12 matrons. It is also why in the emergency assessment unit there was one nurse for every 15 patients, whereas most hospitals of that size have one for every six. Given that 85 per cent. of foundation trusts were considered to be excellent in their provision of services, it would be quite wrong to smear them with what happened in a badly managed and under-staffed hospital.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that answer. I have consulted locally with constituents about the NHS in our area, and in general the feedback has been very good. I visited an excellent, fabulous facility for young people with acute mental health needs that is attached to my local hospital, but constituents have raised with me the issue of community support for young people with mental health needs. What progress is being made to provide community support for those young people in the area, and what I can tell my constituents on the issue?</p>

 I had the pleasure of visiting my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency a few weeks ago. Newham was in fact a national demonstrator site for the development of new psychological therapies and a whole range of new services, and I was extremely impressed by what I saw. I congratulate her on the work that she does in her constituency to support the development of those services. In Newham, 16 staff are part of an early intervention team that helps young people between the ages of 14 and 35 with assessment and care. In particular, it tries to prevent those young people from being admitted to hospital at the first onset of psychosis or some other form of mental illness. Those new early intervention teams&#151;a major investment&#151;are matched by other teams that handle crisis resolution in homes, and outreach in the community.

 The picture around the rest of the country may not be not quite so rosy. Figures show that the number of people admitted to hospital for intentional self-harm has increased by a third in the past five years, from 74,000 to 97,000. More than 4,000 of those admissions were of children under the age of 14. One in eight women admitted to self-harm in 2007, an 80 per cent. increase since 2000. Figures released by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children yesterday show that the number of suicidal children ringing the helpline ChildLine has tripled in the past five years.

 I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns.

The issues that she highlights are serious and need to be addressed. I am pleased that the suicide rate in England continues to fall. It is now at its lowest since records began in 1861, and is among the lowest in Europe. I am also pleased that the World Health Organisation said:</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to say that we inherited a pretty poor show from the Conservatives after they were in power for 18 years. We are endeavouring to increase the quality of mental health services. This year is the last year of the national service framework for mental health, and it is the year in which we intend to look forward to establishing a new strategy for mental health services. Building on the success that we have had so far, we will be launching our New Horizons project to go out to consultation to enable us to hear throughout the country what more we can do to embed success in our mental health services, and to go further to ensure that we have mentally healthy communities more widely so that the public health system, as well as specialist services, reach the quality of care that we wish every individual to be able to receive across the country.</p>

 Incidents of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in my three local hospitals have drastically reduced in the last few months, but will the Secretary of State look at the methodology currently used for determining incidents of MRSA in hospitals? In Barnsley, we had an incident where a patient had an infection after his pacemaker had been fitted in an independent treatment centre. Because it took some time to discover how he had been infected in the hospital, the infection was counted as three separate incidents of MRSA for that same patient. That seems a bit unfair to me, so will my right hon. Friend look into that?</p>

 My hon.

He raises an important point, and one case of MRSA, clostridium difficile or any hospital-acquired infection is one case too many.

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="90324-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09032430000325"><h5 align="left">3.37 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="09032430000148"><a name="90324-0004.htm_spmin1"><a name="09032430000445"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith):</b>
 I have today published the revised version of the Government&#146;s strategy for countering international terrorism. Protecting the safety of everybody in Britain is the primary duty, and the abiding obligation, of Government. Recent events in Northern Ireland were a chilling reminder that the threat of terrorism has not left our shores, and they demonstrated the need to continue to adapt our approach so that we can deal with that threat wherever it emerges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09032430000149">As we set out in our Contest strategy today, the greatest security threat that we face comes from al-Qaeda and related groups and individuals. Our aim is to reduce the risk to the UK and our interests overseas from international terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence. We know that the threat is severe and that an attack is highly likely and could happen without warning at any time. We know that this new form of terrorism is different in scale and nature from the terrorist threats that we have had to deal with in recent decades. This new form of terrorism is rooted in conflicts overseas and the fragility of some states and grounded in an extremist ideology that uses violence to further its ends. It exploits the opportunities created by modern technologies and seeks to radicalise young people into violent extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09032430000150">The threat now comes from the al-Qaeda leadership and its immediate associates, located mainly on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, as well as from its affiliates and from others, including rogue individuals, who espouse similar views. As hon. Members throughout the House will know, not least my predecessors as Home Secretary, on whose important work this strategy builds, those groups have planned a succession of attacks against the UK with the aim of causing mass casualties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09032430000151">Thanks to the hard work and dedication of thousands of people, to whom I pay tribute, we have had considerable success in stopping terrorists in their tracks and bringing those responsible to justice. We have disrupted more than a dozen attempted terrorist plots in the UK and, since 2001, almost 200 people have been convicted of terrorist-related offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09032430000152">However, the threat remains and is always evolving. The strategy takes that into account, draws on what we have learned about how to counter it, and reflects the increased resources that we have rightly made available to keep Britain safe. In recent years, the number of police dedicated to counter-terrorism work has grown from 1,700 to 3,000. The Security Service has doubled in size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09032430000153">We have trained tens of thousands of people throughout the country to prepare for and protect against a terrorist attack, and we are working with communities to prevent the spread of violent extremism. We currently spend &#163;2.5 billion on countering terrorism. By 2011, that will rise to &#163;3.5 billion&#151;the majority will be spent on the main focus of work: pursuing terrorists wherever they are and stopping their attacks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09032430000154">The Contest strategy remains centred on four key areas&#151;Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare. We have updated each of them. Pursue will make use of the new resources and new legislation available to the intelligence  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09032430000155">Prevent will reach more people than ever, as we step up our efforts to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting violent extremism.

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09032430000156">Protect aims to strengthen our defences against an attack through a strong border, improved resilience in our critical national infrastructure and greater protection for the crowded places where we all live, work, shop and play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09032430000157">Prepare will limit the impact of any attacks that occur, with tens of thousands of emergency services workers, security guards, store managers and others trained and equipped to deal with an incident. Every region of the country now has plans to deal with an attack, improve our ability to recover and ensure a return to normal as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09032430000158">There is also dedicated cross-Government work on the specific threat posed by terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons and explosives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09032430000159">The vital work to counter terrorism cannot be done by central Government, the police and agencies working alone. That is why the revised strategy is based on work right across central and devolved Government and local government, and with our international partners and local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09032430000160">In addressing both the immediate threats and their longer-term causes&#151;and how we will deliver action locally, nationally and internationally&#151;our aim has been to publish as full and open an account of our work as possible. The strategy also draws close links with other Government policies that are essential to its delivery, including conflict reduction, our international aid programme, counter-proliferation, our work in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and our support to communities here, building cohesion, empowerment and equality in this country. The strategy is also closely co-ordinated with the national security strategy, which was published for the first time last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09032430000161">The challenge that all of us in the House face is striking the right balance between measures to protect security and the right to life, and the impact on the other rights that we hold dear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09032430000162">Contest is based on clear and unambiguous principles. My approach to protecting Britain&#146;s security in the face of the terrorist threat will always be underpinned by our core shared values, including the protection of human rights, the rule of law, and democratic and accountable government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09032430000163">The Government have sought that balance at all times, but we remain uncompromising on several issues. We oppose the use of torture in all its forms. We have always condemned the practice of extraordinary rendition, and will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09032430000164">The strategy is comprehensive and wide ranging. In publishing it, our primary aim is to reassure the British public that we are doing all in our power to protect this country through our relentless pursuit of terrorists and our determination to prevent violent extremism.</p>

 May I thank the Home Secretary for providing an advance copy of her statement? Once again, however, may I express my annoyance on behalf of the House at the fact that the documents, which are published today, were released and distributed through the media long before they were released to MPs? That is completely unacceptable and goes against numerous rulings by you, Mr. Speaker. The Home Secretary should be ashamed of herself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09032430000167">I join the Home Secretary in paying tribute to the police and all the security services, both overseas and at home, for their work in protecting us against the terrorist threat, but we should do more than recognise that hard work&#151;we should also recognise their personal courage in looking after us. We all share the same goal in respect of the issues we are discussing today. We want to do everything we can to combat terror, and we will be constructive critics of what the Government do as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09032430000168">Furthermore, we face new kinds of threat. The events in Mumbai in November were truly shocking. Innocent people were gunned down in their hotel rooms or shot at random on a busy railway station. Armed men roaming the streets of cities looking for people to shoot indiscriminately is a new experience in the battle against terror. That is why we back the Government&#146;s aim of broadening knowledge of the terrorist threat to thousands of people who work in public places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09032430000169">However, the Government have to do the job properly. It is depressing to discover that the programme described in last weekend&#146;s newspapers by the Prime Minister does not appear to be what we were promised. He described the programme as follows:</p>
<a name="90324-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09032430000312"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tens of thousands of men and women...from security guards to store managers...have now been trained and equipped to deal with an incident and know what to watch for as people go about their daily business&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09032430000170">Will the Home Secretary confirm that the training programme described by the Prime Minister amounts to no more than a voluntary three-hour seminar, and that includes the coffee break? I do not see how we can train people properly to deal with terrorism in less than half the time allocated to a cycling proficiency course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09032430000171">Will the Home Secretary tell us how widely the training has been spread? When we contacted the management of two major shopping centres this morning, we were told that all that they knew about the plans was from newspaper reports this week. Why?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09032430000172">When it comes to new kinds of threat, the Home Secretary is right to highlight the need to be aware of the danger of an attack with chemical, biological or radiological weapons, but will she tell the House why police in London will not all have access to protective equipment ahead of the G20 summit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09032430000173">The other big caveat is how we deal with the groups that foster both hatred and violence in our society and the extremism that underpins many aspects of the threat that we face. The meeting held in a school in London last week at which one of the most controversial of all the so-called preachers of hate, Omar Bakri, was able to preach over a phone line to a group of followers and call for attacks on British soldiers and civilians was a disgrace. Why was that allowed to happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09032430000174">We have to deal with extremism in all its guises. People have the right to campaign for radical change in our society. We should not seek to ban them from doing  <br>

so, but the state has the right to protect its people and its institutions, and the principles of a democratic society. We should not be providing support to those who wish to undermine that society, so will the Home Secretary now stop funding groups that propagate extremism, and instead concentrate on funding projects that break down the community divide?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09032430000175">We will support the Government when they do the right thing to combat terrorism. There is much in the document that we welcome, but the Government&#146;s strategy is not perfect and we will continue to push for change where we believe that it is flawed. We will do so out of a desire that I believe is shared right across this House: to do everything we can to keep the terrorist threat at bay.</p>

I welcome that tribute.

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para28"><a name="09032430000180">The hon. Gentleman talks about the work we are taking forward through Project Argus. I am sorry that he was so dismissive of a wide-ranging programme that is placed on top of the work of police officers, police community support officers, the security and intelligence agencies and others who work to keep us safe, and that aims to provide training and preparation and to protect us where we shop, where we work and where we live. About 700 programmes have been implemented under Project Argus and more than 30,000 people have received training&#151;and plans are in place for even more people to receive it. On top of that, separate training programmes for security guards are being conducted throughout the country to help ensure that they are vigilant. I hope that hon. Members will welcome and support that work in their local communities.</p>

We are ensuring, once again, that all police officers receive basic information training in CBRN threats, with 8,000 police officers receiving specific training, and they all have access to protective equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90324-0004.htm_para30"><a name="09032430000182">The hon. Gentleman rightly emphasises, as do we, the challenge to counteract violent extremism and those who want to support terrorism. In providing funding for groups and other elements of the work, we have ensured that we can measure the outcomes of what those groups do. We commissioned a review from Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit Commission, which has already been published. I agree that our work to counter violent extremism and to support shared values needs to go even further, which is why we are clear in this document about the values that we share&#151;the same values, incidentally, that are under  <br>

attack by terrorists&#151; and we will as a Government and more widely across the community challenge those who do not share those values. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that our emphasis on working&#151;not just in communities, but more widely in prisons, schools, universities and internationally&#151;to prevent people from turning to violent extremism is an important part of, and the correct long-term approach to, what I hope is our joint work to help keep this country safer.</p>

 I welcome the Home Secretary&#146;s statement and her commitment to continue to engage with communities. As events in Luton showed, it is extremely important to continue that process of engagement. She mentioned Mumbai, but security in major hotels and tourist places in such cities does not bear comparison with what is happening in London. Although I of course welcome everything the Government have done in training staff, it is vital that we continue to work with the private sector to ensure that it puts in place the necessary security arrangements in our major hotels and major tourist destinations, which will be targeted by terrorists, and we must prepare for that.</p>

 I think my right hon. Friend is right to draw attention, as I did, to the need to learn from events such as those in Mumbai. I am glad that he welcomes the fact that, through the security advisers we fund, we have ensured that hotel operators are trained. In addition, of course, we provide advice, and we are developing the way in which we provide it&#151;for example, ensuring that buildings are designed and built to be as safe as possible from potential terrorist attack. We will continue to do that and build on that work. I am sure my right hon.

Our task is to make sure that everybody is able to live their daily lives as freely, but as securely, as possible.</p>

We have faced it before in the form of republican Irish terrorism and have survived it, and I have no doubt that we shall do so again. Does the Home Secretary agree, however, that although the threat is severe, our response must always be measured and proportionate?

Ministers have repeatedly returned with proposals for longer periods of detention without charge, as if the whole fight against terrorism could be reduced to a number: 90 days, 42 days and, still, 28 days&#151;more than double the next longest period in an English-speaking country.</p>

What progress is she making with that? Given the substantial success of criminal convictions for terrorist offences&#151;at 92 per cent., the figure is far higher than those for other serious crimes, which is cause for real congratulation of the Home Secretary&#151;will she now review the need for some of the more extreme measures that she introduced in relation to the very long period of detention without charge?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for paying tribute to those involved in countering terrorism and keeping us safe. I agree that our response should be measured and proportionate, but I disagree with his assessment that it is not. I have made it completely clear in the strategy that our approach to countering terrorism must be grounded in basic human rights: that is at the heart of our approach.</p>

Gentleman described the training that we provide through Project Argus, and other training, as being about giving powers to those involved, but it is not about giving them specific powers. It is about, for example, enabling security guards to be vigilant and aware of what is happening outside, perhaps outside the night club that they are guarding, and training people in shopping centres to be aware of what would happen in the event of a terrorist attack. Those people must learn how to lead others to safety, and where the safe places are. Pretty practical and, I think, sensible guidance and advice will be given to people who can play a role&#151;although it will not be their primary role&#151;in keeping others safe.</p>

Gentleman of the arguments that we have presented about European countries&#151;never mind other countries&#151;where people are detained for longer periods, effectively pre-charge, than is the case in this country, and I remind him that in this country any detention for longer than 24 hours is subject to judicial oversight and review.</p>

In the past 10 years, 200 of our fellow citizens have been killed abroad in terrorist attacks, and 150 have been maimed for life, yet we still do not have a comprehensive compensation scheme for British citizens abroad. These are not combatants or volunteers; they are simply men, women and children who were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and because it was not in the United Kingdom they are treated differently. That is indefensible. We are dealing with worldwide terrorism. Every British citizen is entitled to be treated the same and to be protected. Where something goes wrong, they and their families are entitled to be looked after by this country.

 My right hon. Friend makes those comments from a position of considerable experience in terms of his contribution to the whole issue of how we counter the terrorist threat. He is right that cyber-security generally cuts across almost all the challenges highlighted last year in the national security strategy, including not only terrorism but matters such as organised crime and business crime. That is why a piece of work currently being undertaken by the Cabinet Office is extremely important; it is leading a cross-departmental project on cyber-security, and I hope my right hon. Friend is reassured to know that that work is going on in Government. He will also know, not least because he and I were in Washington at the same time, just over a week ago, that the way in which we can work with our international partners is also very important. During that trip, I was able to meet Janet Napolitano at the Department of Homeland Security, who is currently reviewing the role that that Department should play in cyber-security in the US, and we agreed to share experience, to work together, to tackle many of the problems posed in the area of cyber-security and to ensure we can be safe in the virtual world in the same way as we are in the real world.</p>

element of this strategy: its unparalleled openness? Does she agree that if we are truly to be able to face, respond to and&#151;God forbid that we ever have the need&#151;recover from a terrorist attack, the resilience that is needed will ultimately lie not in the agencies of the state, but in the resolve, spirit and understanding, and support for our aims, of the ordinary people of this country? Therefore, may I commend her training programmes, and ask whether she agrees that the litmus test of this strategy is how far it will embed that resilience not just in the political leadership here or the formal security agencies of the British state, but in the ordinary people of Britain, because it is ultimately through them and in the communities that we will defeat the terrorists?</p>

I agree with him that while we depend on those in the police, the security and intelligence agencies and the armed forces to tackle terrorism, it is not enough to expect that they will enable us to mitigate that threat. Each of us has a role, and it is in recognition of that that we have&#151;unprecedentedly, I think&#151;made all these 170-plus pages unclassified and available to the public.

 The Home Secretary will be aware that, every so often, protests and marches are held at which people use language, both orally and on placards, that many would regard as inflammatory. The police do not seem to take any action, despite the popular belief that various laws have been broken. Not surprisingly, there is a perception that some people can get away with breaking the law, whereas the majority of the public would be prosecuted for committing the same breaches. Will the right hon. Lady kindly assure the House that no one is above the law and that, when it comes to this issue, anyone who breaches the law will be prosecuted?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09032430000255">The Bill I wish to introduce seeks to tackle two injustices. The first concerns the penalty that over 500,000 thrifty pensioners face as a result of benefit rules which, in effect, assume that they are earning 8 per cent. interest on their savings. The second concerns 250,000 frail pensioners in care homes who are reliant on state support and are left with just &#163;21.15 a week to cover their personal living costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09032430000256">Under existing benefit rules&#151;the so-called tariff income rules&#151;pensioners with savings over &#163;6,000 who qualify for pension credit are assumed to be earning anything up to 8 per cent. interest on their savings. Whenever I talk about this matter with pensioner and other groups in my constituency, there is one of two reactions&#151;derisive laughter or disbelief turning to outrage, often followed by the question, &#147;Which bank gives that much interest on savings? I want to move my savings there straight away.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para6"><a name="09032430000257">A rate of 8 per cent. is significantly higher than any savings or investment account currently available, and it has not changed, up or down, since 2003. Benefit entitlement is calculated on an assumed rate of return that pensioners receive from their savings. Any savings below &#163;6,000 are disregarded, but for every &#163;500 above that, a saver is assumed to earn &#163;1 per week from their investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09032430000258">My Bill would place a duty on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to review the tariff income rules and the level of capital. By placing a duty on the Secretary of State to consult widely about the rules and limits, I hope the Bill will force the Government to address the growing anomaly which discriminates against thrifty pensioners. I would go further, but that is far as the rules of the House allow me in a ten-minute Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09032430000259">The Government argue that the tariff income rules do not represent a rate of return for investing capital, but are there to</p>
<a name="90324-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="09032430000317"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;provide a simple method of calculating the weekly contribution that people with capital in excess of &#163;6,000 (or &#163;10,000 if in a care home) are expected to make from those resources&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09032430000260">However, the rules imply that pensioners with savings over &#163;6,000 are receiving up to 8 per cent. interest. Back in the real world, where, for example, an individual savings account provided by the Government-backed National Savings and Investments currently offers only 1.62 to 2.16 per cent., that notion bears no scrutiny whatever. More than 500,000 pensioners are having their income overestimated, and are missing out on pension credit and other benefits to which they should be entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09032430000261">The Government calculate, for example, that a pensioner with savings of &#163;16,000 earns &#163;1,080 per annum in interest. In the real world of, for example, National  <br>

Savings and Investments ISAs, such savings would generate &#163;259 to &#163;345 a year. The Government&#146;s assumption that such an interest rate is unrealistic is costing such pensioners at least &#163;734 per year. As real interest rates fall, hard-pressed pensioners are being forced to run their savings down at ever faster rates. That is unfair and needs to be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09032430000262">As for the second injustice, the personal expenses allowance is the only source of income for care home residents whose care is funded by the local authority. At the moment, 250,000 residents receive that support. Means-testing rules require those entering care homes with savings of less than &#163;22,250 to surrender to the state their income, including their state pension and assets to cover the cost of their care. The personal expenses allowance is the amount that residents are allowed to keep for personal expenditure each week, and it currently stands at &#163;21.15&#151;about &#163;3 a day. That amount is the only source of income for local authority-funded care home residents and is intended to pay for toiletries, clothes, gifts for family and friends, travel, hobbies, hairdressing and other leisure activities. Some have had to use that money to pay for health services such as chiropody and physiotherapy. In some cases, the personal expenses allowance is being called on to top up the fees that people pay in care homes. The personal expenses allowance is due to rise this April by 75p a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09032430000263">The case for reform and an increase is compelling. It has the support of many older people&#146;s charities, as it is vital to ensure the dignity and self-respect of residents and to give them a certain amount of independence. Age Concern, Help the Aged and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have all published reports demonstrating that the personal expenses allowance is crucial to the dignity of older people and must therefore be raised, as many elderly people live in poverty or their relatives supplement their allowances from their own incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90324-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09032430000264">The Joseph Rowntree Foundation conducted research among pensioners and concluded that the minimum such amount needed by a single pensioner to maintain an acceptable standard of living is &#163;42 per week. The Royal British Legion, in its Return to Rationing campaign, also calls for a higher personal expenses allowance. In 2005, the Work and Pensions Committee stated:</p>

that no one in this debate will question the need for the provision; if they do, I hope that they will be honest enough to say so openly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09032430000283">This debate focuses on a particular aspect of the 2008 Act. Some religious groups have said they are afraid that the new law will catch them because their religion strongly disapproves of homosexuality, and their representatives or preachers want to continue to say so publicly. It is important, however, to stress what the 2008 Act says and what the new crime is. The Act says:</p>
<a name="90324-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09032430000320"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09032430000284">That means that the words have to be both threatening and intended to stir up hatred. It is not enough for the words to be insulting or offensive; they have to threaten. Nor is it enough that the words may have the effect of stirring up hatred; they have to be specifically intended to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09032430000285">The crime is difficult to prove at the best of times. If a charge was brought against a saintly religious leader whose intention was to save souls, I cannot see how anyone might think that that offence had been committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09032430000288">The problem is not what the law says, but the fact that some rather odd investigations have been started&#151;not under the provisions that I have mentioned, which are not yet in force, but under different ones. That has given rise to a great deal of anxiety and I am sure that we will hear about the cases in the course of the debate. However, it is important to realise that those cases are brought under entirely different provisions. It is right to say that people should not have to suffer unreasonable and unfounded investigation.</p>

 Cases in which people have been exposed to this sort of intrusive investigation, even though no prosecutions have been brought, have been those where the existing laws have been stretched even further to warrant the police coming and knocking on their doors.

 That is why it is very important that we have specific legislation to give guidance to the authorities about how they implement the new laws. The offence that is usually referred to, as in the cases of Miguel Hayworth and Stephen Green, concerns section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, whereby it is a crime to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. In my view, that provision is in itself a violation of freedom of speech. It seems to allow prosecution merely for insults, and for insults that are merely likely to cause distress but have not necessarily done so.</p>

 And without intention, as my hon. Friend says. That is why yesterday I would have supported his amendment, which we never reached, to remove the word &#147;insulting&#148; from that provision. That answers the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09032430000293">The provisions regarding hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation are not the same&#151;insult is not enough; likelihood of distress is not enough&#151;but some people are anxious about the possibility that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service will not recognise the difference. I accept that that anxiety exists and that we should do something about it&#151;the question is what. There are two proposals on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09032430000294">The first is to do what the 1986 Act already says following the so-called Waddington amendment, which went through after extensive ping-pong between this House and the other place last year, when the Government eventually gave way. I thought they were wrong to do so, and divided the House right at the end of that process. They did it because they were up against a deadline on another provision in the Bill about industrial action in prisons. However, they made it clear that they were with me in spirit, if not in the Lobby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09032430000295">The Waddington amendment is sometimes called the free speech amendment, but it completely fails to mention freedom of expression. It says:</p>
<a name="90324-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="09032430000321"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For the avoidance of doubt, the discussion or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of persons to refrain from or modify such conduct or practices shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09032430000296">There are many problems with the Waddington amendment. First, it is not aimed at the problem that it is supposed to solve. The problem lies not in the content of the law&#151;a point that it seems to admit itself by using the phrase,</p>
<a name="90324-0007.htm_brev3"><a name="09032430000322"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For the avoidance of doubt&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09032430000297">but in a possible mistaken interpretation of the law by the police and the CPS. If the police pay no attention to the wording of the offence itself, why should we believe that they will pay attention to the wording of the Waddington amendment? Secondly&#151;this is the most important criticism&#151;it either achieves nothing at all or is attempting to do something that we should oppose. If it really is</p>
<a name="90324-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="09032430000323"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For the avoidance of doubt&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para22"><a name="09032430000298">it adds nothing to the law at all, but if it is read in a different way, as a &#147;deeming&#148; provision, it is entirely unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para23"><a name="09032430000299">A &#147;deeming&#148; provision is a statutory section that tells courts to ignore reality but to treat one thing as another. Last year, we passed about 85 &#147;deeming&#148; provisions. In the Energy Act 2008, for example, we deemed a place where uranium was enriched to be premises owned or used for the purposes of the Crown, so that the Official Secrets Act would apply even when the place was owned by someone else. It is very common for us to do this. The difficulty with the Waddington amendment is that it can be read as deeming discussion of sexual conduct and so on not to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred even when the words actually were threatening and were intended to stir up hatred. That is particularly  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

worrying in the case of urging persons to modify such conduct, which is what the amendment refers to. Such urging could certainly be done in a threatening way and with the necessary intent. There is a danger that the Waddington amendment could be read in a deeming manner so that a person doing such urging in a threatening way, with intent, would not count as having done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09032430000300">Proponents of the Waddington amendment put a lot of weight on the phrase &#147;of itself&#148;, but that phrase has at least two possible meanings. It could mean&#151;this is the hopeful interpretation&#151;something like, &#147;But if the way this was done indicates threats or intentions, the provision does not apply.&#148; &#147;Taken of itself&#148; might mean that, but it could mean something rather different, such as, &#147;Ask only whether the acts complained of are within this provision, and ignore the context.&#148; That would mean that &#147;of itself&#148; was an excluding phrase, rather than an including one. The latter interpretation would fit closely with the interpretation of the Waddington amendment as a deeming provision, which is a grave danger. That is why the Government are absolutely right to propose removing the Waddington amendment from the legislation. It is either useless or dangerous. I do not, however, think that the Government are right to offer nothing in its place, which is where new clause 11 comes in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para25"><a name="09032430000301">New clause 11 would meet head-on the problem of mistaken interpretations that lead to fruitless and distressing investigations. It would do so by requiring the Director of Public Prosecutions to issue guidance to prosecutors on the meaning of the offence, and crucially, it would require chief constables to make the content&#151;or for those Members who were here yesterday, the gist&#151;of that guidance known to police officers. New clause 11 would also introduce a real free speech element by requiring the Attorney-General, whose consent is necessary for any prosecutions to go ahead, to have regard to all the relevant rights and freedoms in the Human Rights Act before giving that permission.</p>

<p><a name="st_o169"><a name="09032430000302"><a name="90324-0007.htm_spnew9"><a name="09032430000515"><b>Mr. Gerald Howarth (Aldershot) (Con):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is placing enormous reliance on guidance to be issued by the authorities&#151;the Crown Prosecution Service or the police. I have an extract from the guidance on prosecuting cases of homophobic and transphobic crime, issued by the Crown Prosecution Service in November 2007. It describes homophobia and transphobia as</p>
<a name="90324-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="09032430000324"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;terms used to describe a dislike of LGBT people or aspects of their perceived lifestyle. In other words, homophobia and transphobia are not restricted to a dislike of individuals; the dislike can be based on any sexual act or characteristic that the person associates with an LGBT person, whether or not any specific LGBT person does that act or has that characteristic. That dislike does not have to be as severe as hatred. It is enough that people do something or abstain from doing something because they do not like LGBT people.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para26"><a name="09032430000303">Surely that is hugely wide-ranging.

about that aspect; the word &#147;homophobia&#148; does not exist in the provisions we are talking about. Furthermore, the guidance would have to be issued after consultation with the Attorney-General. That means that there will be accountability to this House over what that guidance says, through the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90324-0007.htm_para27"><a name="09032430000305">The effect of the second part of the new clause would be that the Attorney-General would also have to have regard to all rights of freedom of expression before a prosecution was brought. That would feed back through the system and create at least some hope of a judicial review of a decision to go ahead with a prosecution, which there would not normally be. New clause 11 is far more focused on the real problem than the Government&#146;s provisions and would help in a much less dangerous way, but it is capable of meeting genuine anxieties that have arisen in religious communities. It is necessary to do something of this nature rather than, as the Government suggest, do nothing at all.</p>

Stonewall does not say that the freedom of speech provision would prevent convictions, thereby contradicting the Justice Secretary. It does not say that it will prevent prosecutions, but only that a small number of extremists will attempt to use it to get out of a prosecution. I do not think that they would succeed and I suspect that Stonewall does not think that, either. Stonewall has been candid. Its members know that a free speech clause does not seriously undermine their intention for the new offence.</p>

I do not understand how anyone could support a clause, which allows expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse against religion, but oppose a provision, which allows mere discussion or criticism of sexual conduct. That defeats logic. I do not understand why the Government would insist on repealing only the weaker of the two provisions, when they claim to oppose both.</p>

 Let me try to explain why there is a difference. The religious saver specifies that abuse and ridicule are not covered by the offence. It is tautological but they are not. The Waddington amendment does not exclude ridicule or abuse, because they are already excluded, but purports, according to one interpretation, to allow the exclusion of intentional threatening incitement as long as it refers only to practice. That is the difference, and the hon. Gentleman must explain whether he understood the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) when he outlined the potential effect of new clause 11.</p>

It simply clarifies what is already outside the scope of the offence. It is not a defence but a signpost, so that those involved at the early stages of the criminal justice system&#151;police and prosecutors&#151; have it drawn to their attention clearly and simply that certain legitimate activities are outside the definition of the offence. That way, if vexatious complaints are made, the police and prosecutors can simply point to the free speech provision and dismiss the complaint, instead of spending time and taxpayers&#146; money pursuing pointless complaints and trampling on the civil liberties of innocent people in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90324-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09032450000024">It is also worth emphasising that the Waddington amendment refers to criticising not sexual orientation, but sexual conduct. I repeat: it does not create a defence. I welcome the support of Liberty&#151;often paid-up members of the Liberal Democrat tendency&#151;for amendment 1. It speculates that clause 58 might possibly remove a defence, but the explanatory notes have got it right. The Ministry of Justice officials who drafted the notes state in paragraph 372:</p>
<a name="90324-0008.htm_brev5"><a name="09032450000715"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The removal of the section will not affect the threshold required for the offence to be made out.&#148;</p>

We are tinkering. If it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change&#151;a favourite phrase of the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). The explanatory notes are more accurate and fairer than the Justice Secretary was to those who tabled the free speech clause. On Second Reading, the Justice Secretary alleged that those tabling it intended to make a conviction difficult.</p>

For a start, it focuses mainly on the decision to prosecute, but we are not concerned about prosecutions at this point. None of the cases that I listed earlier resulted in a prosecution.

The guidance is called &#147;Hate Crime: Delivering a Quality Service&#148; and in paragraph 2.2.6 it tells officers:</p>

Howarth) has raised an important issue, and I think that there is common ground between us that the right to freedom of speech and expression must be protected. It must be protected in terms of how a statute would be interpreted in court, but it also has to be interpreted, to use an expression often used in the past by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), against the chilling effect that a statute can have if it is mistakenly applied by those in authority. As the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) rightly highlighted, there are, unfortunately, quite a number of examples in which laws&#151;not this law, but others that in many ways stretch even further&#151;have been applied in an oppressive way against perfectly respectable people. We have to keep that in mind when we come to legislate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90324-0008.htm_para26"><a name="09032450000045">The hon. Member for Cambridge says that he considers that the law drafted last year&#151;without Lord Waddington&#146;s saving clause&#151;would be sufficient and all right if we simply had guidelines. I have to say to him that I have some anxiety about using guidelines in that way. I accept that guidelines may be of some utility, but the fact of the matter is that if guidelines are disregarded and a legal process against an individual starts to get ratcheted up, there is nothing to stop it until the matter gets into the courts; and by then, as we know, a great deal of damage has been done in many cases to the individuals concerned in terms of stress, their reputation and the anxiety they are placed under&#151;all quite needlessly. It thus seems to me that it would be sensible for the House to consider whether having a saving clause would help.</p>

Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). Lord Waddington has also been a lawyer. When I listened to the comments of the hon. Member for Cambridge, it prompted me to look again at the saving clause to see whether it contained the mischief of being a deeming provision along the lines that he identified. He has clearly raised a serious issue for the House to consider. I have to say, however, that having looked at the provision and read it over and over again, I do not see that it can have the possible effect that he has suggested. The reason for that is the appearance of the two words &#147;of itself&#148; in its penultimate line which refers to something that</p>

Gentleman&#146;s analysis that the saving clause could be used to justify people coming forward and using hateful terminology, language and threats.</p>

side of an argument are increasingly deterred from expressing their views at all, but those who are full of extreme opinion, whether they be at one end of the spectrum or the other, are not deterred in any way by the law and, in fact, have a free field for themselves. That is not good for the health of our democracy or our civic life. We also need to consider that when Parliament enacts legislation in this way, groups and individuals will undoubtedly attribute to it meanings that Parliament may not have intended.</p>

To support its analysis of why the new offence was needed and why it opposed the saving clause, it presented a number of examples. One involved rap lyrics expressing great hatred, such as &#147;Hang lesbians with a long piece of rope&#148;. Quite apart from the fact that I would expect that to be caught by existing law, I feel completely comfortable with the idea of enacting legislation of the kind that we passed last summer, which will criminalise it.</p>

Most people reading the website would consider it to be utterly wacky. I have to say, however, that if it is Stonewall&#146;s opinion that such material should be criminalised, the House needs to approach the matter with some caution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90324-0008.htm_para33"><a name="09032450000052">I am afraid that, just as with incitement to religious hatred, messages are sent out from this place that are latched on to by pressure groups wishing to prevent other people from expressing legitimate views, even if those legitimate views are in fact nonsensical. We cannot have a working democracy without the underpinning of freedom of speech, which also requires tolerance of opinions that we may consider to be bonkers or which we may dislike. As long as hatred is not stirred up, which is the mischief that we have been trying to address&#151;as long as the civil order of society is not being undermined&#151;we must tolerate such opinions. Indeed, as politicians, we tolerate them all the time.</p>

I believe that it is sensible. As we need some saving clause in an extremely difficult piece of legislation in which the balance that we strike will always pose a problem, I can think of no good reason for us to get rid of it on the basis of the arguments that I have heard this afternoon. I therefore intend to support the retention of Lord Waddington&#146;s amendment, and encourage my hon. Friends to do so as well.</p>

We need to get rid of the idea of insult, especially unintentional insult&#151;as in section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986&#151;from our statute book, and also to ensure that guidance throughout makes it clear to the police that they cannot take seriously complaints of insult which is not direct abuse. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree with that?</p>

 Yes. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for that fact that, in the time allowed, I have not dealt with that point.</p>
<a name="09032450000709">
<p>The question of insulting behaviour raises an important issue. I am not sure that I can do full justice to it in this short debate, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes to revisit it, I shall be happy to discuss it carefully with him. I can see that there may well be merit in getting rid of an expression that, I think, carries a number of connotations in wider legislation and that may be undesirable. There is, however, an issue that I think we cannot completely avoid. In some cases, insult, particularly if it takes place in a public arena, can reach a point at which it becomes incitement to a breach of the peace. We must guard against that possibility, but subject to that, I am sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman has said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90324-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09032450000057">For the present, we have quite a simple issue to deal with. We have a piece of legislation, passed on to the statute book last summer, that has not yet been brought into operation and that has not yet been given the chance to see whether it works. I do not see anything in Lord Waddington&#146;s amendment to justify its deletion at present. Its support goes much wider than people with a religious viewpoint. It extends across a wide spectrum of those who have deep anxieties about the erosion of freedom of speech, including within the theatrical world, as has been shown by Rowan Atkinson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90324-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09032450000058">For those reasons, although I am mindful of the mischief that we are trying to address and I want the incitement of hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation to be prohibited, I believe that the amendment does nothing to prevent from happening that and does a great deal to ensure that the legislation that we pass is balanced. For those reasons, I support the amendment.</p>

arguments and concerns in a reasonable way. They do not need to fear that they will be caught by the criminal law. Last year, we had a very lively debate and the Government took the view that no additional provision was needed to ensure freedom of expression. The offence that we are talking about has a very high threshold and a number of safeguards are built into the system to ensure that the offence cannot be used in any way that disrupts the balance between those two concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90324-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09032450000062">The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its report published last week, reaffirmed its view that we have the balance right, as did the Equality and Human Rights Commission at about the same time. Last May, this House agreed, by a very large majority, that we had got the balance right. However, as the hon. Member for Oxford&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) rather; I must get my university towns in the right order&#151;pointed out, the other place inserted a measure for the avoidance of doubt. We all agreed with the principle that the offence should not be misused. As I say, those safeguards have already been built into the offence. The additional provision was and still is unnecessary. It serves only to make the offence less clear; it muddies the waters. This House rejected the amendment and I ask it to do so again today.</p>

 I will come on to the guidance in a moment, but let me just point out a key difference to my hon. Friend. Last May, this House voted on and rejected by a majority of 202 a Lords amendment inserting a saving into the sexual orientation offence. By contrast, in January 2006 we accepted, by only one vote, a Lords amendment inserting a freedom of speech saving into the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill. The saving for the religious hatred offence is the settled will of the House, whereas the saving for the sexual orientation offence is not the will of the House, which is what I ask Members to endorse today.</p>

<p><a name="st_o188"><a name="09032450000070"><a name="90324-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="09032450000756"><b>Mr. Tom Harris (Glasgow, South) (Lab):</b>
 It seems to be very curious logic to say that because the House voted one way at some point in the past, that somehow binds the House today to vote in exactly the same way. Could not Members change their mind at some point?</p>

<p><a name="st_o189"><a name="09032450000071"><a name="90324-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="09032450000757"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 Of course the House can change its mind, and we will discover in the Lobbies in 20 minutes or so whether the House has changed its mind, but I think that the fact that this was introduced last year for an offence that has not yet been put on the statute book is a pretty persuasive argument for believing that that was the House&#146;s view at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90324-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09032450000072">We had long debates about the guidance and about what guidance should be issued. There is a clear need for guidance, as there always is when any new offence is introduced. The Ministry of Justice will provide short explanatory guidance about the offence. The Crown Prosecution Service will issue guidance for prosecutors, and the Association of Chief Police Officers will revise its hate crime manual to include guidance on all incitement to hatred offences. All the guidance will be available before the offence comes into force. However, I am quite persuaded by the argument put by the hon. Member for Cambridge, and I would like to reflect on it. Therefore, although I ask him to withdraw new clause 11, I invite him to take up the opportunity of meeting the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether it would be appropriate to make the guidance statutory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90324-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09032450000073">I fully understand the motivation behind new clause 37, but I believe that it is unnecessary. Allegations about offences, and specifically about child sex offences, are a very easy and damaging way of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. Such allegations are damaging and distasteful and should be challenged, but we believe that it is not necessary to mention them specifically in the offence. In many instances, allegations linking sexual orientation with child sex offences will be threatening as well as distasteful, and will be caught by the offence. However, when the circumstances mean an allegation is not threatening, it will not be caught, and we think that is right.</p>

 On new clause 37, does the Minister agree with us that whenever any linkage of homosexuality with paedophilia is intended to stir up hate it should, by definition, be considered threatening? Is she saying that even if such a linkage is made in the context of a deliberate attempt to incite hatred, rather than, for example, academic discourse, it would not be, in some circumstances, considered threatening and therefore would not be an offence? That is a matter of concern to us, so will she agree to reflect on it a little further?</p>

 I have to reject the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, because the word &#147;threatening&#148;, in this context, has to have its normal English meaning. We do not think that it is right to stretch that to include words or behaviour that it would not naturally cover, because it would muddy the waters. I am concerned that if we were to go down the road he suggests in new clause 37, those who make such allegations could shift their grounds to similar but equally damaging allegations&#151;for example, saying that gay people are responsible for HIV/AIDS. Although I understand the concerns that he is trying to address, I do not think that the new clause is the way to address them.

 In addition to new clause 19, which stands in my names and those of my hon. and learned Friends the Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) and for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson), I plan to discuss our amendments 78 to 88. I also want to comment on Government amendment 25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09032450000632">Our new clause 19 would remove the immunity of Government Departments from prosecution, because the Government&#146;s record on handling, storing and transporting confidential data is appalling. I am afraid that the Ministry of Justice is one of the worst offenders. A computer hard drive containing the details of up to 5,000 employees of the National Offender Management Service in England and Wales was lost by the private firm, EDS. Despite the loss having occurred in July 2007, the Justice Secretary was not told until September 2008. In August last year, the names and addresses, details of convictions and even jail release dates of almost 130,000 people were lost when a computer memory stick went missing. It was being used by an employee of a private contractor working for the MOJ. The Information Commissioner said at the time that the data were a &#147;toxic liability&#148;, and described the loss as &#147;deeply worrying&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09032450000633">The Ministry of Defence is another serial offender. Some time ago, the Defence Secretary of the time was forced to revise upwards the estimate of the number of laptops stolen from his Department in the previous four years from 347 to 658. Furthermore, in January last year, the then Defence Secretary revealed that an MOD laptop, which contained the details of 600,000 people, had been stolen from the boot of a naval officer&#146;s car in Birmingham. The computer contained unencrypted lists of names, addresses, bank and driving licence details, national insurance and national health service numbers and so on&#151;an appalling security lapse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09032450000634">In 2007, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs had the so-called discgate scandal, in which 25 million records were lost. In November that year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer admitted that two CDs containing child benefit data had been lost in transit to the National Audit Office. Also in November that year, HMRC lost the personal details of 15,000 Standard Life pension holders, after a CD was lost in transit by an external courier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09032450000635">Many other Departments have lost data, including the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Communities and Local Government. Many of the subsequent inquiries revealed lax security procedures, confused chains of command and, above all, no proper accountability. Many Departments have a serious cultural problem, which is simply not being addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09032450000636">Last year, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, who was then the Minister for the Cabinet Office, amid great fanfare launched new guidelines called &#147;Data Handling Procedures&#148;. He promised</p>

In fact, they have delivered little. Proper sanctions are needed.  <br>

The Bill contains no sanctions, and we feel strongly that immunity of Departments from prosecution should be removed. Only by applying such sanctions will permanent secretaries and civil servants make the prevention of loss of data a key priority. We need to send a strong signal to all Departments and agencies that cavalier and unprofessional attitudes to our personal data and privacy will not be tolerated. I hope that the Minister will accept our new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09032450000638">I turn to our amendments 78 and 79. Amendment 78 is almost identical to new clause 38, which was tabled by the hon. Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). The official Opposition, and particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest, have said for some time that it is essential that the Information Commissioner be given more power to control and monitor holders of data. That is why we support the principles behind clause 153. However, the clause has one glaring gap, as it does not provide any enforcement powers. If the assessment notice is made, and its subject refuses to comply, the Bill does not allow for any immediate sanction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para25"><a name="09032450000639">Under our amendments 78 and 79, the Information Commissioner will be able to go to the county court, which must decide whether the assessment notice was properly issued, and whether there was a reasonable excuse for non-compliance. If the court decides for the commissioner, it will order the data controller to comply with the assessment notice. Failure to do so will result in the data controller being in contempt of court. We feel strongly that there is no point having an assessment notice regime without proper sanctions for non-compliance. As Sir Mark Walport and the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, said in their submission to the Committee:</p>
<a name="90324-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="09032450000727"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are also no meaningful sanctions for failure to comply with the requirements of an Assessment Notice: this needs strengthening in order for it to be taken seriously.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para26"><a name="09032450000640">I hope that the Minister will accept amendments 78 and 79.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments about new clause 38. As he says, the Information Commissioner recommends such a proposal. The sanction comes at the end of a long chain of warnings and efforts to ensure compliance. If we get to the end of that long chain, something has obviously gone seriously wrong. Some effort is required to make compliance happen, and a contempt of court order can be absolved by compliance.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, on which he can expand when he makes his speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para27"><a name="09032450000643">Amendments 80 to 85 relate to clause 155, which sets up the data-sharing code of practice. They would ensure that there is an affirmative resolution of both Houses before the commissioner issues the data-sharing code. Given that the Secretary of State is removing the key data-sharing provision, clause 154, from the Bill, why is it necessary to have a data-sharing code? Is that not a little suspicious and illogical? Surely the Secretary of Sate&#146;s credibility in the matter would be reinforced if he also withdrew clause 155. Otherwise, people will conclude  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 212</b><br>
that if the power to set up a data-sharing code is left in the Bill, the Government will return at some stage with their totally unacceptable data-sharing proposals. However, if the Secretary of State does decide that the data-sharing code proposals must stay in the Bill, surely it makes sense to accept our amendments 80 to 85.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para28"><a name="09032450000644">I turn to our amendments 86 to 88. In Committee, we discussed at length the apparent anomaly that the assessment notice regime applied to the public sector only. May I refer again to the submission to the Committee by Sir Mark Walport and Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner? The submission pointed out:</p>
<a name="90324-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="09032450000728"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As we stated in the report, distinguishing between public, private and voluntary sectors makes little sense, especially as more information is shared across sectors whose boundary lines are forever shifting.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para29"><a name="09032450000645">The Information Commissioner went on to say:</p>
<a name="90324-0010.htm_brev3"><a name="09032450000729"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Private and third sector bodies frequently carry out work for public sector ones. It is common for charities, for example, to carry out functions on behalf of local government. As it stands, we could inspect the local council but not the charity.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para30"><a name="09032450000646">I argued in Committee that as a consequence of the private sector&#146;s ever greater involvement with Government Departments, agencies and local government, there was an increased blurring of the barriers between the public and private sectors. I gave a couple of examples. The Crown Prosecution Service and the Solicitor-General have a large contract with what was LogicaCMG that covers the provision, support and maintenance of hardware and software applications used by the CPS, including the management of a number of large databases such as the witness management system and the graduated fee scheme for counsel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para31"><a name="09032450000647">Another example relates to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which manages a large number of public sector databases but also has a number of private sector contractors. In fact, of its 166 databases, 75 are maintained by the Department but 90 are run by private sector contractors. Obviously, there is substantial blurring between the two sectors. Amendments 23 and 24 would bring the private sector into the assessment notice regime. The Minister has argued that such an extension to the private sector would place extra burdens on business and conflict with the Hampton principles. My party believes passionately in reducing the burdens on business, so it is hard to ignore the Minister&#146;s concerns; she also raised various points about powers of entry. She feels that a more co-operative approach between business and the Information Commissioner would be desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para32"><a name="09032450000648">However, I submit that there is a compromise solution. Amendments 86 to 88 would extend the less severe and substantially less burdensome information notice regime to the private sector. Crucially, the information notices in schedule 18 do not confer powers of entry, so why does the Minister not accept the amendments as a way to extend the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers to the private sector in a much less onerous manner? I urge the Minister to accept that argument. She has said clearly that she does not want the assessment notice regime to be extended to the private sector, and she has given her reasons for that, but surely our compromise solution would make a great deal of sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para33"><a name="09032450000649">I turn to Government amendment 25. We argued in Committee as powerfully as we could that clause 154&#151;it was clause 152 at the time&#151;should be deleted. In response,  <br>

the Minister gave numerous reasons why the clause was needed. We had a vote and lost it. Then we heard that the Government were in the process of climbing down&#151;unfortunately, that was announced in the Sunday press, rather than in Committee or on the Floor of the House. The Secretary of State then tabled his amendment.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister, and I do not want to be churlish. We had a vote and the clause stood part of the Bill when we came out of Committee, and we felt that we had to vote against it at the time. We are delighted that we helped win the argument and feel vindicated, and we should not be churlish. However, our relief and joy is coloured and tinged by our ongoing and grave concerns about the Government&#146;s record and policy on data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para34"><a name="09032450000652">I mentioned earlier the Government&#146;s appalling record on storing and handling data. We are concerned not only by the Government&#146;s incompetence; of far greater concern are the fundamental flaws in their entire data policy. Only today we heard reports that ContactPoint, the Government&#146;s child protection database, is in disarray. It was designed to help protect Britain&#146;s 11 million children, but its launch has been delayed again after local authorities discovered loopholes in the system that was to hide the details of the most vulnerable young people in this country. ContactPoint has been described as almost entirely illegal by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, and a spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said that it was working to resolve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para35"><a name="09032450000653">You couldn&#146;t write the script, and it gets worse. A recent report by Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge, concluded that at least 11 of the Government&#146;s databases could be illegal. He went on to point out that the Government are spending a staggering &#163;16 billion a year on data gathering and plan to spend another &#163;105 billion on it in the next five years. Furthermore, almost every one of those database projects has signally failed to remain on budget.</p>

At the time, the then PM said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90324-0010.htm_para37"><a name="09032450000655">However, as Ross Clark, author of &#147;The Road to Southend Pier: One man&#146;s struggle against the surveillance society&#148; said, thank goodness Mr. Blair did not fall ill in Stafford. As the Healthcare Commission made clear in its report, it was the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust&#146;s obsession with targets and data that critically undermined clinical judgment and the treatment of patients. The problem is that time and again the Government&#146;s default position when faced with a crisis is to announce yet more databases and more infringements on our civil liberties.</p>

Of course Mr. Hodgson was released only because of DNA testing, but that had absolutely nothing to do with DNA databases; all that was needed was one DNA sample from him that did not match any of the key exhibits.

As Ministers repeatedly said, some data sharing can be beneficial. No one denied that; the question was about the power that had been created to deal with that particular point. The Bill proposed&#151;and continues to propose until amendment 25 goes through&#151;to allow orders from the Secretary of State to permit data sharing between any people anywhere in the world, for the purposes of furthering any Government policy. The orders were capable of overriding the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998 and any other relevant legislation. That final point, especially the possibility that the data-sharing orders would override the Data Protection Act, was the key problem and the point at which the Government rightly decided to give way. Clause 154&#151;or clause 152, as it was&#151;was never proportionate and never had adequate safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09032450000666">I want to speak briefly to amendments 23 and 24, which are similar to amendment 133, tabled by members of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said, they seek to extend to the private sector the Information Commissioner&#146;s new inspection powers under the new assessment notice procedure. As things stand, assessment notices have two problems, the first of which&#151;it was mentioned by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)&#151;is that there is no enforcement mechanism for the new assessment notices. The obvious way to solve that is the application to court route, because that is more challengeable and more open than a warrant route. I therefore support amendments, such as new clause 38, which attempt to change that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09032450000667">The other problem addressed by the amendments is the coverage of the assessment notice system. For reasons that remain obscure, but which might have had something to do with the lobbying by the CBI and business interests that broke out when my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) and I moved amendments in Committee, the assessment notice procedure is confined to the public sector, and even within that it is confined to directly controlled organisations and does not cover even private organisations carrying out public functions under contract. That is unacceptable. Private organisations control vast amounts of data, and there is constant concern about how they use them. The Information Commissioner is clear that there are more complaints about the use of data by private sector organisations than use of data by the public sector. Sometimes the Government&#146;s defence in response to examples of their incompetence in dealing with data such as those cited by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk is to say, &#147;Well, the Government are no worse than the private sector at this sort of activity.&#148; That is a somewhat feeble defence, but it illustrates the point that these problems are not confined to the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09032450000668">As I understood it in Committee, the Government&#146;s case for leaving out the private sector is that it collects data voluntarily, which makes it different from the  <br>

public sector in that regard. I cannot accept that, for three reasons. First, there are the reasons given by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, which are dealt with in amendments 87 and 88. There are many examples of private organisations working under contract to the Government and which have collected information from the Government that the Government got on a non-voluntary basis.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="09032450000669"><a name="90324-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="09032450001286"><b>Jenny Willott (Cardiff, Central) (LD):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the number of people who are getting caught out by that is increasing? For example, people who are facing unemployment in the current economic crisis have had their information passed to private sector companies for assistance with getting back into work. Given that they number 2 million and rising, every day there are more and more people whose data, not voluntarily given, has been passed to the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="st_o213"><a name="09032450000670"><a name="90324-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="09032450001287"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 Yes, that is the case. One has to take into account the interaction of different Government policies. The more the Government want to use the private sector and the voluntary sector to a greater extent in the delivery of services, the worse the problem will get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09032450000671">The second reason I do not accept the Government&#146;s point is illustrated by the recent controversy about Google Street View, where Google supplements its maps with photographs of every house and building in many towns and cities. That demonstrates that private organisations, even when acting purely as such and not working for the Government, do not confine themselves to data they acquire voluntarily. My house is on Street View; Google did not ask me about it, and I am sure that it did not ask anybody else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09032450000672">Thirdly, what worries people about data is what can be done with them, especially data they gave voluntarily at some point in the past without realising how they could be used at some future point&#151;for example, data about which websites someone has visited or which products they have bought from a shop. Bringing all those forms of data together using sophisticated data-mining techniques and analysis can reveal vast amounts about people that they did not intend to reveal, even though technically they voluntarily allowed the data to be handed over to private organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09032450000673">Liberal Democrat Members think that there is an overwhelming case to extend the scope of the assessment notice system beyond the public sector, as narrowly defined. That view is also taken by the Information Commissioner. After all, the assessment notice system introduced by the Bill is a very gentle form of preventive intervention, not the full panoply of the law. Given that, and given the other options that the Information Commissioner has, there is a strong case for the broader extension of these powers. I urge the Government to resist the lobbying that has been going on and to look at the point of principle from the position of ordinary members of the public who are worried about what is being done with the data they handed over.</p>

 I rise briefly to speak to the two amendments tabled in my name and those of the hon. Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Sharma), as members of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As we have heard, amendment 133 is analogous to amendments 23 and 24.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09032450000675">The CBI told the Public Bill Committee that there were not sufficient safeguards to protect the privacy of individual data controllers in the private sector, but we concluded, after examination, that the safeguards already in the Bill are significant; indeed, they provide greater protection than other compulsory powers of entry, search and seizure in the Bill. For instance, an assessment notice must specify the time at which a search or other inspection will take place and the time within which an individual data controller must comply. Rights to appeal against the term of any notice are provided, and there is express protection for legally privileged material. Those are all safeguards that we had called for in respect of other Bills when the Government had said that they would put them only in secondary legislation. In this case, they are in the Bill and yet the CBI is still concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09032450000676">We thought that the CBI&#146;s objections were insufficient, and possibly even invalid, and reinforced the point, which has just been made, that there is a significant amount of contracting out of public functions to private data controllers. There should therefore be no exemption or lower degree of protection in respect of the powers of the Information Commissioner in those cases, at the very least. I would be grateful if the Minister addressed those arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09032450000677">Our other point relates to new clause 38. The Information Commissioner has called for the power of sanction, and we consider the additional powers for the commissioner to be a human rights-enhancing measure. We noted the Government&#146;s view that it would be unusual for a Department or other public body to ignore an assessment notice or fail to comply with its terms, but there is no reassurance in the Bill that that will not be the case, which is why we tabled the new clause. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.</p>

 I am speaking a little sooner than I expected, but there we are. I begin with Government amendment 25, which is at the heart of this grouping on data sharing and data protection, and the associated consequential amendment 153. They will remove from the Bill the power to establish new information-sharing gateways by secondary legislation. The proposal in clause 154 for information-sharing orders stemmed from a recommendation of the independent data-sharing review, conducted by the commissioner, Richard Thomas, and Sir Mark Walport, the director of the Wellcome Trust. They recommended changes to the legal framework for data sharing, in part to support better public service provision. To counterbalance that power, the review recommended that there should be a transparent and consistent mechanism ensuring greater scrutiny while reducing the scope for confusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09032450000679">Following the spirit of those recommendations, clause 154 included a raft of safeguards to ensure an appropriate level of public and parliamentary scrutiny. However, in Committee and elsewhere, we heard and understood the concerns that hon. Members and others expressed about the information-sharing gateway proposal, including that the power was open to misuse. It is important to make it clear that it was never the Government&#146;s intention to allow indiscriminate information sharing, regardless of any protections set up by the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09032450000680">After a thorough consideration of the views expressed by Members of this House and by such outside organisations as the British Medical Association, which I met to discuss this very point, we have concluded that a more in-depth analysis of the features of an information-sharing power was needed. It is therefore right that we withdraw clause 154 from the Bill while we undertake that further work. That is a good example of how scrutiny in this place works, and although those who spoke for the Opposition parties had a small go at gloating, they did not go overboard. I appreciate that and I am grateful to them. We accept the humble pie that they proffered to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09032450000681">The Government are clear that there are many benefits to sharing data, as I said in Committee. To deliver high-quality public services, Departments need to share personal information in a secure and appropriate fashion. Through such data sharing we can improve opportunities for the most disadvantaged, provide customer-focused public services, reduce the burden on businesses, implement policies effectively and detect fraud. We do not underestimate the risks attached to information sharing, nor will we let them blind us to the potential benefits. I assure the House that in taking the matter forward we will consider carefully the views expressed by all interested parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09032450000682">The other Government amendment in this group, amendment 152, requires a brief explanation. New section 41A of the Data Protection Act 1998, inserted by clause 153 of the Bill, provides the Secretary of State with the power to designate, by order, those public authorities subject to the assessment notice regime. As our published delegated powers memorandum makes clear, we intended that that order-making power be subject to the negative resolution procedure. However, owing to an oversight we omitted to amend section 67 of the Data Protection Act, which determines the level of parliamentary scrutiny for all delegated powers in that Act. The amendment makes good that omission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09032450000683">Let me now move on to the other amendments that relate to assessment notices. They deal with three issues: the scope of the assessment notice regime, the sanctions for non-compliance and their relationship with civil penalties under section 55A of the Data Protection Act. Amendments 23 and 24, in the name of the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), and amendment 133, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), deal with scope. Assessment notices constitute an important step towards improving public trust and confidence in the handling of personal information by public sector data controllers. They will create a formal system based upon the current arrangement of spot checks undertaken on Government Departments by the Information Commissioner, which aim to raise the awareness and compliance of public bodies with data protection principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09032450000684">Clause 153 represents the statutory base for the commitment made by the Prime Minister in November 2007, after the loss of the data from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to which the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) referred, to provide the Information Commissioner with the power to spot check Departments. That power is therefore a specific answer to a specific issue. As the clause stands, it is already possible to include certain private or third sector data controllers within the scope of assessment notices.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 219</b><br>
That would be in cases where those data controllers appear to the Secretary of State to exercise functions of a public nature, or are providing, under a contract made with a public authority, any service whose provision is a function of that authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09032450000685">There are sound arguments for applying a higher level of scrutiny to public sector bodies. Data controllers in the public sector handle a variety of sensitive personal information that is necessary to fulfil their responsibilities, such as providing health and social services, fighting crime, and detecting fraud. Most of the information handled by public sector data controllers, or those working on their behalf, is vital to determine entitlements, responsibilities, and obligations. That citizens must provide their personal information to access essential services is, in this context, a defining feature of the relationship between the citizen and the public authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09032450000686">For the private sector, the ability of the public to choose to go somewhere else is a powerful driver, encouraging businesses to look after personal information. Extending assessment notices to the private sector could, as a result, act as a significant additional regulatory burden. While I remain to be persuaded of the case for applying the assessment notice regime to all data controllers, we will continue to consider the points made by the Information Commissioner and by some Members of this House in support of those amendments. However, any move to include all data controllers within the scope of assessment notices would need to be carefully considered. We consider that clause 153 strikes a fair balance between the need to enhance the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers and the potential impact of those changes in view of the wider regulatory framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09032450000687">Amendments 78 and 79 and new clause 38 deal with the issue of non-compliance. Specifically they seek to deal with non-compliance with an assessment notice as if it were a contempt of court. Again, I remain to be persuaded that a bespoke sanction for non-compliance with an assessment notice is needed. In practice, it is difficult to envisage a public sector body refusing to comply with an assessment notice, considering the bad publicity that would ensue from such a notice. That said, the Information Commissioner made it clear that he would like some kind of penalty or sanction for refusal to comply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90324-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09032450000688">Of course, the Information Commissioner already has a range of enforcement powers available to him for a failure to comply with the Data Protection Act. Information notices can be used alongside assessment notices if he reasonably requires information to assess compliance with data protection principles. If he discovers a breach of those principles during an assessment, he can issue an enforcement notice to compel the data controller to comply with data protection obligations. He also has powers to apply for a search warrant under schedule 9 to that Act. Arguably, any greater powers would be disproportionate and inconsistent with broader Government policy about the investigatory powers of regulators. Again, however, I am prepared to reflect carefully on the arguments that have been made as the Bill makes further progress.</p>

the issue of an assessment notice. Those monetary penalties, which are provided for in section 55A of the Data Protection Act, will apply in cases of deliberate breach and when a data controller is aware that there is a risk of serious breach but fails to take reasonable steps to prevent it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09032450000690">By contrast, as I have indicated, assessment notices are a valuable tool to raise compliance levels and to educate public bodies that are being assessed. That is why they do not require the existence of suspicion of non-compliance, or actual non-compliance, with the data protection principles. They are random spot checks. Given the nature of the assessment notice regime, we do not consider it appropriate for information gathered through that process to render a data controller liable to a civil monetary penalty. In any case, the commissioner can still employ his other enforcement tools as and when required throughout an assessment. For example, if he discovered a breach of the Data Protection Act during an assessment, he could still take enforcement action. As I have said, he could issue an enforcement notice under section 40 of that Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09032450000691">New clause 19 would limit the existing Crown immunity under the Data Protection Act so that Government Departments would be open to prosecution under it. As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will know, Crown immunity means that emanations from the Crown are not ordinarily liable to prosecution for offences created either in statute or in common law. That includes Government Departments, and the limitation on the prosecution of Departments includes the offences in that Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09032450000692">That is not to say, however, that Departments are not subject to adequate sanctions for breaches of data protection principles. They can still be subject to enforcement notices, claims for damages in a civil court or civil monetary penalties. That last point is particularly important because it means that financial penalties can be imposed on Government Departments. That range of other sanctions and penalties is sufficient for me to remain unconvinced that disapplying the normal rules on Crown immunity would make any material difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09032450000693">Amendments 80 to 84 would make the Information Commissioner&#146;s codes of practice on assessment notices and data sharing subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The assessment notice code of practice is not subject to any parliamentary procedure, whereas the data sharing code is subject to the negative resolution procedure. Given the scope of those codes, I believe that we have probably got the level of parliamentary scrutiny right. They are not on a par with, for example, the codes of practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. However, if we have misjudged the level of scrutiny for those two codes of practice, I am pretty confident that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place will be quick to tell us that. We will, of course, consider carefully any recommendations that it makes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09032450000694">Amendment 85 would require the Information Commissioner to conduct an annual review of the data sharing code of practice. The Bill already obliges the commissioner to keep the code under review, and he is required to update it if he becomes aware that its content could result in the UK being in breach of any of its community or international obligations. My concern is that the amendment could prevent the code from being revised quickly once a breach has been identified.  <br>

It might be a little too rigid in calling specifically for an annual review. The Bill will give the Information Commissioner scope to reconsider and review the code as and when he sees fit. We believe that that is right, given that his role as the independent data protection regulator is to provide the most up-to-date guidance to facilitate data controllers&#146; compliance with the Data Protection Act.</p>

Section 43 of the Data Protection Act provides the Information Commissioner with the power to issue a data controller with an information notice. That can require a data controller to provide the commissioner with specified information in a specified form, to assess compliance with the data protection principles. The commissioner can issue a notice to any data controller as long as he reasonably requires information to determine their compliance. Failure to comply with an information notice is a criminal offence. The amendments would extend the commissioner&#146;s power to issue an information notice to data processors as well as data controllers. The meaning of a data processor is limited to those handling data on behalf of Government Departments and designated public authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09032450000696">The structure of the Data Protection Act places the responsibility for personal information on the data controller, not the data processor. Introducing a power to serve a notice on a data processor could shift the regulatory balance of the Act. All data being processed by or on behalf of an organisation must be covered by the data controller&#146;s registration. It is the responsibility of the data controller to obtain the information that the commissioner requires. I fear that the amendments would represent a significant change to the data protection regime, so the matter might be better suited to consideration in the review of the European directive that is under way. I therefore hope that the Opposition will not press those amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09032450000697">The hon. Member for Cambridge expressed concern about the Information Commissioner and Google Street View. I have to say that I could not find my street on it, but that might be because I am sometimes technologically illiterate when it comes to such things. I understand that the commissioner is keeping the situation under review, and of course anyone can request to have their image removed. I understand that Google is quite surprised by how few people have so far asked to have their image removed, but that is another matter.</p>

 Has the Minister asked the Information Commissioner to consider the implications for public services of some of the issues that have arisen from Google Street View? I know that it has been online for only a couple of days, and I have to confess that it is quite intriguing to play with, but I understand that in one case, a woman fleeing domestic violence was photographed outside her new house. There are therefore implications for the police, councils and so on. Has she asked the commissioner to look into that?</p>

Of course, the code will be wider than the order-making power and contain practical guidance on the sharing of personal data and other guidance that promotes good practice in data sharing.

I am sure that they will be encouraged by her comments, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

 We now deal with the provisions on sentencing, especially on the Sentencing Council and sentencing guidelines. I support the basic idea in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para31"><a name="09032464000020">The difficulty has always arisen with going beyond the simple aim of extra consistency with extra understanding. The Government have got into trouble by trying to make one of the leading goals of the Sentencing Council and sentencing guidelines simply to save money by various means, including the fairly laudable one of making the criminal justice system more predictable. The problem is that that creates an incentive to make the guidelines far too rigid, to the extent that one could end up with the position in some United States jurisdictions, where the guidelines are so rigid that there is no judicial discretion. The Government have rightly moved from the rigid model, but also have to admit that the benefits that it would have brought in financial predictability have been somewhat compromised.</p>

My overriding concern is not the total amount that the Government spend on sentencing, but the direction of the criminal justice system. I especially want the guidelines to help further the aim of turning the criminal justice system around so that its main purpose is to reduce reoffending by imposing sentences that work, as opposed to those that simply sound tough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para33"><a name="09032464000022">I am fortified in my view by not only members of my party, but members of other parties in the House and members of the Justice Committee. Reducing reoffending should become a central aim of sentencing. Other matters cannot be ignored, but when reducing reoffending is ignored, the result is inevitably that crime is higher. There are more victims. The Government are right that victims and concern for them should be at the heart of the criminal justice system, but that must include potential victims. Only by reducing reoffending&#151;most offending is committed by those who have done things in the past&#151;do we genuinely put victims, especially potential victims, at the heart of the system.</p>

 I endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. I signed amendments 20 and 21 because it is a weakness not to specify the purpose of the Sentencing Council.

Gentleman recall that, when we took evidence about what victims want, we were told that, other than wanting the offence that victimised them not to have happened, they wanted it not to happen again?

evidence shows that they would not, our duty is to ensure the imposition of sentences that do. We are perfectly capable of making those decisions, but bound to take into account what the public want from sentencing. As the right hon. Gentleman said, they want to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime in future. That is the point of amendments 20 and 21.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90324-0012.htm_para34"><a name="09032464000025">We know more about what works and what does not in sentencing than might be supposed from reading the newspapers.

 Surely the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is rather less absolute and is, in fact, a relative one. The point is not that short sentences never work nor that effective community sentences always work. There is no doubt&#151;the reoffending data are made public&#151;that offenders are less likely to reoffend if they have received an effective community punishment than they are if they have served a short sentence. However, offenders are also less likely to reoffend if they have served a very long sentence&#151;not that I am recommending that. My last point, which is about the dilemma facing the courts and policy makers, is that in almost every case where a short sentence is given out by the courts, it is given because the offender is one of those who has been given a community sentence and has failed to stop his reoffending. That is the dilemma for the courts and that is why they are bound to resort to short sentences.</p>

 The Secretary of State is right in his analysis of the effect of some short sentences and the effect of longer sentences, but we also need to bear in mind something that might be missed if one takes what he said at face value. Those who get longer sentences tend not to be the chaotic characters who get short sentences; rather, they tend to be armed robbers or professional criminals. They are therefore altogether better able to look after themselves in prison and outside it, subject to being caught, whereas short-term repeat offenders are, by and large, chaotic characters who commit crimes to fuel a drug habit.

 That is an important point. In cases of domestic murder, for example, the chances of reoffending are usually very low, which will skew the statistics that the Secretary of State used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09032464000031">We know that for the type of offender that the Secretary of State was talking about&#151;those with chaotic lives who sometimes find that they are sent to prison because the courts lose patience and cannot think of anything else to do with them&#151;drug and alcohol treatment programmes are more effective, although not always effective, when delivered in the community than they are when delivered in prison. The reasons are obvious. Alcohol treatment, for example, is clearly the best way of dealing with violent offenders, even though some would say that all violent offenders must always be sent to prison. Alcohol and drug treatment programmes are far cheaper when delivered in the community than they are when delivered in prison. We could run more of them, and therefore prevent more crime, if we allocated our resources properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09032464000032">We know that what works best for those whom we have to put in prison&#151;the Justice Secretary is right: there are some people whom we have to put in prison&#151;in reducing reoffending are training, education and work programmes. In fact, it turns out that those programmes are cheaper and more effective in prison than they are outside it, for various reasons. That tells us the direction in which prison policy should go, not just the direction in which sentencing should go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09032464000033">All I am saying is that we need a dynamic system in which whatever we know from the results of research is built into the process of drawing up the sentencing guidelines. That is all that amendment 20 aims to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09032464000034">One issue in this debate is costs and the extent to which they should be a relevant consideration in criminal justice policy. Let me make it plain that I have absolutely no objection to considering the relative costs of sentences in deciding what should be in the guidelines. It seems obvious that if two sentences are equally effective in reducing reoffending, we should use the cheaper one, because we can do more of it and prevent more crime in the long term. However, I hope that the Government will make it clear that that is the not the same as making sentences in individual cases respond solely to cost, because not only individual cases would be affected. In fact, given the disparate nature of sentencing, doing that would probably not be cost-effective, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09032464000035">It is also important to distinguish between the total resources available to the criminal justice system and the relative costs of different sentences. Sentencing guidelines should take into account relative costs, but that does not mean that they should take into account the total resources available to the system. That is the Government&#146;s business. It is for the Government to ensure that the resources are available to make sentencing in the criminal justice system work. As I understand it, that is the spirit of amendment 44, which has been tabled by Government Back Benchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09032464000038">Overall, there has always been a tension between the courts on the one side, asserting their independence to pass sentences that they think are just, and the Government on the other side, trying to have a criminal justice policy. The methods that we have used so far to try to bring the two together have inherent problems of their own. Sentencing guidelines cause the problem, which I am sure the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) will highlight, of reducing the discretion available to judges. Judges will plainly resent that. On the other hand, if we have only unguided judicial discretion, people in the Secretary of State&#146;s position will have to make resource provision for a vast number of sentences that are never used. That would massively increase the cost in the system and mean that resources were not being put to their best use for reducing crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09032464000039">There might be an even better way forward than the Bill, which is for the evidence that I suggest should be built into the sentencing guidelines process to be built into the Department&#146;s policy-making process, too. If the Sentencing Council and the Department were working from the same evidence about what worked and if they had the same goal of putting what works to reduce reoffending at the heart of the system, the co-ordination of what sentencers do with what the Government do would be more automatic than it is in a system in which one side tries to tell the other what to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90324-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09032464000040">However, perhaps that is a counsel of perfection. I concede that the Bill is, on the whole, a step forward, but I ask the Government to reconsider in detail how what works to reduce reoffending can be built into the system.</p>

 I want the Sentencing Council to be a success and I want it to be effective, and I know that my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor wants that, too. My concern is that the Bill as drafted does not offer any certainty that the Sentencing Council will be effective. There is no certainty that it will address in sentencing guidelines the need to reduce reoffending or to change the attitudes of courts by ensuring that that is at the front of their minds.</p>

What Dame Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, discovered about the incidence of drug taking, drug dealing and drug use in prisons is not restricted to that particular prison.

Having understood that, however, and having decided on the basis of that information and advice what the appropriate maximum sentence, minimum sentence or range of sentences should be, Parliament should not descend into the courtroom, either directly or via the Sentencing Council, to tell judges precisely what to do.

As the law stands, sentencers are obliged to &#147;have regard to&#148; guidance from the Sentencing Guidelines Council, but are not obliged to follow it slavishly. That works well. While I accept that sentencers, be they magistrates or Crown court judges, must explain their reasons for acting outside a particular guideline in a particular case, I do not think that anyone has been surprised by, or unjustly dealt with by, judges having regard to or taking account of the guidance as opposed to following it.

The advantage of the administration of local justice through magistrates courts and Crown courts is that those courts can respond directly and immediately to local circumstances.

 There is a danger in the approach implied in both the question and the answer. It is a twofold danger. First, in order to demonstrate that society will not put up with whatever may be happening in a locality, excessive reliance may be placed on the theory of deterrence and a sentence may be passed that does not have the deterrent effect that it was assumed it would have. Secondly, the process of signalling to society that the courts are not going to put up with the offence may draw them into prison sentences that are themselves ineffective.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but it is not a question of either/or&#151;it is both/and. Local judges and magistrates should be able to take account of local conditions and from time to time deal with criminal campaigns through exemplary or extended sentences, but of course they want to be effective. Judges are not in the business of passing sentences that either are not obeyed, if they are community sentences, or that do not help to reduce reoffending. Unfortunately, some defendants are beyond education and understanding the effect of their offences. I say in parenthesis that I happen to be a great supporter of restorative justice, which the hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned, but it is vital that judges and magistrates should be allowed within a wide remit to conduct this most difficult exercise, which is to do justice to the defendant, society as a whole, the victim and the victim's family, and to play their part in the reduction of reoffending.</p>

assessments, the council will be expected to say what it thinks the guidelines will do in respect of the demand for prison places, the resources that are required for probation provision and for the provision of youth justice services. The question is: once the Sentencing Council has produced those reports about resource assessments, what happens to them? There is nothing whatever in the Bill to indicate that the Government will have to pay any particular attention to them, yet they are key if the recommendations of the Sentencing Council on sentences are to be put into effect. Amendment 161 therefore says that the Secretary of State must monitor those resource assessments and, as far as he practically can, ensure that there are adequate resources to ensure that the guidelines produced by the Sentencing Council can be put into practice.</p>

As the Minister knows, some of us have already told him we have concerns about the resources that are available now and will be available in the next two or three years to, for example, the probation service. Probation representatives are telling us that they are concerned about the effects of their current budgets on front-line services.</p>

A domestic violence programme is focused on changing attitudes and the behaviour of participants in that programme. It teaches people non-controlling behaviour. Courses run for a few months and involve individual sessions, group sessions and relapse-prevention meetings. They seem to be the sort of courses that we want to support, but we hear that there are considerable waiting lists for people to get on them: the waiting times vary from 13 to 42 weeks, depending on the area. The maximum wait for getting on a course varies from 33 to 208 weeks. If we are saying that we expect a course to be effective, but there is a waiting time of four years for someone to get on it, that hardly suggests that we are matching the resources to the programme we believe would be effective.

There will be recommendations to the courts about what they should do in respect of sentencing, and the court will follow those recommendations, but then we will find gaps in, say, the probation provision to make those sentences work. I hope that when he replies to the debate the Minister will address that point and look at what might be done to make that link between the recommendations and the resources that are needed to put them into effect.</p>

the most difficult functions of the judiciary and it has been enormously complicated by the volume of legislation that we have passed over the past 10 years and, if one is honest, many years before that.

 I do not think there has been sufficient time for a full evaluation of the effectiveness of IPPs, but I can say that, when I go around prisons, which I do regularly, I am struck by the difference in attitude between those prisoners who are on determinate sentences and those on IPP sentences.

 That is a fair point, but there is another way of looking at this. When there is an indeterminate sentence and the release date is ultimately dependent not on the trial judge but on those who are assessing whether the person constitutes a risk, the natural attitude of those who make that decision is to guard their own back, and the result can be that many people are held in prison much longer than the index for offences justifies and much longer than a proper assessment of the risk would also justify.</p>

They remember the tariff, but they find it difficult to comprehend that they have an unending or an indefinite sentence. That is why they become fractious and that is why prison governors tell me&#151;whether they tell the Secretary of State this, I do not know&#151;that they are very concerned about the management of such prisoners. I appreciate that the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 adjusted the IPP minimum tariff, but it is a very troublesome sentence.</p>

 I agree with that. Many years ago, when I was an Under-Secretary at the Home Office, I was responsible for trying to determine when it was proper to release people from the special hospitals. We used to get advice from doctors and others on the safety&#151;or otherwise&#151;of the particular prisoner or patient, and no doubt that is still the norm. It was extraordinarily difficult to make that judgment, and I am sure that many officials&#151;and, I suspect, clinicians&#151;were guarding their back, thinking of the criticism that would come in the national press were they to recommend the release of somebody who went on to commit a crime. I think this is true of IPPs and extended sentences, and I fear that lots of characters are being held in our prisons now because people are unwilling to take that chance. I think we have to take that chance, unless we are going to detain people for unconscionably long periods of time.</p>

 There is a further reason why some IPP prisoners are in prison for longer than they ought to be, which is that they cannot get on the necessary course to satisfy the conditions that would enable them to be released. That problem too tends to make them fractious, because they nurse a sense of grievance that the prison is preventing them from fulfilling those conditions.</p>

 I think that that, too, is an important point, and I entirely agree with it. However, I shall move on from what is a somewhat narrow point&#151;it might not even be within the scope of the amendment, but thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for permitting that brief digression&#151;and say that of course I accept that this House has to establish the appropriate brackets of the sentence. That is right; we have always done that, and we should continue to do so. However, my own view is that the imposition of sentences is very much a matter for the trial judge, guided by the appellate court. I think it is difficult to do justice unless we accept that the trial judge or trial magistrate is the person best placed to determine a sentence within the brackets established by Parliament. I therefore agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough that we should not put in statute the requirement that a judge should follow the guidelines set out by the council, hence my amendments. I believe the requirement should be that the judge take account of, but not feel obliged to follow, the prescriptive guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09032464000088">I accept that the council guidelines can bring about greater consistency. That is important, and to that extent I welcome the Bill&#146;s proposals. It is true that the council&#146;s guidelines&#151;this is one of the points made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)&#151;can bring to the notice of the judiciary sentences and alternatives that work, because not all judges go to all courses as assiduously as they should, and I have no doubt that the guidelines, the annual reports and the other material published by the council can inform the courts of what is available and what works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09032464000089">I think, too, that it would be appropriate for the council&#146;s guidelines and other published material to set out the cost implications of various sentence options; that seems to me to be entirely right. I also think that the council guidelines should stress the importance of non-custodial sentences. Whenever I have been to prisons&#151;like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, I have been to a large number of them in my life, both as a barrister representing defendants and as Prisons Minister&#151;I have been conscious of the very many people who are in prison largely because of their own inadequacy or an addiction, and who could probably be dealt with other than by being kept in custody.</p>

Confidence should be not just national but local, hence the intervention of my hon. and learned Friend, who said that areas often suffer an epidemic of certain classes of crime, and a local judge may well form the view that a particular approach to sentencing is right given the particular local circumstances. I shall be very sorry indeed if the guidelines regime precludes a judge taking that local approach.</p>

Member for Cambridge, and which will probably nowadays be regarded as deeply politically incorrect? I do not believe that the criminal justice system should be primarily focused on the victim. I get very concerned when I hear people say that the victim&#146;s interests are paramount. I do not believe that. I think that the purpose of the criminal law is to do justice, and that does not necessarily mean following either the wishes or the interests of the victim. The interests, or at least the plight, of the victim must be taken into account; the victim is very often a witness and needs to be treated with great courtesy, be kept fully informed and be made aware of all relevant decisions. But actually the criminal law is seeking to create a system of punishment, deterrence, retribution and ways and methods of avoiding the repetition of crime. That is not about the victim, and the anxieties and distress of the victim can often cause judges to do things that are not right. When there are victim statements and so forth in court, I personally regard that as an irrelevance. That is not a popular view, and it is probably not shared by many Members. However, I strongly feel that we need to distinguish between the courtesies and respect that one owes to the victim and the fundamental purpose of the criminal law, which is to administer the interests of the state, and not necessarily to reflect the interests of the victim.</p>

 I rise to support amendment 161, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and which I have also signed. Let me explain the background to this amendment, because I know that some Members have argued it may be irrelevant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09032464000093">Amendment 161 arises out of discussions with the trade union group that brings together the various trade unions representing workers in the justice field. The issue that arose time and again is that when Government wields the end, they should also wield the means. The amendment is in some respects intended to assist the Secretary of State in arguments with other Departments, and possibly the Treasury itself, because there has been a consistent pattern in the justice sector in this House: many Members have welcomed various approaches by the Government, particularly the development of sentencing policy&#151;and innovative sentencing policy&#151;but we have had difficulty extracting additional resources. Although there has been a significant increase in resources in this field, it has not matched the level of demand. That was demonstrated in the report by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies published in December, which showed an increase in resources, but also a massive increase in demand and work loads. This legislation will develop the Sentencing Council and enable it to set out various guidelines, but unless the resources are made available we will pass legislation that will have limited effect&#151;in fact, it could cause more frustrations within the justice system and therefore be less beneficial.</p>

as though it will. The situation means that probation officers are having to ponder a quandary when they go before a court and recommend, as a part of their report, a particular approach on sentencing, be it a community sentence, a prison sentence or a particular innovative sentence&#151;I am thinking particularly of sentences associated with restorative justice. They are having to consider whether they should be advising the court, in their professional capacity, that although a given approach might be the best course of action, the resources are not available, particularly within their locality, to implement the sentence. That puts an onus on the probation officer that causes them a considerable dilemma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09032464000095">Amendment 161 seeks to remind the rest of government, as much as this Secretary of State, that if we are to develop the Sentencing Council and it is to be effective, we must ensure, as the amendment says, that as &#147;far as reasonably practicable&#148; the resources &#147;are made available&#148;. If we do not do that, we will undermine the credibility of this part of this Bill, which we, across the House, have supported. Even if we do not press the amendment to a vote, I urge the Government at least to take the spirit of the amendment back in their discussions with other Departments, in particular the Treasury. If we will the ends, we must will the means, and if we do not do so in this instance, we will undermine the credibility of this legislation.</p>

 This debate has been very interesting and well informed, and I shall try to conclude it in that spirit. It might be helpful if I were first to give some background to the proposals in the Bill for a Sentencing Council&#151;I claim some authorship for those. In the mid-1990s, there was, as those of us who were in the House at the time will recall&#151;a number are present on the Labour Benches&#151;concern about the unrelenting rise in crime that had taken place under the Conservatives. Hon. Members may recall that recorded crime doubled between 1980 and 1995. The Conservative campaign guide of 1994 sought to point out that although recorded crime had risen, crime as calculated by the chosen measure of the Conservative Government&#151;the British crime survey, which they had established&#151;had risen by &#147;only 50 per cent.&#148; Both sets of data were true, but even a 50 per cent. rise was alarming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09032464000097">Thus, following the appointment of the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) as Home Secretary in 1993, there was a big shift in the penal policy of the Conservative Government against what he regarded as the liberal and wet approach conducted by all his Conservative predecessors with, probably, the single exception of Lord Waddington; there was great concern about increasing the number of prison places and much else besides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90324-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09032464000098">One of the things that I examined at the time was the question of consistency in sentencing. With great assistance from the statisticians in the House of Commons Library, I published a paper in 1996 called &#147;Honesty, Consistency and Progression in Sentencing&#148;, and its conclusions found their way into the Labour manifesto and then into the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which was piloted through this House by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael). I proposed a modest change: that a sentencing advisory panel should be established. He will recall how tentative we were about moving into territory that previously had been within the exclusive ambit of the judiciary.</p>

Of course I accept what both the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) said about the fact that the court has to have discretion for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which is that there may be what the hon. and learned Gentleman has described as a local &#147;epidemic&#148; of crime and the court may wish to set out imperatives as to why that is not acceptable locally&#151;no one argues about that.

As a result of a major study into sentencing, which I got going towards the end of my period as Home Secretary, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) continued and which reported in 2001-02, we then had the Criminal Justice Act 2003&#151;it established the Sentencing Guidelines Council.

We have responded to the criticism that was made on both sides in Committee that the original provisions were too dirigiste. Therefore, clause 104 will no longer make it a requirement on the Sentencing Council to subdivide all offences into categories of offence, but it will have the discretion to do so. If it does, we invite it to subdivide the offence categories in much the same way as they are currently subdivided. We also make it clear that aggravating and mitigating factors can be related to the offender as well as to the offence, and that is the important effect of amendment 144.</p>

Here, too, we have sought to add greater flexibility to the system. Generic offences such as burglary, robbery and theft cover a range of behaviours and, therefore, the Sentencing Guidelines Council has subdivided them into categories. Where they are divided and there are aggravating or mitigating factors, they can be within the overall range of the guidance for the offence and not just in that particular category of offence. I suggest to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that that will give sentences a considerable degree of flexibility.</p>

 The hon. Member for Cambridge says that that is not &#147;follow&#148;, but something different. I say to him that it is &#147;follow&#148;, but the suggested alteration to the current section 172 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 uses the verb &#147;apply&#148; rather than &#147;follow&#148;.

That is critical: we need to provide considerable discretion, but we must also ensure that that discretion is exercised in a structured way that the public and other sentencers can understand. We are not fettering the judiciary, but we are saying that there should be a carefully moderated body of guidance. That guidance will be moderated by the process of drafting by the Sentencing Council and by the consideration that it will be given&#151;not in the partisan bear pit of the House of Commons but in the more bipartisan Justice Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90324-0015.htm_para15"><a name="0903251000022">When the guidance is finally endorsed by the Sentencing Council, perhaps following amendment, it will become the framework that sentencing judges and magistrates will be expected to follow. It will give them a great deal of flexibility, although they will have to make judgments about the starting point. For example, the existing robbery matrix offers considerable flexibility. Judges and magistrates have to make judgments about additional aggravating and mitigating factors&#151;they can decide that those factors cover the whole of the range laid down for a sentence and not just one category of case within an offence range&#151;and they can depart from the whole thing, if they consider that to be necessary and in the interests of justice. My hope is that we shall end up with greater consistency, which would be in the interests of justice, and of the public.</p>

However, to the extent that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) is correct, and that what the Government propose is meant to be slightly more restrictive than what the Conservatives propose, I come down, in the end, on the Government&#146;s side. That is not because I agree with what they are doing in the Bill, which is to say that we should follow guidelines that are mainly still about punition and the seriousness of the offence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o275"><a name="0903251000546"><a name="90324-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="0903251001950"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 We come to the anonymous witnesses part of the Bill. Members will recall that the anonymous witness provisions in the existing law passed through the House in one day last year, and through the other place in two days. At that point, we were promised proper consideration of the provisions in a full debate, in a full Bill. We are now left with a Report stage, effectively on that Bill, of 21 minutes, which is entirely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para3"><a name="0903251000547">Let me go through three of the main problems that subsist in the provisions. The first is dealt with by new clause 12; it is that the Government have resisted putting in the Bill the mechanism under which independent or special counsel are brought in to advise or help the court as it decides whether to make a witness anonymity order. One of the problems is that an anonymous witness might be prejudiced against the defendant in a way that would become clear only if the defence were able to cross examine them with the benefit of knowing who they were. The person might seem to be only a witness to some external fact in the world at the time of the crime&#151;to something that they saw or heard, rather than to what they thought the defendant did or said. The issue of possible prejudice against the defendant  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 252</b><br>
might not be obvious at the time, but that person&#151;even if apparently only a witness to an external event&#151;might turn out to be associated with an enemy or rival of the defendant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para4"><a name="0903251000548">In such circumstances, making a witness anonymity order might well be the wrong thing to do, but that point would not come out unless someone other than the prosecution had access to all the papers and could ask pertinent questions. Given the circumstances, that job clearly could not be done by the defence; that raises the possibility and in many cases the necessity of appointing special counsel to assist the court to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para5"><a name="0903251000549">In addition, there might well be cases in which the judge was uncertain whether to grant an order, because the status and credibility of the witness were unclear. In such a case the judge might be tempted to deny a witness anonymity order when further inquiries by independent counsel would have revealed that there was nothing to worry about. In such a case, independent counsel would strengthen the case for such an order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para6"><a name="0903251000550">I am not claiming that special counsel should be appointed in all cases. In the Mayers case, the Lord Chief Justice said that there were cases in which special counsel would help and cases in which they would not. The test that I suggest in new clause 12 for the appointment of special counsel is based on the words of the Lord Chief Justice in that case:</p>
<a name="90324-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="0903251001454"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;whether the appointment of special counsel...would contribute significantly to the fairness of the proceedings&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para7"><a name="0903251000551">All I suggest is that the appointment of special counsel should be thought about&#151;no more than that&#151;in every case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para8"><a name="0903251000552">New clause 12 also deals with a possible problem with how the system works now. Special counsel are not appointed by the court, but by the Attorney-General after an application from the judge. So far, special counsel have always been appointed when requested, but what happens if the Attorney-General refuses? There is no provision for that situation, but new clause 12 settles the matter by saying that if the judge asks for special counsel and the Attorney-General delays or refuses, there cannot be a witness anonymity order at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para9"><a name="0903251000553">The second problem is more technical and is dealt with by new clause 13. It is the problem of what happens in multiple-defendant cases when a defendant, rather than the prosecution, asks for a witness anonymity order. The Bill says that the other defendants should not discover the identity of the witness, but adds that the defendant has to tell the prosecution the identity of the witness. The problem is that the prosecution have duties of disclosure to the other defendants and it is possible that the identity of the witness, who was supposed to be anonymous, would be revealed indirectly to the other defendants via the prosecution&#146;s duties to disclose. Nothing in the relevant legislation&#151;the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996&#151;definitively rules out that possibility. In Committee, the Minister said that there was no problem because the witness anonymity order took precedence over any duties to disclose, but nothing in the Bill says that and new clause 13 simply puts into it what the Minister said in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para10"><a name="0903251000554">The third problem identified in Committee has resulted in amendments 160 and 19. It is the problem of what to do about cases in which the witness is not threatened  <br>

with personal injury&#151;there is no threat to life or limb&#151;but there is a threat to property not linked to such injury, such as a threat to burn down a lock-up shop or to damage a parked car.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_18"><a name="90324-0017.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="0903251001459"><h5 align="left">8.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para11"><a name="0903251000555">The debate in Committee was initially about whether property damage should be included at all. There are doubts about whether property threats that are entirely separate from threats of personal injury meet human rights standards. As the debate developed, however, it became clear that there were plausible circumstances on particular estates where such threats, in combination with a general atmosphere of threat and intimidation, would be all too effective in intimidating potential witnesses. The issue then became how the Bill dealt with that problem and whether it properly captured the real-life situation. The Bill as it stands simply talks about serious damage to property, but the question is what that means. Does it mean merely expensive property? If the test relates merely to how valuable the property is, it would tend to favour rich witnesses over poor ones. In any case, that test is not related to the main issue, which is intimidation, not the seriousness of the damage in terms of the value of the property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para12"><a name="0903251000556">Amendments 160 and 19 are tabled in a spirit of compromise to try to clarify the situation. They suggest that the threat to property counts as serious enough if it means that a reasonable person in the position of the witness is intimidated into not giving evidence. The seriousness of the damage to the witness&#146;s property would be judged in terms of their resources, so that damage to the modest property of an impoverished witness would be taken more seriously than damage to the valuable property of a very rich witness.</p>

the process and procedure for the appointment of special advocates or counsel in cases of this type. There have now been several cases that have gone to the Crown court and, to a lesser extent, to the magistrates court, in which applications for witness anonymity orders have been sought. Of that number, many have been granted, while some have not. However, if I remember correctly our deliberations in Committee, the Government were unable to tell us in how many cases the courts, using their own inherent powers, granted leave for a special advocate to appear on behalf of the court itself or to assist one or other of the parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para14"><a name="0903251000561">That is an important omission, and the last few minutes of debate on Report are inadequate to deal with the matter. If the hon. Member for Cambridge or my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham are inclined to press their amendments to a Division, we will support them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o279"><a name="0903251000562"><a name="90324-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="0903251001954"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 I shall deal briefly with the two technical Government amendments in this group. Amendment 142 refines the anonymity provisions to take into account those rare situations where the duty of non-disclosure imposed by an investigation anonymity order may come into conflict with a duty to disclose an anonymous informant&#146;s identity that happens to arise by virtue of some other legislation or the common law. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) alluded to that. The new provision is intended to clarify in what circumstances disclosure of information in pursuance of a conflicting duty to disclose would amount to an offence. Government amendment 131 simply extends the provisions of the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which are to be repealed following the commencement of the replacement provisions in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para15"><a name="0903251000563">I shall now deal, at least in part, with the amendments and new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge, and if I can in the time remaining, I shall at least refer to some of the amendments tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). On new clause 12, as the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), explained in Committee, there is no evidence that the current non-statutory arrangements are not working well. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) asked how many cases there had been. There have been two since the enactment of the emergency legislation where the court asked the Attorney-General to appoint special counsel, and the request was granted in both cases. As the House will be well aware, special counsel is already available in anonymity applications under the common law. We do not see any reason to change that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para16"><a name="0903251000564">New clause 13 follows a similar new clause tabled in Committee and it relates to the effect of trial anonymity orders in relation to disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. As the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston, made clear in Committee, a trial anonymity order overrides prosecution obligations to disclose material to the defence to the extent the trial court thinks fit in any particular case. We therefore consider the new clause unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para17"><a name="0903251000565">Clauses 62 and 63 make it clear who can apply for an investigation anonymity order. It would not be appropriate for the Director of Public Prosecutions to have to  <br>

consent to every investigation anonymity order application, first because the orders are an investigative tool that should be available to the police, and secondly because the police and any prosecuting authority specified in the Bill are capable of deciding whether to exercise the powers or not without reference to the DPP. The orders are not linked to trial anonymity orders; they are an independent tool. It might not be appropriate for the prosecuting authority, in the form of the DPP, to be party to an investigative order that would be pursued by the police. There will, however, be close co-operation between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in any case, under the guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para18"><a name="0903251000566">The hon. Member for Cambridge also tabled amendments 160 and 19, which would alter the nature of the test that in clause 72 the court applies when assessing whether an anonymity order is necessary to prevent any serious damage to property. My concern is that such a change would make the value of the property relative to the total wealth of the witness relevant in considering whether the witness&#146;s fear is reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para19"><a name="0903251000567">I would think it odd to suggest that someone&#146;s personal wealth should somehow affect how intimidated they might reasonably feel if their house were deliberately burned down. I believe that the amendment is unnecessary because the clause will require the court to have regard to any reasonable fear on the part of the witness that there would be serious damage to property if they were identified. The intimidating effect of damage to property is therefore already captured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para20"><a name="0903251000568">On the series of amendments tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, we are not far apart on the principles behind some of the things that he wants, but the sort of detail that he requests in his amendments is not appropriate in primary legislation. We believe that the criminal procedure rules are the right venue for dealing with such detail. As an intermediate measure pending the making of those rules, the judiciary issued a practice direction on 28 July last year. The relevant passage stated:</p>
<a name="90324-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="0903251001455"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An application for a witness anonymity order should be made as early as possible and within any period directed by the court.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para21"><a name="0903251000569">The criminal procedure rule committee is currently working on detailed provision for the procedures governing applications for witness anonymity orders. In the meantime, we are content for the courts to operate in accordance with the practice direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para22"><a name="0903251000570">I assume that the intention behind amendment 60 is to require the court to be satisfied to the criminal standard&#151;that is, beyond reasonable doubt&#151;that the conditions for making a witness anonymity order have been met. We debated that in detail during the passage of the emergency legislation. There are many contexts in criminal legislation in which a court is required to be &#147;satisfied&#148; that applicable conditions are met. It is the function of the court to exercise its judicial judgment about that. It will either be satisfied or it will not, and I believe that that is the right term to use. It is commonly applied by the courts in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para23"><a name="0903251000571">Amendment 62 would redraft condition B to replace the reference to anonymity being consistent with a fair trial with a reference to anonymity not depriving the defendant of a fair trial.

current wording guarantees that they will. The amendment would also replace the reference to &#147;the defendant&#148; with a reference that explicitly covers multi-handed cases. I am happy to confirm that the Bill already covers such cases. When the court considers granting an anonymity order, it must have regard to the impact on all the defendants, and the term &#147;the defendant&#148; in clause 72(4) is to be construed accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para24"><a name="0903251000572">Amendment 63 would mean that in deciding whether condition C is met, the court must believe not only that a witness would not be prepared to testify without an order but that he could not reasonably be expected to do so. In other words, it would add a new objective criterion for condition C to be satisfied. My starting point is that clause 72(5)(a) essentially reproduces section 4(5)(b) of the emergency legislation, which is working well in practice. I would therefore need to be persuaded that such detail is needed in an amendment. In applying the consideration in clause 73(2)(f) of whether it is reasonably practicable to protect the witness by measures other than the anonymity order, the court is likely to consider whether it is reasonable to expect the witness to testify. It will also be able to take into consideration such other matters as it considers relevant, including the reasonableness of the witness&#146;s fear. We therefore do not consider it necessary to change the current framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para25"><a name="0903251000573">Amendment 64 would make the witness&#146;s honesty, which is currently set out in clause 73(2)(e) as a consideration that the court must have regard to, a fourth condition for making a witness anonymity order. Again, we debated that subject during the passage of the emergency legislation. The amendment is unnecessary because it goes to the question of whether the defendant will have a fair trial. That, of course, is already catered for in condition B.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90324-0017.htm_para26"><a name="0903251000574">On that basis I cannot accept the amendments, but I hope that I have clarified to some extent the Government&#146;s position on them.

learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), and the hon. Members for Cambridge (David Howarth) and for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) have been ready to engage in debate in a helpful and positive way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para7"><a name="0903251001025">I commend the valuable and thoughtful contributions from my right hon.

She was very disappointed not to be here to participate in debates on matters that are her policy responsibility. However, I am sure she will be pleased that we have seen the Bill through this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para8"><a name="0903251001026">I thank all the officials who have been involved in the many different parts of the Bill.

Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) and his counterparts, who, through the usual channels, ensured that the Bill had a smooth passage both in Committee and on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para9"><a name="0903251001027">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I said, on Second Reading and subsequently, that we would listen to those expressing legitimate concerns about a number of provisions in the Bill, and that we were open to constructive suggestions for improving those provisions. We have listened, and we have responded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para10"><a name="0903251001028">There were fears that the provisions in respect of certified coroners&#146; investigations were drawn too widely and did not provide for sufficient judicial oversight. We have narrowed the criteria for certification of an investigation, and have removed from the Secretary of State the decision whether a certified inquest should proceed without a jury. As the Bar Council and the Criminal Bar Association have acknowledged, those and other changes to clause 11 have</p>
<a name="90324-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="0903251001029"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;fundamentally recast the proposals for certified investigations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para11"><a name="0903251001030">There was concern about the scope of the power to make information-sharing orders. We have now withdrawn clause 154, and will consider carefully the views expressed by all interested parties. There was also concern about the possibility that the Sentencing Council would be required to operate within too rigid a structure for the formulation of sentencing guidelines, and that the requirement for sentencers to follow the guidelines was too inflexible. We have recast those provisions so that both the council and the sentencers will have greater flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para12"><a name="0903251001031">Another worry was that the provisions in part 1 did not go far enough in monitoring the actions that coroners recommended to prevent future deaths, and that senior coroners were being unfairly denied the opportunity to apply for the post of deputy chief coroner. Again, we have listened and responded. As the Bill approaches the end of its Commons stages, we will continue to listen, to reflect and, when we are convinced by the arguments, to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90324-0018.htm_para13"><a name="0903251001032">Although it is understandable that much of our deliberation has been focused on the provisions that divide us, we should not lose sight of the many other  <br>

provisions that have attracted cross-party support. Too little has been said about the reforms of the coroner and justice systems, and the beneficial impact that they will have on bereaved families, victims and witnesses.</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="0903251001033"><a name="90324-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="0903251002390"><b>Simon Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b>
 One of the matters about which nothing was said&#151;because my amendments were not reached&#151;was the question of complaints against coroners. Will the Minister assure me that the Bill, if enacted, will allow individuals to complain not necessarily about the decisions of coroners, but about the behaviour of coroners who have left families, as in the Marchioness case, or a family&#151;as in the Jeremiah Duggan case&#151;with no confidence in their work?</p>

<p><a name="st_o283"><a name="0903251001034"><a name="90324-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="0903251002391"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 I will come to the charter for the bereaved in a moment. For me personally, it is one of the most important parts of the Bill. It puts the bereaved families at the heart of the coronial system. I have met the Marchioness victims and talked with many other bereaved family organisations. There will be an opportunity for families to appeal to the chief coroner if they feel that a coroner has been wrong in a decision. In addition, the charter will for the first time give bereaved families the opportunity to know what standard of service they should expect from coroners. I am glad that the hon.

 One of the other issues that was discussed at great length in Committee but that unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to debate on the Floor of the House was that of the disparities between funding in different coroner areas. There are concerns that the Bill does not tackle that strongly enough. Will the Minister give more thought to the possibility of allowing the chief coroner extra powers and some more teeth to be able to tackle problems arising when not enough funding is provided in a local coronial area?</p>

 The chief coroner will have a number of powers in setting the national standards and making sure that there is consistency across England and Wales. I spoke to the Local Government Association conference this morning. We will work closely with local authorities to ensure that resources are in place for coroners to be able to carry out their duties properly. As a result of the reforms, there may be fewer inquests for coroners to deal with: because of the introduction of medical examiners, who will look at the death certificates, many cases that presently go to a coroner may not need to do so. Resources may thus be freed up in that way.</p>

It will also ensure that family members have, on request and wherever possible, access to all documents relevant to the inquest and that they will be able to participate fully in the inquest proceedings.

Coroners and their staff have a difficult task to perform, and many provide an excellent service to the bereaved. These reforms will help to ensure that all bereaved families have the high standards of service that they are entitled to expect.</p>

If a member of the public has a poor experience as a witness, who can blame them for not wanting to stick their neck out on a second occasion? So we must put the needs of victims and witnesses at the heart of the justice system. The provisions in the Bill are directed to that end.</p>

Those witnesses who bravely come forward to give information about a gang-related homicide should be able to do so in the knowledge that their identity will be protected. Vulnerable and intimidated witnesses should be given all necessary assistance to help them to give their best evidence in court. Victims and the wider public should have confidence that there is consistency in sentencing across the country.</p>

They conducted a survey in their own school, which revealed that 88 per cent. of them felt they would be fearful of being witnesses. This Bill changes that for such young people, and that is hugely important for them. Victims should not have to suffer a second time when they see the person who inflicted pain and suffering on them, perhaps by killing a loved one, being able to cash in on their notoriety.

I want to remind the House of a passage from a Government Green Paper published yesterday, as it tells us a lot about how this Government think, and what motivates them in coming to this House with legislation. The passage is from paragraph 4.2 of &#147;Rights and responsibilities: developing our constitutional framework&#148;, published yesterday by the Secretary of State. It reads as follows:</p>

At one end, it might take the form of a declaratory and symbolic statement. At the other lies a set of rights and responsibilities directly enforceable by the individual in the courts. Along the continuum there are options including some form of statement of principles which, endorsed by Parliament, might inform legislation&#151;as well as public authority and court decisions&#151;while not necessarily giving rise to enforceable individual rights. Ultimately, different categories of principles, rights and responsibilities could have different legal effects, so that a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities could encompass a range of legal effects and mechanisms for enforcement.&#148;</p>

We also welcome other aspects of the Bill, outside part 1, that deal with anonymity in investigations.

We welcomed the measures on vulnerable and intimidated witnesses and the extension of live video links for the giving of evidence by vulnerable or frightened people. We have had discussions and disagreement this evening about the way in which the Sentencing Council will be required to arrive at conclusions and recommendations, and whether they should be followed or taken account of. However, as a matter of general principle, we do not object to the existence of a sentencing council; indeed, we have understood its positive features since 2003.

Each time they come forward with a provision to increase the power of the state, to diminish the rights of the individual or to create some new criminal offence, they say that it is only a small reduction of liberty or a small new offence, but that it is strictly necessary in this particular case.

recognise the importance of special counsel and the Government have not responded to the penetrating debate in Committee about threats to property and how they should be handled in this legislation. We have not even reached the provisions for criminal memoirs and, although they are fine in principle, many of the details are confused and will cause serious difficulty if they reach the statute book in their present form. Above all, however, what happened yesterday means that the Bill cannot be passed in its present form. The motion before us says that &#147;the Bill be now read a Third time&#148;, and it is the word &#147;now&#148; to which I object. Virtually none of the provisions on coroners were reached. Amendments to do with the duties of coroners, the make-up of inquest juries and how the medical examiner system would work and be governed were simply not discussed.

The Bill reforms the whole law on murder, and the defences against it, but discussion in Committee revealed important weaknesses in the Government&#146;s approach to what is the most serious of crimes. We put forward an entirely different approach that took into account the Law Commission&#146;s original recommendations&#151;which the Government ignored&#151;and what was said in Committee. Those proposals have not been discussed at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0903251001068">In many respects, the law on murder&#151;what counts as murder&#151;remains too narrow for some cases and too broad for others. What counts as murder does not respond fully to what the public would understand by the word &#147;murder&#148;. Many deaths that the law would see as murder would be counted as accidental by most people, yet many other deaths are counted by the law as only manslaughter when most people would regard them as murder. That aspect of the law, which the Law Commission attempted to reform, has not been reformed at all by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0903251001069">The Government&#146;s diminished responsibility reforms are retrograde. They introduce far too much detail and specificity into a defence whose main function is to allow the jury to do justice. The introduction of an over medicalised form of defence&#151;as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) said, it does not include any consideration of developmental immaturity in young people&#151;is only part of the problem. Other difficulties include the fact that the Bill uses far too strict a notion of causation, with the result that the Government are restricting a defence that should not be restricted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0903251001070">The Bill proposes that the notion of provocation to murder should be replaced by a defence of loss of control, but that is entirely unsatisfactory. In Committee, it became clear that the Government were jamming together two different types of situation. In one, a person can claim to have been justifiably angry at the victim of the homicide, with the result that the charge can be reduced to manslaughter. It is right in such cases that the defence&#151;it is a sort of &#147;blame the victim&#148; defence&#151;should be as narrow as possible. The test of loss of control remains perfectly proper in those cases, but the Bill confuses them with cases in which the defendant&#146;s fear of what might happen, rather than his anger, is at issue.</p>

I do not think that justice can be done if loss of control is included in such cases. Many of us came to the conclusion that cases based on anger and on fear should be entirely separate, yet the Government have not allowed any debate on that.

I am pleased that there has been a confluence of interest in getting the situation resolved. It has been a technical process, and there are issues between the legal systems. However, a mechanism has been agreed for the repatriation of bodies and the transferral of cases, should that be necessary. In truth, we do not know how the mechanism will operate, although it was agreed in good faith. I hope that the proceedings will never be needed. Of course, we hope that nobody dies overseas in military service, but at a time when the UK military has a very fast tempo of military operations, sadly there are too-frequent deaths.

down south was very difficult. The changes will remedy all that. We will look closely at how the system operates in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0903251001077">Those are the only measures in the Bill that relate to Scotland; all the other matters of contention&#151;data sharing, murder and assisted suicide&#151;relate entirely to England and Wales. There are also some provisions that pertain to Northern Ireland. The only measures in the Bill that apply to Scotland relate to fatal accident inquiries into overseas military deaths, and that is why the Scottish National party will support the Government tonight.</p>

 There are elements of the Bill with which I profoundly disagree, and I shall have no hesitation in following the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) this evening. I want to touch on the matters that were not debated yesterday on Report&#151;the changes to the coroner system. I have no doubt that the system could be improved further, but I respect the Government&#146;s intentions in changing the architecture of the coroner system, and in making significant improvements to its operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0903251001079">My interest in the subject was sparked largely by the experiences of a constituent of mine, Mr. Alick Moore, who sadly lost his son on 15 October 2004 in a diving accident. Mr. Moore and his family had to wait four and a half years for an inquest to be held, with very little information on the protracted investigations of the Health and Safety Executive and the police into the circumstances of his son&#146;s death. There was little apparent co-ordination, and a very unsatisfactory conclusion at the end. That, and the treatment that Mr. Moore received at the inquest, persuaded me that serious questions need to be asked. I have been in a long correspondence on the subject with various authorities, including the Attorney-General and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice). I should like to say how grateful I am for the way in which she addressed the concerns raised by Mr. Moore in her most recent letter to him. I know that he very much appreciates the care she took in responding to the points that he put.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0903251001080">I hope that the outstanding questions&#151;work-related deaths&#151;will be resolved in the further stages of the Bill, if it passes to another place. The work-related death protocol has been ineffective in ensuring proper co-operation between the investigating authorities, particularly the HSE and the Crown Prosecution Service. I am dismayed that the wait that Mr. Moore had to experience is so often seen as the norm. My question to Ministers is whether they believe the Bill will cure that chronic problem of delay in investigation and delay in inquests being held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0903251001081">It is essential that the investigative period is substantially reduced in order to provide comfort to the bereaved family at an early stage, and so that at the time of the inquest they have clear and conclusive reasons for a prosecution being pursued or not. The key point that Mr. Moore would want to raise with the Minister is how we reduce that very long and entirely unacceptable period between the death and the results of any investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0903251001082">Other issues include the degree to which bereaved families are represented in court. In work-related deaths, corporate respondents to the inquest are often well and expensively represented. The family do not have that  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

opportunity. We should look at whether, within the guidance and the funding of the inquest system, we can provide for families to be properly represented where there are questions that need to be put on behalf of the family about the circumstances of death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0903251001083">One of the things that my constituent found most difficult about the circumstances that he faced was the point-blank refusal of the coroner to communicate effectively with him until the inquest was completed, and even after that time, when he was not prepared to give any reasons for reaching his conclusions, having set aside what had already been accepted as a partial liability on the part of the company involved. That is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0903251001084">I hope the charter for the bereaved that the Under-Secretary mentioned will deal with some of those issues. Clear guidance must be given to coroners on the extent that they can communicate with and have a dialogue with bereaved families without prejudicing the conduct of the inquest. That seems to me to be a crucial point if we are to provide a proper service to bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0903251001085">Despite my deep reservations about other parts of the Bill, I think the Government are moving in the right direction in the reform of the coronial system. I wish we had had a separate coroners Bill that dealt with that, rather than with all the other excrescences that have been added. Although I shall join my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge in the Lobby this evening against the Bill, I very much hope that reform of the coronial system will survive parliamentary scrutiny and will be improved in another place, and that we shall see a real improvement in the services offered to families in future.</p>

 I share the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), and the views that my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) expressed about the Bill. I share the frustration of colleagues who found that they were unable to debate so much of what they wanted to debate yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0903251001087">I return to the subject on which I intervened on the Minister. One of the things that will be a tribute both to the Minister and to the Government and that I hope will survive in the other place is a better system of protection of witnesses. When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he made it clear that he was committed to changing the justice system so that victims and witnesses were better protected, and the Secretary of State for Justice and his team have said the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0903251001088">One of the tests of whether the Bill becomes decent legislation after scrutiny by the House of Lords is whether all those who would like to give evidence but are frightened feel that they can do so. The Minister replied positively to me about that. But whatever the shape of the Bill when it finishes its passage through both Houses, information about the protection given needs to be clearly, simply and urgently disseminated&#151;in particular that the witness protection service works, and works well. I am still dealing with a family who have not yet had a satisfactory resolution, because of the witness protection service&#146;s difficulty in achieving it, following a domestic violence case of great seriousness several years ago. Clearly, that is not a satisfactory state of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0903251001089">The coroner&#146;s court in my constituency has a good reputation, but that has not always been true of other coroners&#146; courts around the country. The Minister shared  <br>

with me her knowledge of the frustration of those such as the recently deceased and much lamented Eileen Dallaglio, who fought for so long to get what they regarded as justice for their children or relatives who died in the Marchioness disaster. As a result of their complaints, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) was eventually extremely helpful in providing a public inquiry. One of the reasons that a public inquiry was needed was that the coroner system, through delay, insensitivity and not allowing the families to take part in the process and get answers to the questions that they rightly wanted to ask&#151;not just about the causes of death following that sinking in the Thames more than a decade ago, but about personal matters such as what happened when hands were chopped off bodies, which was unacceptable&#151;had failed those families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para23"><a name="0903251001090">The Minister and her colleagues are well aware of the concern, expressed in cases that we are still dealing with, about what happens when a British citizen dies abroad and the investigation by the domestic authorities of a foreign country is thought to be inadequate. Sometimes the matter comes back to be considered by coroners&#146; courts in this country&#151;I am not talking about service deaths, which have been long debated. That issue is rightly a cause for concern among Members of Parliament, and by the time the Bill becomes law I hope that we will be able to say with confidence to our constituents that wherever a British person died, we will have a system that, at home or abroad, ensures the best possible investigation, answers to questions and a sense of closure, with justice. The Minister and her colleagues desperately want that, as do I and my colleagues.</p>

 In the three minutes remaining for scrutiny of the Bill&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>It is unbecoming for Government Whips who have conspired&#151;I choose the word carefully&#151;to ensure inadequate scrutiny, to protest from a sedentary position when a Member wants to discuss the Bill. They should recognise what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90324-0019.htm_para24"><a name="0903251001092">The Joint Committee on Human Rights spent a lot of time scrutinising the Bill. We were pleased by the speed with which the Minister replied to our letters. It must also be noted that the Government were willing to provide extra days in Committee, and that they provided two days on Report, when the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill got only one day&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The Government Whip, the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), says that it was him&#151;congratulations. However, is it not a pity to spoil it all with the programme motion, whereby important chunks of the Bill were not scrutinised? Ministers have done an excellent job&#151;</p>

whether the Government will reflect on whether programme motions can better be used, in consultation with the Opposition parties, to ensure that if there is failure, we all fail, rather than us having sometimes unseemly rows about the failure to scrutinise. That does not look good, particularly given what the Prime Minister has said about the importance of the House being able to scrutinise. The Bill involves important matters, and those who have not been in Committee feel that this is their only chance to get stuck in. We have had good debates about some of the other issues. I urge the Secretary of State, who is listening, to think about what I have said and talk to his colleagues about it.</p>

 I rise to present a petition on what may seem a relatively trivial matter but is of great significance and importance to my community in Castle Point, and particularly to the community of Hadleigh. We are an urban borough, but we have lovely areas and views and a charming, green, tree-lined verge on the A13 entrance to Hadleigh from Southend. We cherish it and want to keep it. Residents are angry that a politically correct band of councillors has dreamed up a scheme to put a bus lane in, which will destroy the verge and the trees. That bus lane will clearly achieve almost nothing for residents but will cost a fortune and destroy our beautiful street scene in that area. Yet again, councillors have totally failed the people. By refusing to consult them, they have shown contempt for residents. I warmly congratulate each and every person who has showed that they care about their community by signing the petition.</p>

 It is now just over two years since the MSC Napoli, en route from Antwerp to Portugal, was beached off the east Devon section of the world heritage coast, between Sidmouth and Branscombe, following a storm off Cornwall. What followed was four days of what can only be described as chaos, triggered by the substantial influx into Branscombe of people intent on removing items of cargo washed ashore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0903253000024">The incident triggered a major inter-agency operation led by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and presented significant challenges both at sea and on land, including public order and traffic management issues. Although those involved in the handling of the clear-up, particularly the work at sea, performed exceptionally well, what will be remembered for years to come will instead be the scenes of looting that took place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0903253000025">The purpose this evening&#146;s debate is not to apportion blame but to learn lessons and suggest changes. What happened in Branscombe was nothing short of a disaster, and although the impact was felt locally, the issues that it raised are certainly of national, if not international, importance. Frankly, it is a disgrace that the events in Branscombe were not given the examination that they deserved in a public inquiry. The Secretary of State refused to hold any type of public inquiry, simply deciding that the marine accident investigation branch report would suffice and that the events both on Branscombe beach and in Branscombe parish were not his concern or, it seems, of national significance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0903253000026">Instead, Devon county council was forced to take responsibility and had to resort to spending &#163;22,000 of local taxpayers&#146; money on its own inquiry, a fact that is all the more shocking when we consider that it spent &#163;25,000 of local taxpayers&#146; money on an inquiry into foot and mouth in 2001, again due to the Government&#146;s refusal to hold one. Although it is fundamentally and irrevocably wrong that it was left to the taxpayers of Devon to foot the bill, if the inquiry report, which is intended to help authorities cope better with such an incident in future, is given the full attention that it deserves, and if recommendations are taken forward and legislative changes implemented, that money will have been well spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0903253000027">I trust that by now the Minister has read the inquiry report thoroughly. I congratulate and thank all those involved, particularly Professor Ian Mercer, who also handled Devon&#146;s inquiry into foot and mouth. Will the Minister concede that it was wrong for Devon to have to foot the bill for an inquiry into an event that had repercussions far beyond the county borders?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0903253000028">It has generally been recognised that the biggest stumbling block to an effective operation on land was the many centres, groups and units that were involved in the emergency. Although we have a successful system in place for disasters at sea, we simply have no clear understanding of who is in overall control of land operations when a ship comes ashore. That was the central focus of the inquiry.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 278</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0903253000029">If someone&#151;perhaps, as the inquiry report suggests, the chief constable of the region where the ship or cargo first comes ashore or off which it grounds&#151;were appointed the Secretary of State&#146;s Representative or SOSREP on land, there would be a clear command chain, and the initial confusion need never happen again. If there had been a leader on land from the outset&#151;and I can think of no better person in Devon than our own Chief Constable Stephen Otter&#151;who had been able to direct operations as soon as they were aware of what was about to occur, the scenes of looting and ransacking could have been, if not completely averted, at least controlled and contained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0903253000030">That brings me to my next point: the urgent need to address the laws of salvage. The looting that took place in the days that followed the beaching of the Napoli caused an astonishing 800 per cent. more damage than the accident caused. The police, who were unsure about the law of salvage, refused to close access to the beach until legal advice had been obtained. Order was restored only when the police were sure that they had the power to cordon off the beach. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the current legislation led to delays in the police taking appropriate action. The legislation must now be clarified to prevent similar situations from occurring in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0903253000031">The relevant merchant shipping legislation dates from only 1995, yet provisions in part IX of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, which deal with wreck, are an only slightly altered version of the Maritime Act 1854. We are working with a 19th century statutory framework, devised in the days of considerably smaller trading vessels, that cannot now cope with such an incident. Indeed, the Napoli, which was built in 1991 and carried just over 2,000 containers, is dwarfed by the newer generation of far larger container ships, which have a capacity of more than 11,000 containers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0903253000032">Both the police and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency have freely acknowledged that the legislation cannot adequately cope with current conditions. Indeed, the multi-agency debrief report states that</p>
<a name="90324-0020.htm_brev9"><a name="0903253000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the agencies involved in the Napoli incident have now recommended a review of the adequacy of Part IX of the 1995 Act to determine whether it is &#145;fit for purpose&#146; in dealing with large scale incidents where property is washed ashore.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0903253000033">Does the Minister agree that, in the light of events, it is time to reconsider the applicable legislation and make changes? If so, what time scale can we expect? Perhaps it is true that salvage, especially in my part of the world, was once part of local coastal behaviour, but theft and criminal damage is simply not appropriate or acceptable conduct in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0903253000034">Although the Napoli incident has done much to highlight weaknesses in our maritime legislation, it has also drawn attention to fundamental flaws in the global shipping industry. The marine accident investigation branch report showed that many containers were considerably above the weight shown in their papers. Indeed, the Napoli had arrived or departed from berths or other ports on several occasions at up to 122 per cent. of her maximum stress levels. That, along with the speed and loading, caused the ship to &#147;break its back&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0903253000035">The discrepancy in weight of many of the containers is not unique to the Napoli; it is a dangerous feature of the industry that shippers deliberately under-declare containers&#146; weights to minimise import taxes calculated  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

on cargo weight. That dangerous practice was a large contributory factor in the actual break-up and demise of the ship and must be stamped out. That clearly demonstrates that it is essential to weigh containers on the dockside before embarkation, and that the practice should now be mandatory. Will the Minister make that a legal requirement? If so, when?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0903253000036">Considering that a previous marine accident investigation branch report, published in September 2007, on the collapse of cargo containers on the Annabella, concluded that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0903253000037">what guarantees can the Minister give that he will ensure that recommendations made to the International Association of Classification Societies and the International Chamber of Shipping will be monitored, followed up and acted upon?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para26"><a name="0903253000038">A further recommendation made by the inquiry is that the Government should make a general and permanent commitment to reimburse the extraordinary costs of handling the aftermath of an incident such as that involving the Napoli to the whole range of land-based bodies involved. Insurers have estimated the total bill for the wreck at &#163;120 million, a sum that is second only to the $2.1 billion incurred in the Exxon Valdez case. With claims being met out of a &#163;14.7 million limitation fund, claimants will be lucky to recover more than 20p to 30p in the pound. Instead, it is the taxpayers of East Devon and other affected areas who are being forced to make up the difference for costs such as policing and the use of the fire service, simply because they had the misfortune of having the event happen where they live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0903253000039">Devon county council spent &#163;44,000 on the clean-up, while Devon and Cornwall police estimate that they spent more than &#163;320,000 on the operation. Those costs cannot even be claimed back from the insurers. For the many others who have put in claims, such as the fishermen and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the sum that they can expect to receive is minimal. That is undoubtedly a case of penalising coastal areas for any unforeseen shipping incidents that may occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0903253000040">In an Adjournment debate that I secured two years ago, I raised the issue of insurance. In fact, I specifically asked for a reassurance that the pot would not run dry. I was reassured somewhat that on 29 March 2007 a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency stated:</p>
<a name="90324-0020.htm_brev11"><a name="0903253000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government&#146;s mantra is that the polluter pays, and in this instance, a very large metal ship needs to be removed. That won&#146;t cost the public purse.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90324-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0903253000041">In fact, the cost to the public purse has been estimated at more than &#163;10 million. Indeed, the then Transport Minister, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who is in his place this evening, stated in a parliamentary answer in January 2007 that the Department of Transport would not provide money for councils that incur costs as a result of pollution from ships. That contradiction is strikingly unfair to the taxpayers of the south-west, whose council tax bills are already among the highest in Britain, so will the current Minister now consider establishing a central fund along the lines of the Bellwin fund or, indeed, modifying that fund accordingly to meet such disasters?</p>

The fact that the Government have not yet seen fit to implement that important legislation and that the various provisions of the draft Marine Navigation Bill, which would include the ratification of the ICRW, have not yet found their way into the legislative timetable demonstrates a woeful lack of commitment on the part of the Government. Can the Minister explain that?</p>

Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), whose constituency looks over most of Lyme bay, is here this evening&#151;was based on the area&#146;s sheltered waters.

I am sure that he is as concerned as I am to discover that elements of the wreckage remain, entrapping fishermen&#146;s gear in Lyme bay.

It is estimated that for every bird found oiled on the shore, between three and 10 times as many will have been oiled at sea. The wreck of the Napoli may also have threatened as many as 28 sites of special scientific interest, including the Exe estuary, Chesil beach and the Fleet SSSIs. Will the Minister therefore ensure that provisions specifically to keep ships away from environmentally sensitive areas, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has just suggested, and legislation covering navigation are built into the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, particularly in the light of the Napoli incident?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0903253000050">The beaching of the Napoli was an event that highlighted serious deficiencies in many aspects of dealing with such an occurrence, which is why action must be taken now. This report must be heeded, the national contingency plan must be strengthened, maritime legislation must be adapted and a single person to take charge on land must be appointed. Only two months ago, police admitted that they were powerless to stop members of the public helping themselves to sawn timber that had washed up on the Kent coast, which had been lost by a Russian ship, the Sinegorsk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0903253000051">For an island nation with a proud maritime heritage, it is now high time that the Government demonstrated some form of real commitment to the shipping industry and seaside communities and ensured that costly situations such as this are avoided in the future. The channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and although economic times are more constrained at present, with container ships less frequent along our coast than they once were, that is not to say that things will not pick up again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0903253000052">Figures from Lloyd&#146;s Register-Fairplay show that as the world fleet has grown, so has the propensity for accidents to happen. In fact, the number of serious navigational accidents rose from around 30 in 2000 to more than 120 in 2006, and statistics now show that a ship is twice as likely to be involved in a serious grounding, collision or contact accident today compared with only five years ago. The grounding of the Napoli demonstrated the costly dangers to a marine nation such as ours, and while mistakes were made, this need not happen again. Instead, it is time to grasp this opportunity to learn lessons and implement real changes that can prevent these disasters in future. When will the Minister finally listen to what he is being told from all sides and implement effective change? If the Government are not simply paying lip service to marine conservation and planning, they will adopt the recommendations set out in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0903253000053">Finally, I would like to add that without the professionalism and efforts of all those who worked tirelessly on the operation, including Robin Middleton, the SOSREP at the time, the situation could have been far worse. What I and those affected by this and similar incidents would like to see is these actions replicated on future operations on land. The Napoli incident has exposed many problems that must be taken seriously  <br>

and addressed by the Government as soon as possible. This event could and should be used as a template for future containership casualties and provides an opportunity to frame legislation accordingly.</p>

 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) on securing this important debate. I am very pleased to see in their places the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), the distinguished former Shipping Minister, who is continuing to take an interest in these important matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0903253000056">With respect to the hon. Member for East Devon, I would suggest that the successful way in which the MSC Napoli was dealt with demonstrates the effectiveness of the UK&#146;s arrangements for handling incidents at sea and the professionalism of all those involved. Mr. Robin Middleton, whom the hon. Gentleman has just mentioned, was then the Secretary of State&#146;s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention&#151;commonly known as SOSREP. He came in for a good deal of praise, and rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="st_o310"><a name="0903253000057"><a name="90324-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="0903253000103"><b>Mr. Letwin:</b>
 Let me make it clear, as I did at the time, that I have the greatest respect for the way in which the then Minister handled the situation&#151;he kept us fully informed&#151;and indeed the way in which the SOSREP handled it. The question is whether the ship should have been anywhere near there in the first place, which is a wider issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="0903253000058"><a name="90324-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="0903253000104"><b>Jim Fitzpatrick:</b>
 I hope, if I have time, to explain in a few moments the Government&#146;s position on where ships go if they run into difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0903253000059">The United Kingdom&#146;s handling of the MSC Napoli incident received widespread approbation domestically and internationally. Ever since establishing the SOSREP function, and whenever the subject of command and control of maritime incidents has come up for discussion in any forum, we have consistently expressed the view that the UK&#146;s system for dealing with them is exceptionally good. Nevertheless, there are lessons to be learned from shipping incidents even when they have been handled in an exemplary way, and the MSC Napoli incident is no exception. The Government identified a number of lessons, which were set out in the document entitled &#147;MSC Napoli Incident: The Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#146;s Response&#148;. As the hon. Gentleman said, that document was issued in November 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0903253000060">One of the most prominent lessons learned is about the communication of the role of SOSREP and the MCA to other bodies involved in incidents of this type. The emphasis in the MCA&#146;s counter-pollution and response branch has been on training courses for local authorities. We now realise that the MCA needs to inform other category 1 and 2 responders about the role of SOSREP in salvage and the role of other MCA units in counter-pollution activities, including the command and control procedures that are implemented at the scene of a maritime incident. We believe that briefing local resilience forums and strategic co-ordination groups, and conducting suitable exercises with other responders, may be a more effective way of explaining the procedures that are in place to deal with shipping incidents of this nature.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 283</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0903253000061">Communication is at the heart of another of the lessons that we have learned. Communication of the potential level of risk between the salvage control unit, where the most up-to-date information is available, and any land co-ordinated response organisation needs to be improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0903253000062">The document entitled &#147;National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations&#148; sets out the Government&#146;s response procedures. The plan is reviewed periodically to take account of lessons learned from the incidents that have occurred during that period. We consider that the next review of the national contingency plan should consider the scope for dealing with medium-sized incidents through the use of combined response centres. In such a scenario, the marine response centre and the salvage control unit could merge to form a single unit. During the review process, the MCA could also expand on mechanisms for dealing with beached material other than oil and chemicals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0903253000063">In the next review of the plan, consideration needs to be given to the interface between the at-sea, shore and near-shore protection activities. The review also needs to address the issue of which bodies are best suited to carry out shoreline protection and clean-up, and consideration should be given to the interrelationships between the civil contingency representatives and the MCA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0903253000064">There are still more lessons to be learned. The co-location of response units should be used whenever possible. A number of MCA officers should be trained specifically for the role of Acting Receiver of Wreck and for liaison with police gold commanders, and suitable procedures should be added to the operational manuals. The use of dispersant on more viscous oils should continue to be considered as a useful tool in future responses to oil spills of this type. That was demonstrated during the MSC Napoli incident with the use of dispersant on IFO 380, a quite viscous oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0903253000065">The MCA needs to explore with the other agencies involved how the process of preparing multiple environmental impact assessments for a range of options, and achieving agreement from all the authorities involved, could be expedited in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0903253000066">Action is being taken to follow up the marine accident investigation branch&#146;s finding that discrepancies in the declared weights of the containers on MSC Napoli were a contributory cause of the accident, a very important point raised by the hon. Gentleman. The International Chamber of Shipping and the World Shipping Council have published &#147;Safe Transport of Containers by Sea, Guidelines on Industry Best Practice&#148;. When it met in December 2008, the International Maritime Organisation&#146;s maritime safety committee referred those guidelines, and the associated concerns about misdeclared cargo and the false or incomplete declaration of contents, to an IMO sub-committee for detailed consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0903253000067">Let me turn to some other points raised by the hon. Gentleman. I am, of course, aware of the report of the local public inquiry which was conducted by Devon county council. The Government do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions and recommendations of the inquiry, but some of its recommendations are very close to the conclusions that we ourselves reached. We  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

are currently considering the recommendations, and will respond in due course. The most prominent recommendation is, of course, the creation of a new post ashore, with powers of command and control on land which are equivalent to those that SOSREP exercises at sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0903253000068">The Government's position is that the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 provides the legislative framework for civil protection in the United Kingdom. That includes a well established generic national framework for managing emergency response, irrespective of the size, nature or cause of the incident. That framework is adapted to the particular needs of the emergency. By using an adaptable, but generic framework, rather than an incident-specific approach, it allows for the integration of emergency plans across agencies and boundaries, and ensures that all involved understand their roles and responsibilities, in a combined response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0903253000069">Within that framework, the local management of an emergency is undertaken at three ascending levels&#151;bronze, silver and gold commands&#151;responsible, respectively, for operational, tactical and strategic command. I recognise, however, that in the case of the MSC Napoli a local gold command was not established, as the hon. Gentleman has outlined, until it became apparent that events on the beach were descending into disorder. It appears that local commanders, given the unprecedented nature of events, did not anticipate the effect that the beaching of that container ship would have, specifically with regard to the looting of property. I understand, however, that once gold command was established and SOSREP joined that group, control over the scene improved and co-ordination between the land-based and sea-based operations improved dramatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0903253000070">All that is not to say, however, that we are complacent. When the Civil Contingencies Act was enacted, there was an explicit intention to review it within three years. That will include recommendations contained in the recent report into the events following the beaching of the MSC Napoli.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0903253000071">The hon. Gentleman went on to recommend that the legislation that relates to salvage and wreck be clarified and updated. However, it would not be true to say that the existing merchant shipping legislation prevented the police from taking the necessary action after the beaching of the MSC Napoli. The law states that anyone finding or taking possession of wreck material, regardless of size or value, must report it to the receiver of wreck. Failure to report recovered wreck is a criminal offence. That was the initial information given, after the beaching of the MSC Napoli, to the media and to finders on the beach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0903253000072">It was the actions of many of the people who came to Branscombe after the beaching of the MSC Napoli which clearly showed that what they were doing could not be categorised as &#147;salvage&#148;. That compelled the Receiver of Wreck, MCA colleagues and the Devon and Cornwall constabulary to reassess the situation and to invoke the receiver&#146;s power under section 237 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to use force if necessary against anyone who refuses to hand over recovered wreck material or attempts to conceal it or to keep possession of it. Accordingly, we do not envisage that the Government will be seeking to change the legislation on salvage and wreck on this account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0903253000073">The hon. Gentleman referred to the local public inquiry&#146;s recommendation that the Government make a general and permanent commitment to reimburse the extraordinary costs of handling the aftermath of an incident from a central fund along the lines of the Bellwin fund. That is an issue on which further discussion needs to take place within government but, on the face of it, it appears problematic. The Government cannot make a generic commitment because every emergency is different, and incidents are considered on their individual merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0903253000074">The hon. Gentleman suggested that coastal areas that have national and international conservation significance should not be used as places of refuge in the event of a maritime incident. However, as the right hon. Member for West Dorset mentioned, this proposal is at variance with the UK&#146;s tried and tested policy for protecting our seas and coasts, which is that anywhere around the UK&#146;s coastline could be a place of refuge. When a ship in need of assistance requires a place of refuge, SOSREP inevitably takes account of all the factors that relate to that specific incident, such as the  <br>

weather, the location, the type of threat posed by the vessel and its cargo. This established process allows SOSREP to determine the most appropriate place of refuge, minimising adverse consequences for any incident. It is important to stress that ships are not brought into a place of refuge in order to cause pollution. On the contrary, ships are brought into places of refuge to avert or minimise pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90324-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0903253000075">Let me conclude by thanking the hon. Member for East Devon for his continued interest in the issues surrounding the handling of the MSC Napoli. I have tried to answer his concerns, although perhaps I have not done so to his complete satisfaction. We accept that this matter is of great importance, and it is to his credit that he maintains his interest and has secured the opportunity to raise this debate tonight.
