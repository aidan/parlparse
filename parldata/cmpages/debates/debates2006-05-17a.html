had a huge Department to run, and was deeply involved in the day-to-day
activities of a Department. If I was to play a more central role then I

cheerleaders under his office. That had to be changed. It is not the
intention to use civil servants in that way. Let me be clear that the
office that Lord Heseltine defined is exactly the one I accepted. He
also said in his evidence that he chaired a number of Cabinet
Committees. That is true, but I will be chairing two or three times as
many as he did. He also

this year. However, businesses in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency

those difficulties. We face a range of differences, not only in
Departments, but in the pensions for which they are responsible. I will
do my best to see whether we can find common agreement, looking at all
ways of getting a fair pension fund. However, I notice that the

The Charities Bill has been widely welcomed for the way it improves and
modernises charity law. It has completed its passage in the House of
Lords and will return to the House as soon as parliamentary time
allows. I will meet the chair and chief executive of the Charity
Commission on Monday 22 May to discuss a number of matters of mutual

Bill.</p><p><a name="06051774000091"><b><a name="06051774000452">Mr.

Miliband:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman worked hard in
the charities industry before entering the House, and he is a doughty
fighter for charities in his own constituency. On the issue of
irrecoverable VAT, it would cost &#163;500 million to return all that
VAT to charities. Two reviews have looked at the questionof
whether there is a way of doing so for somecharities and not
others, but they have not found a solution. The Government have done a
huge amount of work on charities&#146; tax position, and there has
been a &#163;400 million increase in the amount that they receive
under Gift Aid since we introduced reforms. That is just one of the
things that the Government are doing to help the charitable
sector.</p><p><a name="06051774000093"><b><a name="06051774000454">Mr.

what is he going to do about the awful practice of chugging? Basically,
&#163;8 of every &#163;10 goes to organisations that put hired
muggers on the street to make people part with their hard-earned cash

encourage charitable giving, including donations through face-to-face

practice of collecting on the street through the Charity Commission and
a system of licensing by local authorities.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 987</b><br><p><a name="06051774000095"><b><a name="06051774000456">Mr.

citizens against terrorism and crime? In the light of this clear duty,
does he also agree that in making decisions in such cases, judges
oughtto be aware of the wider interests of the public, and

society?</p><p><a name="06051774000113"><b><a name="06051774000473">The
Prime Minister:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, but it is
important to emphasise that because it incorporates the European
convention on human rights, the Human Rights Act allows for a balance
between the rights of the individual and the wider collective rights of
society. If that balance is interpreted wrongly, we must look at that.
It is always open to the House to decide that we will legislate,
irrespective of the Human Rights Act. It is perfectly possible, both
under the European convention and under the Human Rights Act, for that
balance to be more sensible. Most people would agree, for example, that
if someone is inciting hatred and inciting people to kill others in
this country, it is absurd if we cannot return them to their own

answered the right hon. Gentleman. It applies only to people who have
gone to prison, which is why we are talking about foreign prisoners.
If, for example, someone is sent to prison for a very short space of
time and they have been in this country for a long period of time, then
the presumption of automatic deportation would not apply, but in the
vast bulk of cases, as has been explained, there will be an automatic
presumption to deport, and the vast bulk of those people will, indeed,
be deported. In my view, those people should be deported, irrespective
of any claim that they have that the country to which they are
returning may not be safe. That is why it is important that we consider
legislating, if necessary, to ensure that such an automatic presumption
applies.</p><p><a name="06051774000118"><b><a name="06051774000476">Mr.

he goes along. That is an example of a Government in complete
paralysis. Let me give him another example: he has said that the Human
Rights Act 1998 has led to an abuse of common sense and that he will
review it, and a few moments ago he said that perhaps the House of
Commons will legislate. Three years ago, however, in January 2003, he
announced a review of the operation of the Act&#151;what happened to
that
review?</p><p><a name="06051774000119"><b><a name="06051774000477">The
Prime Minister:</b> It was precisely because we believed it
important to rebalance the system that we introduced, for example, the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which allowed us to take money off those
suspected of being involved in drug dealing. It was for precisely that
reason that we introduced the antisocial behaviour legislation. And it
was for precisely that reason that we introduced the Criminal Justice
Act 2003, which allowed us to impose mandatory minimum sentences on
people carrying illegal firearms. What those things have in common is
that the Conservative party either opposed them or refused to vote for
them. Yes; we will make sure that our human rights legislation does not
get in the way of commonsense legislation to protect our country.
However, when we have tried to legislate to toughen up the law, the
Liberal Democrats have opposed all the measures and the right hon.

them.</p><p><a name="06051774000120"><b><a name="06051774000478">Mr.

problems with the Human Rights Act for years. He keeps announcing
reviews, but nothing ever happens. I asked him about the 1998 Act, but
he did not say a word about it, so let me give him another example of
Government in paralysis. The head of the civil service has said that
the immigrationand nationality directorate has been
&#147;performing particularly well&#148;, yet the head of
enforcement and removals at that directorate says that he has not got
the faintest idea of how many people are in Britain illegally. When the

exactly&#151;Michael Howard. Let me tell the right hon. Gentleman
about the current situation in our asylum system: the number of
unfounded claims is down; since 1997, the number of asylum seekers is
down; all asylum seekers are now fingerprinted and issued with identity
cards; and there are now three times as many removals as there were in
1997.</p><p><a name="06051774000124">The right hon.
Gentleman is right that it is necessary to control illegal immigration
better, and there are two things that we need to do. First, we need to
introduce electronic borders, which we have introduced for some 26
routes and which we need to roll out across the entire country.
Secondly, we need identity cards both for foreign nationals and for
British nationals. If we want to track people coming in and out of our
country and to know the identity of people who are here,then
that is what we have to do. The truth is that the right hon. Gentleman
is not prepared to support any of that. His spokesman has said that
there have been43 Criminal Justice Acts and that not one of
them has done anything to help. Let me say what is in those Acts,
including the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which the right hon. Gentleman
voted against: the early removal scheme that would allow foreign
national prisoners to be deported at the halfway point in their
sentence; tougher sentences for murder and sexual and violent crimes;
measures to tackle jury-nobbling; allowing hearsay evidence in court; a
five-year minimum custodial sentence for unauthorised possession of
firearms; and everything to do with antisocial behaviour. So when we
introduce the next load of measures to help to deal with this problem,
perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will support
them.</p><p><a name="06051774000125"><b><a name="06051774000482">Mr.

sack his Home Secretary last week? Whether it is deporting dangerous
criminals, sorting out the mess of the Human Rights Act, or dealing
with illegal immigration, this is a Government in paralysis. The Prime
Minister made the criminal justice system a top priority, yet he said

changes that have made a real difference. But yes, I agree that we have
to do much more. That is precisely why we need the new measures such as
identity cards and border controls that allow us to do something about
it.</p><p><a name="06051774000128">If we are
comparing records on crime, let me just say to the right hon. Gentleman
that under this Government, according to the British crime survey,
overall crime is down, domestic burglary and vehicle theft are down,
and police numbers are at a record high. When he was in the Home Office
and the Conservatives were in office, crime doubled. I do not say that
we have got everything right&#151;of course not; we have got to do
far more. What I do say, however, is that every time the tough measures
that the right hon. Gentleman goes out and tells the media he wants are
introduced here, they are opposed by him and his party. Next time we
introduce them, perhaps he will put his vote where his mouth

families to get into work and ensured that they have a decent living
income. Somewhere in the region of 2 million pensioners have been
lifted out of acute hardship. That has been achieved by a combination
of measures&#151;helping with fuel poverty, as well as the pension
credit. It is important to realise that, even though there are still
too many people in our country living in poverty, the situation is a

to address the energy security needs of the United
Kingdom&#151;including Scotland&#151;we have to be prepared to take
the necessary decisions to ensure that we do not end up entirely
dependent on foreign imports of gas. That would not be sensible, in my
view. I do not believe that nuclear power is the sole answer. Of course
renewables are important, as are energy efficiency and carbon
sequestration. All the measures that we are taking will assist us, but
we have to debate very seriously whether we need to replace nuclear
power stations to guarantee the future energy needs of this country;
otherwise, we would be engaging in a collective dereliction of our

met the goal of getting treatment to all sufferers of HIV/AIDS by 2010.
At the time, he said that that would be difficult because other
countries needed to take action as well. Will he confirm that the
Government are now supporting the campaign to set interim targets? Now
that we have domestic consensus on the issue, will he tell the House

would accept. I think that there is to be a meeting at the United
Nations shortly, and we need to try to agree how we should stage the
delivery of as near as possible universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment
by 2010. The whole purpose of what we are trying to do is to ensure not
only that our money will help to deliver that target but that there is
a co-ordinated effort right across the international community.
Fortunately, the auspices for that are reasonably
good.</p><p><a name="06051774000143"><b><a name="06051774000498">Mr.

set an interim target for 2008, to give us a better prospect of hitting
the overall target in 2010. Does the Prime Minister agree that one of
the real challenges is to help children with HIV, who need access to
specialist paediatric drugs? At present, there is little demand for
such drugs in the west, but there is a big demand in Africa. What steps
is the Prime Minister going to take to talk to the drugs companies to
ensure wider provision of these vital
treatments?</p><p><a name="06051774000144"><b><a name="06051774000499">The

prepared to work with us to try to make sure that the treatments are
available as cheaply as possible. Over the next few years, we are
contributing in the region of &#163;1.5 billion to tackle AIDS, TB
and malaria, which is a huge commitment from this country, and rightly
so. If we can set staging posts for universal access by 2010, we will
do that. The important thing, however, is that that be done on a
collective basis. It is important, too, that we do not forget the other
two components involved in helping Africa, which are decisions that
will be taken this year: first, the 20,000 peacekeepers that we need to
have trained by the end of the year, which will be dramatically
important in places such as Sudan; and secondly, the World Trade
Organisation deal. That development package is of essential importance
to the

John Maples (Stratford-on-Avon) (Con):</b>
The Prime Minister says
that our forces in Iraq are doing a wonderful job, and, of course, they
are&#151;we all acknowledge that. However, the Saddam Hussein regime
was overthrown three years ago, yet the violence is getting worse all
the time, even in the south of the country. Our forces are often the
target of terrorist attacks, and the very presence of coalition forces
is used by terrorists as an excuse for their appalling violence. Would
not a timetable for an orderly withdrawal of coalition forces, say,
over the next 12 months, force the Iraqi Government and Iraqi citizens
to come to terms with this problem and take control of their own
destiny?</p><p><a name="06051774000152"><b><a name="06051774000507">The
Prime Minister:</b> The hon. Gentleman put his finger on it
when he said that the presence of coalition forces was being used as an
excuse by the terrorist groups. It is important to understand that the
Iraqi Government which I hope will be formed in the next few days will
be, for the first time, a genuine unity Government. In other words,
they will include as part of a coalition across all the different
groups in the country representatives of the Shi&#146;a, Sunni and
Kurdish people. If that Government are in place, obviously the whole of
Iraq can take a more benign path and escape from its current
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06051774000153">The
purpose of both the militia in the south of the country and those who
are still fighting, along with the al-Qaeda people, in the centre and
the north is to stop that democratic Government functioning. I think
that we must work with the new Government once they have been formed.
Of course it has always been our strategy to withdraw when the Iraqis
wish us to do so&#151;when they are capable of handling their
security themselves. We need to sit down with the new Government once
they have been formed, and work out how we can ensure that the rest of
the build-up of the Iraqi forces takes place so that of course, in
time, we can withdraw. That is the very purpose of what we are trying
to do.</p><p><a name="06051774000154">It is important
to realise one thing, however. The purpose of these groups&#151;who
know perfectly well that our desire is not to stay there, but to leave
once the job is done&#151;is to prevent the country from securing a
broad coalition of unity across all the groups so that Iraq can be
governed properly. In my view, it is the Iraqi Government who are the
key to determination of the timetable, not the terrorist
groups.</p><p><a name="06051774000155"><b><a name="06051774000508">Patrick

then say that no new homes should be built and there should be no
development. That development will happen in a planned way, but it
would be of great assistance, frankly, if the opposition parties agreed
that we will have to build more homes in the south if we are to relieve

rainfall for 19 months. In particular, the south-east has been much
drier than during the notable drought of 1974-76. The Environment
Agency believes that the droughtin the south-east has the
potential to be the worst for 100 years. Water planning is based on the
principle that each water company has a water resource plan looking
ahead 25 years. Water companies also have a drought plan setting out
how they will continue to meet their duties during a water
shortage.</p><p><a name="06051774000171">I recognise the public concern
about leakage rates. Ofwat, the economic regulator, sets targets for
leakage and over the past 10 years, leakage rates have reduced by 30
per cent. However, there is more to be done, particularly by some
companies. Since privatisation, water companies have invested
&#163;55 billion in water and sewerage assets, and more than
&#163;3.5 billion in 2004-05 alone.</p><p><a name="06051774000172">As the House will be aware,
water companies in the south-east have introduced hosepipe and
sprinkler bans to manage the drought situation. The recent decision to
approve the Sutton and East Surrey Water drought order application is
the next step beyond a hosepipe ban. I am considering the independent
inspector&#146;s reports following the hearings on the drought order
applications made by Southern Water and Mid Kent
Water.</p><p><a name="06051774000173"><b><a name="06051774000522">Mr.
Ainsworth:</b> May I begin by congratulating the hon.

Opposition do not blame the Government for the weather, even though
some of my colleagues would like us to. Many of us will remember the
last Labour Minister for drought, who rapidly became the Minister for
floods, so we accept that these things are indeed unpredictable, and we
recognise that most of the water supply problems that we face,
particularly in the south-east, are mainly the result of below average
winter rainfall.</p><p><a name="06051774000174">However, I remind the Minister

task of urging people to use water wisely is not helped by the fact
that the water industry loses more than 3.5 billion litres of water a
day in leaks? Is he completely satisfied that all water companies are
addressing the pressing issue of renewing our water supply
infrastructure with the sense of urgency and the use of technology that
people have a right to expect? Does he accept that it is reasonable for
people to ask why they should do their bit, if the water companies do
not seem to be doing theirs? Is he satisfied that a sufficiently robust

given that Thames Water has missed its target for fixing leaks for five
years in a row

regime?</p><p><a name="06051774000179">What
is the Government&#146;s policy on the construction of new reservoirs
in the south-east? Is it not the height of folly, and seriously
irresponsible, for the Government to press ahead with plans for
millions of new homes in the south-east, an area already suffering from
water stress, without having first put in place the infrastructure to
support them? We all accept the need for more affordable housing, but
nobody&#151;least of all the people who would move into the new
homes&#151;would thank the Government if they were subjected to
regular restrictions on their water use. Will the Government therefore
support the Bill introduced yesterday by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), which would require an
assessment of the adequacy of water supplies to be made before the
construction of new homes or commercial
developments?</p><p><a name="06051774000180">What
plans do the Government have in place to ensure that supply matches
demand, if we have another dry winter next year? Do the Government have
any plans in that regard? What action do the Government have in mind to
support those businesses that are likely to suffer from the
consequences of drought orders? What assessment has the Minister made
of the number of businesses that may face closure as a result of the
restrictions he has sanctioned? What discussions has he had with major
sporting venues, such as Wimbledon, Lords, race courses and golf
courses about the likely impact on them of the imposition of drought
orders?</p><p><a name="06051774000181">We

Pearson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his words of
welcome. I do indeed follow an illustrious predecessor in Denis Howell,
who was the Member of Parliament for Small Heath. I am also responsible
for floods, and if I am as successful in encouraging rainfall as he
was, I will be delighted.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1001</b><br><p><a name="06051774000183">I welcome the
realism shown by the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth). The
situation is principally the result of below average rainfall for 19
months, so groundwater levels are very low. Although reservoir levels
in the south-east are not that bad, more than70 per cent. of
the area&#146;s water comes from groundwater, and the Environment
Agency&#146;s recent report shows those levels to be very
low.</p><p><a name="06051774000184">The Government
recognise that there are too many leaks and we also believe that some
water companies need to up their game. However, Sutton and East Surrey
Water has met its leakage targets and the headline figures for 2004-05
show a reduction in leakage rates from 2003-04. All but three water
companies met their leakage
targets.</p><p><a name="06051774000185">I
note what the hon. Gentleman said about compulsory metering, which is
not Government policy but which clearly has environmental benefits. The
evidence suggests that it reduces domestic consumption by about 10 per
cent., so it is worth serious consideration. All of us have to do our
bit, water companies and consumers in the south-east alike. We need to
think about the simple things, such as ensuring that the tap is turned
off when we brush out teeth and that washing machines are fully loaded.
Collectively, simple measures like that can have a major
effect.</p><p><a name="06051774000186">The hon.
Gentleman asked about new reservoirs. He will know that five new
reservoirs are planned for the south-east, and that three others in the
area are to be expanded. The region&#146;s particular geography means
that, traditionally, it has relied on groundwater far more than other
parts of the UK. Reservoirs can be part of the solution in the
south-east, but they will never be the whole solution and especially
not in the short term, as of course the normal planning procedures
apply. That is why we have drought orders.</p><p><a name="06051774000187">The hon. Gentleman raised an
important point to do with new housing developments in the south-east,
and I shall explain how the system works. Water companies produce
25-year water resource plans that take account of future housing need,
where that is clearly defined, and I am informed that the plans
currently take account of 900,000 extra houses in the south-east. The
regulator has to agree investment plans with the individual companies,
based on the water resource forecasts. Those investment plans have been
agreed up to 2010, but the next review of water prices and investment
plans begins in 2009 and will take account of all housing development
planned up to that
year.</p><p><a name="06051774000188">Lastly, the hon.
Gentleman asked various questions about the impact on businesses and
sporting venues. I emphasise that so far we have granted one drought
order, and we expect the company concerned to implement it
proportionately and sensitively. We do not know how long the present
situation will last, but it is in everyone&#146;s interest to take
action now. If there is a message to people in the south-east, it is
that they should use water wisely in the current
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06051774000189"><b><a name="06051774000524">Paddy
Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> This year, water and sewerage
charges are up 5.5 per cent on last year. The Minister was reluctant to
name poor performers, but will he have discussions with Ofwat about the

<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1002</b><br>performance of Thames Water, and of Severn Trent Water, the company that
serves his constituency? Will he ensure that customers, who are paying
substantially more this year, get a decent and improved
service?</p><p><a name="06051774000190"><b><a name="06051774000525">Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall certainly meet the regulator regularly,
as it is important to ensure that customers get a fair a deal. That is
what Ofwat is about. The fact that Thames Water has consistently missed
its leakage targets for a long time is a serious problem that I intend
to discuss with the company and the
regulator.</p><p><a name="06051774000191"><b><a name="06051774000526">Chris
Huhne (Eastleigh) (LD):</b> As the hon.
Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) has already said, this is a
weather issue so the Opposition would be ill-advised to hold the
Government solely account for that. As the Minister said, there have
been many months&#151;he said 19; my information was 17&#151;of
below average rainfall in the south-east. Has he reached an assessment
of whether that involves a change in the trend or is it in the normal
run of weather events? The Department is responsible for assessing the
impact of climate change, so in the light of possible climate change
and of what appears to be a recurring pattern of extremely dry summers
in the south-east, is it time to reassess the five extra reservoirs
already planned for the
area?</p><p><a name="06051774000192">The hon. Member
for East Surrey quoted from the Labour manifesto of 1997. Is the
Minister happy that Ofwat has required adequate investment? In some
companies, for example Southern Water, leakage is still running at 27
per cent. after nine years. That is unacceptable and requires rather
greater urgency from the Government and the companies than seems so far
to have been
exhibited.</p><p><a name="06051774000193">As
many as 20 years ago plans for a national water grid were mooted. Are
they being reconsidered in the context of current drought orders,
hosepipe bans and water shortages? We know that water metering has a
clear impact in reducing use. Not only has Ken Livingstone backed water
metering, as the hon. Member for East Surrey mentioned, but a possibly
even more authoritative body, the Consumer Council for Water, has
backed compulsory metering in affected parts of the south-east. Will
the Government consider, not a general plan for metering, but at least
a plan for metering in affected
areas?</p><p><a name="06051774000194">The
Minister mentioned the Government&#146;s commitment to extra house
building in the south-east: 580,000 houses over the next 20 years. Is
not it time to recognise that the infrastructural needs of that housing
have not been put in place ahead of the new build? We have had new
build and we are still suffering not merely water shortages but
considerable problems with drainage and sewerage, which are another
aspect of the water companies&#146; responsibilities. Will the
Minister tell us whether the Department will seriously consider putting
a block on development in the most affected areas until it is clear
that the infrastructure is in place? Finally, does the Minister agree
with the Mayor of London&#146;s turning down a planning request for a
desalination plant that would ease some of the difficulties in the
area?</p><p><a name="06051774000195"><b><a name="06051774000527">Ian
Pearson:</b> On climate change, I am informed by experts that
droughts tend to go in cycles, but I do not think anybody knows what
the full impact of climate 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1003</b><br>change is likely to be on our environment and whether we are likely to
see more sudden occurrences of drought or floods. We need to keep the
situation under close
review.</p><p><a name="06051774000196">In
the planning framework, water resource plans are based on looking at
the worst drought scenario in 1993-94 and assuming that, with hosepipe
and non-essential usage bans, a month&#146;s supply would be left.
That equates to a one in a hundred years occurrence. Unfortunately, it
seems that there is a prospect of such an occurrence this summer. We
all hope that that will not be the case but we cannot guarantee
it.</p><p><a name="06051774000197">I have already
answered the questions about leakage and metering, but I emphasise that
more can be done about leakages. There is an economic leakage rate, but
it is important that we set leakage targets and that they are met by
water companies. Where they are not met we want to know why and,
ultimately, the regulator will use the powers at his
discretion.</p><p><a name="06051774000198">There has
been an increase in metering, which covers about 27 per cent. of the
total household population. It has been rising in recent years and I
expect that trend to continue, but we should not force meters on
people&#151;certainly not unless there is a water scarcity. There are
clear environmental benefits from introducing water metering, and we as
a Government need to look at how those benefits can be
realised.</p><p><a name="06051774000199">I have
already commented on the infrastructure needs of housing development in
the south-east. I believe that that is being taken into account in the
25-year planning process, but I will undertake to look into that again,
just to ensure that I am personally assured that those plans adequately
reflect new-build commitments. It is important we are joined up as a
Government, and I will endeavour to ensure that that
happens.</p><p><a name="06051774000200">Lastly,
the idea of a national water grid has been bandied around for at least
40 years. It is not a very environmentally friendly measure, given that
water is a pretty bulky supply and the energy requirements needed to
pump water around parts of the country, let alone the excavation costs
that would be required, make its use prohibitive and a non-starter, but
the idea resurfaces from time to time. I do not get any sense that
water companies are planning on that basis, but they have done some
significant work over the past 10 years to improve regional grids, so
that they can co-operate and share scarce water resources, which has
been very
beneficial.</p><p><a name="06051774000201"><b><a name="06051774000528">Mr.
Michael Howard (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</b>
My constituency is not only subject to a hosepipe ban
but is in the process of being subjected to compulsory water metering,
so why will the Minister not recognise the facts and accept that the
Labour party has now abandoned the pledge in respect of compulsory
water metering that it gave prior to the 1997 election? Does he agree
that more needs to be done to help those who are least well off to meet
their water charges, particularly under a metering regime, both by
introducing additional measures and by giving greater publicity to the
water efficiency measures that are already in
place?</p><p><a name="06051774000202"><b><a name="06051774000529">Ian

<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1004</b><br>scarcity there. Certainly, the water company believes that that is a
win-win situation for the consumer: less water will be used overall,
because people will be more careful in monitoring their water usage,
and that will reduce customers&#146; bills in turn as well. That is
one way in which water can be more affordable, but a range of
Government support measures are available at the moment, and we
certainly want to ensure that he encourages his constituents to take
advantage of
them.</p><p><a name="06051774000203"><b><a name="06051774000530">Dr.
Phyllis Starkey (Milton Keynes, South-West) (Lab):</b> Could
the Minister confirm that new house building accounts for only 1 per
cent. of the housing stock and that, although we need to ensure that
new houses are water efficient, it is much more effective to
concentrate on the existing housing stock and to encourage its
increased water efficiency? Will he look again at measures to encourage
people to upgrade the water efficiency of their houses? Does he agree
that it is perfectly possible to meet housing need in the south-east
and still respect the need to improve water
efficiency?</p><p><a name="06051774000204"><b><a name="06051774000531">Ian

absolutely right to say that the vast majority of the housing stock for
2030 is already in place in the United Kingdom and that new-build plans
account for only a tiny fraction of the potential additional water
usage in the future. We need to focus on water efficiency in
households, just as we need to focus more on energy efficiency. There
is a range of ways in which consumers can use water more
wisely&#151;for example, with dual-flush toilets. The simple fact is
that new house development will be far more water and energy efficient
than the current housing stock. The more that we can do to bring the
current housing stock up to the best environmental standards for both
health and water efficiency reasons, the better for all
concerned.</p><p><a name="06051774000205"><b><a name="06051774000532">Mr.
Andrew Mackay (Bracknell) (Con):</b> But even so, does the
Minister accept that my constituents will find it inconceivable that
the water companies can cope with the huge number of extra houses being
foisted on the south-east when they cannot cope at all with the current
drought? No one will believe
him.</p><p><a name="06051774000206"><b><a name="06051774000533">Ian
Pearson:</b> In that case, I hope that the right hon.
Gentleman can explain the situation better to his constituents, because
there is a clear difference between a short-term drought and the
long-term planning of water resources. We need to ensure that that
long-term planning is effective and takes account of new housing
development, but we also need to consider water saving measures as well
and to use water wisely. His constituents need to use water wisely, but
they need not be afraid that new housing development will cause them
massive water problems in the future, because I am confident that the
planning system can fully take into account future housing
needs.</p>

some of that, but we do agree that there have been decades of
under-investment in the water industry, stemming back way before
privatisation, because the public sector was not that good at investing
in long-term infrastructure in the water industry. One of the problems
with the public sector is that there are always more pressing
investment needs&#151;whether schools or hospitals&#151;than
long-term improvements to sewerage pipes and the water supply. The
simple fact is that, since privatisation, there has been &#163;55
billion-worth of investment, primarily funded by the water companies,
which has led to a major improvement. Most of the water companies have
made significant reductions in leakage rates. More can be done, but we
must still face the fact that we were one of the first countries in the
world to introduce water and sewerage systems, so our system is older
than anyone else&#146;s and it is still in need of repair and further
investment, which will come from the water companies as part of their

average rainfall for this summer, but if we get a summer like 1976,

declare my interest in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. One
of the constantly recurring complaints from British business concerns
EU regulations. Of course, most businesses greatly resent the very
existence of many of those regulations, but most of all they condemn
the peculiar British habit of gold-plating EU directives. Her
Majesty&#146;s Government transpose the directives into our law so
that they end up being tougher, more complicated and less
business-friendly than elsewhere in the EU. The other big complaint is
the open-ended lifespan of many of the directives. Time and again,
business tells Members that what was relevant 10 years ago is now often
out of date, yet the directives remain in place, so why not time limit
the directives with sunset clauses?</p><p><a name="06051774000227">That is why
my Bill has two key aims: first, to outlaw gold-plating by giving
businesses and individuals the right to launch a challenge in the
courts, and, secondly, to ensure that directives can be challenged if
they do not contain a sunset clause. I pay tribute to the entrepreneur,
Sir Paul Judge, who has put a great deal of effort and work into the
Bill, and also to my hon. Friends the Members for Cities of London and
Westminster(Mr. Field) and for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), who
introduced similar Bills in the last Parliament.</p><p><a name="06051774000228">In a few minutes,
I will outline to the House some further details about the Bill, but I
just want to say a word or two about the current context that business
is facing. Anyone listening to the Chancellor&#146;s recent Budget
statement would have heard an upbeat assessment of UK plc. We heard a
great deal about inflation, growth, interest rates and employment.
However, whatever the Chancellor said in his Budget statement, dark
storm clouds are gathering over the UK economy. The recent trade
figures were atrocious. Indeed, trade in goods showed a quarterly
deficit of &#163;18.9 billion, which was the worst since records
began in 1697. I am struggling to remember who was on the throne in
1697, although I sure that my hon. Friend the Member for South
Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) will know&#151;was it William of
Orange? That was a long time ago and the figures are
disgraceful.</p><p><a name="06051774000229">Our
competitive position is under threat. Indeed, in the World Economic
Forum&#146;s competitiveness league tables, the UK has fallen from
fourth in 1998 to 13th today. According to the CBI, we are experiencing
the lowest level of business investment since records began. Spending
on research and development is falling and there is a skills crisis,
with 5 million people having no qualifications at
all.</p><p><a name="06051774000230">The phenomenon of
falling productivity growth is one of the key reasons behind our
worsening competitive position. Our productivity grew at an annual
average rate of 2.5 per cent. between 1992 and 1997, but has now slowed
to 1.6 per cent. over the past 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1009</b><br>six years, which is in line with the rate in the eurozone, but way below
that of America and many other
economies.</p><p><a name="06051774000231">One
of the main drivers for the dark set of clouds that is gathering is
excessive regulation. Indeed, the British Chambers of Commerce has a
burdens barometer. When I last looked at it, the combined total cost of
regulation since 1997, excluding the minimum wage, came to
&#163;50.27 billion. Much of that regulation comes from the EU.
Indeed, Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s Better Regulation Task
Force estimated that the EU was responsible for roughly 40 per cent. of
all regulations affecting business. The relentless tide of EU
regulations is getting worse, and despite what the Chancellor says and
despite the Lisbon agenda, the situation is
bleak.</p><p><a name="06051774000232">I
entirely accept that there are other drivers of regulation that affects
business, including the Government&#146;s policy agenda. We have
administrative creep in this country and government is growing larger
by the week and the compensation culture is exploding. However, the
biggest driver of all is gold-plating, although it is the most
avoidable of all, too. As I mentioned briefly, gold-plating occurs when
implementation in this country goes beyond the minimum necessary to
comply with an EU directive. It can involve extending the scope of a
directive by adding to its substantive requirements, or substituting
wider UK legal terms for those in the directive. It can involve not
taking advantage of derogations, or providing for sanctions,
enforcement mechanisms and matters that go beyond the minimum needed,
such as the burden of proof. Such things happen time and time
again.</p><p><a name="06051774000233">Let me give two
quick examples. The Government implemented the EU part-time workers
directive through the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable
Treatment) Regulations 2000. The EU directive stated that part-time
workers must have the same rights as full-time workers, but left member
states to decide how to implement the requirement. The UK regulations
include a provision that UK firms must issue part-time workers who
query their terms and conditions with a written statement setting out
all reasons within 14 days. The British Chambers of Commerce argued
that that was a classic example of
gold-plating.</p><p><a name="06051774000234">A
further such example was discussed the other day. The artists&#146;
resale rights directive or, to give its French title, the droit de
suite regulations, give living artists&#151;it will eventually cover
dead artists as well&#151;a right to a percentage of revenue when
their works are sold. The British Government said that they would
oppose it, but unfortunately, the regulations got into the hands of an
especially weak Department of Trade and Industry Minister in another
place. The Minister spectacularly over-regulated, and instead of
implementing the directive to the letter and sticking to what it
strictly required, he ensured that the threshold for a work of art was
not &#8364;3,000, but &#8364;1,000, thus drawing into the net huge
numbers of extra businesses and items and completely contradicting the
Prime Minister&#146;s and the Government&#146;s earlier campaign in
Brussels to try to get the directive rejected.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1010</b><br><p><a name="06051774000235">Such gold-plating happens all
the time, so what can be done about it? A Bill could be introduced to
challenge gold-plating itself. My Bill would achieve that by
introducing a right for businesses, individuals and public bodies to
seek a declaration by the courts that UK regulations enacted under
section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 were ineffective to the
extent that their provisions went beyond the basic minimum requirement
under Community law. That would apply if the UK regulations contained
extra and burdensome clauses beyond the requirements of Community law.
Secondly, it would apply if other member states had not implemented
certain provisions, and, thirdly, if other member states had
implemented such provisions in a less burdensome way. Additionally, and
importantly, similar legal challenges could be made under the Bill if
the EU directive did not contain a sunset clause or specific cut-off
date.</p><p><a name="06051774000236">My Bill would
force policy makers and civil servants to monitor closely what was
happening in other member states. Above all else, it would help to
change the whole culture of Whitehall and make that much more
business-friendly. Rather than the UK habitually being the toughest and
most pedantic implementer of EU regulations, we would thus actually
move at the pace of the most dynamic and least regulated UK economy.
That explains why the Bill is needed. It is not some
back-of-an-envelope, here-today-gone-tomorrow, kite-flying ten-minute
Bill, but a measure that is vital to the health and future of UK
businesses.</p><p><a name="06051774000237">The Bill
has third-party endorsement. The Federation of Small Businesses
says:</p><a name="06051774000385"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
constructive Bill carries the support of the Federation of Small

believes that the measures contained in this Bill will go some way

Hanson:</b> I hope that the new clause and
amendment will find favour in the House because they will establish a
statutory duty for sustainable development on public authorities in
Northern Ireland. They will ensure that public authorities act in a
manner that best contributes to the objectives of sustainable
development. You may be aware, Mr. Speaker, that on 9 May my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State launched the Northern Ireland sustainable
development strategy, which in itself establishes a framework and focus
for tackling the challenges that lie ahead on sustainable development
and environmental protection, to provide a better future for future
generations in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051774000249">It is
self-evident that global warming is a continuing problem, and the
Government and the people of Northern Ireland and the rest of the
United Kingdom need to support measures that tackle the problem and
make our communities more sustainable. There are certainly measures 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1012</b><br>that we can take which will help to achieve those objectives and aims.
Without a doubt, we need to look not only at our own lives, but at our
public bodies and institutions to see how we can deliver a strategy to
help us make more responsible choices on sustainable development. We
need to take account of long-term sustainability. The Government are
committed to that, and we need to ensure that we take a lead on that in
government so that we meet sustainable objectives and set a framework
to encourage others, particularly public bodies, to do so as
well.</p><p><a name="06051774000250">The new clause
gives a power to the Secretary of State to put a statutory duty on
public authorities. It sends a strong signal from the Government that
we are serious about tackling global warming, encouraging sustainable
development and making those objectives a reality, not just in
government, but in other public bodies in Northern Ireland. The policy
will allow for the transfer from the Department of the Environment to
the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister the ability
to set sustainable targets. I shortly expect to consult further on what
those targets and objectives should
be.</p><p><a name="06051774000251"><b><a name="06051774000554">Lady
Hermon (North Down) (UUP):</b> The Minister
will be well aware that, in his home nation of Wales, the National
Assembly has a statutory duty to promote sustainable development. Given
that he has referred to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of
the Northern Ireland Assembly having the power to designate other
public authorities, and in the light of his good wishes for the
re-establishment&#151;one hopes&#151;of the real Northern Ireland
Assembly, why is there no provision for the Assembly to have the duty
that there is in Wales to promote sustainable
development?</p><p><a name="06051774000252"><b><a name="06051774000555">Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady is accurate. The
National Assembly for Wales has a statutory duty on that basis. My
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has shown, from the
Government&#146;s perspective, that we wish to promote sustainable
development. Subsection (3) allows for &#147;public authority&#148;
to mean</p><a name="06051774000388"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any other person
designated for the purposes of this section by order made by the Office
of the First Minister and deputy First
Minister.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051774000253">The Northern
Ireland Assembly can consider that. The Government have tried to set
down objectives for local authorities and other public bodies. We have
left open the opportunity for other persons to be designated. If the
Assembly wants to have a statutory authority, it can examine those
matters and discuss them with the Northern Ireland team.</p><p><a name="06051774000254">I commend the new clause and
hope that it receives the support of hon. Members on both sides of the
House.</p><p><a name="06051774000255"><b><a name="06051774000556">Mark
Durkan (Foyle) (SDLP):</b> I offer a broad
welcome to the new clause. There is strong support in the community for
the active commitment that the Secretary of State in particular is
showing to moving the sustainable development agenda forward. It is
clear that the new clause spins out of the sustainable development
strategy launched last week. The Government are moving quickly to
translate their commitments into legislation. That is welcome. I note
that that contrasts with the Government&#146;s long-standing 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1013</b><br>commitment to consider issues such as the powers of the Northern Ireland
Human Rights Commission. They are still reluctant to address such
things in the Bill, yet something new can quickly spin into it. Perhaps
the Minister will address
that.</p><p><a name="06051774000256">Some
of the details could be fine-tuned, in particular when it comes to
putting things into practice. Hon. Members might know from what I have
said before that I am not sure that putting sustainable development and
its co-ordination into the Office of the First Minister and Deputy
First Minister is the best way of ensuring that the necessary
co-ordination takes place. There is already a clutter of
responsibilities in that Department that are not easy to manage in
terms of co-ordination and liaison. This could add to the
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06051774000257">My
experience of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister working with other Departments is that things can be
cross-cutting, but they do not achieve the benefits of cross-cutting
co-ordination. I hope that there is enough room for us to revisit that
so that the Assembly and a restored Executive can make the best, most
competent and most appropriate provisions for a rigorous approach to
sustainable development by Government and non-governmental
bodies.</p><p><a name="06051774000258"><b><a name="06051774000557">Mr.
Nigel Dodds (Belfast, North) (DUP):</b> I agree with the hon.
Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). Generally speaking, the new clause is
uncontentious and will be broadly welcomed, but I want to tease out
some details.</p><p><a name="06051774000259">Sustainable
development is new to the Bill and was not discussed on Second Reading
or in Committee. One of the difficulties of a miscellaneous provisions
Bill is that we might have to deal with things that come almost out of
nowhere and at any stage, whether it is in Committee or on Report.
Nevertheless, sustainable development and the aims for public
authorities are laudable.</p><p><a name="06051774000260">Subsection (1)
states:</p><a name="06051774000389"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
public authority must, in exercising its functions, act in the way it
considers best calculated to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development...except to the
extent&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051774000261">this is
what concerns
me&#151;</p><a name="06051774000390"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that it
considers that any such action is not reasonably practicable in all the
circumstances of the
case.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051774000262">As we know, a
get-out clause is always written in for such matters. What examples
does the Minister have in mind? What circumstances could a public
authority use as a means of avoiding action that it might otherwise
take?</p><p><a name="06051774000263"><b><a name="06051774000558">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Perhaps I can help the hon.
Gentleman. The new clause is a framework clause to give the Secretary
of State the power to set guidance for local authorities. It is the
intention of the Secretary of State, via the Office of the First
Minister and Deputy First Minister and myself, as the Minister
responsible, to consult on a range of things to do with the
implementation of the new clause in due course. There will be an
opportunity for the specific targets and responsibilities of local
authorities, and for the Secretary of State&#146;s relationship, to
be determined.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1014</b><br><p><a name="06051774000264"><b><a name="06051774000559">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He refers to
something that I was going to explore: the purpose of the new clause.
He talks of giving the Secretary of State certain powers. Perhaps he
can clarify that. Is it not the case that, under the terms of the new
clause, public authorities, whether they are Northern Ireland
Departments or district councils, will immediately be subject to the
duty? It does not require a further order by the Secretary of State.
The powers that he is taking relate to introducing an Order in Council
to allow the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to
designate other bodies. That is significant because, when the new
clause passes into law and receives Royal Assent, Northern Ireland
Departments and local authorities will be subject to its provisions
from that time forward, without the need for any further action. That
is a major innovation
.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051774000401">1.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06051774000265">To my
knowledge, there has not been much discussion in the council of which I
am a member in Belfast about the duty and obligation that will be
imposed. I would be grateful if the Minister would say what discussions
have taken place with local authorities in Northern Ireland on that
issue. What will the cost implications be for local authorities? What
assessment has been made of that? We are all aware that all this is
important, but clearly there are costs involved and it is important
that we understand that, too.</p><p><a name="06051774000266">Today we may pass legislation
that is entirely laudable in its objectives, but people may come to us
afterwards and say, &#147;We could have done with a lot more
discussion about what it will mean in practice.&#148; I invite the
Minister to address some of those issues.</p><p><a name="06051774000267"><b><a name="06051774000560">Mr.
Alan Reid (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</b> We
certainly support new clause 1 and amendment No. 1. Sustainable
development is clearly an important aim for public authorities and we
support the Government placing a duty on public authorities to achieve
sustainable development. I want to raise a similar issue. Are the
Government considering placing a duty on public bodies to promote the
shared future agenda? It is now over a year since the Government
published their framework document, &#147;A Shared Future&#148;.
Although that document was strong on vision and principles, it was
light on policy specifics. At that time, the Government made
commitments to publish the first in a series of shared future action
plans in the autumn of 2005. That is now well overdue. Although the
Government have freely used the concept of the shared future in
speeches, there seems to be a lack of specifics. Surely that should be
a priority for public bodies in Northern Ireland. Perhaps the Minister
can explain what the Government&#146;s intentions are on the shared
future agenda.</p><p><a name="06051774000268"><b><a name="06051774000561">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am grateful for the broad welcome for the
measure from hon. Members on both sides of the House. As I said, on 9
May, the Secretary of State outlined his vision of a sustainable
development strategy for Northern Ireland. That backs up the
Government&#146;s &#163;59 million package of measures to help to
support a range of initiatives on sustainable development in Northern
Ireland. The principle today is that we give the Secretary of State a
power to place that duty on local councils.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1015</b><br><p><a name="06051774000269">As I indicated in an

practice. We want to ensure that we encourage local authorities and
other public bodies to act in a sustainable way. That will include
looking at recycling, energy conservation and a range of issues to help
to build a sustainable Northern Ireland. I accept fully that there may
in due course be cost implications. In due course, duties may be
placed. It is my intention and that of colleagues, following the

Northern Ireland and for the measure to place a duty on local
authorities to contribute to that. Having inherited this post some
seven days ago, I want to consult on how that duty will operate in
practice, what the relationship is and what the targets are. I want to
examine that in detail so that we can get collective ownership of those

it will be of help to the hon. Gentleman when I say that the Northern

State launched on 9 May. The councils&#146; living more sustainably

objectives. We may disagree on this, but I believe that we cannot
legislate for &#147;A Shared Future&#148; in that way but that we
need to examine how we can put it into practice in due course. I will
look at the strategy and take that on board. I am happy to discuss with
the hon. Gentleman outside this place his party&#146;s views on that
matter, as I am with any others, but the whole ministerial team is

power vested in the National Assembly. As I have said, the new clause
will allow for further public authorities to be designated for the
purposes of the duty. I reconfirm that it is open to the Northern
Ireland Assembly in due course to make those requests accordingly. I
hope that the Assembly has an early opportunity to do that. I hope that

colleagues, I welcome the commitment to sustainable development but the
biggest difficulty for me is the deep concern at the measure coming
suddenly at us and perhaps us not having time to think it through. The
biggest offenders in opposing or obstructing sustainable development in
Northern Ireland are Government Departments, particularly the old
Department of the Environment, which is now split up into the
department of environment, the department of regional development and
the department of social development. Will this legislation do anything
to ensure that Government Departments, particularly the department of
regional development, will use recycled building materials in
Government contracts? Until now, Government have refused to allow
recycled materials in Government contracts.</p><p><a name="06051774000279"><b><a name="06051774000565">Mr.

themselves.</p><p><a name="06051774000280">My hon.

Hanson:</b> The Government new clause and amendments were
tabled after our helpful discussions in Committee and on Second Reading
and they deal with issues relating to the devolution of policing and
justice functions. I shall speak first to new clause 3, then consider
Government amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8,9 and 11, which make
related and consequential changes.</p><p><a name="06051774000295">It has always been the
Government&#146;s position that policing and justice can be devolved
on a sustainable basis only with broad cross-community support. We have
put in place a triple lock, as the Assembly must wish to have
devolution, the Secretary of State must wish to agree it on behalf of
the Government, and the House of Commons must approve it. Consistent
with that position, it is our view that the support of the majority of
sections of the community in Northern Ireland is essential if the
devolution of policing and justice is to succeed. The amendments give
legal effect to that position. New subsection (2A) inserted into
section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 by new clause 3(3)
accordingly provides that the Secretary of State shall not introduce an
order to devolve policing and justice unless a number of caveats are in
place.</p><p><a name="06051774000296">First, the
Assembly motion asking the Secretary of State to do that must be tabled
by the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly. Secondly, that
motion should receive support in the Assembly from a majority of
designated Unionists and a majority of designated nationalists. Having
listened to the discussion, it is self-evident that unless the Assembly
has that support it is not worth considering forcing devolution on it.
The 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1019</b><br>fact that under the amendments the First and Deputy First Ministers
would have to introduce a proposal shows that a majority of community
support is necessary. We want a majority of nationalists and designated
Unionists to support it, too. New clause 5 (5) introduces a drafting
change to that effect.</p><p><a name="06051774000297">On Government amendments Nos.
2, 3, 4, 7 and 10, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I
have made clear during the passage of the Bill it is the
Government&#146;s intention to ensure that the Assembly has the
greatest possible flexibility to determine the departmental models to
oversee policing and justice.</p><p><a name="06051774000298"><b><a name="06051774000569">Lady
Hermon:</b> Will the Minister clarify what precisely is meant
by the triple lock? He referred to a cross-community vote in the
Assembly, agreement by the Secretary of State and approval by
Parliament. However, new clause 3 imposes another triple lock: the
First and Deputy First Ministers act jointly, then a resolution is
passed by the Assembly with cross-community support, then an order is
laid before the House. What is the Secretary of State&#146;s role in
that arrangement? Is it part of the triple lock or is it redefined, so
that he is substituted by the First and Deputy First
Ministers?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051774000402">1.45

Hanson:</b> If the hon. Lady wishes to be pedantic, perhaps it
is a quadruple lock. The Secretary of State and I seek a situation in
which devolution of policing and criminal justice takes place following
a cross-community vote among nationalists and Unionists in the Assembly
in support of the proposal, which is then considered by my right hon.
Friend or his successor, who agree to recommend it as Government policy
to the House of Commons, which must support it before it can take
place. That is a triple lock. The hon. Lady wishes to make it a
quadruple lock because there is a two-part assessment when the Assembly
reaches its decision. However, I put it in the following terms: the
Assembly; the Secretary of State; the House of
Commons.</p><p><a name="06051774000300"><b><a name="06051774000571">Sir

and my esteemed colleague Eileen Bell, the Speaker of the Assembly, has
sought legal advice on the matter. Lest I confuse any lawyers who are
looking at the issue, it is best to allow that legal advice to be given
so that Eileen Bell can make her judgment in due

&#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> The Minister will know
that I have long been concerned about triple and quadruple locks
because they can be manipulated, as the hon. Member for South
Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) suggested. The Minister assured us
in previous proceedings on the Bill that he would consult the parties
about their preferred mechanism of election. Has he done
so?</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1020</b><br><p><a name="06051774000303"><b><a name="06051774000574">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Again, the purpose of the measure is quite simple.
However we describe it, it is a simple process. The Assembly must
submit a request to the Secretary of State asking for the devolution of
policing. The Secretary of State must agree&#151;presumably, that
will involve discussion with Cabinet colleagues because he must make an
assessment or political judgment as to whether he wishes to recommend
it&#151;and he must make a recommendation at the Dispatch Box to the
House of Commons, which must support it before it can take place. That
is a simple, straightforward process, as the Assembly, the Secretary of
State and the House of Commons must secure approval for the proposal. I
am certainly happy with our position, which I discussed with
individuals when considering whether to table the amts. I have tried to
facilitate a procedure so that, should the Assembly wish to do so, it
can advance the proposal in due course.</p><p><a name="06051774000304"><b><a name="06051774000575">Mark
Durkan:</b> Does the Minister accept that talk of triple and
quadruple locks involves double-speak? In the past, whenever the
Democratic Unionist party referred to the triple lock that it says that
it achieved in the comprehensive agreement, it meant that it could
control whether or not there was movement on the devolution of justice
and policing. It would be able to control the form of the Department
and the appointment of Ministers. That triple lock is different from
the triple lock outlined by the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="06051774000305"><b><a name="06051774000576">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that we are at
a stage where the Assembly does not formally constitute an Executive.
There will not necessarily be movement towards that framework in the
foreseeable future, so we will put in place such a framework. Neither
he nor I know whether any movement towards devolved criminal justice
and policing will take place before or after a further Assembly
election. I cannot even envisage a situation in which I know who will
be the First and Deputy First Ministers or which will be the majority
parties in the Assembly when a decision is made to effect the
devolution of criminal justice and
policing.</p><p><a name="06051774000306"><b><a name="06051774000577">Mark

Hanson:</b> No. I am trying to put in place a framework so
that when the Assembly wishes to do so, it can request devolution of
criminal justice and policing. With due respect to my hon. Friend, he
is over-complicating matters that are simple. I hope that, as ever, he
will trust my judgment and
relax.</p><p><a name="06051774000308"><b><a name="06051774000579">Lady
Hermon:</b> May I convey to the Minister a point of reference?
His colleague, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, gave
evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee almost exactly a
week ago, in which he referred to the triple lock on the devolution of
policing and justice. He
stated:</p><a name="06051774000392"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
requires across community votes in the
Assembly&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051774000309">that is
precisely what he said. He went on to say
that</p><a name="06051774000393"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it then requires a
Secretary of State to agree it, and Parliament to approve the necessary
legislation.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1021</b><br><p><a name="06051774000310">At no stage was there
any reference to the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly.
<i> [Interruption.] </i>With great respect to those who are making
comments from a sedentary position, they will get their opportunity
later. Will the Minister elaborate? Did the Secretary of State know
last week, when he gave evidence live to the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee, that there was a fourth element, or has the definition been
changed within the week? As usual, the Northern Ireland Office moves
with great speed on these
matters.</p><p><a name="06051774000311"><b><a name="06051774000580">Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady will know that there was discussion
of these matters in Committee and the Government have reflected on
that. The new clause to allow the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister to propose that change is important, but it does not change
the balance of the argument. It would be strange if the Assembly voted
to devolve criminal justice and policing, but the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister were against it, as they will presumably be the
leaders of the largest parties in the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06051774000312">We have
tabled the amendments and new clauses to support the wish of the
Assembly for such devolution. I say again to all hon. Members that the
Assembly must decide, the Secretary of State must agree and the House
of Commons must support that process. That may happen at some point
when the Assembly forms its
Executive.</p><p><a name="06051774000313">I shall
make progress. During the passage of the Bill, my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State and I have made clear the Government&#146;s
intention to make possible a range of departmental models for
devolution of policing and criminal justice. Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 7
and 10 support that objective. We discussed the Northern Ireland Act
1998 in detail in Committee and we considered a range of models in the
Act for the devolution of policing and criminal justice. Clause 16 of
the 1998 Act permits the Assembly to create various forms of
departmental responsibility. We have sought to broaden that choice
through consultation on the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051774000314">As hon. Members may recall,
during the debate in the Committee of the whole House on 20 April, my
hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) suggested that
notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill, there was at least one
further model that had not been considered&#151;a department of
policing and justice that might be in the charge of a single Minister
elected on a cross-community resolution of the Assembly, rather than
appointed under the d&#146;Hondt process.</p><p><a name="06051774000315">I am pleased to tell my hon.
Friend that his words of wisdom have been listened to by the Government
and we have tabled an amendment which, I hope, meets the objectives
that he set in the debate on 20 April. He will know, therefore, that on
occasion the Government act in a comradely fashion with his party. I
cannot help him on every occasion, but when I can I am pleased to do
so, and I will labour the point to keep him on his toes. Amendment No.
3 provides for the new model. Amendments Nos. 2, 10 and 7 reflect that
addition.</p><p><a name="06051774000316">Amendments
Nos. 14 and 15 were tabled by the Liberal Democrats. In Committee I
undertook to reflect on the points made by the hon. Member for Solihull

<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1022</b><br>(Lorely Burt) at the time. The Government&#146;s view is that a
department of policing and justice with joint or rotating Ministers
would bear a strong similarity to the office of the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister, and correspondingly the requirement for
cross-community support for those Ministers, set out in the Bill,
reflects that for the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister.</p><p><a name="06051774000317">On
reflection, I have concerns that that is a move away from the
requirement for parallel consent from both sides of the community.
Having considered the matter in detail, I have concluded that that
support for any nomination for ministerial appointment to a department
with devolved policing and justice functions that makes use of one of
the models provided for in the Bill should continue to be required to
secure parallel consent. This may disappoint the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), but it is important that we keep
to the original principles.</p><p><a name="06051774000318">As drafted, the Bill requires
Ministers under the alternative models for the Department of Policing
and Justice to be nominated by the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister, and for their nomination to be approved by the Assembly with
the support of a majority of Members. The amendments give effect to
that, on the basis of the 50:50:50
model.</p><p><a name="06051774000319">The amendments
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle would remove the
responsibility for nomination and subsequent dismissal from the First
Minister and Deputy First Minister and put it in the hands of party
nominating officers. I do not believe that to be workable or
consistent. I am sorry that I cannot help my hon. Friend on this
occasion and I ask him to withdraw the amendments, given that I have
been able to help him in other respects during consideration of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051774000320">I
hope that Members in all parts of the House will recognise that the
amendments are the result of amendments tabled but not debated,
discussion in Committee and representations made to me from all parts
of the House relating to the devolution of criminal justice and
policing. I commend the Government new clauses and amendments to the
House and ask Liberal Democrat and Social Democratic and Labour party
Members to recognise that I have moved some way and to withdraw their
amendments
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06051774000321"><b><a name="06051774000581">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I listened with interest to the Minister and
accept that he has provided us with a clear exposition of where he
stands. He rightly highlighted the issues that we address in our
amendments Nos. 14 and 15. The amendments were tabled in Committee, and
in his reply the Minister said that he would reflect on them and
discuss with political parties whether they wanted some flexibility in
the voting arrangements. We appreciate that there has not been much
time between Committee and Report for such discussions, but we
re-tabled the amendments to give the Minister an opportunity to update
the House. He has given his view, but I infer that he has not
explicitly spoken with the parties.</p><p><a name="06051774000322">I remind the Minister of his
words. He said in

small gripe, but I believe that the Government having imposed the

issues. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that there is a
range of issues before political parties in Northern Ireland. The Bill
is not necessarily at the forefront of everyone&#146;s mind, given
the issues relating to the restoration of the Assembly. I am happy to
discuss the matter with the parties, as I have said before. We have had
some general consultations, I have reflected seriously on the matter

system, but I shall not repeat the argument because the Minister has
made it clear that he will not accept our suggestions, which is fair
enough. We will not push our amendment to a vote on that issue, which
simply involves a difference of view. My point concerns the process.
The Minister knows about the frustrations when the Government impose
and do not consult. Without being too heavy on him, I wish that the
Government would be more assiduous in going through the consultation
process after they have inferred in this Chamber that they will do so.
I hope that the Minister will take that point on board, notwithstanding
the difference of view on specific
amendments.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051774000403">2

seems to insist that the devolution of policing and justice functions
can occur only when the motion before the Assembly is laid jointly by

the reasons that the Minister has outlined, as does the requirement
that the motion should be approved by a majority within the Assembly as
a whole.</p><p><a name="06051774000327">The rest of
the amendments seem to be largely technical. In his response to our
brief debate, I hope that the Minister will clarify my concern about
Government amendments Nos. 4 and 6. Does the consequence of those
amendments limit the ability of the political parties to decide the
shape of any Department of Policing and Justice, and do those
amendments mean that there can be only one Department that incorporates
policing and justice functions?</p><p><a name="06051774000328"><b><a name="06051774000584">Mr.

helpful, because the record will show that those amendments do not
prohibit the setting up of separate Departments for policing and for
justice, if that is what the Assembly wants to do. I have no reason to
think that the Assembly wants to do that, but it would be in keeping
with the spirit of giving the Assembly the right to organise its
devolved processes not to preclude that option. I thank the Minister
for that
clarification.</p><p><a name="06051774000330">The
SDLP amendments seem to make sense. One might think that it goes
without saying that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister would
not nominate a person for ministerial office if that person&#146;s
political party did not want them to take up that position. Given the
history of politics in Northern Ireland, however, we know that anything
is possible. I look forward to further clarification from the SDLP
spokesman, whoever he may be, but I am sympathetic to the common-sense
position adopted in the amendments because, as we all know from painful
experience, when it comes to some matters relating to Northern Ireland
legislation, sense is not
common.</p><p><a name="06051774000331"><b><a name="06051774000586">Mark

new clause 3 and some of the Government amendments and our support for
some of the other Government amendments, but first I shall speak in
favour of our amendments Nos. 24, 26, 27 and 30. Furthermore, we will
lend our support to Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 14 and 15, at
least in terms of this debate.</p><p><a name="06051774000332">Our amendments aim to address a
fundamental unfairness in the legislation. The starting point for
understanding our amendments is the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which
implemented the d&#146;Hondt system in the Good Friday agreement.
Under the 1998 Act, the nominating officer of each party, who is
usually the party leader, appoints Ministers, and they have the power
to fire those Ministers, unless, of course, the Assembly chooses to
exclude Ministers from office for particular reasons.</p><p><a name="06051774000333">By contrast, under the system
in the Bill, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister would choose
the justice Ministers. If they wanted to do so, they could nominate a
member of another party, perhaps even against the wishes of that
party&#146;s leader, which happens from time to time in politics. In
southern Irish politics, there is the famous example of Charlie Haughey
appointing a member of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party to be
European Commissioner to force a by-election to convenience
himself.</p><p><a name="06051774000334"><b><a name="06051774000587">Mr.

such events have occurred for calculated reasons.</p><p><a name="06051774000336">We must remember that the Bill
provides that a ministerial appointment will count against the party
whose member is appointed a Minister for the purposes of the
d&#146;Hondt system. The parties would therefore be denied their own
legitimate and proper choice under the d&#146;Hondt system by virtue

another party without the agreement of that party or that
party&#146;s leader through the use of the parallel consent
mechanism. That is fundamentally unfair, and it goes against the grain
of the Good Friday agreement in terms of inclusion and the choices that
rest with parties. It is a return to the principle of parties not being
able to vet or veto each other&#146;s
appointments.</p><p><a name="06051774000337">Amendment
No. 24 seeks to address that matter by stating that the First Minister
and Deputy First Minister may nominate a person for the justice
portfolio only with the consent of that party&#146;s nominating
officer. So, contrary to what the Minister has said, we are not in the
business of denying the First Minister and Deputy First Minister any
role in the matter. We say that the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister should only be able to nominate for the police and justice
portfolio with the consent of a party&#146;s nominating officer,
given that that party&#146;s d&#146;Hondt quota will be affected
and that its ranking of choice under d&#146;Hondt will be materially
affected.</p><p><a name="06051774000338">Amendments
Nos. 24, 26, 27 and 30 apply only to joint Ministers, as they are
currently drafted. However, I contend that the same approach should
logically apply to rotating Ministers, for which the Bill provides, or,
indeed, to a Minister elected with parallel consent, which is covered
by the Government amendment that the Minister discussed
earlier.</p><p><a name="06051774000339">Amendment No.
26 makes a consequential amendment to allow the Standing Orders to
permit the nomination and election of joint justice Ministers. That
would be helpful to ensure clarity on procedure in the same way as the
Standing Orders for the Assembly under the Northern Ireland Act 2006
provide helpful procedural clarity on, for instance, how to manage if
two sets of people are proposed as joint Ministers.</p><p><a name="06051774000340">Amendments
Nos. 27 and 30 address the dismissal of a Minister. As has been said,
Ministers appointed under the d&#146;Hondt system are appointed by,
and may be dismissed by, the leader of their party&#151;the Assembly
may also choose to exclude them. Under the Bill, the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister have the sole power of dismissal, although
holding ministerial office counts towards a party&#146;s
d&#146;Hondt entitlements. Even more significantly, the Bill is wide
open for abuse, because it specifies that holding office as a junior
Minister counts towards a party&#146;s entitlements under
d&#146;Hondt.</p><p><a name="06051774000341">The
First Minister and Deputy First Minister could appoint a member of
another party, using the votes of their own parties under parallel
consent to secure that appointment, only to dismiss them and vote in a
member of one of their own parties instead after the d&#146;Hondt
system had been run for other ministerial
offices.</p><p><a name="06051774000342"><b><a name="06051774000589">Mr.

is surreal, because the prospect of the community having any confidence
in the devolution of policing and justice powers in Northern Ireland is
remote? We should consider the matter in that
context.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1026</b><br><p><a name="06051774000343"><b><a name="06051774000590">Mark

be so, but the fact is that we are faced with this Bill, which is
asking us to arrange the furniture in what may be castles in the air.
That is the nature of the legislative exercise that we are undertaking.
The Minister has indicated on several occasions that some of this goes
back to previous discussions&#151;perhaps more of that
anon.</p><p><a name="06051774000344">Under the Bill
as it stands, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, who
would clearly be fromSinn Fein and the DUP on current
numbers, can appoint somebody from another party. They can vote that
person into office using their own votes under parallel consent against
the wishes of that party, thereby altering its d&#146;Hondt
entitlements. They can then subsequently fire that Minister or those
Ministers and replace them with somebody from their own party, and the
party that originally lost out under d&#146;Hondt still loses out. It
gets fewer Ministers than it is entitled to under d&#146;Hondt by
virtue of the First and Deputy First Ministers using the power that the
Bill gives them. That is fundamentally unfair. The problem with the
Bill is that control is given solely to the parties of the First and
Deputy First Ministers, not to the Assembly or to anybody
else.</p><p><a name="06051774000345"><b><a name="06051774000591">Mr.
Peter Robinson:</b> Let me try to clarify something. I
understood the hon. Gentleman to have said that if the First and Deputy
First Ministers were to appoint a member of another party without the
approval of that party, that would use up one of their d&#146;Hondt
entitlements. Where does he see
that?</p><p><a name="06051774000346"><b><a name="06051774000592">Mark
Durkan:</b> If the hon. Gentleman reads the schedules, he will
see the various permutations that are offered for joint Ministers,
rotating Ministers or any other types of Minister, all of whom have to
be appointed before d&#146;Hondt can be run. Schedule 2 provides that
the d&#146;Hondt arithmetic will already count the holding of a
justice ministerial office as the holding of a ministerial office.
Under the M plus one formula, when d&#146;Hondt is run, M will
include a justice ministerial office already held whether under
rotating junior and senior or joint ministerial offices. That means
that if Sinn Fein and the DUP appoint their own party members as joint
justice Ministers, they will lose their first entitlement under
d&#146;Hondt. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not know
that. I remember that when he asked the Minister on Second Reading
whether it would count towards d&#146;Hondt, the Minister was unable
to provide the answer, but the schedules make it clear that it
does.</p><p><a name="06051774000347">It could well
be that Sinn Fein and the DUP do not want to use up their first
entitlements under d&#146;Hondt by appointing members of their own
parties to be joint or rotating justice Ministers. They may pull the
stroke of trying to appoint people from other parties tothose
Ministries in order to preserve their own d&#146;Hondt entitlements
and reduce the d&#146;Hondt ranking preferences of other parties, and
then, at a subsequent date, use the powers in the Bill to dismiss those
Ministers from other parties and replace them with members of their own
parties, thereby securing more than their own d&#146;Hondt
entitlements and denying other parties their entitlements. That abuse
is wide open and available under the Bill as it
stands.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1027</b><br><p><a name="06051774000348"><b><a name="06051774000593">Mr.

the wishes and advice of their own parties. They can vote them into
post, even against the votes of their own party, and still deny that

Alliance party&#146;s occasional proclivities for running after a
post that might happen to become available.</p><p><a name="06051774000354">We need to ensure that nothing
in the Bill creates new difficulties and unfairnesses. The Bill as it
stands, even with the Government amendments, does create an unfairness.
As things stand, the First and Deputy First Ministers can bring about a
situation whereby their parties hold the first ministerial and deputy
first ministerial offices and the justice ministerial office, as well
as other ordinary ministerial offices, as though they did not hold the
justice ministerial office. If the Government are serious in their
intent to ensure that the justice ministerial post counts properly
towards d&#146;Hondt and does not materially affect or prejudice any
party&#146;s d&#146;Hondt entitlement, they should be prepared to
accept amendments Nos. 27 and 30, which seek to rectify that
possibility.</p><p><a name="06051774000355">Amendment
No. 27 would strike a compromise that is contrary to the
Minister&#146;s suggestion that we are trying to strip the First and
Deputy First Ministers of any role in the appointment of justice
Ministers. It would provide that the nominating officer of a party can
dismiss a justice Minister from his party, just as the party leader can
for ministerial offices allocated under 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1028</b><br>d&#146;Hondt. By way of compromise, we would also allow the First
Minister and Deputy First Minister to dismiss a justice Minister, even
one of another party. However, amendment No. 30 would provide an
important safeguard. If they dismiss a justice Minister and replace him
with a Minister from a different political party from that of the
outgoing justice Minister, d&#146;Hondt has to be re-run for ordinary
ministerial offices as well. That would build in a protection against
abuse by removing the temptation for it&#151;likewise, for example,
if the Assembly or the First Minister and Deputy First Minister refused
to support the replacement that a party leader would want where a
vacancy arose because of the resignation or death of a justice Minister
from that
party.</p><p><a name="06051774000356">However, I
accept that it is important to guard against a party leader trying to
abuse the system by then sacking his own justice Minister and refusing
to allow the First Minister and Deputy First Ministerto
nominate anybody at all from their party so as to trigger a rerun of
d&#146;Hondt for all ministerial offices. I am seeking to prevent the
temptation for abuse and tactical manoeuvres by the First and Deputy
First Ministers and by party
leaders.</p><p><a name="06051774000357"><b><a name="06051774000599">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I would say to my hon. Friend&#151;I mean this
in the nicest possible way&#151;that we are in danger of legislating
for every single possibility. I am trying to put in place mechanisms
for the devolution of police and criminal justice that have the broad
support of the Assembly and provide an opportunity to appoint
Ministers. He may be looking at this in too much
detail.</p><p><a name="06051774000358"><b><a name="06051774000600">Mark
Durkan:</b> In that case, I would ask the Minister why we are
dealing with any of this legislation at all. We are dealing with issues
of permutations. When other parties are insisting that they need
safeguards and triple locks to protect them from all sorts of perils,
is it not right that we who are here to legislate on these matters
should ensure that we do that properly, so as to prevent unintended
problems and contrary effects to those that the Government claim to
intend?</p><p><a name="06051774000359">We
have tabled amendments that would avoid re-running d&#146;Hondt on a
tactical basis by parties. That would mean that the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister could nominate a person from a different
political party, without the inconvenience of re-running d&#146;Hondt
for ordinary ministerial offices. I ask the Government to reflect on
our amendments, even if they do not accept them now. Perhaps they will
consider introducing their own amendments elsewhere that would have a
similar effect. They would protect the integrity of what the Government
say that the Bill is trying to achieve, namely to provide arrangements
for a menu of options from which to appoint justice Ministers without
doing any damage to the basic architecture of the inclusion formula in
the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p><p><a name="06051774000360">I also want to
express our support for the Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 14 and 15.
They would make it clear that justice Ministers could be elected by
cross-community consent, in contrast to the present requirement for
parallel consent alone. The Good Friday agreement and the Northern
Ireland Act 1998 provide for only two occasions on which parallel 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1029</b><br>consent alone is required: the election of the First Minister and Deputy
First Minister, and in the context of the special equality procedure.
We see no reason why that especially high threshold should be required
solely in those circumstances.</p><p><a name="06051774000361">We are
obviously not content with the Government&#146;s new clause 3 and
consequential amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8 and 9. Section 4 of the Northern
Ireland Act already states that devolution of any additional functions
cannot occur without prior Assembly cross-community support. However,
new clause 3 proposes that additional requirements be introduced only
for policing and justice. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister
must pray that the matter be devolved, and a vote by parallel
consent&#151;and only by parallel consent&#151;must also take
place. For no good reason, that is being required here. But perhaps
there is a bad reason, and perhaps this goes back to previous deals and
understandings.</p><p><a name="06051774000362">After
the comprehensive agreement in 2004, the hon. Member for Belfast, East

are more than 100 side deals and secret understandings with the DUP

be clear indications that that is the case. Martin McGuinness is on
public record as saying that the whole issue of how the devolution of
justice and policing was to be dealt with was all done and dusted in
the negotiations in the run-up to the comprehensive agreement. Are we
now seeing the result of all that doing and dusting here in the
legislation? Is that why the Minister cannot accept even a

institutions and matters such as the devolution of justice and

documents on the ground that their disclosure might colour or
jeopardise the Government&#146;s relationship with the Irish
Republic. Yet they deal solely with strand 1 matters, which the DUP
says that it is very good at safeguarding, saying that there is no
Irish Government interest or input in them. We cannot have sight of any

as legislators have the right to know where all this is coming from, as
well as wanting to see where it is all going to. The SDLP wants a
process of equals, because that is the only way to build trust. It is
the only way to make progress. That is why we ask the Government to
live up to the commitment that they made to inclusive negotiations in
Parliament this month, and to let all see
all.</p><p><a name="06051774000371">The Minister will
be glad to hear that, by contrast, the SDLP is happy to support
Government amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 7. These allow for the possibility
of a single Minister to be elected by cross-community support and by
parallel consent. That said, that might not be our preferred option for
the appointment of a justice Minister. However, if the point of the
Bill is to provide for a menu of options from which the parties may
choose, that option should be included.</p><p><a name="06051774000372">The reason for all this
difficulty, and the reason why nearly all of us have been caught trying
to put the cart before the horse, is that the Government have launched
us into legislating for these options at a time when the parties have
not been truly negotiating and debating them. That is why the Minister
is having difficulty in presenting the Bill, and why the rest of us are
having difficulty in presenting our amendments.</p><p><a name="06051774000373">We say again, however&#151;as
we have in our support for the Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 14 and
15&#151;that the vote should involve either version of
cross-community support, and not parallel consent alone. We also have
difficulties with Government amendment No. 4, which limits to one the
number of Departments that have joint, rotating or single
cross-community elected Ministers. We do not want more joint Ministers
in more Departments, but the Government have gone too far in removing
the possibility that, if the Assembly decides on two separate
Departments for justice and policing, there could be a single Minister
in each Department, elected by cross-community support. Again, I must
stress that we are not advocating two separate Departments, but that
might be a choice that the Assembly wishes to make. If two Departments
were created under d'Hondt, we do not see why the same should not be

he wants the legislation to go forward. We have some difficulties with
it, but we are not going to create more difficulty for him or for
anyone else. We ask that he considers carefully the points that we have
made. I have answered his unfair misrepresentation of our amendments as
having the effect of removing completely powers from the First and
Deputy First Minister in respect of justice Ministers. We are trying to
get a balance of responsibility and rights between parties, and between
the First and Deputy First Minister. I therefore commend our
amendments, and the spirit of them, to the Minister for further
consideration.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051796000077">2.30

referred to is mandatory, not voluntary. In the previous Executive,
every party was in opposition to every other party. In the Assembly,
Ministers voted against legislation brought forward by other Ministers.
We had a bizarre set of circumstances.

envisage that happening in my lifetime. I am always happy to be
surprised about such matters, but the key issue is that the community
must be satisfied. I do not believe that the community would be
satisfied if people who are associated with those who are involved in
terrorism, and who have a history of such involvement, were responsible
for policing and justice.</p><p><a name="06051796000011">The bizarre nature of the
debate has become even more difficult because of the decision by the
party of the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) to enter into a
formal relationship with a party that speaks for an illegal

will put such powers in the hands of the Assembly, where there is now a

that we could not be in government with those who are linked to parties
involved in paramilitary and criminal activity. Out of the blue, the

colleagues in the Assembly. That decision caused me deep distress.
However, having said that, I believe, having had a long conversation
last night with my party leader, Sir Reg Empey, that this might allow
him an opportunity to exercise leverage on loyalist paramilitaries. It
was perfectly obvious that the Northern Ireland Office has no strategy
to bring about loyalist decommissioning. If Sir Reg is able to
establish now a policy to bring about loyalist decommissioning and
prevent any more murders, such as that of Lisa Dorrian in my

that he has given publicly for his decision. It was a self-serving
reason&#151;or at least he thought that it was&#151;as he thought
that his party would get an additional ministerial post. However, he
will find that that might not work out as he expected.</p><p><a name="06051796000018">To return to new clause 3,
policing and justice issues are of such importance that if they are to
be devolved to a Northern Ireland Assembly, it is imperative that there
is not just general support in the Assembly but, as under the previous
legislation, cross-community
support.</p><p><a name="06051796000019">According to
the definition of cross-community support in the earlier legislation,
40 per cent. of votes from one section of the community would have been
sufficient. Policing and justice powers could have been devolved even
if the majority of the Unionist community, for instance, did not
support it. The Government new clause and amendments remedy that in two
ways.</p><p><a name="06051796000020">The first
relates to the parallel methods of securing cross-community support in
the Assembly. That support can be secured through an overall majority
of Assembly Members, no fewer than 50 per cent. being from the Unionist
community and no fewer than 50 per cent. being from the nationalist
community. Alternatively, it can be secured through an overall
majority, at least 40 per cent. being from either the Unionist or the
nationalist community. In new clause 3, the Government specify the
former method. There must be an overall majority, and a majority of
both nationalists and Unionists. That should ensure real
cross-community support: substantial support for the devolution of
policing and justice powers in both communities, rather than a majority
in one community and a minority in the other. The Government have made
a sensible decision, establishing at least one lock for the Northern
Ireland community.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1034</b><br><p><a name="06051796000021">The second lock relates to the
First and Deputy First Ministers. In practical terms, it would be
absurd to provide for circumstances in which the Assembly might decide
to devolve policing and justice powers without their consent. The
Government have provided for practical circumstances, and for the
further lock that my colleagues and I requested. In the comprehensive
agreement proposals published by the Government, it was accepted not
just by Her Majesty&#146;s Government but by the Government of the
Irish Republic, and I assume that Sinn Fein approved of it as
well&#151;although I cannot say for certain, because we were not
speaking to Sinn
Fein.</p><p><a name="06051796000022">When I mentioned
the desirability of this further lock to the Minister on Second Reading
and also, I believe, in Committee, he responded that no mischief had
been intended by its omission. We attributed its absence to a drafting
blip. I am glad that that has now been remedied, and that both those
locks are in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051796000023">It is true that
there are two further locks, but they are not locks on which the
Northern Ireland community would rely on very strongly. The fact that
the Secretary of State must give his approval will not engender a great
deal of trust and enthusiasm in the Unionist community nor will the
need for the approval of the House, which has passed much legislation
that has not been supported by the overwhelming majority of people in
Northern Ireland. Those two locks may be important to the Government
and the House, but they are not as important to the people of Northern
Ireland as the first two locks. The first two locks are to the
advantage of Unionist and nationalist alike. No Assembly Member need
fear that anything will be foisted on the Assembly before the
community is ready, and before the Assembly is ready to take its
responsibilities. It would be wrong to put such important powers in the
hands of an Assembly that was not ready to accept them. I trust that no
nationalist or Unionist will dispute what the Government have done, but
essentially we are talking about two double locks rather than a
quadruple lock.</p><p><a name="06051796000024">My
second point is that because policing is such an important issue, it
may be said to have an important context even before the devolution of
policing and justice powers. My right hon. Friend the Member for North
Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) is quoted as having said at the weekend that
it was imperative for those who are part of an Executive in Northern
Ireland to give their support to policing in Northern Ireland. The
point has also been laboured&#151;if he will forgive me for saying
so&#151;by the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for
Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington). Whenever he has explained what is necessary,
he has specified that essential
requirement.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051796000078">2.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06051796000025">It is hard for
anyone who reads about democracy in the text books to believe that
someone could be part of an Executive, part of the Government of a
country, without supporting the law enforcement agency of that country.
It is still harder to believe that a member of an Executive would not
support, and in many cases would not even recognise, the courts. That
is not a proposition that anyone could seriously contemplate. Anyone
who wants to be part of Government in Northern Ireland 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1035</b><br>must be determined to urge people to give evidence to the police if they
witness events, to contact the police if they are in need, and to
encourage the police to operate freely in their areas. That is
essential.</p><p><a name="06051796000026">My right
hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim rightly said that merely
joining a police force would not be seen as giving support to the
police, and that simply signing up to the devolution powers would
certainly not be seen as such. Tangible support will consist of
Assembly Members&#146; urging those over whom they have influence to
support the police, join the police, give evidence to the police and
ask the police to go into their areas.</p><p><a name="06051796000027"><b><a name="06051796000094">Sammy
Wilson:</b> That condition has pertained since 1998, but has
not yet been met by members of Sinn Fein. It is entirely wrong for the
Secretary of State to describe it as a new
condition.</p><p><a name="06051796000028"><b><a name="06051796000095">Mr.
Robinson:</b> I have not heard the Secretary of State say
that, and if he believes it to be a new condition, I am surprised that
he has not been better briefed. My colleagues and I have often
mentioned the issue in the House, so there is nothing new about
it.</p><p><a name="06051796000029">We are now
reaching a stage at which we want to make very clear the particulars of
what giving support to the police, and to our judicial system, means in
Northern Ireland. I trust that those with aspirations to be in
Government recognise that it would be inconsistent with that position
to be part of an organisation that does not recognise the courts, and
will not recognise or support the police. Even worse, a policy document
from Sinn Fein that we received fairly recently did not merely suggest
that Sinn Fein did not support the police, but argued that its members
should go out and protest against them actively. There is a long road
to travel.</p><p><a name="06051796000030">I think
that that demonstrates how difficult it will be for people to come to
terms with the devolution of policing and justice powers, and why it
will be necessary for Sinn Fein in particular to convince the community
in Northern Ireland that it supports law and order and wants the police
to be able to operate freely in all parts of Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051796000031"><b><a name="06051796000096">Dr.
McCrea:</b> As my hon. Friend will know, reports from the
Independent Monitoring Commission and from those on the ground
acknowledge the existence of a continuing serious threat from the
Continuity IRA and the Real IRA. Does he accept that anyone holding
ministerial office in any Executive will have to support the police
force in the execution of its duty, and support the forces of law and
order in the defeat of terrorism? Terrorism has been the scourge of
Northern Ireland for so many years that we cannot be ambivalent about
the future.</p><p><a name="06051796000032"><b><a name="06051796000097">Mr.
Robinson:</b> I do indeed accept that.
Difficult decisions would have to be made if Sinn Fein did support the
police. It would have to be asked whether the community were confident
that policing and justice powers had been devolved, and whether Sinn
Fein should have any role in that. I cannot envisage such
circumstances, but my hon. Friend tempts me to consider what situation
Sinn Fein might face. It might well face the situation faced by a
Minister in the Republic&#151;in 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1036</b><br>the Home Office, or whatever it was called in those days&#151;who,
having been in the Provisional IRA, had to line up some of his former
colleagues who had continued in the war after he had taken up his
democratic position, and have them shot. There would be hard decisions
for any member of Sinn Fein to take in those circumstances, but I must
point out to my hon. Friend that I cannot envisage them arising
immediately.</p><p><a name="06051796000033"><b><a name="06051796000098">Rev.
Ian Paisley (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> Is it not a fact that
Mr. De Valera had to do the same with his own people? Did not the first
Prime Minister of the Irish Republic make a statement in which he said
that there cannot be two police forces or two armies? He said that one
police force&#151;the police force of the state&#151;was to be
recognised, and that all others were to be rejected, and that if they
were not rejected by the people, they, as the Government, would reject
them and remove
them.</p><p><a name="06051796000034"><b><a name="06051796000099">Mr.
Robinson:</b> My right hon. Friend is correct, and that is the
position that the Government of the Irish Republic adopt to this day.
Indeed, it is one reason that the Justice Minister of the Irish
Republic, Michael McDowell, gave for not countenancing Sinn
Fein&#146;s participation in government. He said that, while they
retain a link with the Provisional IRA, one could not have two armies
in the Irish Republic. However, there is a certain hypocrisy on the
part of the Irish Republic, in that they are expecting us to do
something that they are not prepared to do.</p><p><a name="06051796000035">The intervention of my right
hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) reminds me
of <i> The</i><i> Irish Times</i> article by Dermot Aherne, which was
immensely insulting to the community in Northern Ireland. In essence,
he said that these principles can be applied to us, but that they
certainly cannot be applied in the Irish Republic. The attitude was,
&#147;Anything is good enough for those people up there.&#148; The
general attitude adopted by the Irish Republic&#146;s foreign affairs
Minister seemed to be, &#147;We cannot have Sinn Fein in government,
but those people up there should have them because they do not have a
normal society.&#148; They could not allow Sinn Fein to have any
responsibility for policing but, of course, we can. However, if we are
coming out of conflict, the need for stable institutions is all the
greater. It is all the more important for people to have confidence in
our security forces, the police and the justice system.</p><p><a name="06051796000036">So policing is a critical
issue, which is why the Minister, in providing these enabling powers,
should not get carried away with the prospect of their being taken up
immediately. His offer might lie on the table for some time. That said,
I do welcome the further option that he provides in amendment No. 3,
which allows the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to create a
policing and justice department&#151;set up by their
nominee&#151;if the proposal is supported by a cross-community vote
in the Assembly. That is another option; however, no one knows whether
that or any of the other options will be taken up. The hon. Member for
Foyle (Mark Durkan) could well be right: a new idea might arise in the
weeks, months and years before this event comes about, and the
Government may well have to come back with more legislation.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1037</b><br><p><a name="06051796000037">I would be more content if the
Government focused on what is possible, rather than on what is
practically impossible at the moment. I welcome the prospect of the
Northern Ireland Assembly being brought out of suspension, if events go
as well as the Government and my colleagues and I hope. Although the
Assembly created under the 2006 legislation is not running, it is
certainly up. I trust that the position of the Social, Democratic and
Labour party&#151;which is willing to participate, to discuss these
issues and to put them before the Government&#151;will be taken on
board, because it is largely the same as that adopted by me and my
colleagues. We do not want to be part of a talking shop. That said, we
do want to talk about these issues and to reach agreement on them, but
we will point out to the Government that if an agreement is reached,
they must ensure that the wishes of the elected representatives in
Northern Ireland are implemented in respect not just of the issues
before us, but of wider
issues.</p><p><a name="06051796000038"><b><a name="06051796000100">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I want to make one or two brief points. We have
discussed a wide range of issues in some detail. The hon. Member for
Foyle (Mark Durkan) painted various scenarios in convoluted detail,
some of which were extremely hypothetical, and which may or may not
come about. He painted an unhappy picture of extreme deviousness and
lack of trust&#151;not that that is uncommon, perhaps, in politics.
If such safeguards as he described have to be implemented, that
suggests that the devolution of policing and justice will never come
about. He referred, in the context of appointing a Speaker, to Caesar
doing in Brutus, although today we perhaps have Cleopatra in the Chair
of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It appears that, in the process of
deciding who should occupy the Chair, there would be a complete
blood-bath.</p><p><a name="06051796000039">That does not
bear thinking about, but we should all be reassured by the fact that
the scenario that we are contemplating today is extremely unlikely. My
hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) said that it is
not likely to happen in his lifetime, and I agree that it is extremely
unlikely that the circumstances will be such that the people of
Northern Ireland will be sufficiently confident to contemplate allowing
a party such as Sinn Fein&#151;or, indeed, the Progressive Unionist
party&#151;anywhere near justice and policing in Northern Ireland. We
must bear that point in mind during this
debate.</p><p><a name="06051796000040"><b><a name="06051796000101">Mark
Durkan:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that it will be a long
time before the community in Northern Ireland contemplates Sinn
Fein&#146;s being involved in policing and justice. Does he think
that that is true even if a Sinn Fein representative were serving as
Deputy First
Minister?</p><p><a name="06051796000041"><b><a name="06051796000102">Mr.
Dodds:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a point that perhaps gets
to the core of this issue. As has been pointed out, we have emphasised
in recent days that support for law and order and the police must be
demonstrated not just by joining the Policing Board. We must remember
that Sinn Fein joined the Northern Ireland Executive while they were
quite prepared to 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1038</b><br>undermine democracy and government. Signing up to the Executive did not
make them democrats, and signing up to the Policing Board does not make
them supporters of the police. Before they can be considered fit for
office&#151;be it in policing and justice, or any in other
position&#151;they must support all aspects of policing and urge
people to give information to the police. They must also do so in a
credible way, instead of simply issuing a statement that enables them
to clear a particular hurdle. I hope that that is
clear.</p><p><a name="06051796000042">I
am somewhat concerned by the attitude that Ministers from the Prime
Minister downward are adopting on this issue. They seem to be saying
that this is a new precondition, but it is not. If someone is committed
to exclusively peaceful and democratic means and says that there has to
be a complete end to criminality, ipso facto, they have to support
police. If they are against criminality but do not support the police,
in effect, they are saying, &#147;We&#146;ll organise the stamping
out of criminality, through the structures and organisations that we
have in place.&#148; That is unacceptable in a democratic society,
and it is certainly an unacceptable view for any party that aspires to
be in
government.</p><p><a name="06051796000043"><b><a name="06051796000103">Mark
Durkan:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I
hope that he can help us further. He pointed out that the hon. Member
for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) said earlier that we might not see
devolution of justice and policing in his lifetime, particularly if
there is a Sinn Fein Minister. However, the hon. Gentleman did not say
the same about the prospect of a Sinn Fein member becoming Deputy First
Minister. He also said that he could not see a First Minister and
Deputy First Minister appointing anybody other than people from their
own parties. So will the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds)
please clarify the relationship between the First Minister and Deputy
First Minister and the devolution of policing and justice in that
regard?</p><p><a name="06051796000044"><b><a name="06051796000104">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question, but my
hon. Friend made it clear that when he was talking about who would be
First Minister and Deputy First Minister, he was doing so in the
context of the legislation before us and the various scenarios that
might arise. He also made it clear, as has our party, that the
prospects of reaching that situation, in which we would consider
proposals for the Northern Ireland Assembly on the issue of devolution
of policing and justice, are remote. In fact, they are so remote that
it is difficult to envisage when it might
happen.</p><p><a name="06051796000045">As for the
holding of ministerial office, the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland and the Prime Minister has said that parties that want to take
part in the government of Northern Ireland should support the policing,
but that those are matters for the medium term and which must be worked
on or must happen&#151;as if we can somehow expect that to happen in
due course, in parallel with the Executive being up and running. That
will not wash.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051796000079">3

acceptable for it to be in government in Northern Ireland because we
have been in a conflict situation. Our people, our constituents, our
kith and kin have been murdered and butchered by the people who Dermot
Aherne says are acceptable as Government Ministers, and they still do
not support the police. What sort of message does that send to the
people of Northern
Ireland?</p><p><a name="06051796000047">Dermot
Aherne said in effect that it was acceptable for Sinn Fein not to
support the police because all the recommendations of the Patten report
have not been implemented. He was pressed on which recommendations he
meant, and he said that Sinn Fein had not signed up. I am sure that the
SDLP was not very grateful for those comments. It was diplomatic in its
response, in public, but I am sure that it has let the Irish Government
know how it feels.</p><p><a name="06051796000048">In
those remarks, Dermot Aherne effectively told Sinn Fein,
&#147;It&#146;s okay, you don&#146;t have to sign up to policing
and justice, or give your support to the police. We accept your
position of being in government but not supporting the police.&#148;
That is a very dangerous situation, and the Government should be aware
that this is a matter of fundamental importance to all the people of
Northern Ireland. That is why the decision, in that context, of the
Ulster Unionist party to embrace the PUP as a formal part of its party
structure in the Assembly has such incredible implications for the
political process in Northern Ireland. I welcome what the hon. Member
for North Down (Lady Hermon) has put on record today, but the reason
that her party leader gave her in private conversation is not the
reason he gave publicly at the time, or in the Assembly. He said that
he had done it purely as a power grab, to grab an extra ministry. In
fact, if he had waited, he would not have needed to do that at all. He
has got all the pain, with no gain
whatever.</p><p><a name="06051796000049"><b><a name="06051796000105">Rev.

bypassing the conditions that were laid down by the Prime Minister in

Ervine was &#147;a surprise&#148;, but a matter for the parties. I
do not know what he means by that. What parties? Healso said
that Sinn Fein was in a &#147;much stronger position&#148; to be on

morning? Before that meeting, another UUP Assembly Member, Mr. Copeland
from East Belfast, made an offer to Mr. McCord of the use of an office
if he would keep quiet and not criticise the decision. The UUP is now
into bribing victims. Is my hon. Friend also aware that Mr. McCord was

Dodds:</b> Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. In considering the
clauses, which relate to the conditions under which policing and
justice powers may be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly at some
point in the future, it is important and relevant to consider the
parties involved and the conditions that they have to meet. In that
context, the Secretary of State&#146;s comments today, referred to by
my right hon. Friend, are significant. The point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) is also significant. I know
Raymond McCord, he is one of my constituents and I have spoken to him
on many occasions. I am aware of the hurt and the pain that he and his
family have gone through as the result of the death of his son at the
hands of the UVF, and many other people have been in touch with our
party to express their utter revulsion at the latest development with
the UUP. The suggestion that the UUP, through Mr. Copeland, would
attempt to bribe Mr. McCord into silence adds another dimension of
revulsion, and it poses serious questions about the judgment of that
party.</p><p><a name="06051796000056"><b><a name="06051796000110">Dr.

clauses touch on wider political issues. As I said in my intervention
on the hon. Member for Foyle, we could spend a long time on minutiae
and mechanics and lose the context of what we are discussing. The
latter part of the debate has focused on the real political issues at
stake. There has been much talk about locks, triple locks, and
quadruple locks. Some people will be on the side of the locksmiths and
will try to build in safeguards, while others will be on the side of
those who want to pick the lock and sneak into Government by the back
door.</p><p><a name="06051796000062">We are on the
side of the locksmiths and are building in safeguards. I am glad that
the new clause means that we will have, not the triple lock that my
party called for originally, but a quadruple lock. That quadruple lock
requires the approval of the Secretary of State and this House, and the
50-50 approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I welcome that, for
precisely the reason that the leader of the SDLP does not&#151;it
changes the Belfast agreement. Moreover, the First Minister and the
Deputy First Minister have to agree before any proposal can be brought
forward.</p><p><a name="06051796000063"><b><a name="06051796000115">Sir
Patrick Cormack:</b> I had not intended to
take part in the debate, but I have listened with considerable interest
to speeches that have been rather longer than were originally promised.
I completely understand that and you, Madam Deputy Speaker, have been
very generous in allowing a wide-ranging debate on the new clause. I
hope that it does not sound patronising if I say that I think that you
have been right to do so. Events have taken place in the Province this
week that cast a shadow, and hon. Members were bound to refer to them.
I thank you very much for allowing them to do
so.</p><p><a name="06051796000064">I
support the new clause because, in essence, it is impeccable. The
Government are saying that in no circumstances should matters of
policing and justice be devolved unless there is a credible and
virtually unanimous wish across the Province, encapsulated by the
agreement of the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the
nationalist and Unionist communities, that that should happen. All of
that is right, and I applaud the Minister for bringing the new clause
forward.</p><p><a name="06051796000065">I
listened with mounting perplexity to the long speech from the leader of
the SDLP, which certainly deserves to earn him a doctorate in
Machiavellian studies. He set out so many conditions and preconditions,
and anticipated so many difficulties, that the Minister was right to
resist his
blandishments.</p><p><a name="06051796000066">The
hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) referred earlier to last
week&#146;s appearance by Secretary of State before the Northern
Ireland Affairs Committee. It is always an interesting session when he
comes before the Committee, and last week was no exception. He always
treats the Committee with total courtesy, and is an extremely effective
witness, but he did rather equivocate last week.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1042</b><br><p><a name="06051796000067">One after another, hon. Members
asked whether the acceptance of the rule of law and support for the
police should not be preconditions of participation in government. The
transcript shows that the Secretary of State did not give an
unequivocal and binding answer, yet the new clause contains just such a
commitment&#151; [<i> Interruption.</i>] It would be nice to have the
attention of all those from the
Province.</p><p><a name="06051796000068">The
new clause says that matters of policing and justice cannot be devolved
without the agreement about which there has been much discussion and
which the DUP support very strongly. On the other hand, however, it
makes it clear that people will be allowed into government and
positions of executive responsibility who do not accept the rule of law
or support the policing of the
Province.</p><p><a name="06051796000069">That is a
remarkable and frankly indefensible paradox, and I beg the Minister to
talk to the Secretary of State about it. There will be an opportunity
to debate the matter in greater detail later this afternoon, although I
shall not necessarily take part. That is why I making some relevant
remarks
now.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051796000080">3.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051796000070">We cannot
cherry-pick in the way that is proposed if we are to have a proper and
credible Assembly in Northern Ireland, with an Executive who can
command widespread and lasting support. To establish proper normality
in the Province, we must remember what government means, and insist
absolutely that it is upheld by those who participate in it. People
cannot uphold government if they do not uphold the rule of law, and
they cannot do that unless they uphold those who are given
responsibility for keeping the peace.</p><p><a name="06051796000071">I hope that the
debate will lead to a bit of a rethink, and that the Secretary of State
will give us an absolute assurance that cherry-picking will end. I hope
that a welcome will be extended to people who change their views and
foreswear criminality. It is impossible to forget, but there must be a
willingness to draw a line in respect of the past. The absolute
requirement, however, is that the people with executive responsibility
in government sign up to the rule of law, absolutely and completely.
That must be accepted totally if matters to do with justice and
policing are ever to be
devolved.</p><p><a name="06051796000072">Until
such matters are devolved, we will not have a proper devolved
Government in the Province. That is why it is essential that we move
towards the acceptance that I have described. The Government are right
to insist on the preconditions in new clause 3, and I applaud them for
bringing that provision forward, but I also implore them to accept the
logic of the argument implicit in it. There can be no fudge over the
next six months that causes us to land up with an Assembly that has
built-in obsolescence from the day of its first meeting.</p><p><a name="06051796000073">I am one of those who are
concerned about the future of the Province of Northern Ireland. We want
it to be treated with the same degree of respect as Wales, Scotland and
England, and to enjoy the same degree of normality that obtains in
those countries. That is why we must insist that there can be no fudge
in this matter. That is crucially important.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1043</b><br><p><a name="06051796000074">I support what the Minister is

McCrea:</b> The heading for the new clause is
&#147;Conditions for devolving policing and justice matters&#148;.
My colleagues who have spoken in the debate have made it abundantly
clear that, for us, there can be no new conditions. The conditions for
the devolution of policing and justice matters are also the conditions
for a devolved Government, which are, as we have said so many times
before, that there must be not only a complete and absolute end to
terrorism with a renunciation of terrorism and all acts of terrorism,
but a complete and final turning away from criminal activities and a
renunciation of them. That includes those who still live on the rewards
of crime. We do not close our hearts and minds to a fact that many
people have forgotten: &#163;20 million is still in the hands of the
Provisionals. We cannot allow people to continue to live on the fruit
of their past criminal activity.</p><p><a name="06051798000004">We are making no new conditions
for the devolution of policing and justice matters; the conditions for
any democratic society are that everyone must uphold the rule of law
and support those who exercise it in the Province on behalf of Her
Majesty and Her Majesty&#146;s Government. There can be no fuel
laundering, no money laundering, no extortion, no intimidation and no
continuation of the wide range of criminal activity that the
Provisional IRA and Sinn Fein-IRA have so successfully carried out for
so many years. We demand an absolute end to such activity. I want to
make it clear that this is not a new condition laid down by the
Democratic Unionist party; it is a statement of our position right from
the beginning. We shall not change our principles for the Government or
anyone else; we shall not sacrifice the principles of a democratic
society.</p><p><a name="06051798000005"><b><a name="06051798000089">Sir
Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> I say with pride

For many years, I have taken an active and positive interest in
Northern Ireland. Does he accept that the views expressed by my hon.
Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), as
Chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee, were absolutely right?
There can be no devolved Government unless all parties in Northern
Ireland accept the rule of law and recognise the police and justice in
the Province. Without that, there can be no meaningful devolved
Government in Northern Ireland who will encourage the involvement of
all its
peoples.</p><p><a name="06051798000006"><b><a name="06051798000090">Dr.
McCrea:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his
remarks. For many years, both he and his good wife, the hon. Member for
Congleton (Ann Winterton), have indeed had the interests of Northern
Ireland at heart. I wholeheartedly agree that the hon. Member for South
Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) exactly set out the principles of
democracy, but I do not accept that terrorists should hold up devolved
Government in Northern Ireland. The Social Democratic and Labour party
should have 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1044</b><br>the imagination and vision to join the rest of us in a devolved,
cross-community Government who ostracise those who carry on criminal
and terrorist activity.</p><p><a name="06051798000007">We have
constantly suggested to the SDLP that there could be a voluntary
coalition among true democrats in Northern Ireland. That would give
great heart to the people of Northern Ireland and would be a positive
way forward. If the SDLP ties itself to the likes of Sinn Fein-IRA, it
will be tying itself to a broken stick. Sinn Fein-IRA have proved that
they are not democrats working in accordance with the principles of
democracy&#151;they are not, therefore, meeting the
conditions.</p><p><a name="06051798000008">The rest
of us&#151;the people of Northern Ireland&#151;should not be tied
by criminals and terrorists. True democrats should stand shoulder to
shoulder, side by side, and give the people hope and a visionary way
forward that will give us a good devolved Government who are not
undermined by the constant threat of whether their members will be
involved in terrorist atrocity or whether another stash of arms will be
found. We need stable government, and the conditions for devolving
policing and justice matters are the same as those that will establish
truly acceptable, democratic devolved government in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051798000009">We in the DUP
want to see that day; we want it for the good of the people of Northern
Ireland, but there is one price that we will not pay. We are not
willing to undermine the principles of democracy. If we do that, the
foundations will be rotten and, as I have said so many times, a house
built on sand will surely fall when the day of testing comes. My
Saviour set out that principle when he talked about the house built on
sand. The house that will withstand every test is the house built on
rock. Our foundation must be the rock of democracy and we will accept
nothing less. We must have those conditions, which is why I am happy to
support everything that my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends have said
in the debate. I trust that the Secretary of State will get the
message. We are not moving one iota from the principles we have set out
in the
past.</p><p><a name="06051798000010"><b><a name="06051798000091">Mr.

and 45 minutes, but I think that there is an element of consensus among
Members. The issues set out in the amendments have received a welcome
from DUP Members&#151;the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.
Ian Paisley) and the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds). The
Chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee, the hon. Member for South
Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) welcomed the principal Government
amendments and there has been no opposition to them from my hon. Friend
the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). There is a general consensus that
our amendments will help to secure support in due course for the
devolution of policing and criminal justice in Northern
Ireland.</p><a name="06051798000080"><p><b><a name="06051798000092">Mark

that locks have been mentioned, I feel that I am in the possession of
more locks than Chubb at the moment, but we make progress.</p><p><a name="06051798000012">The principle
behind all this remains the same as the principle that I elucidated in
my opening comments: can we get a position whereby the Assembly has the
opportunity to consider whether it wishes policing and criminal justice
to be devolved? I believe that the amendments provide an opportunity
for rational consideration, which gives the opportunity for
cross-community support and empowers to the First Minister and the
Deputy First Minister to propose that support to ensure that the
Assembly has its full consideration. Again, I am in danger of repeating
myself, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, or his successor, must then agree to that proposal and would
bring it to the House for its endorsement.</p><p><a name="06051798000013">I fully
accept that all the points mentioned by the hon. Members for South
Antrim (Dr. McCrea), for Belfast, East, for Belfast, North, for South
Staffordshire and, indeed, others have pointed to the fact that there
is still a range of difficulties that relate to the conditions being
right for the process to commence, but I do not know whether or not
that will happen in the lifetime of the hon. Member for Belfast, East.
I wish I knew how long he will live; I am sure that he will have a long
and happy life. However, the key conditions are there to allow that
mechanism to begin when that confidence is in
place.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000084">3.30

that there are many difficulties and I am in danger of straying into
discussing later amendments on the rule of law, which I am happy to
debate now, and there are real issues about the definitions. We have
tabled further amendments for later in consideration, but I repeat what
I have said in the House previously: the Government, my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State and I wish to see Sinn Fein sign up to
policing and to support policing operations in Northern Ireland. That
is a key element in building the confidence that hon. Members wish to
see, and I certainly urge those hon. Members from Sinn Fein who are not
in the House today to consider that proposal in considering these
matters in the House and elsewhere. It is important that they support
the police for reasons that are self-evident to every hon. Member who
sits in the House
today.</p><p><a name="06051798000015"><b><a name="06051798000094">Sir

has done, at the pledge of office that is in place for Ministers, he
will see that the very points that he makes are intrinsic in that.
[Hon. Members: &#147;They are not.&#148;]
Let me finish the point. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
has done, I have also said that, as part of the discussions on the way
forward for 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1046</b><br>the Assembly, the question of discussion on the pledge of office is open

it?</p><p><a name="06051798000018"><b><a name="06051798000097">Mr.

hon. Members have raised today. We will have an opportunity later to
discuss those concerns in more detail, and I am in danger of drifting
into issues that are important in relation to these clauses but are
subject to further amendment later in the
day.</p><p><a name="06051798000019"><b><a name="06051798000098">Rev.

take.</p><p><a name="06051798000020"><b><a name="06051798000099">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Perhaps I can help the right
hon. Gentleman. The pledge of office that all Ministers must affirm in
the Assembly before taking up posts already requires a commitment to
non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Amendments
made in 2003 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 facilitate the
consideration of the Independent Monitoring Commission&#146;s
recommendations and provides safeguards where Ministers and parties
fail to observe the pledge of office. As I have said, the pledge of
office, as currently constituted, provides for adherence to exclusively
peaceful and democratic means. As we have already made clear, if the
parties want to change the pledge of office and they can agree on a
form of words in the context of an agreement on a package of other
strand 1 issues, I am certainly willing to take those matters
forward.</p><p><a name="06051798000021"><b><a name="06051798000100">Sir

policing and the rule of law is something that I wish to uphold. I wish
to see that happen, and I have no problem with that. However, as I have
said during the course of the debate, it is possible for a Minister to
have disagreements with the police and there is a whole range of
circumstances in which a Minister could exercise judgment in those
disagreements. I agree with the substance of what hon. Members are
saying, but it is difficult to put things in the form that the later

totally different.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1047</b><br><p><a name="06051798000023"><b><a name="06051798000103">Mr.

Policing Board, as does the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member

support. However, there are specific reasons why the Government cannot
accept the phraseology of later
amendments.</p><p><a name="06051798000024">I want to
refocus the debate on the fact that there is an element of consensus

Member for Foyle for the proposals that I have made in response to the
concerns that he put to me in Committee. However&#151;I mean this in
the nicest possible way&#151;there is a danger that the amendments
that he has tabled will mean that we will not just micro-manage some of
the circumstances, but micro-micro-manage them. I understand and have
some sympathy with what he has said, in that everything that he has
mentioned in support of his amendments is accurate and relates to
things that could occur. However, I am trying to envisage circumstances
in which they would. What I am saying is genuinely intended to help
him. He talked about d&#146;Hondt. It is true that a Justice Minister
counts as a d&#146;Hondt post, but if a Minister resigns or is
dismissed and a new Minister is appointed, d&#146;Hondt would be run
again. The Bill already provides for that. So, the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister cannot gain extra seats by dismissing Ministers
from other parties in the way that he has suggested.</p><p><a name="06051798000025">Again, I understand the
possibilities but, as even the hon. Members for Belfast, East and for
Belfast, North recognised, we are discussing things that may or may not
ever occur. I accept that they could occur and that everything that my
hon. Friend the Member for Foyle said is possible. I will certainly
reflect on those things. If other parties feel that we need to
micro-micro-manage those issues, I am happy to reflect on those points
in another place. I am trying to put in place a broad framework that
will mean that devolution can take place and we have the mechanisms in
place to put in the locks to which we have all referred. Although we
can certainly adopt the principles of what has been said, I do not
necessarily wish to micro-manage at that level of detail the
possibilities that exist, but if other parties wish to do so I am happy
to reflect on those points.</p><p><a name="06051798000026"><b><a name="06051798000104">Mark
Durkan:</b> I just want to correct the
Minister. If a vacancy arises by dismissal, resignation or some other
means in the Justice Ministry, as created under the Bill, it is not the
case that there is an automatic re-run of
d&#146;Hondt&#151;because, after all, the appointments are not
d&#146;Hondt appointments&#151;any more than if a Minister resigns
under d&#146;Hondt or a party resigns on bloc under d&#146;Hondt
that forces a total rerun of d&#146;Hondt. It does
not.</p><p><a name="06051798000027"><b><a name="06051798000105">Mr.

contribution, but my understanding, and that of my officials who are
concerned with this matter, is as I have just outlined to the House.
His understanding appears to be different. There are issues on which we
fundamentally disagree, but this is an issue on which I am just looking
at the practicalities of the level of micro-management. I think that
what I have said is the 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1048</b><br>correct position; he may have a different interpretation. However, in
both cases we are talking about situations that may occur in which, in
effect, the First and Deputy First Ministers potentially would have to
rat on their own parties as well. I am just looking at the mechanics of
all this and trying to envisage circumstances in which such a thing
could happen. My hon. Friend&#146;s points undoubtedly have an
element of validity, but I cannot envisage such circumstances. I would
be grateful if he would not press his amendments to a Division. I will
be happy to reflect on them with officials, and if other parties have
views they can put them
forward.</p><p><a name="06051798000028">I do not wish
to comment in detail on a matter that several hon. Members have
mentioned in passing, but I will put a couple of points on the record.
There has been discussion about the relationship between the PUP and
UUP and the announcements that were made. As I said before you took the
Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the matter is subject to legal discussion
regarding the Assembly Speaker&#146;s recognition of the UUP-PUP
grouping as a party for Assembly purposes. She is likely to make a
ruling later this week. I have heard what has been said about the
political elements of the situation, but it would be inappropriate for
me to comment in detail on the legality of the situation because that
will be subject to the Speaker&#146;s ruling in the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06051798000029">Given what
has been said about the politics of any relationship, it is important
that the Secretary of State has undertaken today to recognise the fact
that the republican movement has taken steps. Admittedly, for some
parties it has not gone far enough to move away from the violence that
has occurred. Although there is more work to be done, the Independent
Monitoring Commission reports indicate that the republican movement has
taken serious steps to move away from
criminality.</p><p><a name="06051798000030">What
the Secretary of State has said today emphasises the importance of
loyalist paramilitaries undertaking to go down the same route. It is
not acceptable for me or the Secretary of State that a situation exists
in which there is officially no ceasefire from loyalist paramilitaries.
I ask both loyalist paramilitaries and dissident republicans&#151;the
Continuity IRA and Real IRA, which were mentioned by the hon. Member
for South Antrim&#151;to abandon immediately their activities that
lead to potential terrorism, threats and murder. That was the point
that the Secretary of State was making. The relationships between
political parties in the Assembly are a matter for those parties and
the legal judgment of the Assembly
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06051798000031"><b><a name="06051798000106">Sir
Patrick Cormack:</b> I would like to put it on the record that
when the Secretary of State came beforethe Northern Ireland

him about loyalist paramilitaries and their nefarious deeds than the
hon. Member for North Down (Lady
Hermon).</p><p><a name="06051798000032"><b><a name="06051798000107">Mr.

the point into context in relation to the amendments, my right hon.

Sinn Fein&#151;want police and criminal justice devolved to the
Assembly in due course. For that to happen, for the reasons that we all
know, my right hon. Friend and I want Sinn Fein to be involved in
supporting policing, because policing, criminal justice and the rule of

society in Northern Ireland, as they are elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06051798000040">We should continue to encourage
Sinn Fein to work towards playing its full part on the Policing Board

hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, that we will do that over time.
Ultimately, I want devolution to take place, but I recognise, on all
these matters, that it will only take place with the confidence of both
sides of the community. I have put in place mechanisms in the
amendments so that if Sinn Fein and others in the nationalist community
sign up to policing and the conditions arise to devolve criminal
justice and policing in due course, that will be done if the Assembly,

Ulster Unionist party is now in a weaker position than Sinn Fein. He
knows very well that the IMC report was unequivocal in its condemnation
of the Ulster Volunteer Force. Three paragraphs of the report spell out
that it is a terrorist body and is engaged in terrorism. How, then, can
he say that there is a difference between the activity of Sinn Fein and
the activity of the UVF, and that because the official Unionist party
has gone into a coalition with the UVF spokesman, it is in a weaker
position? We cannot balance aspects of terrorism. Terrorism is
terrorism. It is not possible to say that one part is a bit weaker than

consistency. I would simply say that my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State believes that the republican movement, in the broadest sense,
is moving towards a more peaceful route, has been verified by the IMC
to that effect and is undertaking moves that, I hope, will lead to the
restoration of the Assembly. I have not seen his remarks, but my
understanding of what he said today is that there needs to be the same
movement from Continuity IRA and Real IRA, the dissident republicans,
and there needs to be the same movement from those loyalist groups that
are currently not on ceasefire and are undertaking activity that has
led to the deaths of a number of individuals over the12

that paramilitary activity. I want to see an end to it, as I know do

given extra models, which my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle has

the new clause is to ensure that buildings to which artic1e 12 of the
Rates (Capital Values, etc.) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 applies come
under subsection 4, as opposed to subsection 5, of the Criminal Damage
(Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977. Community halls, Orange
halls, halls used by the Ancient Order of Hibernians and other types of
hall recently gained exemption from rates in Northern Ireland. That
move was widely welcomed throughout the community as beneficial for
local communities. It relieved a major financial burden for those who
run such halls on both sides of the community: on the Unionist side and
on the nationalist side. Under the new clause, those halls would also
be subject to subsection 4 of the criminal damage compensation
provisions, rather than subsection 5. That would bring them into line
with agricultural premises.</p><p><a name="06051798000049">Other properties have to prove,
for the purposes of getting compensation from the Northern Ireland
Office, that three or more people were involved in an attack or
commission of an offence that resulted in damage to premises, or the
Chief Constable has to issue a certificate indicating that it was
carried out by a proscribed organisation. Agricultural premises, on the
other hand, are not subject to such stringent provisions. In that case,
if the act is deemed to have been carried out maliciously or wantonly,
that alone is the condition that applies and compensation is payable.
</p><p><a name="06051798000050">Through their recent
derating provisions, the Government have recognised the valuable role
played by the halls that we are talking about&#151;community halls,
Orange halls, halls used by those in the nationalist community. They
provide an invaluable community resource. That applies to urban areas,
but it is particularly applicable to rural areas. Lest we run away with
the idea that the proposal would only benefit 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1052</b><br>people who run those halls, many of them, like parish halls throughout
the United Kingdom, are used for a wide range of purposes. In Northern
Ireland, they are used by credit unions, community groups and youth
services for a vast array of community activities, and their use has
expanded a great deal in recent years. The removal of a large financial
burden following the introduction of derating was welcomed in Northern
Ireland, and I congratulate the Government on taking on board the
proposal, which we pressed strongly in our discussions and negotiations
with them.</p><p><a name="06051798000051">Insurance
is even more financially crippling for those halls than the rates
levied on them. Orange halls often make their own provision, which is
very costly, because many insurance companies refuse to offer cover for
community halls, particularly Orange halls. The cover that is available
is extremely expensive, because of the number and extent of sectarian
attacks suffered by the halls and the problems that they face in
obtaining compensation for such attacks. Sometimes, people seeking
insurance for an Orange hall approached more than 30 different
companies before finding one that provides cover, and even then at an
exorbitant price. They sometimes have to pay four-figure sums for
insurance that would cost &#163;100 or &#163;150 in Scotland and
England, which is a massive difference. There have been dozens of
sectarian attacks in recent years, particularly on Orange halls, which
have suffered extensive damage and, in many cases, been razed to the
ground. Those attacks are usually carried out in the dead of night,
with few witnesses, and they deprive a local community of an invaluable
resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000052"><b><a name="06051798000117">Lady
Hermon:</b> I support very strongly the new clause tabled by
the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. He will have noticed that the
Minister expressed support for the Government document, &#147;A
Shared Future&#148;. Would it not be helpful if the Government did
not just talk the talk but walked the walk and supported the proposal,
which usefully acknowledges the traditions and cultures not just of the
Orange Order but of the Ancient Order of
Hibernian?</p><p><a name="06051798000053"><b><a name="06051798000118">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I very much welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s support.
She is quite right. The case for the halls has been made, and the
argument has been won, as evidenced by the fact that the Government
decided exceptionally to introduce derating for the halls only a few
months ago. The principle and precedent have been established: the new
clause would simply remove a major financial burden that has an even
greater impact than rates, so I hope that the Minister has it in his
gift to respond positively to the proposal.</p><p><a name="06051798000054"><b><a name="06051798000119">Mr.
Peter Robinson:</b> My hon. Friend is making a powerful
case&#151;one so compelling that no reasonable Minister could resist
it. The fact that compensation is not paid after halls are destroyed
makes them all the more a target. In the sectarian attacks that have
taken place, there is the knowledge that the responsibility and the
cost will be borne directly by the Orangemen or the Ancient Order of
Hibernians concerned. That makes it much more attractive because the
perpetrators know the pain that will result from the
attack.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1053</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000086">4
pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000055"><b><a name="06051798000120">Mr.
Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend has highlighted a significant
aspect. Those who carry out the attacks see that they are hurting the
Orange community directly. Those who attack other halls on the
nationalist side are doing the same on that side. They are impacting
directly on the community. That, as my hon. Friend points out, provides
an incentive for further attacks. There is no greater incentive for the
arsonists, vandals and hooligans who carry out the attacks than to see
halls that they have attacked previously lying derelict and, in some
cases, razed to the ground for months and in many cases years on end,
as people struggle to get compensation from their insurers, if they
have insurers, or from the Northern Ireland Office, which refuses to
provide insurance. They have to resort to raising the funds themselves,
which in many cases is virtually
impossible.</p><p><a name="06051798000056">The way
that the system operates is an incentive for arsonists to go on
attacking isolated halls. I should draw the attention of the House to
the areas affected. I have a list of the arson attacks on Orange halls.
I do not have a complete list of all the halls that have been attacked
throughout Northern Ireland, but last year there were attacks on three
Orange halls in County Tyrone, two in County Down, another one in
County Tyrone, one in County Antrim, one in Armagh, two in Belfast and
another one in Armagh. The attacks are widespread throughout the
Province and are having a major impact on local
communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000057"><b><a name="06051798000121">Dr.
McCrea:</b> The list that my hon. Friend read out reflects the
fact that the halls often represent a small, and in the local area a
minority, community. Local people therefore are not able to pay for the
rebuilding of the hall. My hon. Friend mentioned halls that were
attacked in Tyrone. Those were isolated Protestant communities in a
large nationalist or republican area. The attack on the hall was an
attack on the culture of a small minority
community.</p><p><a name="06051798000058"><b><a name="06051798000122">Mr.
Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Halls that have been
targeted&#151;for example, in Castlederg, Strabane, Altnaveigh in
Newry, and Whiterock in Belfast, near my constituency&#151;are all
situated in areas where the Protestant Unionist community is very much
in the minority. That is a feature of the preponderance of attacks that
have taken place, though it is not exclusively the case. They are seen
as attacks on vulnerable communities, depriving them of what is for
many of them their only local community
resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000059">I
know that the Minister takes such matters very seriously. In recent
months he has spent a long time looking into issues in deprived
Unionist areas in particular, and deprived areas generally. He has
spoken to many people in local communities in Belfast and in rural
areas. I know that he has heard directly from many organisations,
community groups and individuals who make extensive use of Orange halls
and other halls, and who have told him how important it is that those
facilities continue to be made available for local communities in their
areas.</p><p><a name="06051798000060">The
new clause is in line with the Government&#146;s recent derating of
Orange halls, and it is all of a piece with the proposals announced by
the Minister recently, when he 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1054</b><br>said that he was in the business of trying to bring about regeneration
and give confidence to deprived Unionist and loyalist areas. If the
Government were to adopt the amendment, it would be seen as a positive
step in not only Unionist communities, but nationalist
communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000061">The
amendment would not cost the Government a considerable amount of money.
They may say that we must not open the floodgates to large amounts of
Government expenditure, but the fact that they have been prepared to
move on the issue of the rates indicates that they recognise the
issue.</p><p><a name="06051798000062">The Minister
followed through on his consultation process in those communities with
a &#163;33 million package, and something similar could be done to
help communities in not only Belfast, but throughout Northern Ireland.
The DUP welcomed that package, but we recognise that a lot of it was
centred on deprived areas, particularly in Greater Belfast. We accept
that the bulk of the most deprived areas are in Belfast, but we have
also made the point that the process should not stop there and that
more needs to be done for rural areas and the west of the Province.
This is a tremendous opportunity for the Government to take that
process forward and implement in a practical yet modest way a measure
that would give a tremendous fillip to communities throughout Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051798000063">I urge the
Minister to accept the amendment. It is clear that the current
regulations, which require proof that a hall has been attacked
unlawfully, maliciously and wantonly by three or more persons
unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled, or as a result of an
act committed maliciously by a person actingon behalf of or
in connection with an unlawful association, are often unworkable,
because in a huge number of cases it is impossible to prove that those
conditions were met. Such attacks often take place in the dead of night
in isolated areas. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the
motivation behind attacks on community halls is sectarian, yet
obtaining compensation for such an attack can, even when it is done
successfully, be tortuous and involve extremely costly insurance
premiums.</p><p><a name="06051798000064">Such
premises should be categorised in the same way as agricultural
premises, which have been categorised in Northern Ireland for the
precise reasons that I have enunciated. Agricultural premises were
targeted in the dead of night and, although everybody knew why it was
happening, the matter could not be proved. Historically, the Government
have recognised that certain types of buildings and premises deserve
special categorisation, because they are in isolated areas and are
difficult to protect and defend, and Unionist and nationalist halls
across the community deserve to be placed in that category. I trust
that the Minister will respond positively to the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06051798000065"><b><a name="06051798000123">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I want to add two thoughts to the remarks by
the hon. Member for Belfast, North(Mr. Dodds). First, it
seems that there is some justification for saying that in certain
circumstances in which natural justice would point towards a
compensation payout, such payouts have been prevented by the strictures
outlined by the hon. Member for Belfast, North, because the conditions
are difficult to prove. He cites the example of a rural and 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1055</b><br>isolated premises that might be subject to an arson attack. The same
thing can happen in urban areas. Will the Minister outline his
understanding of the extent to which this is a problem?</p><p><a name="06051798000066">My second concern is that it
looks as though an accident of circumstance can mean that an attack in
two different situations will lead to very different outcomes as
regards compensation, through no fault of the person making the
compensation claim. What is the Minister&#146;s view of that apparent
double standard? I know that he would agree that it is an unintended
consequence of the Bill, but it strikes me that the new clause could
resolve the disparity. It would be terribly undesirable were
compensation not to be paid out in some situations. I hope that he can
either accept the new clause or provide clarity about what the
Government regard as the best course of action to ensure that those in
rural and isolated areas, or those who cannot prove the nature of an
attack, are not treated as second-class
citizens.</p><p><a name="06051798000067"><b><a name="06051798000124">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr.
Dodds) for tabling his new clause.</p><p><a name="06051798000068">I start by utterly condemning
any attacks or vandalism on Orange or Hibernian halls, or any other
buildings used for meetings. Whether they are attacked as a matter of
general vandalism or subject to an attack of a sectarian nature, that
is unacceptable in a civilised society. I would urge, as would the
Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale,
East (Paul Goggins), that any individuals who had information about
such attacks should take it to the police, who may be able to undertake
prosecution. Those who carry out such attacks should face the full
force of the law&#151;that is self-evident in a civilised
society.</p><p><a name="06051798000069">Let me say
to the hon. Member for Belfast, North in particular that the current
criminal damage legislation is an important means of supporting
individuals and groups who have suffered material loss over the period
of conflict in Northern Ireland. Now that we are moving, I hope, to a
more normal society, such attacks, particularly the sectarian ones,
should be reduced. That will in due course have obvious implications
for current criminal damage arrangements generally.</p><p><a name="06051798000070">The Criminal Damage
(Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 is particular to Northern
Ireland. As we all know, that is because of the particular problems
faced by Northern Ireland at that time. Such legislation does not exist
in other parts of the United Kingdom. I want to reflect on the future
of such compensation schemes, particularly in the context of a changing
Northern Ireland and the Government&#146;s national approach to
compensation. Of course, I recognise the great hurt and pain that can
be caused, be it by a small act of vandalism causing a broken window or
something much more serious in the shape of an arson attack on an
entire building. The Police Service of Northern Ireland takes such
criminal acts very seriously and will use the full weight of the law to
prosecute the
perpetrators.</p><p><a name="06051798000071">Before
turning to the new clause, I will respond to the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), who asked me about the nature and
number of such attacks. I recently answered a parliamentary
question&#151;if it was 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1056</b><br>not me, it was my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for
security&#151;which indicated that police figures show that over the
past 15 years, attacks on Orange halls in particular have varied
significantly. In 1997, therewere 41 attacks; in 2004, there
were six attacks; and the provisional figure for 2005 was higher than
that for 2004. That information gives no specifics on the nature of the
attack&#151;it could be a broken window or a full arson attack on a
building.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000087">4.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000072">The
new clause seeks to change article 4 of the Criminal Damage
(Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which was drafted to meet
specific conditions relating to agricultural property, particularly the
absence of a Chief Constable&#146;s certificate where the damage was
caused by those acting on behalf of an illegal organisation, or the
evidence of the involvement of three or more
persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000073">Claims
for non-agricultural properties are covered under article 5 of the
Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 and, where
its conditions are satisfied, claimants can obtain compensation for
damage to such property. A Chief Constable&#146;s certificate, or
proof of the involvement of three or more persons or of an illegal
organisation, are generally required as proof of liability in respect
of claims for compensation. Where there is evidence of damage caused by
civil disorder, for example, Orange halls can make claims under the
provisions of the order. When claims are not met under compensation
arrangements, they should fall under commercial insurance arrangements
in the normal way. We are dealing here with the question of whether we
should give compensation to Orange halls on a par with that given to
agricultural buildings when there is no Chief Constable&#146;s
certificate and no evidence of the involvement of three or more
persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000074">The
effect of the new clause would be to extend the category of properties
falling under article 4, which was not intended for that purpose. The
Government believe that, when a property is damaged and when there is
no Chief Constable&#146;s certificate and no evidence of the
involvement of three or more persons&#151;when the circumstances do
not meet the evidential requirement of the legislation covering
criminal damage compensation&#151;the normal route for seeking
compensation, in Northern Ireland as in other parts of the United
Kingdom, is through general property
insurance.</p><p><a name="06051798000075">I recognise
that there can be difficulties in obtaining insurance, and I have
discussed this issue with the hon. Member for Belfast, North. The
Orange Order is a powerful organisation in the fabric of Northern
Ireland, however, and it represents an awful lot of individuals and
organisations. I would hope that it could use its power to raise these
issues with the insurance companies.</p><p><a name="06051798000076">I know that it will disappoint
the hon. Gentleman that I am unable to accept his new clause today. The
provisions relating to the specific circumstances of agricultural
properties were made in 1977. There is an anomaly involved, as that is
the only area that is covered. However, there is compensation available
for circumstances involving collective discontent and disorder, and
compensation can also be obtained with a Chief Constable&#146;s
certificate or with evidence of the involvement of three or more
people. I am unable to accept the new clause for those
reasons.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1057</b><br><p><a name="06051798000077"><b><a name="06051798000125">Lady
Hermon:</b> If the Minister is not prepared
to accept the new clause, will he consider an alternative that would
make things easier for organisations such as the Ancient Order of
Hibernians and, particularly, the Orange Order, which bears the brunt
of these problems? Could not the Northern Ireland Office pay for CCTV
cameras to be installed at the premises of such organisations, in order
that they might gather the evidence themselves under the present
scheme? Will the Minister agree to
that?</p><p><a name="06051798000078"><b><a name="06051798000126">Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady will know that I
have recently announced additional resources for CCTV cameras, and a
competition for individual organisations to bid for such cameras. That
is possible for any organisation to do, subject to their demonstrating
that the cameras would be of benefit in the prevention of crime. In
principle, there is nothing to preclude an organisation from bidding
for CCTV cameras to cover Orange halls. I cannot, and nor would I wish
to, fund CCTV cameras at every Orange hall site, because that would be
an impractical way of implementing Government policy. However, in
principle, there is nothing wrong with applications being made to that
effect.</p><p><a name="06051798000079">The hon.
Member for Belfast, North mentioned the significant investment of
&#163;33 million in areas of deprivation, and we have also undertaken
the derating of Orange halls, which has released significant resources
to the organisation. I know that he and his party welcomed that move,
having pressed for it. The Government supported that change, and
considered it a positive move forward in releasing those resources to
the Orange halls. I know that he will be disappointed that I cannot
accept his new clause today, but I cannot. I have explained the reasons
for my decision, and I hope that he will withdraw it on that
basis.</p><p><a name="060517102000009"><b><a name="060517102000592">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I have listened to the
Minister&#146;s comments and I am disappointed that he does not feel
able to accept the new clause or to take on board the suggestion made
by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) that he might at least
provide such halls with the opportunity to try to claim
compensation&#151;as many of them do not have insurance&#151;by
gathering evidence from CCTV.</p><p><a name="060517102000010"><b><a name="060517102000593">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I emphasise again that if the
Chief Constable offers certification to the effect that the damage was
caused by disorder or other associated means, and if three or more
people were involved, criminal compensation can be claimed. The problem
only exists if fewer people were involved.</p><p><a name="060517102000011"><b><a name="060517102000594">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I understand that that is the legal position, which
is precisely the problem. That is why we have tabled the new clause.
While we understand that three or more people must be involved in an
attack for compensation to be payable, the difficulty is proving that
three or more people were involved. We are talking about buildings that
have clearly been destroyed for sectarian reasons and as part of a
wider campaign, as has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland.
It was for precisely that reason that the Government introduced an
exception for agricultural premises in 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1058</b><br>section 4 of the 1997 order, to which the Minister referred. That
accepted that, for certain types of premises, it would be difficult to
provide proof.</p><p><a name="060517102000012">My
party&#146;s suggestion is that the same criteria should apply in
relation to halls&#151;primarily Orange halls, but also to
nationalist halls such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians and
others&#151;so that they are not crippled in that way and that local
communities are not deprived of an extremely valuable resource, in many
cases for years and sometimes for ever. All hon. Members recognise the
valuable and important role that such parish halls play in our
communities up and down the land, day in and day
out.</p><p><a name="060517102000013"><b><a name="060517102000595">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> In that context, does the hon. Gentleman
agree that the Minister&#146;s position seems to step against
normalisation, as he has created a double standard in relation to the
burden of proof in some circumstances? I cannot see why the Minister is
making such heavy weather of accepting a fairly common-sense proposal
that provides proper and sensible protection in a way that cannot
realistically be abused.</p><p><a name="060517102000014"><b><a name="060517102000596">Mr.
Dodds:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I hope that
his additional words, even at this late stage, will cause the Minister
to think again. This short debate has illustrated a fairly strong
consensus on the issue. Most people see the proposal as fairly
modest.It is in line with Government policy, the recent
announcement of a package of measures and the recent announcement on
derating. It accepts that there are anomalies for certain types of
premises. The proposal simply ensures that local communities will not
be deprived.</p><p><a name="060517102000015">Finally, the Minister asked
whether the owners of such halls, and the Orange Order in particular,
could go to the insurers and talk to them. No doubt the Minister will
be aware&#151;some of his colleagues should be, as the Orange Order
has made this clear to Ministers in talks&#151;that this matter has
been the subject of years of discussion and negotiation with insurers.
The trouble is that those discussions are not getting anywhere. As a
result, halls up and down the land either cannot get insurance any more
or any insurance that is available to them is so exorbitant that it
simply cannot be obtained.</p><p><a name="060517102000016">For those reasons, and in view
of the expressions of support in the House, I shall press the new
clause to a Division.</p><p><a name="060517102000017"><i> Question put</i>, That the

Reid:</b> New clause 4 replicates the provisions of section 10
of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which introduces anonymous
registration provisions in Great Britain but does not extend to
Northern Ireland. However, the principal justifications for anonymous
registration in Great Britain apply equally well in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000505">In Great
Britain, people who fear that their security, or that of their
families, will be put at risk if their names appear on the register are
allowed to apply to register anonymously. Given that the principles
behind anonymous registration were debated at length in Committee,
where there was widespread support for introducing it in Northern
Ireland, I shall not repeat all the arguments
today.</p><p><a name="060517102000506">We have tabled
the new clause to elicit from the Minister an explanation of why the
Government treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.
The Government do not intend to use the Bill to introduce anonymous
registration in Northern Ireland, but instead will do so means of an
Order in Council. As a result, people there will not be able to take
advantage of anonymous registration until much later than their
counterparts in Great Britain. I hope that the Minister will answer a
few questions about that.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1064</b><br><p><a name="060517102000507">Will there be a consultation in
Northern Ireland before the Government introduce the secondary
legislation here? Secondary legislation cannot be debated and amended
by this House, so consultation is even more important than with primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="060517102000508">Do the
Government have a proposed timetable for implementation of the
provision? When do they intend to bring the Order in Council before the
House? Will it be in place before the annual canvass planned for next
year? That is important because, if it is not in place then, people who
might want to register anonymously will be forced to make a choice. If
they decide not to register, they will give up their right to vote, but
if they remain fully on the register, they could put themselves or
their families at risk. The next canvass is not due until 2010, but it
could be as late as 2016 if the Secretary of State uses his power of
veto.</p><p><a name="060517102000509"><b><a name="060517102001074">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> The Minister is likely to stand up and give
the reasons why the Government are not willing to accept this
commonsense proposal, and we have just had a vote on a matter in which
he showed no interest at all. He did not take the DUP&#146;s
amendment at all seriously, but does my hon. Friend agree that the
Minister would do a lot better if he showed some sympathy and empathy
for what is being
proposed?</p><p><a name="060517102000510"><b><a name="060517102001075">Mr.
Reid:</b> I agree wholeheartedly. The
Minister showed little sympathy for the earlier amendment. I hope that
he will do better this time and at least answer my questions properly.
People&#146;s right to vote is a key element of a democratic society,
but they are also entitled to exercise that right in complete security
and in a way that does not put at risk their lives, or the lives of
their
families.</p><p><a name="060517102000511">The
right to anonymous registration has been introduced in the rest of the

amendments Nos. 17 to 20, aspects of which we discussed at earlier
stages.</p><p><a name="060517102000513">Accuracy of
the register is extremely important. We expressed concerns about the
abolition of the annual canvass in previous debates; today, we are
discussing the same thing in a different way. We were concerned about
the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to override the chief electoral
officer and, indeed, the legislation. We are now looking at the matter
slightly differently. Our amendments would ensure that a canvass took
place in 2015 and every 10 years thereafter, so that even if one
canvass was delayed, others would be carried out in those
years.</p><p><a name="060517102000514">We were a
little concerned about the abolition of the annual canvass, but having
discussed it with the former CEO, we understood some of the reasons. He
felt that it would be better if he could deploy his resources on
encouraging people to register rather than carrying out an annual
canvass. I can appreciate both sides of the argument, but I am
concerned that the Secretary of State could say that a canvass should
never be carried out. It is important to hold a canvass every so often,
as people move or slip through the net.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1065</b><br><p><a name="060517102000515">I commend our amendments; they

Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) made
their proposals.</p><p><a name="060517102000517">The
Government and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute have a common
interest. It is our intention broadly to mirror the provisions on
anonymous registration, for the reasons that we discussed in the
Committee of the whole House some weeks ago. Anonymous registration is
vital to protect individuals who feel threatened and we agree with it.
The question is how to do
it.</p><p><a name="060517102000518">The new clause
would replicate the provisions of the Electoral Administration Bill,
and the reason I cannot accept the new clause is not that we are not on
the same wavelength in respect of anonymous registration but because
there are differences in the operation of electoral law in Northern
Ireland. There are registration conditions and anti-fraud measures that
do not apply to the rest of the United Kingdom, including, for example,
proof of identity requirements at the polling station that are not
necessary in Great Britain and which make anonymity more difficult to
maintain. There is a range of
reasons.</p><p><a name="060517102000519">We shall
introduce an Order in Council to give effect to the same principle that
the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, but in a Northern Ireland context.
The proposals will be introduced later so that we can consider their
implications for Northern Ireland, but the principle is exactly the
same. I want anonymous registration in due course and we shall
introduce the order after the consultation process. We hope that that
will not be long after the scheme is introduced in Great Britain and
that any difference in time scale will be a matter of only a few
months. I hope that it will be only a few weeks, and that we can
introduce the order
quickly.</p><p><a name="060517102000520">I appreciate
that the hon. Gentleman does not support the whole idea of Orders in
Council. I realise that they are not amendable and that that gives rise
to difficulties, but on this occasion there are real reasons, which I
have outlined, for an Order in Council. I do not expect that he will
disagree with the content of the order because it will achieve his
objectives, but in a Northern Ireland
context.</p><p><a name="060517102000521">I
turn to the points made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr.
Robertson). If he looks at clause 3, as I know that he has done, he
will see that the Government&#146;s clear intention is that there
will be a canvass in 2010. The key point of his amendments is that, if
the chief electoral officer believes that the canvass in 2010 is not
necessary for him to meet the registration objectives that we have also
set out in the legislation&#151;for example, if he feels that a
canvass would not improve the comprehensiveness or accuracy&#151;and
he believes that, for his own purposes, that the cost of that canvass
is not justified, he can recommend to the Secretary of State that the
2010 canvass be cancelled.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1066</b><br><p><a name="060517102000522">Only if such
a recommendation is made can the Secretary of State make an order to
remove the requirement for a canvass to held in 2010. The Secretary of
State cannot unilaterally cancel the canvass in 2010; he can only do so
if the chief electoral officer makes a recommendation to that effect
because the chief electoral officer, not the Secretary of State,
believes that the canvass should be cancelled. Even if that were the
case and the Secretary of State accepted the chief electoral
officer&#146;s recommendation, it would be subject to approval by
both the House and another
place.</p><p><a name="060517102000523">Canvasses are
very resource-intensive in terms of both labour and money. It is only
right that the chief electoral officer has the power to determine how
his resources will be best deployed in determining whether or not a
canvass is necessary in 2010. Indeed, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury
will know that 2010 is only four years after the final annual canvass,
which will take place very shortly. I hope that, with the assurance
that the Secretary of State has a power only to accept a
recommendation, the hon. Gentleman will not press any of his amendments
and that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute will withdraw the
motion.</p><p><a name="060517102000524"><b><a name="060517102001078">Mr.

including accepting the new clause.</p><p><a name="060517102000529">Since this is the
Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I have an opportunity
to introduce, under the heading of miscellaneous, a very important
issue that has come to my attention for a certain reason in North Down.
The new clause would amend the current wording of article 31 of the
Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. If no next of kin or other
family member has visited a child in care within 12 months, the
relevant authority should certainly appoint an independent visitor to
see to the needs and request of the young person who is in
care.</p><p><a name="060517102000530">I
understand that the system of independent visitors has worked extremely
well in Wales, but the practice has been very patchy in Northern
Ireland, where some trusts appoint independent visitors, while others
choose not to do so or leave doing so until the eleventh hour. The new
clause would ensure that, if there had not been a visit to a child in
care in a much shorter period of time&#151;three months&#151;an
independent visitor would, of necessity, be appointed.</p><p><a name="060517102000531">The matter came
to my attention in my constituency for a very particular reason. The
whole of Northern Ireland is serviced by one juvenile justice centre,
which was opened recently. I pay tribute to&#151;sadly&#151;the
late Martin Mogg, who led the way in many ways. He was very progressive
in his thinking about modernising juvenile justice in Northern Ireland
and I had the great good fortune of being first shown around the
juvenile justice centre on the Rathgael road in Bangor by him. I knew
at the time that he was ill, but I did not realise just how ill. I am
sure that other hon. Members who knew him will wish to join me in
paying tribute to his efforts to modernise juvenile justice in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000532">I first visited
the juvenile justice centre on Good Friday 2004. We are talking about
young people who, allegedly, have committed serious offences in
Northern Ireland, but who are juveniles. During the course of
conversations with some of those young people&#151;particularly the
young women, who were being taught for the first time to iron clothes
and the young men who were being taught how to make scrambled egg, if I
remember correctly, and were delighted to have been given skills to
cook, wash, iron and look after themselves&#151;many of them
expressed reservations about returning to their communities.</p><p><a name="060517102000533">Those young
people&#151;particularly the young women&#151;also gave me a clear
impression of how they felt let down by the care system in Northern
Ireland. That has remained with me in my conscience for two years. As I
say, we have a vehicle to change things and to try to improve the care
system in Northern Ireland for young people. It seems a terribly sad
fact of life that young people who have gone into
care&#151;particularly young women&#151;have ended up in the
juvenile justice centre. We have let them down badly somewhere along
the line.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1068</b><br><p><a name="060517102000534">I have not
drafted the new clause with particular care, but I want to put it on
the record that we definitely need a care system that is much more
flexible in terms of independent visitors or advocates for young people
who go into care for whatever reason&#151;and there are always a
variety of reasons. I do not wish those young people to end up in the
juvenile justice centre. If the Minister cannot accept the wording of
the new clause, I hope that he will give a clear commitment that the
issue will be looked at seriously and promptly by the Northern Ireland
Office and those who are responsible for juvenile justice in Northern
Ireland..</p><p><a name="060517102000535"><b><a name="060517102001080">Dr.
Alasdair McDonnell:</b> I welcome the
opportunity to raise my concern about child welfare. There are many
serious issues. Although I welcome the purpose and intent of my hon.
Friend the Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) in proposing the new
clause, I have some concerns. I would have preferred the new clause to
have been additional to the current legislation, rather than something
to be used instead of it. As I understand it&#151;I am subject to
correction if I am wrong&#151;article 31(1) of the children
order allows independent visitors to be appointed only for children who
are in care. Children in care are defined by articles 25(1) and 27(2)
as children under care orders. That means that independent visitors
cannot be appointed for other children who are very much in need, but
who are not fully in care or fully under care orders. Such children may
nevertheless need and seek considerable assistance with finding a place
to live. They are generally teenage children who are in transition to
independent living, but not always. They are known as article 21
children. There is a serious defect because these children are very
much in need of support. They are in a halfway house, or
no-man&#146;s land, between care and independent living. The new
clause would certainly go a long way towards addressing the
problem.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517102000588">5
pm</h5><p><a name="060517102000536">The
new clause would delete article 31(1) and substitute the new wording,
but that would create a new problem, because article 31(1) is essential
for the protection of children in care. In fact, we need both
provisions. We need visitors to be appointed to children in care, but I
would claim that we also need visitors appointed to the many children
who are not quite in care or under care orders, but at the boundaries.
Such children need support as they move from being in care to
independent
living.</p><p><a name="060517102000537"><b><a name="060517102001081">Mrs.

difficult young people in the United Kingdom, and I met him when he was

need not soft treatment, but care and concern. No matter what offences
they may have committed, they must have the chance of rehabilitation

Simpson (Upper Bann) (DUP):</b> I support the idea of having a
visitor for young people. I have been involved in youth work for more
than 20 years, and I recognise some of what the hon. Member for North
Down (Lady Hermon) referred to. I remember visiting an organisation in
the city of Belfast which dealt with young people from 11 up to 16. I
visited one small apartment of a young lady of 15 years of age. She had
a young baby in the corner in one of the prams. I was informed that
that was her second child. Some of the young people had been used on
the streets of Belfast by paramilitary organisations and some of them
had got pregnant.</p><p><a name="060517102000543">My
hon. Friend the Member for Strangford(Mrs. Robinson)
mentioned follow-up visits, which are important. Through that
organisation, the young people were learning how to take care of basic
domestic tasks, from ironing clothes through to handling money,
including learning about computers so that they could keep basic
accounts. Those were tremendous achievements, but the young people
needed to be visited. Many of them had gone through traumatic times,
not only because they were used on the streets, but because they were
abused in homes by family members. We need to push for such support.

Wilson:</b> I have no hesitation in supporting the new clause.
The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) has identified an
important problem. Youngsters who are taken into care in Northern
Ireland face many disadvantages, which hon. Members mentioned, both
when they leave care and when they are in it. Not least, they face
disadvantages in getting an education.</p><p><a name="060517102000549">Many youngsters have come from
backgrounds in which their families have been disrupted and their lives
have been in turmoil in their early years. They come into care with
considerable educational disadvantages because they have not attended
school regularly&#151;perhaps because they have not been encouraged
to attend, because they are persistent truants, or because they come
from dysfunctional families. A recent ministerial response to me said
that about 90 per cent. of such youngsters leave school without the
basic qualifications that one would expect from schools in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000550">I
understand that the role of the visitor is to befriend youngsters and
to act as an advocate on their behalf. I am not clear whether that
would extend to the visitor acting as someone who can take up the
problems that the youngster may have with school and act as an
intermediary, or whether their role would be to identify some of the
problems that the youngster faces with education, and then persuade
someone else to intervene. The one thing I know is that we can no
longer tolerate a situation in which so many youngsters, who already
have an accumulation of disadvantages, are put out into the wide world
at 17 with little or no support and without the basic educational
skills that will enable them to get some stability back into their
lives. If the new clause helps at least to move us in that direction,
in all social conscience, we must accept it and progress in that
direction.</p><p><a name="060517102000551"><b><a name="060517102001087">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul
Goggins):</b> I thank the hon. Member for North Down (Lady
Hermon) for her warm welcome and hon. Members on both sides of the
House for the welcome they have offered to me in this debate and
elsewhere in the past few days. In a gentle way this afternoon, the
hon. Lady finally got her revenge. As a Home Office Minister for the
past three years, I have taken a range of criminal justice legislation
through the House. On the Floor of the House and in Committee, I have
engaged in discussions with her on a range of issues. She often said,
&#147;If this is good enough for England and Wales, why is it not
good enough for Northern Ireland?&#148;, to which I always replied
sympathetically that that was a matter for Northern Ireland Ministers.
Well, here we are.</p><p><a name="060517102000552">The hon. Lady raises an
important issue. The intention behind the new clause, which is clearly
thoughtful and caring, is shared by hon. Members across the House. The
Chair of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire
(Sir Patrick Cormack), alluded to my past. In the first 15 years of 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1072</b><br>my working life, I worked with children as well as troubled children in
care. I hope that some of what I learned then will inform my new
responsibilities in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000553">There is a
debate about whether the responsibility placed on the trust to appoint
an independent visitor should begin after three months or 12 months.
Some may regard three months as too early, some may regard 12 months as
too late. There is genuine discussion and reflection to be had. There
is, however&#151;I think that the hon. Lady recognised this&#151;a
technical difficulty with the new clause to which my hon. Friend the
Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) alluded. The provisions on
independent visitors apply to all children, whether they are in
voluntary accommodation or the subject of a care order. The inclusion
of a reference to article 21 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order
1995 would mean that the facility to appoint independent visitors
applied only in relation to children in voluntary care. It would take
away any requirement to appoint independent visitors for children who
were the subject of care orders. That presents us with a
difficulty.</p><p><a name="060517102000554">I feel
strongly&#151;I sense from the discussion that right hon. and hon.
Members agree&#151;that there is a need to ensure that children in
care in Northern Ireland have a stronger voice within the various
discussions that we have. I was pleased on Sunday to host a fun day in
the grounds of Hillsborough castle for the fostering network and to
meet representatives of Voices of Young People in Care, who said some
interesting things to me. They carried out some research as recently as
last year that highlighted a number of the issues facing young people
in care in Northern Ireland. They want more contact, where it is
possible, with their familyand friends. They want to have
greater input in the decisions that affect them, as well as to
highlight some of their difficulties in learning to trust and to engage
with new people.</p><p><a name="060517102000555">I
was pleased, therefore, in coming to this new role, to find that the
children and young people funding package that was launched by my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State in March contains an additional
&#163;660,000 to provide an independent advocacy and peer mentoring
service for children in care across Northern Ireland. That package and
the resource it brings will help us, along with other measures, to
promote greater stability and continuity of care placements, which are
so important.</p><p><a name="060517102000556"><b><a name="060517102001088">Mrs.
Iris Robinson:</b> May I flag up an issue
that is close to my heart? A lot of young vulnerable people in care
homes are self-harmers. When they are released back into the community,
they sometimes, sadly, become suicide statistics. We must look at the
whole question around mental health provision. We must allow more money
to be spent on those young adolescents who suffer mental illness
following whatever traumas they have suffered throughout their young
lives.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517102000589">5.15

with her in future.</p><p><a name="060517102000558">The hon. Member for East
Antrim (Sammy Wilson) made an important point about the need for better
educational outcomes for looked-after children. I hope that the
packages that we are developing will help young people in care to have
a greater say in the decisions that affect their lives and future. I
intend shortly to consult on proposals to place the independent
advocacy service on a statutory footing, which is a significant step
forward, and I look forward to hon. Members&#146; contributions and
observations. It is important that the new service complements, and
does not obstruct, other provisions for independent visitors and the
personal advisers appointed when children leave care. I agree that it
is important to follow through&#151;we should not abandon children
when they leave care.</p><p><a name="060517102000559"><b><a name="060517102001090">Sir

it must be developed in consultation and discussion with professionals,
children who have been in the care system, and hon. Members. In urging
the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) to withdraw the motion, I
pledge to make sure that she and other hon. Members are included in the

specific time scale. Work is under way, and there is a &#163;6
million package to promote fostering in Northern Ireland, which could
transform the fostering network, recruit more foster carers, and give
them better training and support. A series of measures will be
introduced, and our debate has confirmed my view that the matter is
urgent. We have a debt and obligation to looked-after children, and we
must all fulfil it. In response to the hon. Member for South

topics that we discussed in a slightly different context during earlier
stages of the Bill. They refer to the requirement that Ministers in
office uphold the rule of law, and that before they are appointed to
office, they make a declaration before the Assembly pledging to uphold
the rule of law. The new clauses add to sections 30 and 18 of the 1998
Act and the pledge of
office.</p><p><a name="060517102000574">On earlier
amendments we debated support for the rule of law and for the police,
so I do not intend to speak for too long, but as I did not take part in
that debate, I hope I shall be allowed a few minutes to express my
opinions. As has been said by various Members, we cannot allow a
situation in Northern Ireland where Ministers are in control of the
police, yet do not support the police. We cannot accept that situation
or move towards
it.</p><p><a name="060517102000575">Last week I
visited south Armagh. The people there, the Army and the police were
clear that the situation had improved immeasurably, and I accept that
it has. However, it may be useful to the House, especially to Members
who may not visit Northern Ireland regularly, if I describe the
situation there. The Army still accompanies the police when they go
around south Armagh, particularly in Crossmaglen. The police are often
refused service in shops. They are concerned about what will happen as
the Army pulls out of the area. Criminality is continuing and, in the
words of the people in the area, there is a long, long way to go before
normality is
reached.</p><p><a name="060517102000576">Given that
background, it is reasonable that we should ask any Minister who has
the potential to be in control of the police, and of the other offices
of Northern Ireland as well, to make a declaration before the Assembly
pledging to uphold the rule of law. I do not see that there can be any
objection to that requirement, other than one: there may be a
party&#151;Sinn Fein&#151;that would object to that requirement. If
we allow that party to get in the way of writing the requirement into
the Bill, what does that say about the entire process?</p><p><a name="060517102000577">We feel strongly about new
clauses 7 and 8. Yes, there is a requirement in the Bill to pursue
non-violent and democratic means, but the Bill, like the 1998 Act,
should require the additional declaration before the Assembly pledging
to uphold the rule of law. If that were the requirement, the
constitutional and legitimate parties in Northern Ireland would find it
much easier to move towards the full restoration of the Northern
Ireland
Assembly.</p><p><a name="060517102000578"><b><a name="060517102001100">Mark

Durkan:</b> New clauses 7 and 8 are better
than the provisions that we examined in Committee, but we are still
concerned on a couple of counts. On the new grounds for exclusion, the
question whether people are committed to upholding the rule of law in
Northern Ireland leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Earlier
today, I mentioned the attitude of parties to the Parades 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1076</b><br>Commission&#146;s rulings, to the performance of the police in
enforcing such rulings and to the ensuing violence in the case of
Whiterock. It is possible to question many parties other than Sinn Fein
about their attitude to upholding the rule of law.</p><p><a name="060517102000581">We now face the additional
problem created by the step too far by the leader of the Ulster
Unionist party in incorporating the leader of the political wing of the
Ulster Volunteer Force into the UUP Assemblygroup. I assume
that the Independent Monitoring Commission&#146;s examination of the
activities of political parties in the Assembly would centre on the
rights and roles in the Assembly of the new UUP Assembly group rather
than distinctively or specifically the Progressive Unionist party,
because the IMC has powers, which have not yet been activated, on the
conduct and rights of parties in the Assembly. That is an additional
complication, and, because we are all coming to terms with it and
hoping that other people might resolve it for us, it would be dangerous
to accept new clause
7.</p><p><a name="060517102000582">New clause 8
proposes an addition to the pledge of office. As I have said, the SDLP
is happy to consider in the context of a proper review of the agreement
altering the pledge of office to include commitments on the rule of law
or, indeed, the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In that context,
new commitments could be made to people who participate in all the
institutions or who exercise responsibility in all of the institutions.
I originally drafted the pledge of office when we negotiated the
agreement, and I was careful not to build in a commitment to all the
institutions, because that would be unfair to Ministers who oppose the
agreement&#151;people should not have to sign up to the agreement to
take office. Equally, we did not build in specific commitments at that
stage in relation to policing and the rule of law. If the circumstances
have changed, we could consider that matter, but it should be done in
the context of a review agreed by the parties rather than by the House
acting at its own
behest.</p><p><a name="060517102000583"><b><a name="060517102001103">Lembit

by including that additional pledge. If we listen to the testimony from
various individuals in Northern Ireland, nobody robbed the Northern

everything that he says is absolutely true. Yes, there has been
significant advance&#151;nobody denies that&#151;but one still has
to travel in an armoured helicopter or an armoured vehicle, and in a
convoy. We heard some pretty horrific tales of people being set upon
and beaten up. We also heard tales of extraordinary courage&#151;of
young police officers who, despite suffering the most dreadful
injuries, still returned to their posts wanting to serve in south
Armagh because they do so love the countryside and the people. We are
dealing with a very small number of evil people and a very large number
of decent ones. It is crucial that there should be public and
proclaimed commitment to the rule of law. That is all that my hon.

achieve.</p><p><a name="060517111000016">I make one

and I entered this House in June 1970, almost 36 years ago, the
Province was represented for the most part by Ulster Unionist party
Members, who sat with us on what was in those days the Government side
of the House and received the Whip. I might say that the right hon.
Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) entered on the same day and
sat in the same place.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1078</b><br><p><a name="060517111000017">I was deeply concerned earlier
this week when I learned of the extraordinary arrangement between the
Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Unionist party. I can well
understand the misgivings that the hon. Member for North Down (Lady
Hermon) was courageous enough to proclaim in the House this afternoon.
Let us hope that I am proved wrong, and that there is more to it than
the official reason that was given immediately afterwards. Let us hope
that what the hon. Lady heard last night turns out to be true. However,
at the moment, it looks like a rather cynical manoeuvre, and it is one
that I am deeply distressed about, having always had a profound respect
for that party. It has had its ups and downs, but it has always been
consistently and absolutely democratic and law abiding. To find it now
put into the same category as Sinn Fein by the Secretary of
State&#146;s statement today is very distressing. I think that that
was very unfair on his part, but it is nevertheless
distressing.</p><p><a name="060517111000018">The
hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) has his misgivings. He said that he
was unhappy about the new clauses, but he went on to say that he was
happy about a pledge to uphold the rule of law. He referred to the
events of earlier this week, and it is those events that underline the
need for everyone who is to play a constructive part in the Northern
Ireland Assembly, particularly those in the Executive who will govern
the Province, to make a public proclamation of their dedication to
upholding the rule of law. I hope that it will not be necessary to vote
on the new clause, because I hope that we shall have a good response
from the Minister, but if it is necessary to go into the Lobby, I shall
certainly support my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury most
strongly.</p><p><a name="060517111000019"><b><a name="060517111000715">Sammy
Wilson: </b>The new clause is key to the
likelihood of devolution being successfully implemented in Northern
Ireland and to whatever devolved Government we set up being sustainable
in the long run. It surprises me that there has already been resistance
to it from the Government. Without a commitment by all those involved
in the devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland, and in the Executive
within it, to supporting the police and upholding the rule of law, we
can be sure that it will not be long before a crisis hits the Assembly
and it collapses again. We have already experienced that. The previous
Assembly stumbled from one crisis to another, and it was quite clear
why that was happening. Periodically, one of the parties involved in
the Executive showed that it did not support the police not only
through its words but through its activities. It is unthinkable that we
could have a workable Executive in which there was no commitment to
upholding the rule of law and supporting the police.</p><p><a name="060517111000020">My party and I share some of
the reservations that have been expressed about the wording of the new
clause. Of course it is possible for someone to take a pledge to uphold
the rule of law and then totally disregard it, or say that their
interpretation of it was different. The Northern Ireland Act 1998
required Ministers to be committed to &#147;exclusively
peaceful&#148; means. The Sinn Fein Members signed up to that, while
at the same time running a spy ring from their office. Members of their
party were also engaged in gun running and, on a regular basis,
extortion, criminality and murder were being carried out by the very
people with whom they were associated.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1079</b><br><p><a name="060517111000021"><b><a name="060517111000716">Mrs.
Iris Robinson: </b>I want to highlight the
fact that there is no such thing as a good terrorist, whether they are
members of the UVF or the IRA, or Muslim extremists. If they are
terrorists, they are terrorists, and murder is murder. I also want to
point out how far down the road Sinn Fein-IRA have gone within the
ethnic minority communities. Last year, the Government gave
&#163;10,000 to a community group called WARN, which stands for the
West Against Racism Network. I think that it is well named. It operates
out of west Belfast, and had prepared a package for ethnic minorities
coming into west Belfast. A leaflet that was part of the package said
that the PSNI was an extension of the British state and had no support
in west Belfast, so it would not be in the interest of any ethnic
minority grouping to call the police for any reason at
all.</p><p><a name="060517111000022"><b><a name="060517111000717">Sammy

deal with that issue later. She has highlighted an important part of
what we mean by supporting the rule of law.</p><p><a name="060517111000023">Despite
reservations that we might have about the effectiveness of any
additional pledge, we support the new clause for two reasons. First, it
is at least a step in the right direction. It counters the wrong
signals sent out by the Government at present. Members have already
referred to the Secretary of State giving evidence to the Northern
Ireland Affairs Committee last Thursday, which was an interesting
session. During it, I put a simple question to him. I asked him whether
it was</p><a name="060517111000679"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;possible for an
executive to be set up in Northern Ireland, with ministers from Sinn
Fein, even though Sinn Fein had not at that stage given their support
for policing.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000024">His
answer was extremely disturbing. First, he said that he did not want
to</p><a name="060517111000680"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;erect new hurdles
to power sharing.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000025">He
went on to state:</p><a name="060517111000681"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I do not want to make
this&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000026">a
commitment to supporting the
police&#151;</p><a name="060517111000682"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a
pre-condition, and it will not be made a pre-condition, for the
restoration of the institutions&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000027">What could be a clearer signal to those
who not only do not support the police but, as the hon. Member for
Strangford (Mrs. Robinson) has pointed out, actively discourage people
from having anything to do with the police, even to the point that they
seek to poison the minds of people who come to Northern Ireland from
outside to get them into their way of thinking? Leaflets have been
given to those who have come to west Belfast warning them not to go to
the police station, not to report crimes to the police and not to go to
the police station unaccompanied. What kind of message is that to send
out?</p><p><a name="060517111000028">The Secretary
of State told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee last week that he
did not wish to erect a barrier to the setting up of the institutions.
In this case, he did not want us to insist that Sinn Fein should desist
from that kind of poisoning of people&#146;s minds. He went on to say
that</p><a name="060517111000683"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is
no question that it is unsustainable in the medium-term, let alone the
long- term, for parties to seek to have ministers in an executive when
they are not co-operating with the police even at the most basic level
or at a local level&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1080</b><br><p><a name="060517111000029">What is the medium term? How long can a
Minister stay in office while the kind of poison that I and my hon.
Friend the Member for Strangford have described&#151;about not
co-operating with the police&#151;is pumped out by activists on the
street?</p><p><a name="060517111000030">At the
weekend I did a television interview with a Sinn Fein representative.
During the interview, I asked her whether she and her organisation
would advise someone who had witnessed or had evidence of a rape to go
to the police. One would have thought that a woman who was asked about
that kind of issue would respond, &#147;Of course, such a violation
should be immediately reported to the police, and anyone with
information should go to the police.&#148; However, all I got was
rhetoric about the police recruiting informers and gathering
intelligence in republican areas. Even as a woman, that Sinn Fein
representative could not say unequivocally &#147;We want people to
report rapes to the police, and to give evidence.&#148; Someone who
wants to be a Minister in a Government and who still associates with a
party which, collectively and in terms of its individual members, gives
such advice to the public is not fit to be in Government, and a
Government containing such people will not, in my view, be
sustainable.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517111000703">5.45

Dodds:</b> Does not the point become rather more telling when
we consider that one of the responsibilities of the social development
Minister&#151;a post that this Minister currently holds
here&#151;relates to antisocial behaviour orders, under housing
legislation? It would be possible for a devolved social development
Minister to deal with antisocial behaviour legislation in a housing
context while not being prepared to tell people to support the PSNI,
the agency that might be involved in enforcing the legislation. Surely
that is nonsense.</p><p><a name="060517111000032"><b><a name="060517111000719">Sammy

Minister not to encourage the public to give evidence when schools had
been attacked and windows broken. I think that the new clause is a step
in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="060517111000033">I was
perturbed by the Secretary of State&#146;s apparent acceptance that
Sinn Fein had done all that it could. When I pressed him again, he
said:</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/debtext/60517-0166.htm"/>


<a name="060517111000684"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I do
not want a late pre-condition established on top of the absolutely
correct demands that have been made of republicans that they
decommission, that they end their paramilitary activity and they end
their criminality.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000034">It
would seem that the Secretary of State is sending a signal to Sinn
Fein, saying &#147;You have done all these things, we are thankful,
and we do not want to press you any further.&#148;</p><p><a name="060517111000035">Let me make it clear that this
is not a new precondition. It is not an attempt to create a hurdle. It
is a long-standing requirement. It is what was meant by the reference
in the pledge of office to being committed to entirely democratic and
peaceful means. That must involve upholding and supporting the police,
which has not been done. It is therefore important for us to send the
right signal.</p><p><a name="060517111000036">I take
the point made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). I believe
that this argument has been weakened somewhat by the activities of one
of the 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1081</b><br>Unionist parties in Northern Ireland. At least in the House of Commons,
even today, all who represent the Unionist tradition have made it clear
that they envisage no role in Government for those who have been
involved in terrorism.</p><p><a name="060517111000037">Only last
week, when the Secretary of State appeared before the Northern Ireland
Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) put on
record what the IMC report had said in paragraphs 2.30 and 2.31 about
the activities of the Ulster Volunteer Force. I will not read it out
now, because time is short. Two days later, the hon. Lady was
completely undermined by her own party, which seemed to have ignored
all that the IMC had said because, in terms of ministerial posts, it
was in its interests to do so. That was the reason given. At the
weekend I conducted an interview with one of the party&#146;s leading
negotiators, and that was the only reason he gave. He did not say that
it would help the UUP to persuade the UVF to give up its guns and its
criminality; he simply said that it would give the party an extra
position should an Executive be established.</p><p><a name="060517111000038">I believe that that cynical
exercise has, to an extent, undermined the position that the Unionists
have adopted. I should make it clear, however, that we believe the same
requirement should apply across the board. We cannot allow it to be
weakened by the fact that some may have decided for cynical reasons to
ally themselves with those whom the IMC has accused of being engaged in
all kinds of criminal and terrorist
activity.</p><p><a name="060517111000039">This is an
important new clause. The Government must stop being ambivalent toward
the behaviour of Sinn Fein and its associates, and toward that of
others involved in terrorist activity. It does not matter whether or
not the Minister includes this test in the Bill: we will apply it to
Sinn Fein. It would be much better to include that test in the Bill,
however, so that the clear message is sent to terrorists and to Sinn
Fein that the whole democratic body of the United Kingdom supports the
test and requires that it is met. But we will make the judgment, and as
we have made clear today, if Sinn Fein persists in its refusal to back
law and order and the police, and persists in its refusal to encourage
those who are influenced by it to support the police, it will not be
regarded as fit for government and will not be included in the
Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000040">The
Minister is keen to have devolution in Northern Ireland by the end of
November. The one way to ensure that that does not happen is to allow
Sinn Fein to believe that it is not going to be pushed into doing the
proper thing, the democratic thing, the right thing, which is to
support the police, who will have to enforce the laws that they would
wish to pass in an Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000041"><b><a name="060517111000720">Mr.
Hanson:</b> For the avoidance of any doubt,
I say straight away to the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)
that I will not be ambivalent in my comments on support for policing.
This Government, the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister, the
Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) and I all believe
that Sinn Fein should be involved in, sign up to and support policing,
and that they should take their places on the Policing Board. I am not
going 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1082</b><br>to defend in this House a situation in which attacks on schools could
occur, or in which individuals are not encouraged to go to the police
to ensure that information about rapes is passed on. I make it clear to
the hon. Member for East Antrim and others that the Government look
forward to the day when Sinn Fein members take their place on the
Policing Board and all citizens of Northern Ireland respect and support
policing in the community and at large.</p><p><a name="060517111000042">We share the aim

right to support the rule of law in that way. My problem with the new
clause tabled by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury relates to the ability
to legislate according to it. First, it is important to put on the
record that there is movement in the direction of travel that those who
have spoken today want to see. In paragraph 2.19 of its 10th report,
the Independent Monitoring Commission&#151;an independent body, not
the Government or a political party represented in this
House&#151;states:</p><a name="060517111000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
believe that the
leadership&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000047">of Sinn Fein
and of the IRA</p><a name="060517111000686"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has
accepted the need to engage in policing if it is to achieve its aim of
devolution of policing and justice to an Assembly and Executive in
Northern Ireland. It has not...yet determined how this might be
delivered&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000048">but it has
said that it wishes to see that direction of
travel.</p><p><a name="060517111000049">Paragraph 2.13 of the
report
states:</p><a name="060517111000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
remains our absolutely clear view that the PIRA leadership has
committed itself to following a peaceful
path.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000050">I recognise that
there is more work to be done, and in my role as Minister I will do all
that I can to ensure that that it is done. The hon. Member for East
Antrim said that there is a problem of definition with the new clause,
and that is the nub of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle
(Mark Durkan) intimated as much, because we cannot define what the rule
of law means or what support for it means. We know the direction of
travel in broad terms, but I cannot define it in
legislation.</p><p><a name="060517111000051"><b><a name="060517111000725">Mr.
Laurence Robertson:</b> The Minister will be aware that the
word most often used in law is &#147;reasonable&#148;. It is not

means.</p><p><a name="060517111000052"><b><a name="060517111000726">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I put my points to the House and that is one of
the points that it is important to recognise. I draw the attention of
hon. Members back to a point that I discussed earlier, which concerns
the pledge of 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1083</b><br>office. The pledge of office in place at present ensures that all
Ministers must affirm, before taking any post, a commitment to
non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. The current
pledge of office can also be affected by IMC recommendations&#151;and
that is an important point. For example, if a future IMC report
determined that individuals or organisations were not acting in the
spirit of the pledge of office, safeguards are in place so that action
could be
taken.</p><p><a name="060517111000053"><b><a name="060517111000727">Sir
Patrick Cormack:</b> I have a high regard for the Minister, as
he knows, but there are times when the Government have to behave with
real firmness. We need the smack of firm Government. The Government
must tell these people that unless they make such a pledge, there is no
place for them in the Government of any part of the UK. If the
Government do not do that, they will not achieve devolved Government in
Northern Ireland&#151;which we want them to
achieve.</p><p><a name="060517111000054"><b><a name="060517111000728">Mr.
Hanson:</b> I reciprocate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
sentiments, but he will understand that every hon. Member who has
spoken today shares the same objective. I simply do not feel that
legislating for it in the way proposed, with due respect to the hon.
Member for Tewkesbury would achieve that end or, for the reasons of
definition mentioned by the hon. Member for East Antrim, would be
applicable.</p><p><a name="060517111000055"><b><a name="060517111000729">Rev.
Ian Paisley:</b> The situation arose after those men had taken
that pledge: they resorted to violence and some of them made statements
justifying it. Why was nothing done then? The Government did not say
that those men had to leave the Executive: they closed down the whole
lot. I was accused of a sin and so were all the other Members, but
those men were
not.</p><p><a name="060517111000056"><b><a name="060517111000730">Mr.
Hanson:</b> If the right hon. Gentleman is not happy with the
current pledge of office and its operation&#151;I take it from his
comments that he is not&#151;I have given a commitment previously,
and I reaffirm it today, that we are happy to consider further
legislation in due course on a stronger pledge of office, if such
measures are produced by agreement as part of discussions of strand 1
issues. He will know that I am happy to discuss that and, in fact, I
have sat across a table from his colleagues and raised the prospect
with them.</p><p><a name="060517111000057">For the
avoidance of doubt, I confirm that the Government are committed to
supporting the rule of law and the involvement of Sinn Fein and other
interested parties in policing. That is essential, but the new clause
would not assist in that process and I ask the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury to withdraw
it.</p><p><a name="060517111000058"><b><a name="060517111000731">Mr.

this debate in less than a minute, I do not have time to go through the
various arguments that have been made. The new clause is not
watertight, but no legislation is. However, as the hon. Member for East
Antrim (Sammy Wilson) said, it would be a significant move in the right
direction if we were to adopt it. I therefore have no option but to
press the new clause to a vote.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1084</b><br><p><a name="060517111000059"><i> Question put</i>, That the

Hanson:</b> Over the course of its consideration, on Second
Reading, in Committee&#151;particularly given that there was a
Committee of the whole House&#151;and on Report, we have had a useful
discussion about the principles of the Bill. I commend right hon. and
hon. Members on their valuable contributions to today&#146;s debate.
Contrary to assertions made by Members, the Government have listened to
some of the points that have been made and have tabled amendments that
have made a material difference to the nature of the Bill. As with
every piece of legislation, it is not possible to accept every
amendment or every point made in the debate. There will be differences
between us, but I have moved on several points and I am pleased to see
that those have been incorporated in the Third Reading of the
Bill.</p><a name="060517111000675"><p>As right
hon. and hon. Members will know, there is a clear path open to us now
on Northern Ireland&#146;s political development to ensure that, as
has been stated by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, by the end of
2006 we bring about clear political progress for the political
organisations in Northern Ireland and for the benefit of the people of
Northern Ireland. It is now for local politicians to take forward that
task of devolution. I am pleased that we are meeting today, in the week
that the Assembly reconvened following the passing of earlier
legislation; that we have in place Assembly Members who are signed up
again to take part in the Assembly; and that we had debates on the
Floor of the Assembly this week, with participation from Members from
across the Assembly. I believe, as do the Government, that the Assembly
offers a better future for Northern Ireland. Now, through the Bill, we
are in a position to take forward the possible next stages of
devolution in Northern Ireland by devolving criminal justice and
policing.</p><p><a name="060517111000555">Given
what has been said today, no one fails to accept that there are still
major hurdles to overcome and that work must be done, not least to get
the proper Executive-led Assembly back in place by November.
Additionally, difficulties are self-evident to anyone who has been
involved in our debates on the possible devolution of criminal justice
and policing. However, the Bill sets a clear path before the House:
devolution in October or November&#151;I hope&#151;at the very
latest with the Executive back in place. At some point in the future,
we will have the framework and opportunity for the devolution of
criminal justice and policing. For the sake of having the discussion
again, the famous triple&#151;or perhaps now even
quadruple&#151;lock is in place whereby the Assembly, the Secretary
of State and the Government must agree with the House of Commons if
such devolution is to take place. In all essence, however, the
framework is in
place.</p><p><a name="060517111000556">The framework
is in place because, hopefully, no one can deny that there is progress
towards a political 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1091</b><br>solution in Northern Ireland, however slow that might seem. The latest
IMC report of 26 April states that the Provisional IRA leadership is
committed to a peaceful path. There is work to be done and efforts to
be undertaken, but we must realise that there is movement and that
Northern Ireland today is unrecognisable from how it was at the height
of the troubles in recent
years.</p><p><a name="060517111000557">The
Bill makes progress on the devolution of policing and criminal justice,
but it does much more than that. It takes forward the modernisation of
our electoral system so that we will be brought in line, over a staged
period, with the rest of the United Kingdom&#146;s electoral law on
political party funding. It also modernises the electoral canvass and
allows for the appointment and operation of the chief electoral
officer. Again, it does so to put Northern Ireland in a fair frame of
progress towards proper elections and electoral
law.</p><p><a name="060517111000558">The
Bill also provides for an extension to the order-making power under the
Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 to facilitate the
continued decommissioning of loyalist weapons. That issue has been a
major bone of contention today, but I will press, along with hon.
Members on both sides of the House, especially the hon. Member for
North Down(Lady Hermon) and DUP Members, for the
decommissioning of loyalist weapons. The Bill puts in place a framework
to give us extra time, should we need
it.</p><p><a name="060517111000559">The
Bill will also make important contributions to the existing criminal
justice and policing regimes in Northern Ireland. It will give
investigators and prosecutors new powers to tackle serious and
organised crime. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is new to his
position, will be taking forward those measures in due course to ensure
that we do what we say we will do, namely, crack down on organised
crime and criminality in Northern Ireland. We will continue to take the
effective steps that have been seen over the past few weeks to tackle
the cross-border smuggling of petrol and cigarettes, and other
problems.</p><p><a name="060517111000560">An
issue close to the heart of the hon. Member for North Down is central
to the Bill. The Bill provides corporation sole status to the office of
the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I gave
her an assurance that we would do that when we were considering the
on-the-runs legislation in Committee and, following her
representations, we have done so. We have responded to her concerns,
so&#151;dare I say?&#151;the Government have listened. We have also
responded to other points that members of that Committee raised, albeit
not all of
them.</p>

<a name="060517111000676"><p>There
are several other key aspects of the Bill that we should consider. Only
today I moved a new clause on sustainable development, which is now
part of the Bill, to ensure that we protect our environment for our
children and grandchildren. We have introduced important measures to
safeguard the future of the environment and are giving legal status to
the&#163;59 million investment that my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State has brought forward to support 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1092</b><br>sustainable development. That means, in real life, that we can use the
&#163;59 million to do important things for the people of Northern
Ireland. That includes putting solar panels&#151;this is part of my
political domain&#151;in new social build housing, with 600 panels
this year and 600 next year, to help the environment. Those are the
challenges on improving our
environment.</p><p><a name="060517111000561">The
Bill also contains key provisions for a single wholesale electricity
market, with opportunities for new investment, new efficiencies, new
economies of scale and security of supply&#151;the things that matter
to the people on the island of Ireland as a whole, both north and south
of the border. It is a pragmatic approach, welcomed by all hon.
Members, to support the economic well-being of Northern Ireland in the
future. The Bill achieves what it set out to achieve&#151;it helps us
to make progress on the devolution of policing; it modernises our
election law; it provides support for sustainable development; and it
looks at giving extra support to tackling crime. It is a good
Bill.</p><p><a name="060517111000562">On behalf of
the ministerial team, I want to thank the many officials from the
Northern Ireland Office and the devolved Executive, reporting to direct
rule Ministers, for the time and effort that they put in over many
weeks, months and, in some cases, years, to bring the clauses to
fruition. A tremendous amount of work went on behind the scenes. As a
Minister, it is important that I recognise
that.</p><p><a name="060517111000563">The Bill will
add to the value of Northern Ireland and add strength to devolution. I
commend it to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517111000705">6.26
pm</h5><p><a name="060517111000564"><b><a name="060517111001206">Mr.
Laurence Robertson:</b> By and large, we welcome the Bill,
although we have tried to improve it in various ways. I thank the
Minister for the way in which he introduced it and took it through
Committee. It has been possible to explore it in great detail, and he
was always willing to take interventions. It does credit to the House
that we have analysed it in that way, in particular on the Floor of the
House, which has been useful in
part.</p><p><a name="060517111000565">We have some
concerns. We were worried about abolishing the annual canvass and tried
to put a time scale on that so that there would be canvasses in 2015 at
the latest and every 10 years after that. We were also a little
concerned about the ability of the chief electoral officer, working
with the Secretary of State, to cancel those canvasses, but we are
where we are and we recognise the need to modernise the system. The
important thing is that we have a full register of electors in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517111000566">We were a
bit concerned about the donations for political purposes, although we
did not touch on that greatly. We would have liked a time limit on
donations from the Republic of Ireland, but the Government turned that
down. I regret that. We tabled an amendment to address that, but sadly
we did not reach it because of the lack of time. However, those
donations remain a concern, for obvious
reasons.</p><p><a name="060517111000567">The biggest
issue covered by the Bill is the devolution of policing and justice.
Although we have no objection to that in principle, we have discussed
it at length and are worried that responsibility for it could fall into
the 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1093</b><br>wrong hands. I recognise that we have the double-double lock, the treble
lock or the quadruple lock&#151;or whatever it is&#151;and that the
Assembly does not have to accept responsibility for policing and
justice. However, whether policing and justice are devolved, the points
raised in connection with that are extremely important.
</p><p><a name="060517111000568">I spoke about my
experiences in South Armagh, but did not get a chance to expand on
those because of the 6 o&#146;clock deadline. When I visited it last
week&#151;I was pleased that the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee
also visited it last week, and that the Chairman confirmed that my
experiences were his&#151;it was stressed that there had been a huge
improvement in the area. However, it can by no means be considered
normal when the police cannot go out on their own. That is not
acceptable in any part of the United Kingdom. Whether certain people in
that area like it or not, it is part of the United Kingdom. One of the
most alarming things was that the police told me that the MP for that
area would not engage with them. That is unacceptable, especially when
that person is a Member of the Assembly, could become a Minister, and
could become the Minister with responsibility for the police. However,
at this point that person will not engage with them. Moving on from
that, we wanted to try to make it a little more secure that people
holding office in Northern Ireland actually supported the rule of
law.</p><p><a name="060517111000569">The hon. Member
for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) mentioned that when he did a television
programme and asked a Sinn Fein supporter whether they would report a
crime&#151;he gave as an example the crime of rape. If someone had
such knowledge and did not report it, they would not be upholding the
rule of law. It is not acceptable for such a person to sit in
government. It is unfortunate that the Minister did not accept our
amendments in that respect. We pressed them to the vote and did not
win, but we made the point. It was not a watertight measure, but it
would have moved the situation in the right direction.</p><p><a name="060517111000570">Again, we have not discussed
the electricity market in great detail on the Floor of the House,
although we discussed it upstairs. My understanding&#151;this is not
a criticism; it has been a good start&#151;is that the Bill does not
create the wholesale electricity market, as it is headlined in the
Bill. According to the discussions I have had with the authorities in
Northern Ireland, it will provide the ability to coordinate the
regulation of the market in Northern Ireland with the regulation of the
market in the Republic of Ireland. That may be a useful step but, in
order for consumers in Northern Ireland to get the full benefit of
that, they need to go further and to have a true market covering the
whole of Ireland and, indeed, possibly the whole of Ireland and the
United Kingdom. A bigger market, especially if they can move towards a
freer market, will lead to lower electricity prices.</p><p><a name="060517111000571">I welcome the possibility of
financial assistance for energy purposes, which is in clause 23,
especially renewable energy. It is important that we develop renewable
energy, first, because it is renewable and helps to reduce emissions of
poisonous gases, and secondly, because it would provide security of
supply. We have seen throughout the world a rather unsettled market in
primary sources of energy. If we look at what 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1094</b><br>is happening in certain areas of South America and at the behaviour of
Russia on one or two occasions, it is clear that we need a more secure
energy supply in this country.</p><p><a name="060517111000572">I pay tribute to the answer
that the Prime Minister gave during Prime Minister's questions today.
He gave a balanced and positive view of energy policy. I hope that he
has the courage to pursue that policy against the opposition of certain
members of his own party. It is important that he does so. I give a
word of warning on clause 23. In Great Britain, we have not developed
renewable energy as well as we should. It still provides a very small
percentage of the electricity that we use. If we are going to pursue
that in Northern Ireland, we need to do more not only on energy
conservation, but on the development of renewable energy. It is not
being developed in this country quickly enough. I hope that we can use
the Bill to study why that has not been the case and to move on
renewable energy a little more quickly in Northern Ireland than we have
in Great Britain.</p><a name="060517111000677"><p>I have made just a few
observations; perhaps other hon. Members want to contribute. By and
large, we welcome the Bill. There are not many of my colleagues here
tonight, but they have contributed a great deal in Committee,
particularly the Chairman of the Select Committee. I thank them for
their help and support during the passage of the
Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517111000706">6.35
pm</h5><p><a name="060517111000573"><b><a name="060517111001207">Mr.
McGrady:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on
Third Reading. Generally, my party welcomes the Bill, which is more
miscellaneous than most of us expected. The Minister said that he has
achieved what he set out to achieve, and that seems to have been his
attitude every time that he saw a new draft or provision. None the
less, the Bill usefully deals with the multitude of issues mentioned by
the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). Some of its provisions
are essential, some are useful and some are convenient but, none the
less, they all contribute to the whole.</p><p><a name="060517111000574">On behalf of
my party, may I pay tribute to Ministers who have moved on from the
Northern Ireland Office, hopefully to greater things as a result of the
fine training that we gave them and the multi-faceted experience that
they gained? May I welcome to the Front Bench the new Ministers with
whom we hope to do good business in the months ahead? The Bill is
interesting, as it does not have a central theme and changes gear in
each part. I was disappointed that we did not manage to debate some of
our new clauses because of the 6 o&#146;clock deadline. That is
especially true of the new clause that deals with the powers of the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Notwithstanding the lack of
debate, perhaps the Minister can take on board our efforts to give the
commission powers that are available to other human rights commissions,
especially in the south of Ireland, so that it can act in accordance
with European Union requirements on human rights. The Northern Ireland
Human Rights Commission does not have investigatory powers to pursue
people and papers.</p><p><a name="060517111000575"><b><a name="060517111001208">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Given that we failed to reach new clause 9, may I
give my hon. Friend an assurance that we seek to implement the results
of our consultation on 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1095</b><br>the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consultation at an appropriate time?
His proposal may not have found favour today, but its broad principles
should receive Government support in
future.</p><p><a name="060517111000576"><b><a name="060517111001209">Mr.
McGrady:</b> I thank the Minister for giving an undertaking,
on the record, to pursue the matter with more urgency. I recall that
the issue was to be examined six years ago.</p><p><a name="060517111000577"><b><a name="060517111001210">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have been lenient with the hon.
Gentleman, who has received more than he expected. We are now debating
the contents of the Bill.
</p><p><a name="060517111000578"><b><a name="060517111001211">Mr.
McGrady:</b> Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. There is no harm
in making the attempt, but I accept your rap on the knuckles.</p><a name="060517111000678"><p>I
thank the Minister not just for his intervention, but for the
commitments, undertakings and reviews that he has promised in the
months ahead. The atmosphere in Committee and throughout proceedings on
the Bill is indicative of a new understanding or tolerance across the
Floor of the House. I experienced it, too, when we debated the Northern
Ireland Act 2006. A clear understanding of the needs and requirements
of the two communities in Northern Ireland was given positive
expression, and I hope that that will be translated substantively and
directly to the new Assembly, which was reconvened on Monday and
Tuesday this week. I am sure that it is appropriate to say in the House
that we wish the Assembly a fair wind in dealing with the many
difficult problems that it faces to enable people to move from
entrenched positions so that they can accommodate one another. The
contents of this and other Bills will assist that process. Hopefully,
this will the last such Bill to come before the House, because all the
matters that it covers, with the exception of reserved matters, will be
dealt with by an Executive of the Northern Ireland parties on behalf of
the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517111000579"><b><a name="060517111001212">Mr.
Donaldson:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments
about the new Assembly. I also welcome the participation of the SDLP in
the proceedings of the Assembly earlier this week. Will the hon.
Gentleman join me in expressing regret that one party&#151;Sinn
Fein&#151;which absents itself from this House, was also absent on
Tuesday from the debate on the economy? Is it not time that it ended
its
abstentionism?</p><p><a name="060517111000580"><b><a name="060517111001213">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I remind the hon. Member for South
Down (Mr. McGrady) again that we are discussing precisely the contents
of the Bill
today.</p><p><a name="060517111000581"><b><a name="060517111001214">Mr.
McGrady:</b> Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That saves me
thinking of a suitable response to the last intervention. I shall
simply say, &#147;Noted and
agreed.&#148;</p><p><a name="060517111000582">Some
of the comments made on Report disturbed me. It seemed as though
certain parties were flagging up new preconditions for the effective
devolution of policing and justice. Without going into detail because
of the time factor, I urge the Government to do all in their power not
to fall into the trap that they have 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1096</b><br>fallen into repeatedly with demands from Sinn Fein and, with respect,
demands from the Democratic Unionist party, which are preconditions to
further progress. The whole thrust and ethos of making progress in
Northern Ireland is that no party has a veto on progress over other
parties. That has been neglected or severely damaged in the past two or
three years.</p><p><a name="060517111000583">Even
today, a certain precondition seemed to be imposed by the DUP, which
sounded to me like an everlasting ban on Sinn Fein being accepted into
government. That sounded a negative note&#151;the only negative note.
I know the concerns that DUP Members have, because I have exactly the
same concerns. We cannot have people in government who do not fully,
honestly and openly support law and order. However, that should not be
used in a dramatic way in terms of the purity of the
situation.</p><p><a name="060517111000584">It is
difficult when one is dealing with human relationships and things
evolve and change daily. We should not box ourselves into
preconditions. For instance, the Government allowed Sinn Fein to say
that it would not join the Policing Board until the DUP agreed to the
devolution of policing and justice. That is a crazy situation, in which
we should not allow ourselves to be involved. We need openness to
achieve progress in Northern Ireland. The Bill, with its various
provisions covering elections, funding, donations and the matters that
we discussed today regarding policing and justice, will contribute to a
healthy debate in Northern Ireland. I hope that we can translate the
very good atmosphere in the House today to the Floor of the Assembly.
If we do, the hope of achieving full, lasting and proper devolution to
Northern Ireland will be greatly
enhanced.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517111000707">6.43
pm</h5><p><a name="060517111000585"><b><a name="060517111001215">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> When I think of the range of the
Bill&#151;sustainable development, policing and justice, criminal
damage, registration of electors, children, commitment to the rule of
law, powers of the Human Rights Commission, primacy in intelligence
gathering, donations to political parties and so on&#151;it is
amazing that it is possible to be out of order on any of the subjects
that we have covered, but we have even achieved
that.</p><p><a name="060517111000586">I noted the
Minister&#146;s praise of his team. He has made some terrible
mistakes by not listening more to the sage advice offered to him by
Opposition parties. I know from personal experience how wonderful the
Northern Ireland Office team is, and no doubt it supports him superbly.
I am sure that they agree that the Minister should have taken on some
of our amendments, given their fine judgments on these
matters.</p><p><a name="060517111000587">The
Minister has shown some signs of listening in the past few hours. If in
some small way we have opened his ears to be more inclusive in his
politics with regard to Northern Ireland, then the debate on Report and
Third Reading will have been worthwhile.</p><p><a name="060517111000588">The hon. Member for Tewkesbury
(Mr. Robertson) highlighted some issues about which he is concerned. I
broadly agree with him and share the same concerns, which I do not need
to repeat.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1097</b><br><p><a name="060517111000589">I remain concerned that there
is a weakness in the 50:50:50 process in securing cross-community
support, and I am worried that that will once again get in the way in
the months ahead. I hope that the Minister will at least take on board
and consider our points on that
matter.</p><p><a name="060517111000590">I am also
concerned about the census. We have made a mistake by allowing such a
preposterously long period in keeping the census up to date. All the
good work and the enormous investment of time and money which has been
carried out to make sure that we have the most accurate electoral
register in the United Kingdom will fade away because of the length of
time between electoral censuses. Once again, I hope that the Minister
will reflect on that point, and if my rather gloomy prediction turns
out to be right, perhaps the Government will revisit the enormously
long period between censuses.</p><p><a name="060517111000591">Finally, I recently saw a fine
show in Majorca called, &#147;Pirates&#148;&#151;I attended to
help raise money for Great Ormond Street hospital. As I watched the
show, I thought about how this Government plunder the goodwill of
Northern Ireland politicians&#151;some of us have covered this
particular portfolio for almost a decade. They have stolen money from
students by introducing a truly unpopular method of student support,
and they have also threatened the Northern Irish people with enormous
hikes in their utility bills in order to undo damage which was not
caused by the citizens themselves.</p><p><a name="060517111000592">If the politicians of Northern
Ireland use this Bill and other legislation as a spur to restart the
Stormont Assembly, then Northern Ireland will not have to endure the
injustices which are endlessly meted out to them by the Government as a
whole rather than by this particular
Minister.</p><p><a name="060517111000593"><b><a name="060517111001216">Mr.

be no hiding place if the Assembly is re-established. I respectfully
point out once again that there is a powerful incentive for Northern
Ireland politicians to regard this Bill, which will soon be enacted,
and other legislation, as an opportunity to provide a firewall between
the legislation that the Government will impose through Statutory
Instrument Committees and the alternative legislation that Northern
Ireland politicians are collectively likely to introduce in the
Assembly. As the Bill passes into law, I hope that the DUP and others
find it easier to work together, even with those parties that they
still distrust and unquestionably dislike, because it is surely in the
greater interests of the citizens whom they represent for those
differences to be managed and Northern Ireland politics to be
established on a devolutionary footing, which I hope and believe that
we all want to
see.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517111000708">6.49

for a long time. I have been castigated and kicked in this House,
treated as a leper, refused admittance to Downing street for two years
and six months, and so on and so forth, and I am still saying the same
thing. The Prime Minister said the same thing from the Front Bench. If
he wants to break his word to the people of Northern Ireland, we will
not be breaking our word to the people who have voted for us.</p><p><a name="060517111000599">We are in great difficulties
because on Monday and Tuesday we discovered that the Ulster Unionist
party had entered into an agreement with the Progressive Unionist
party. Any Minister of this Government who is prepared to defend the
PUP has only to read what the report that Government Ministers love to
read&#151;the Independent Monitoring Commission report&#151;has
said about it. All that I can say is that we have a tougher road to
travel, and we had better remember that. I hope that this House will
remember that, by passing this Bill without amendments that would have
been useful to us in the battle to keep to democracy, it is really
responsible for what

to say that I appreciate that the Government have made some amendments
that improve the Bill. Should the circumstances ever arise whereby
policing and justice powers can be devolved, my party, regardless of
what any other party does, believes in the primacy of the electoral
mandate. As a party, we are mandated to seek devolution for Northern
Ireland. We want that 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1099</b><br>devolution to be stable, accountable, effective and efficient. Those
were the principles that we enunciated for many years. I believe that
we have moved towards that, making some progress along the way, but
barriers still remain. The principal barrier has been Sinn Fein and its
relationship with the IRA, to which it is inextricably linked. As a
party that was entitled to be in government under existing legislation,
it was clearly necessary that it met the standards of democracy, that
it decommissioned all its weapons, and that it ensured that there was a
complete and unalterable end to all of its paramilitary and criminal
activity.</p><p><a name="060517111000606">Those are
all essentials for government. They are even more essential in relation
to the devolution of policing and justice suggested in the Bill. When
the last report by the Independent Monitoring Commission was published,
we said openly in this House that some progress had been made, but that
there were still grey areas and loose ends that needed to be addressed.
So I am sure that the Minister will accept that many of us were shocked
when a spanner was thrown into the works this week by the irrational
decision of the Ulster Unionist party to embrace the Progressive
Unionist party, whose members are the spokespersons for the
UVF.</p><p><a name="060517111000607">I knew
instinctively that the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) would
be opposed to that marriage, and that was confirmed during the debate.
The relationship undermines her, however, and I regret these
circumstances because there will now be a mountain to climb in regard
to devolution unless these matters can be undone. We will await the
ruling of the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly on this, but the
Speaker can rule in favour of the decision of the Ulster Unionist party
Assembly group only if she believes that that group is a separate
political party. The party&#146;s representatives indicated that they
had formed a new political party. That is what the Speaker was
instructed by the Ulster Unionist party&#146;s Assembly
representatives&#151;</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1100</b><br><p><a name="060517111000608"><b><a name="060517111001223">Mr.

he could make that clear.</p><p><a name="060517111000609"><b><a name="060517111001224">Mr.
Robinson:</b> The Bill covers a number of miscellaneous
matters relating to the government of Northern Ireland and matters that
will, in due course, be able to be devolved to the Government there.
Unfortunately, that Government is less likely to be formed because of
the situation that has developed in the Assembly. However, I want to
give Front-Benchers some time to wind up the debate.</p><p><a name="060517111000610">I will round
off my remarks by saying that this issue must be addressed, because the
conditions remain the same, whether we are talking about paramilitarism
from a Unionist background or a nationalist background. We are not
prepared to be in government with those who are linked to paramilitary
organisations. It would be ironic if, in the months or years ahead,
Sinn Fein and the republican movement were to be given a clean bill of
health and the Government could proceed, only for the Ulster Unionist
party to delay that process because of a relationship with a
paramilitary organisation. Those issues have to be dealt with; they
cannot be ducked.</p><p><a name="060517111000611">This relationship has
certainly not been formed for the altruistic purpose that the hon. Lady
was told by the leader of her party, who was no doubt squirming when he
said that the purpose was to try to take the UVF away from its
paramilitary activities. The purpose was self-serving: it was to try to
increase the number of Ministries that the Ulster Unionist party would
get. That has not worked, and it will not work. Indeed, my party would
have ensured that Sinn Fein would not have got a third Ministry. There
were at least four strategies to ensure that that would not happen. The
Ulster Unionist party was not robbing Sinn Fein of a Ministry. It
thought that it was robbing the DUP, but it will find out that it has
not.</p><p><a name="060517111000612"><i> Question put

Theresa May (Maidenhead) (Con):</b> I am grateful to the
Speaker for giving me this opportunity to raise in this Adjournment
debate the case of a daughter of a constituent. I want to speak about
the brutal murder of Rana Faruqui, the handling of that case by Thames
Valley police and the wider issues raised by it.</p><p><a name="060517111000626">In 2003, Rana Faruqui was a
bright, attractive, lively 35-year-old working in IT as a business
analyst. At work, she met Stephen Griffiths. A relationship started.
Stephen Griffiths moved into her home. Several incidents of domestic
violence followed, the relationship faltered, and Stephen Griffiths
left her home. After he left her home, several incidents of him
stalking Rana Faruqui took place. On 21 July, Rana Faruqui reported by
telephone to Thames Valley police that the brake pipes on her car had
been cut. Three days later, on 24 July 2003, she went physically to
Slough police station and spoke to the police about the fact that those
brake pipes had been cut. That report passed from inbox to inbox, and
from officer to officer, for 10 whole days. On Saturday 2 August 2003,
Stephen Griffiths stabbed and brutally murdered Rana Faruqui.
</p><p><a name="060517111000627">I have absolutely no
doubt that Thames Valley police failed Rana. They should have taken the
issue of the cutting of the brake pipes more seriously. Sadly,
Rana&#146;s family, having had to face the tragedy of her brutal
murder, are left with the feeling that had Thames Valley police acted
differently, she might be alive
today.</p><p><a name="060517111000628">I am very
conscious that there has been a full investigation of the case by
Thames Valley police, and that a misconduct hearing in relation to one
senior officer is still due to take place. Despite parliamentary
privilege I do not intend to name any individual officers, but I hope
the Minister will agree that the bare facts that I have outlined raise
a degree of concern about the handling of the issue by Thames Valley
police. They raise wider issues as well, however, and it is on those
that I wish to
concentrate.</p><p><a name="060517111000629">When
Rana Faruqui&#146;s mother Carol came to see me with other members of
her family, she was obviously distressed at what had happened to her
daughter and at the suffering that the family had experienced following
Rana&#146;s death, but she was also anxious to ensure that other
families were not put through the same distress. She wanted to try to
ensure that issues of domestic violence, and particularly of stalking,
were taken more seriously by Thames Valley police, and that any lessons
from the case were learnt not only by them but by police forces across
the country.</p>

<p><a name="060517111000630">I am
grateful to the acting chief constable of Thames Valley police, Sara
Thornton, for giving me information about what the force has done
following the case. She has not only written to me, but taken the time
and trouble to speak to me about it. As a result of my conversation
with her, I hope to be able to visit one of the domestic violence units
in the Thames Valley area. However, as I have said, I have absolutely
no doubt that Rana was failed by Thames Valley police. 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1104</b><br>That raises a number of issues about the approach that the force takes
to domestic violence, and the attitude of officers to such
violence.</p><p><a name="060517111000631">In 2004-05,
there were 14,793 cases of domestic violence in the Thames Valley area.
That is an increase of about 15 per cent. on the number of cases in
2003-04. I am aware that since then the Government have introduced a
Bill to deal with domestic violence, and that more recently the Home
Office has issued guidance to police forces on the handling of domestic
violence cases. The acting chief constable tells me that Thames Valley
police has adopted a rather more rigorous approach of risk
assessment</p><a name="060517111000698"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in all
domestic violence or &#145;stalker&#146; type
cases&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000632">which
are now</p><a name="060517111000699"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reviewed and
reassessed by specialist Domestic Violence
Officers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000633">Investigation
management is subject to strict
timetables.</p><a name="060517111000700"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Cases
which fall within the risk assessment process are given added scrutiny
in respect of &#145;follow-up&#146; with the emphasis being on
early intervention and positive
action&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000634">That is what is
happening now, of course; it was not in operation when Rana Faruqui
reported those incidents to the
police.</p><p><a name="060517111000635">It is
important to stress that, by all accounts, Rana was not a shrinking
violet who did not know what to do, and did not take action when the
incidents happened. She did report them to the police. We all know that
many cases of domestic violence are not reported to the police, but she
did report those incidents, and the stalking incidents. I think she
rightly expected appropriate action to be taken, but sadly it was
not.</p><p><a name="060517111000636">Despite the
action that has now been taken by Thames Valley police, the case raises
several issues. The first is the general attitude of the police to such
cases. I want to separate the issues of domestic violence and stalking.
As I have said, the Government have taken action on domestic violence
issues through their Bill and the guidance that they have now issued to
police forces, but I am not convinced that as much emphasis has been
placed on the stalking issue, which I believe should be taken very
seriously. I suspect and fear that a number of such incidents are not
taken as seriously as they should be. In some cases, the
police&#146;s attitude may well be, &#147;It&#146;s just somebody
who has broken up with her boyfriend, does not want him around and has
rung the police to try to get rid of him&#148;, but in many others,
that is not what is happening.</p><p><a name="060517111000637">There are
individuals out there like Stephen Griffiths. It subsequently emerged
that although he could at times be very charming, he was also very
manipulative and had had a number of broken relationships before he met
Rana&#151;relationships in which domestic violence incidents had
occurred. So a pattern was being repeated but sadly, there was no
evidence: no reporting of that pattern on which Thames Valley police
could draw in assessing that case.</p><p><a name="060517111000638">I have some questions for the
Minister concerning the seriousness with which stalking is being
addressed. Have the Government issued any guidance on dealing with
stalking? What is the attitude taken by junior officers, in particular,
when they first encounter such incidents? When a junior officer first
deals with a 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1105</b><br>reported stalking incident, it is crucial that they take it seriously.
As I said earlier, Thames Valley police told me about the various steps
that they have taken in dealing with domestic violence, such as risk
assessment and the use of specialist domestic violence officers, but
they kick in only if the initial report is taken seriously and treated
seriously.</p><p><a name="060517111000639">That leads
me to the very real issue of the training our police officers, their
understanding of such incidents and their recognition&#151;or
not&#151;of their seriousness. I realise that the 14,793 domestic
violence incidents that Thames Valley police had to deal with in
2004-05 is a large number. But in each case where it was shown that
such violence had indeed taken place, there was a victim and someone
who had acted in a criminal way against them. The police must take a
serious approach to such cases.</p><p><a name="060517111000640">I want to
ask the Minister about the training of police officers in dealing with
stalking. Stalking hits the headlines when it happens to a celebrity
and such cases have been reported to the police, but it does not happen
just to celebrities. Rana Faruqui was not a celebrity, but she was
stalked by Stephen Griffiths, and with tragic consequences. What are
the police doing to ensure that sufficient training is given to
officers, so that they understand the seriousness of such offences and
behaviour, and that they recognise it and report it appropriately? They
need to ensure that the action that has so far been taken can kick in,
that proper risk-assessment takes place, and that officers put the
emphasis on early intervention, in order to ensure that the tragic
consequences of Rana&#146;s case are not repeated.</p><p><a name="060517111000641">I want also to ask about
guidance from the Home Office itself and from the Association of Chief
Police Officers. I hope that the lessons that the Thames Valley police
have learned following this incident will be shared with other forces
throughout the country. One problem that we in this country have is
that police forces often do not share information with each other in an
effort to deal with such issues. There is no lack of good intent in
that regard: it just happens; there is no culture of sharing
information. I have always been of the view that if someone finds a
good way of dealing with a problem, they should share it, because doing
so is to the benefit of everybody. So there are lessons to be learned,
and they should be shared with other forces.</p><p><a name="060517111000642">Is the Home Office doing
enough to deal with stalking? Is it introducing guidance and proper
measures at police-force level? As I said earlier, Rana&#146;s mother
and the rest of her family are very keen that others should not have to
go through the suffering that they have gone through, purely because no
lessons are learned and no action is taken by Thames Valley or other
forces. They have not just sat around or even just talked to me about
it. Rana&#146;s sister went over to the US to investigate the action
taken there, and she sent me an interesting set of papers about San
Diego county, which has established a stalking strike force, a
multi-disciplinary approach to the issue. An article by Wayne Maxey, a
criminal investigator affiliated with the stalking unit of the San
Diego&#146;s district attorney&#146;s office, describes it
as</p><a name="060517111000701"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
multi-disciplinary approach...one in which both criminal justice
and mental health approaches come together to address the
problem.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1106</b><br><p><a name="060517111000643">The Americans find that approach most
effective. The article
continues:</p><a name="060517111000702"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Strike Force strive to evaluate carefully each case and develop
effective case management
strategies.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000644">I have here
copies of security recommendations for stalking victims and the
stalking strike force victim handbook&#151;the information that is
given to victims of stalking on what they can do to help to ensure
their safety. The evidence from the strike force suggests the need for
early intervention, to identify where there is a serious risk and to
take appropriate action.</p><p><a name="060517111000645">I am happy to share the
information with the Minister. I would also be happy to meet him and
share further details of the case that I am not able to share with him
in the time available tonight. Rana Faruqui was brutally murdered,
despite the fact that she had reported the incidents of stalking
and&#151;crucially, in my view&#151;the cutting of the brake cables
of her car to the police. Thames Valley did nothing about that report
for 10 days, at the end of which she was dead. Thames Valley police
failed Rana, and I want to ensure that nobody else is failed in that
way, by Thames Valley or other forces; that the lessons from this case
are learned by others; and that the police take cases of domestic
violence and, crucially, stalking seriously. Such cases must not be
dismissed as women reporting things that have not taken place or trying
to get rid of a boyfriend who is being a bit difficult. When someone
goes to the police, they must be treated properly and seriously. The
police must recognise the danger that can ensue and take action
accordingly. We owe it to Rana and her family to ensure that the
lessons are
learned.</p><p><a name="060517111000646"><b><a name="060517111001231">Mr.

Sweeping changes in case handling have been made across the criminal
justice system, including in the police, the Crown Prosecution Service
and the courts. Those changes will aid victims and help to prevent
cases such as those in the Thames Valley area and beyond. The plan also
highlights action to ensure the early identification of victims and
perpetrators. In addition, it offers focused support for victims and
the better management of
perpetrators.</p><p><a name="060517111000652">This
debate gives me an opportunity to say a few things. As a new Minister
at the Home Office, I was shocked when I was briefed on the scale of
the problem that we face. For instance, the House will be appalled to
learn the following: that, on average, two women a week are killed in
the UK by a male partner or former partner; that in 2003-04 nearly 40
per cent. of all female homicide victims were killed by their current
or ex-partner, compared with about 5 per cent. of male homicide
victims; that about one in four women and one in six men have been
victims of domestic violence since the age of 16, although women are
clearly likely to suffer greater injury and be classed as chronic
victims; that 89 per cent. of those suffering four or more attacks are
women, and that one incident is reported to the police every minute.
Moreover, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead noted, there were
more than 14,000 such incidents in the Thames Valley area in
2004-05.</p><p><a name="060517111000653">In addition
to the human suffering that is caused by domestic violence, the costs
to our economy are staggering. In 2001, domestic violence in England
and Wales was estimated to cost a total of &#163;23 billion, of which
&#163;3 billion was spent on public services and&#163;2.7
billion was absorbed by employers and workers. The cost of human and
emotional suffering was putat &#163;17 billion. In
addition, the criminal justice system spent &#163;1 billion on
domestic violence cases, and&#163;300 million was spent by
civil legal
services.</p><p><a name="060517111000654">In 90 per
cent. of incidents involving domestic violence, children are in the
same or the next room. Domestic violence also has worrying links to
pregnancy: 30 per cent. of domestic violence starts during pregnancy,
and existing violence often escalates. Domestic violence accounts for
17 per cent. of all violent crime in the UK. I am sure that the right
hon. Member for Maidenhead probably knows those facts better than I do,
but they are another reason why we should welcome the opportunity that
this debate gives us to state them in the House.</p><p><a name="060517111000655">Those statistics tell a
terrible story, as is highlighted by the case at the heart of this
debate, but that story is made far worse when we realise that behind
each 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1108</b><br>statistic is a life, and often many lives. Those lives are damaged and
sometimes destroyed by the cruel and barbaric acts that are
committed&#151;and as a man I have to say this&#151;mainly by men.
I recognise that men and same-sex couples also experience domestic
violence, but women are far more likely to experience physical or
sexual violence at the hands of
men.</p><p><a name="060517111000656">However, I wish
to reassure the House that the Government are facing up to our
responsibilities, and I should like to outline some of the major steps
that we are taking to respond to this most insidious of crimes in all
parts of the country, including in the Thames Valley area. The
Government take domestic violence very seriously, and that is why we
have set up the inter-ministerial group on domestic violence. It is
chaired by Baroness Scotland, and draws ministerial membership from
across all the major Government Departments. The group performance
manages the delivery plan and monitors its progress
quarterly.</p><p><a name="060517111000657">As the
right hon. Member for Maidenhead noted, we passed the Domestic
Violence, Crime and VictimsAct 2004 in November of that year.
The biggest overhaul of domestic violence legislation for 30 years,
that Act gives tough new powers to the police and the courts to tackle
offenders, while ensuring that victims get the support and protection
that they need. We hope that that protection will help people across
the country, including in the Thames Valley
area.</p><p><a name="060517111000658">The 2004 Act
gives greater protection to victims and children, and encourages them
to stand up for their right to live without fear of violence. The
measures that it contains have been rolling out in stages since March
2005.</p><p><a name="060517111000659">I turn now to
the specific concerns about Thames Valley police expressed by the right
hon. Member for Maidenhead. I should like to reassure the House that
that force have initiated a fundamental overhaul of their policies and
procedures in response to domestic violence cases. The Thames Valley
police domestic violence project is nearing completion; the main
changes have been implemented and the force is consolidating the
improvements in its routine business. After some of the awful things
that we have seen and that the right hon. Lady has highlighted, I hope
that lessons have been learned and I trust that such initiatives offer
some comfort and
reassurance.</p><p><a name="060517111000660">The
improvements include the establishment of public protection units
throughout Thames Valley police. Those specialist units focus on
protecting communities from the most dangerous offenders and provide
expertise in cases involving the most vulnerable members of our
society. The force&#146;s existing domestic violence units have been
incorporated in the public protection units and augmented with
additional investment and resources. Specialist domestic violence
officers now review all domestic violence
incidents.</p><p><a name="060517111000661">A
comprehensive structured risk assessment process has been implemented.
All operational officers have received training in identifying domestic
violence cases and in the use of the risk indicator tool to assist
their investigation and management of the case. Every case is assessed
by a specialist domestic violence unit officer to ensure that high-risk
cases are identified early&#151;a point made by the right hon.
Lady&#151;and given added priority and resources.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1109</b><br><p><a name="060517111000662">We need to ensure that action
on stalking is included in those procedures. The right hon. Lady asked
about guidance in such cases. The Association of Chief Police Officers
has issued police forces with guidance on harassment, which includes
stalking, so the hon. Lady can be reassured about that
issue.</p><p><a name="060517111000663">The
changes in the Thames Valley force are part of a much wider overhaul
that has been instigated in all police forces. In November 2004, ACPO
issued comprehensive guidance to all forces in England and Wales,
including Thames Valley, about the investigation of domestic violence
cases, including Thames Valley. The accompanying training programme
covers identification and flagging of cases of domestic violence by the
police; officer response at the scene of the incident to protect
victims and to gather evidence; managing the investigation and building
a prosecution case; protecting the victim as the case progresses
through the criminal justice system and how to engage effectively in
multi-agency working. I was most interested in the information from
America provided by a relative of the family about multi-agency
working. Perhaps the right hon. Lady and I could discuss that further
when we meet. The police alone cannot tackle domestic violence; it
requires a partnership response, although I am very aware that turning
those words into reality is something else
again.</p><p><a name="060517111000664"><b><a name="060517111001233">Mrs.
May:</b> Before I comment on that point, I apologise to the
Minister for not welcoming him to his new post in the Home
Office.</p><p><a name="060517111000665">The San Diego
experience is one of the interesting points that I should like to
discuss with the Minister. The scheme was set up on a voluntary basis
and has managed to get around many of the administrative barriers that
can get in the way of a multi-agency approach, which then fails to
operate properly, as the Minister
said.</p><p><a name="060517111000666"><b><a name="060517111001234">Mr.
Coaker:</b> I thank the right hon. Lady for her welcome. We
can certainly discuss the issue she raises. I am well aware that
bureaucracy sometimes gets in the way of service delivery and in cases
such as these we need to make sure that what we say in an office
translates into reality on the ground for people who suffer, or may
suffer, domestic
violence.</p><p><a name="060517111000667">The
training programme that I outlined is a major initiative in each police
force area, including Thames Valley, and a target has been set to
ensure that every operational officer in every police force in England
and Wales will be a graduate of the programme by 2008. To complement
it, every new recruit in every force will be trained about domestic
violence as part of their mandatory training, as they have been since
April 2005. Again, Thames Valley is obviously included in that 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1110</b><br>programme. Such training is crucial to changing the
culture&#151;changing awareness and attitudes. All those things are
important and will take longer than a training programme, but the
programme is vital none the
less.</p><p><a name="060517111000668">I welcome the
fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) is
present in the Chamber. She has also taken a keen interest in these
matters, including when she was a Home Office Minister, and we are
building on much of the work in which she was
involved.</p><p><a name="060517111000669">Every
police force in England and Wales now also has a domestic violence
co-ordinator&#151;so the Thames Valley police will have such a
co-ordinator as well. That illustrates the fact that the Government and
the police recognise that domestic violence is a serious crime that
needs to be policed rigorously and effectively, but our commitment to
tackling domestic violence does not stop there. To ensure that we
capitalise on the improved policing policy, the Crown Prosecution
Service has also created a domestic violence training pack for all its
prosecutors. It, too, has set a target of having all prosecutors
trained on the programme by 2008 and every CPS area, including Thames
Valley, now has a domestic violence
co-ordinator.</p><p><a name="060517111000670">Last
year, to strengthen the role of the criminal justice system further,
the Government announced the development of 25 specialist domestic
violence court systems, which will be in place by April 2006&#151;so
they are obviously just in place. There will now be at least one
specialist domestic violence court area in every region of the
country&#151;obviously, including the Thames valley. In this context,
specialist courts are not just about the practice of courts and their
procedures; neither are they about tangible changes being made to
existing courthouses: it is an approach that situates the court system
and the criminal justice system as part of a community-wide response to
domestic violence. Clearly, such arrangements may cover parts of the
Thames Valley area.</p><p><a name="060517111000671">I
congratulate the right hon. Member for Maidenhead on initiating the
debate. I am very happy to meet her to discuss what is clearly an issue
of importance not just in the Thames Valley area but in the whole
country and something about which we, as country, need to do more. This
was a terrible case; we must learn the lessons from it. Thames Valley
police, as well as all other forces, have reviewed their procedures,
and we must all hope that, in so far as possible, such tragedies are
avoided in the future. I thank the right hon. Lady again for raising
the issue; I am sure that we all need to do something more about
it.</p><p><a name="060517111000672"><i> The motion
