</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60419-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 The Government&#039;s plans are based on targets to reduce the number of accidental deaths from fire in the home by 20 per cent. and incidents of arson by 10 per cent. by 2010. Fire prevention was made a statutory duty for all fire authorities, as part of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. I am pleased to advise the House that last year&#039;s figures for deaths showed a 45-year low. The fire service is to be commended for the recent reductions and encouraged to continue making our communities safer, year on year.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer, but will he specifically consider the issues around Cheshire? He will be aware that my constituents take fire safety very seriously, for reasons of the proximity of the petrochemical industry. Will he help my constituents by putting into perspective what he says about the national picture by including Cheshire? Can he describe how successful Cheshire has been in achieving those goals?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60419-01_spnew1"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend suggests, modernising the fire service is a challenging task. Cheshire fire and rescue service, led by Chief Fire Officer Steve McGuirk, has been at the forefront of many positive, new initiatives, which include supporting our programme of home fire risk visits for the most vulnerable, installing some 10,000 free smoke alarms and pioneering innovative working with young people, including young offenders, as well as dealing with the industrial risk pertinent to the locality.

<a name="stpa_o0">The Minister will know that three schools a day suffer fire damage in this country. Most of those fires involve arson and most are started by pupils. The increasing number of them started in school time are putting more children&#039;s lives at risk. Will the Minister now require all new and extended schools to have a sprinkler system installed to safeguard against that risk?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60419-01_spnew3"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 The Department is very well aware of the increasing risk to schools from arson and accidental fires. Using building regulations approved document B, we have been consulting on the installation of sprinklers generally. The Department for Education and Skills is in the lead in considering building bulletin 100 and a revision of the provision of sprinklers in schools. Its consultation will conclude later this year, and we are looking forward to that to find out whether we can move forward on this very important issue.

 (Lab): Retained firefighters play a very valuable role in the fire and safety service, particularly in rural areas. Will the Minister consider ways in which retained firefighters could play a much stronger role in fire prevention, as well as in firefighting?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60419-01_spnew5"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Retained firefighters cover some 35 per cent. of the United Kingdom. A retained firefighters working party was set up by the Department and the Chief Fire Officers Association last year. There were 51 recommendations, as I think that she is aware, on how the retained fire service can participate better in community fire safety, as well as on improving the position of retained firefighters. That review is being examined. The recommendations are being taken forward, and I am sure that they will improve the lot of the retained fire service and its ability to contribute to fire safety in general.

<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60419-01_spnew7"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I believe that I have probably written to the hon. Gentleman directly, and he may recall that I said in my correspondence that the quote that the Fire Brigades Union is using is taken out of context from an analysis of an initial examination of the regional fire control project. We are fully supportive of the regional control project. We believe that the FBU&#039;s misgivings are badly placed. The first three control rooms are under construction.

 (Con): May I also say how pleased I am to see you in the Chair, Mr. Speaker? The Minister may be aware of two recent serious arson attacks at schools in my local authority area, but far from being isolated cases, a report published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister last year admitted that the number of deliberate fires rose by 40 per cent. between 1998 and 2002. Why, then, have the Government cut their target for reducing the number of deliberate fires from 30 per cent. to just 10 per cent. by 2010? Is that not an admission of defeat?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60419-01_spnew9"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 On the contrary. The hon. Lady acknowledged that her statistics on arson attacks relate to 2002, but the latest figures from last year demonstrate that fewer than 100,000 arson attacks were committed&#151;26 per cent. below the 10 per cent. reduction target that we set for 2010. We have set ambitious but realistic targets to deal with arson right across the piece. It is a combined effort between ourselves and the Home Office through the arson taskforce and we are making good progress. In that regard, the fire and rescue service and local authorities should be commended.

<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60419-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 The Department is working closely with the Local Government Association on Gypsy and Traveller sites. I met the Local Government Association in February and September, and officials in the Gypsy and Traveller unit met the LGA earlier this month. We expect to continue regular discussions.

<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60419-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Does the Minister recall the Deputy Prime Minister saying that, when it comes to allocating Traveller sites and issuing enforcement proceedings against illegal Travellers, the views of local councils should prevail? Why does her Department often overrule local councils, particularly in the case of the Crays Hill site at Billericay? When it comes to a sensitive issues such as Traveller sites, surely the views of local people and local democracy should prevail.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60419-01_spnew11"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I cannot comment on individual cases. I hope that he would also recognise that if we are to deal with difficult problems relating to unauthorised sites, which cause huge distress for local communities, we must do so in a balanced and sensible way. That means providing more alternative appropriate sites to deal with the shortage and improving enforcement. We are working closely with local councils and the LGA across the country. We have already offered Basildon help to find alternative sites, but the council has to acknowledge some responsibility as well.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60419-01_spnew13"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We recognise that that is an important issue, which has also been raised by court cases. We will be looking further into the matter, but I have to say that our priority at the moment is ensuring an increase in the number of sites to address the shortage and improving enforcement on inappropriate sites.

 (Con): The Deputy Prime Minister told us that one of the criteria for deciding whether to evict illegal encampments at places such as Minety in my constituency is the degree to which proper provision has been made elsewhere in the country. By what mechanism can the county judge whether proper provision is being made, given that most of the Gypsies are coming in from Ireland, Poland and elsewhere? How can we judge the requirements and decide whether sufficient sites are being provided?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60419-01_spnew15"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 We think that local authorities need to carry out proper needs assessments for Gypsy and Traveller sites just as they do for housing accommodation more widely. We have set out detailed guidance for local authorities to help them to achieve that and I would be pleased to send a copy to the hon. Gentleman if he thinks it would be helpful. The problem of unauthorised sites and site shortages has increased since the Conservatives abolished the duty to provide sites in the first place.

 We would hope that local authorities would already be starting to work to identify appropriate sites. That is an important way of removing some of the pressures, tensions and the real difficulties that we see with unauthorised sites. We would hope that local authorities would do that through the planning process&#151;the issue is partly about identifying private sites as well as publicly provided sites&#151;that is under way at the moment. I am happy to give my hon. Friend further details of the planning timetables in his area.

<a name="stpa_o1">Partners in north Staffordshire have made good progress on achieving closer integration between the regeneration work undertaken by the renewal pathfinder and the regeneration zone. To date, they have established a joint commissioning sub-board and a joint development team. The expectation is that this will lead to the establishment of a single merged board in the near future.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply and for the &#163;67.5 million of second-stage housing market renewal funding, which is really making a difference in north Staffordshire. There are, however, still issues about joined-up delivery of regeneration locally, which also takes in regional generation zones and our regional development agency. Will he therefore be prepared to meet me, other north Staffordshire MPs and colleagues from the Department of Trade and Industry to see how we can improve delivery in the future for the benefit of all the people of north Staffordshire?

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60419-02_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks. By 2008 we will be spending &#163;1.2 billion on the pathfinder programme, which has been very successful. I would be very happy to meet him and to talk to the DTI, which has direct concern for matters concerning the regional development agencies. If he and his hon.

 (Con): The acceptability of the housing market renewal initiative and the pathfinder scheme in north Staffordshire is based on its moderate scale and its sensible balance between demolition and refurbishment, and those two factors are missing in the Liverpool pathfinder scheme. When will the Deputy Prime Minister react to the growing criticisms about Liverpool, which have been repeated in the Audit Commission&#039;s concerns and which are denying the scheme the support of the public and his own MPs? Between us, does he not think that the more modest north Staffordshire scheme is a rather better model to be following?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60419-02_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 No. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s basic criticism is of the Merseyside pathfinder scheme, but let me make it clear that the whole programme of &#163;1.2 billion in payments for the nine pathfinder schemes up until 2008 will refurbish 30,000 houses, have a new build of 15,000 houses and lead to the demolition of only 10,000 houses, which is a small but necessary part of the programme. In Liverpool, 50 per cent. of the population have moved out of the area concerned so it is not surprising that an awful lot of low-quality houses are empty there.

<a name="60419-02_para1">

 The new part L of the building regulations that has come into force this month should improve energy efficiency standards by 40 per cent. compared with 2002. We propose to consult this summer on improvements to water efficiency.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60419-03_spnew4"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 Why do the Government not make higher environmental standards compulsory for new homes, given that companies such as Bedfordshire-based Agrifibre Technologies can build highly energy efficient homes for as little as &#163;40,000 each?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60419-03_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 We are making higher energy efficiency standards compulsory. From this April, it will be compulsory to increase the energy efficiency standards in new homes by 40 per cent. compared with 2002. The hon. Gentleman might not be listening, but that is compulsory. It is a real and tangible policy to deliver energy efficiency for warm homes, not just warm words.

 (Lab/Co-op): While, of course, energy efficiency and the reduction of carbon gas emissions are significantly important for environmental reasons, does the Minister remember our correspondence about the chimney industry in North-West Leicestershire? An inflexible approach on the implementation of revised building regulations will lead to the loss of the chimney from new British homes, which will be aesthetically damaging. A hermetically sealed home is not good in health terms, and the proposal will be economically disadvantageous to numerous firms in North-West Leicestershire.

 My hon. Friend raises the matter on behalf of firms in his constituency. We have examined the situation in detail and think that there are ways in which the industry can respond. We also think that it is      important to make such energy efficiency improvements.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60419-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 There is a negotiation over the tariff. There is a single tariff in the payment-by-results system throughout the NHS, which is a necessary part of the reform. All those four hospitals have received a very substantial increase in funding over the past few years&#151;that has led to extra numbers of nurses and consultants&#151;but it is important that they, like everyone else in the health service, live within their means.

 If that is what he has said, I entirely disagree with him. The right hon. Gentleman has said that there is a great mystery about what has happened to the money that has gone into the NHS, so let me tell him where it has gone in his area. In 1997, more than 10,000 people in the Thames Valley strategic health authority area waited more than six months; today, the figure is 12. In 1997, more than 2,500 patients waited longer than 13 weeks for their out-patient appointment; today, the figure is none. There are also 3,000 more nurses, 162 more GPs&#151;no doubt the right hon. Gentleman will tell them that they are paid too much&#151;and 400 more consultants. A &#163;155 million private finance initiative scheme is under way to relocate services provided at Radcliffe infirmary; there is a &#163;112 million scheme to provide cancer services; &#163;29 million has been allocated for the expansion of cardiac services; and &#163;37 million has been provided for the redevelopment of the Nuffield orthopaedic surgery. The money has gone on cutting waiting lists and waiting times, improving cancer and cardiac services and providing more nurses and doctors. It is money well spent, and every penny piece of it was opposed by the Conservative party.

When we took office, people used to wait for an average of a year&#151;some people waited for two years&#151;to get a cataract operation, but the wait is now less than three months. The right hon.

 As I said a moment or two ago and have said constantly, nobody is talking about a military invasion of Iran or military action against Iran.

Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) a moment or two ago. Let us be quite clear about what is happening and the reason why Iran is in the news headlines. It is because it is in breach of its international obligations and not co-operating properly with the International Atomic Energy Agency. I would have thought that this is the moment for the world to send a clear and united message to the Iranian regime that it has to desist from that and, in particular, to desist

That is perfectly sensible for all the reasons that have been given many, many times by the President himself. However, we are actually pursuing a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran. That diplomatic solution is now being taken forward in the UN Security Council. There will be a report back by Mr. el-Baradei, I think within the next couple of weeks, and then the UN Security Council has got to sit down and work out what action to take.

<br>&nbsp;<br>immensely brave people who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and the security of the wider world, and we owe them an immense debt of gratitude. As he knows, any awards would be made not by Government but by the military. I agree, however, that it is always important that we consider ways of marking the contribution made by such gallant people in extremely difficult circumstances in which they paid with their lives for the benefit and security of the wider world.

 (LD): May I take the opportunity, after the local elections, to invite the Prime Minister to come to Harrogate theatre, where the play, &quot;Cut and Run&quot;, is being performed? He will know that that is a classic farce about the running of the national health service. Will he then visit with me the local three-star foundation hospital, which has delivered on every target that he and his Government have set and has exercised financial prudence every year in balancing its budget? This year, however, it must close a ward of 31 surgical beds and a unit that deals with the rehabilitation of people with disabilities. How will this period of boom and bust help my constituents? If he cannot help to save those two wards, will he join the cast?

<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="60419-03_spmin21"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I do not know about the individual position of the hospital in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. He is right, however, that that hospital has met all the targets for the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times, and that it has received substantial increases in investment. As a result of that, as I understand it, it is employing many more nurses, doctors and consultants. Whatever amount of money any Government put into the national health service, hospital trusts will have to live within their means. Otherwise, we will not have the proper systems and financial accountability in place. I am happy to examine the individual circumstances that he mentioned, but most people in his area would accept, as in other constituencies, that the national health service is in a much better state than it was eight or nine years ago.

<a name="stpa_0">The United Kingdom overseas territories are extremely important, so I am extremely pleased that the Leader of the Opposition, my right hon.

 Exactly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">This Bill is designed to raise the profile of the United Kingdom overseas territories and to modernise our relationship with them. They are unique and very special to us, so I will name them all: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, St. Helena, Turk and Caicos Islands, Pitcairn Island, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, British Indian Ocean Territory, and British Antarctic Territory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I remember looking at a map of the British empire as a boy and feeling extremely proud of our imperial history and of the achievement of this small island nation. Today, I am equally proud of those 14 remaining British overseas territories, which are important for two specific reasons. Thanks to the Labour Government, in 2002 the citizens of these areas were granted full British citizenship. So 220,000 British citizens live in these territories, and we have a duty and responsibility to look after their interests and to promote them here and in the European Union. We also derive tremendous military benefits from these territories. Their allowing us to use their territory and their surrounding waters gives us a huge military outreach that greatly exceeds the outreach that we would enjoy from our own country alone. We lease some of the land, of course, to our principal ally, the United States, and gain significant financial benefit from those leases, as well as good will from our number one ally.

<a name="stpa_4">The French and Dutch allow their overseas territories to participate in the elections for their national assemblies and for the European Union Parliament, and provide every assistance for them to lobby effectively in Brussels. As a result, those overseas territories have far more recognition in the EU and secure far more financial assistance than do ours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Bill does not go as far as the French and Dutch models, but it would do two very important things. First, it would give our British overseas territories the ability to have representation here in Parliament in the House of Lords. The Prime Minister would be able to appoint two or three extra peers&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I make no comment on that. Those extra peers would represent all 14 overseas territories. Secondly, the Bill would enable us to provide specific help for our overseas territories through UKRep, the United Kingdom Representative Office in Brussels, to overcome some of the hurdles, in the form of red tape and bureaucracy, that the European Union throws in their way in allocating money to them. The money is there, but every time that they want to draw money from their accounts, the EU throws more red tape at them. The special service from UKRep in Brussels would allow our 14 overseas territories to overcome those hurdles. The 14 overseas territories are affected increasingly by EU law and they need representation there. They cannot rely on second-hand information passed down from the Foreign Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">I have met representatives from many of the overseas territories. In fact, this morning I met representatives from the Falkland Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. I was greatly upset that some of them said that independence is &quot;inevitable&quot;, because I would hate for us to lose any of the remaining 14 overseas territories. They are extremely important to us strategically and historically.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">I hope that this Bill will reverse the dissatisfaction that some overseas territories feel towards the Foreign Office and how it ignores them and their concerns. We need to show more solidarity with our overseas territories and the Foreign Office needs to work more closely with them in the European Union to maximise their benefits. I ask for support for this Bill. If passed, it would show the UK overseas territories our determination to improve and modernise our relationship with them and keep them within the British family of nations.

<a name="stpa_10">This week we celebrate the 80th birthday of one of the most respected people of our times, whose sense of duty and service has had a profound impact on our country, the Commonwealth and the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_11">Years before the premature death of her father and her unexpected succession to the throne, the then Princess Elizabeth publicly dedicated her life to the service of her nation, but declared that she would need the support of the country to ensure that she could fulfil that promise. She has, as we know, carried out that pledge through all the changes, both in her life and in this country, with extraordinary grace and dedication, and her people, here and across the Commonwealth, who share in the celebration of her 80th birthday this year, have responded, as she hoped that they would, with their affection and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_12">In a world that has been transformed in her lifetime, she has been a truly remarkable source of constancy and strength. Our country has faced tremendous trials, witnessed the horrors of the second world war and celebrated some extraordinary triumphs in her 80 years. Throughout, as part of the royal family and as the Queen, she has been a reassuring and unifying presence for her people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_13">She has also responded to a world that has become smaller and more interdependent than ever by travelling extensively. In all, the Queen has undertaken over 256 official overseas visits to 129 different countries. Her   Majesty shows no sign of slowing down. She has just undertaken her 14th tour of Australia, which included the official opening of the Commonwealth games in    Melbourne. She attends hundreds of public engagements every year and is an active patron of over 620 charities and organisations. There is simply no aspect of our national life that she does not have an interest in and a deep understanding of.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_14">Her Prime Ministers have better reason than most to know and appreciate her knowledge and experience. I am the tenth Prime Minister to serve her. Like each of my predecessors, I am profoundly grateful for her wise counsel. She has superb judgment, an intuitive empathy with people and, above all, an unshakeable and profound sense of duty. It is that sense of duty that motivates her and defines her reign and, since it communicates itself unobtrusively but none the less obviously to her subjects, brings her the love of the people of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_15">It is difficult in this day and age for the monarchy to balance the natural demands for accessibility and openness with the dignity and majesty of the monarch, but it is a balance that she has struck with immense skill.

 I am delighted to associate myself and the Opposition with the Prime Minister&#039;s generous tribute to Her Majesty. It is entirely merited. The occasion of anyone&#039;s 80th birthday is a matter for rejoicing, but this landmark in the life of Queen Elizabeth, who has reigned over our country so wisely and for so long, is a genuine cause for national celebration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_16">She has been our queen for 54 years. Through 1,000 years of British history, only Queen Victoria, George III, Henry III and, by a few months, Edward III have sat on the throne for a greater period. As the Prime Minister said, Her Majesty has lived in two centuries through a time of incredible transformation. She served in uniform in the second world war, presided over the dismantling of the empire and Britain&#039;s joining of the EU, and witnessed the end of the cold war and the beginning of the new millennium. She has been a rock of stability, calm and good sense in a period of the most turbulent change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_17">I had my first meeting as Leader of the Opposition with Her Majesty a few weeks ago. As one tries to explain what one is up to, one is acutely conscious that she has heard it all before and seen it all before. Her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill. Her first Leader of the Opposition was Clement Attlee. I am the 19th Leader of the Opposition the Queen has had to meet; I am sure that, like others, Her Majesty has no doubt noticed that the number has increased all too frequently in recent years. However, she was, as ever, far too polite to point that out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_18">To me, the Queen personifies two vital principles. The first is national unity. Many things divide us, but the institution of our monarchy and the integrity with which the Queen has carried out her role over almost six decades bring Britain together. I remember celebrating the silver jubilee in the village where I grew up. As a newly elected Back Bencher, I participated in golden jubilee events across my constituency, as other Members did. The Queen means as much to people of my generation as to those in previous ones, as I know that she will in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_19">As head of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty presides over an organisation that includes more than a quarter of the earth&#039;s population. That that community of nations has endured and thrived through such a tumultuous period in our world&#039;s history is due in no small measure to the Queen herself. She is admired and held in affection by everyone, from the most senior dignitary to the youngest schoolchild.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_20">The second principle that the Queen embodies is public service. Throughout her reign she has displayed judgment, tolerance and absolute political neutrality. Her life has been one of selfless duty. From the moment she was born, she has lived in the public eye. I cannot think of a single occasion on which Her Majesty has done or said anything that would damage in any way the institution that she embodies. For all of us in public life, she has set the highest standards in every respect.

May I say quietly and gently to the Minister that I am absolutely sick, sore and weary of delegated legislation being used in Northern Ireland? Yesterday, we had a prime example, when the Secretary of State made a statement in the House indicating that he believed that the best way to govern Northern Ireland was by local people. Within an hour, through delegated legislation, the format of local government in Northern Ireland was changed by an Order in Council&#151;no amendment in Committee and no debate on Report or Third Reading.

That Bill could be extended to Northern Ireland. It is a curious fact that, as drafted, clause 10 of that Bill does not automatically extend to Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_62">Again, I join the hon. Lady in saying that anonymous registration has real merits&#151;I shall come to some of those issues in a moment or two&#151;but I am not quite clear why she has moved the amendment by which subsection (1) would be deleted, whereby no provision would be made for anonymous registration. So how would we meet the criteria of parity and be dealt with in the same way as other parts of the United Kingdom? If the hon. Lady had sought to delete subsection (1) and replace it with a substitute, we would probably have been with her all the way, but removing subsection (1) and subsection (2), as she proposed in amendment No. 2, would effectively mean that we had no anonymous registration.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60419-07_spnew7"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 Let me clarify the point. In my final remarks, I urged the Minister to ensure that clause 10 of the Electoral Administration Bill, which is currently before another place, extends to Northern Ireland and therefore the same provisions about anonymous registration as those that apply to the rest of Great Britain would extend to Northern Ireland. Therefore, anonymous registration would be covered.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60419-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 We are dealing with this Bill, and the Committee cannot amend a Bill that is being considered in another House. We must deal with the Bill that is in front of us. Clearly, if the Committee removed subsections (1) and (2), as the hon. Lady asks us to do, we would not have anonymous registration in Northern Ireland. It is particularly important that we have that provision in Northern Ireland, although I endorse the caveats that she mentioned, because I am unhappy about the manner in which the provision is being introduced in the Bill. None the less, I believe that it is essential that that should happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_63">I am particularly uncomfortable about approving measures that are subject to provisions that the Secretary of State will produce at some later stage. Anything we say at this stage is subject to the caveat that it depends on whether we approve the later provisions. Clearly, given the different arrangements in Northern Ireland, the provisions will not be identical to those that apply in other parts of the United Kingdom, but they should share the same underlying principles. Establishing a system of anonymous registration for people whose safety could be compromised if their addresses were known is a helpful step forward.

<a name="60419-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_64">In respect of the consultation responses, I note that Sinn Fein was the only party opposed to anonymous registration, but that is not really surprising. I also found that the Ulster Unionist party put in no response at all, and my party did the same&#151;largely, I assume, because both parties are happy with the Bill. I also note that the Electoral Commission expressed strong support

<br>&nbsp;<br>for the introduction of anonymous registration. It is particularly relevant to Northern Ireland in view of threats to the security forces and members of the Prison Service.

<a name="60419-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_65">My right hon. and hon. Friends will be well aware of IRA intelligence-gathering operations, whether it be the raids at Castlereagh police station and Dundonald house or the Stormontgate affair, after which many people&#151;police officers and others&#151;were informed that their details had been compromised. There is good cause for servants of the Crown to have some anonymity. Many of them could be compromised and when it came to deciding whether to exercise their right to vote or protect their families&#039; safety, they would probably choose not to be registered at all. That would be a most unfortunate set of circumstances to have to deal with and I am sure that the House would not want those circumstances to continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_66">Apart from the special circumstances of prison and police officers in Northern Ireland, some more general circumstances apply throughout the UK&#151;to victims of domestic violence, for example. That provides further evidence of the benefits to be gained from allowing anonymous registration. It would help the people affected to live free from the fear of attack. Any scheme would have to be devised with the main aim of protecting the vulnerable without allowing anyone to benefit from not being on the register. Such a balance will always be difficult to strike, but that difficulty cannot be allowed to stand as an argument against the principle of anonymous registration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_67">When the Electoral Administration Bill was passing through the House, the official Opposition sought to table a probing amendment. Its main principle&#151;that access to anonymous registration should be for those who are at risk rather than those who seek privacy&#151;would be generally accepted by the House. It is important to back up the case for being at risk with suitable documentation from the police or other statutory bodies. On that basis, I believe that the House could be content that the right people had access to the anonymous registration list. All such cases are to be regarded as exceptional rather than usual. Adopting the telephone directory analogy, it should not be as easy to get off the register as to go ex-directory. I hope that, in framing the provisions, the Government will take into account the issue of risk rather than convenience or privacy. The electoral register plays an important role and must be as complete as possible: it should not be changed on account of privacy, but only by reference to safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_68">Unfortunately, due to the bad drafting of clause 1, it is impossible to make an assessment of how the arrangements will work in practice. We support the principle of anonymous registration, however, so we continue to support the Bill, but we trust that our business will be dealt with in a more appropriate manner in due course.

If the Government&#039;s deadlines announced from the Dispatch Box yesterday are not met&#151;we all hope that they will be, but know why they might not be&#151;we will have to make some other provisions. It was most unfortunate that an Order in Council, affecting the whole local governance of Northern Ireland, was made yesterday without any opportunity for amendment, particularly when virtually all the political parties in Northern Ireland had expressed real misgivings about the number of the new local authorities to be constituted. That, however, is by the way. It remains an apposite illustration, but I shall not digress any further, Sir Alan, as you would rebuke me. The matter should be dealt with on the record and I hope that the Minister will say something about it.

Members in their places today will know that the Government were particularly helpful when I sought to amend the Bill to prevent the sort of ridiculous delay that occurred in my constituency last year as a result of the tragic death of one of my opponents. I could not have asked for greater co-operation from any Government, whatever their political complexion, in trying to amend legislation. First, I brought in a ten-minute Bill and the Minister&#151;the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)&#151;gave her agreement to what I was trying to achieve, but suggested that it could be tagged on to the Electoral Administration Bill. I readily accepted her suggestion and she and her officials worked closely with me, for which I remain extremely grateful. I am glad to put that on the record again.

It is therefore essential that the relevant provisions in that legislation come into force for Northern Ireland, at least in that particular.

Indeed, it would not apply in Northern Ireland. I am unhappy about some of the almost pro-consular powers that go with the Secretary of State&#039;s office at the moment, but I would still prefer the anonymous registration promised in the Bill, even with all its imperfections, than run the risk of having no anonymous registration at all. The hon. Member for Belfast, East was entirely right to point that out.

I do not blame the Minister, but there are those in the usual channels who should be more sensitive than to have Northern Ireland business and a Welsh Grand Committee on the same day.

<a name="stpa_74">New clause 1 would simplify the process of introducing anonymous registration in Northern Ireland, and anonymous registration is a necessary option for the reasons that have already been outlined. However, the process that the Government are putting forward seems rather complicated. Our new clause would amend clause 73 of the Electoral Administration Bill to allow clause 10 of that Bill, which introduces anonymous registration for England and Wales, to apply also to Northern Ireland. That is a very simple way of achieving what the Government seem to want to achieve. We do not understand why they have taken the approach that they have. First, it is fairly easy to make the change, and I do not understand why they think&#151;perhaps the Minister can explain&#151;that it is not easier simply to replicate in this Bill clause 10 of the Electoral Administration Bill.

If it was, I certainly have not been informed. The Northern Ireland Office also carried out its own consultation on the issue but, as far as I understand it, that consultation did not finish until January.

If the point behind new clause 1 makes sense to the Government, they can still take it on board. That does not mean a great victory or defeat for anybody, but it would at least ensure consistency.

 I understand perfectly well the situation in which the hon. Gentleman found himself last June.

I understand that it extends to Northern Ireland, but I will seek advice on all the clauses. I would not want to mislead him, so I will write to him. It is my understanding, and certainly my hope, that the provisions relating to his postponed election last June would be applicable to Northern Ireland, but I want to check on the details and report to him in due course, if I may, because it is a Department for Constitutional Affairs Bill, for which I have no direct responsibility.

As the relevant provisions in that Bill might be amended, we wish to examine in detail the final proposals that come before the House before we look at how to apply them to Northern Ireland. In the light of those considerations, we have concluded that it makes sense to wait until the approach for Great Britain is finalised, in another place, before we seek to define any detail of how any scheme will apply to Northern Ireland.

Indeed, dare I say it, they are occasionally unsatisfactory to the Government as well.

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be aware that when we considered the last modification order&#151;indeed, when we considered the first modification order with which I dealt, in July 2005&#151;the way in which we deal with Orders in Council was raised by the hon. Members for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), as well as Northern Ireland Members. We gave an undertaking to examine our proposals. The Secretary of State wrote to the spokesmen for the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats and others to ask for their comments. We have received responses and I understand that private discussions are taking place. In the unhappy event of the Northern Ireland Assembly not being restored by the end of November, as proposed, we are considering how we will deal with the situation. I hope that the Assembly will be ultimately restored and that matters that are dealt with by Orders in Council will, rightly and properly, be dealt with by elected Members of the Assembly in Stormont, rather than by hon. Members in the House of Commons.

 The criteria for anonymous registration and the way in which that will be implemented will be a matter for consultation. A register will be published annually, as is set out in other clauses in the Bill. The proposal in the Bill is that the canvass will be held every 10 years. The two matters are entirely separate, so I am sorry if I confused the hon. Gentleman. The criteria for who should be anonymously registered, the conditions for their registration, the way in which the registration should be applied, and how the scheme will work will be subject to the consultation that I intend to issue as soon as possible, after considering the results of the consultation on the DCA Bill before the House&#151;and, I hope, with hon.

 I am not sure if the Minister was going to come to this before he finished, but I shall put to him again the question that I asked before. Why did the Government not simply replicate clause 10 of the Electoral Administration Bill to achieve the same purpose? It would be perfectly respectable for him to say, &quot;We didn&#039;t think about it,&quot; but it would be useful to understand whether that approach was a strategy or an accident.

 I hoped that I had dealt with that point earlier, but I will try to assist the hon. Gentleman&#039;s recollection. I said that Northern Ireland had a body of electoral law, especially relating to registration and electoral fraud, that&#151;for reasons of which the hon. Gentleman will be aware&#151;is different from that in the rest of the United Kingdom. That means that technical issues that are different from those that apply to the Electoral Administration Bill must be considered. I understand that the hon. Gentleman might have some worries about that. We are broadly trying to replicate in Northern Ireland the situation that exists in my constituency in north Wales, but we have to examine the detailed and technical way in which we can do that when the situation is intermeshed with existing legislation that under current legislation is not amendable.

In March 2001&#151;not so long ago&#151;the Government presented to Parliament a command paper, Cm 5080, entitled &quot;Combating Electoral Fraud in Northern Ireland&quot;. On the first page, the Government spelled out their responsibility in light of the fact that there was perceived&#151;it certainly existed, so it was not just perceived, but unacceptable&#151;electoral malpractice in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_116">In common with the hon. Member for North Down    (Lady Hermon) and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), we feel that a 10-year interval is too long. It is in everyone&#039;s interest to encourage people to register to vote and to ensure that the register is up to date and accurate. We did not object to clause 2, which abolished the annual canvass, but a 10-year interval is too long, which is why we tabled our amendments. We should therefore like the Minister to explain why he chose 2010 to conduct a canvass and why he chose an interval of 10 years.

 There are two issues. The first was raised by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) and the second is the length of time between canvasses. I very much agree with the hon. Lady that it is unnecessarily centralist and directive to give the Secretary of State the opportunity simply to cancel the 2010 canvass. I do not wish to repeat her arguments, but I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s justification for the inclusion of that provision. I counsel him to be careful, because there is an increasing tendency in Northern Ireland legislation to give more and more powers to the Secretary of State simply because we are debating a particular subject and someone says, &quot;Let&#039;s give the Secretary of State flexibility to make individual decisions.&quot; If one steps back from the body of legislation that we have passed in the past nine years, one can see that there has been a huge centralisation of power for the Secretary of State because the opportunity arose for someone to do so for his convenience. That is not a good reason to do it, and I want to hear what the Minister has to say by way of justification.

Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) would decrease it to every five years&#151;I think that the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) also takes that view.

First, why should there be such an incredibly long period of time, when all kinds of factors mean that the register will be highly inaccurate by the end of that period? Secondly, why are the Government not concerned that electoral fraud will creep in again as the register becomes inaccurate? Thirdly, human beings are human beings and may not keep up to date if they move house or their circumstances change, so why are the Government not concerned that people will become increasingly disenfranchised, as logic tells us that they will be, in a 10-year period? Ten years is a quarter of my life; it is one eighth of the life of the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.

<a name="60419-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_122">Earlier this afternoon, I referred to the pro-consular powers of the Secretary of State. I hope that the talks that the Government are instituting next month will lead to agreement, but one must be an extremely optimistic person to be absolutely confident that agreement will be reached by the due date. If an agreement is not reached, we face the indefinite continuation of direct rule and of the use by the Secretary of State of his current powers, which are very great indeed. This is not a criticism of the present Secretary of State, any of his predecessors or any of his potential successors, but pro-consular powers are dangerous, and they make Northern Ireland very different from the rest of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_123">I want to reinforce the point about the 10-year period. The next general election cannot be later than 2010, so if that rule had been in force in 2001, a 10-year period would have encompassed three general elections, which is a telling point. All 10-year cycles include two general elections, and most of them include three, which is too long. I understand why the Government feel obliged to introduce clause 2 and abolish annual registration, and the fact that clause 3 went through without debate, let alone a Division, indicates that there is broad agreement on both sides of the House and among the parties in Northern Ireland that that is a sensible move. One year may be too short, but 10 years is far too long.

As the devolved Minister who presided over the last census in Northern Ireland in 2001, I know that there were difficulties and confusions because changes in electoral law were pending. The new form of electoral registration whereby people had to give their signatures led to confusion between the census and the new form of registration, because people thought that having done one, they had done the other.

<a name="stpa_127">Equally, we must be careful when we consider how the electoral calendar might fall. Several elections could take place, not just general elections, before there is a general canvass to ensure that the register is clearly and publicly updated. It would be a step too far, and into the unknown, if we were to face the possibility of numerous elections before knowing how well the health of the register is maintained in between general canvasses. I hope that the Minister can colour in the ways in which the electoral office is intended to engage in focused and targeted work in between the dates for the general canvass to tend to areas where there is a strong case for believing that there is marked under-registration or over-registration. Regardless of whether we are talking about four-year, five-year or 10-year canvasses, what work will be done in the intervening period to proof and improve the quality of the annual registers?

With a 10-year period, we could find that the annual canvass is taking place at a time that coincides broadly with Boundary Commission reviews, again adding to confusion and uncertainty.

We would probably prefer four years, but we recognise, with all due respect to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), that the amendment tabled by the hon.

The Conservative amendment rhymes better, in technical terms, than the Lib Dem amendment. We are not particularly hot and bothered about whether it is four years or five years, but we have many concerns about 10 years. Irrespective of that, we would like the Minister to clarify what remedial and health checking work will be guaranteed in relation to the annual registers that will be published.

 I do not want to repeat the various points that have already been made. Surely, the essence of what is being debated at this moment, irrespective of what will arise under clause 4, is the independence of the chief electoral officer. If his decisions are subject to questioning and agreement or non-agreement by the Secretary of State, he will simply not be independent. If the Minister wishes to pursue the autonomous rule of the Secretary of State in that regard, will he consider introducing some appeal mechanism or forum to determine whether the so-called public interest is of sufficient seriousness to override a considered opinion of the chief electoral officer?

<a name="stpa_153">The Secretary of State will make an order only if the recommendation is forthcoming from the chief electoral officer. I put to hon. Members the fact that the onus and responsibility lie with the chief electoral officer, who has duties under later clauses to ensure the integrity of the register. If he feels that the register is not truly correct and is failing, he has the power and duty to ask the Secretary of state to continue with the canvass. The proposal to fix an interim canvass is unnecessary, because we have 2010 fixed, and we have the potential for an interim canvass if required and for the chief electoral officer to bring it forward.

 The fact is that we do not. There is the option, but no fixed 2010 date. If there were such a date, there would be general consensus in Committee. I can see from the nodding heads around me that people would be tolerably satisfied. The fact of the matter is, however, that the Bill as currently drafted does not insist on 2010, which is an option.

<a name="stpa_155">The Secretary of State will only do that for two reasons. First, he would act on the recommendation of the chief electoral officer. Secondly, the power is exercisable only by statutory instrument, which would come before the House anyway.

 But the point is that the Secretary of State has the overriding power. I hope that this will not be construed as an attack on the current or any future Secretary of State; we just believe that it is wrong to give that power to a Secretary of State. Were there no option, we would all be tolerably satisfied. For goodness&#039; sake, the Minister should at least undertake to consider the matter with a view to introducing a Government amendment in the House of Lords.

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="60419-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I think that there is a disagreement between us. First, the canvass in 2010 can be cancelled only by order of the Secretary of State through a statutory instrument, which will come before the House. Secondly, that will happen only if the chief electoral officer recommends it. That is a double safeguard, which I hope that he and other Members will accept.
</p>





<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60419-15_spnew1"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 The Minister has asked us to place some reliance on clause 3(1)(a). If we consider clause 3(3), however, we see that the Secretary of State&#039;s powers make it possible that such a canvass might not be conducted before 2015. The Bill asks us to consider that it might not just be a case of the Secretary of State letting it slip for a year. I accept that there might be a case for not proceeding in 2010, because were the 2010 electoral canvass to be done in the autumn, which is the traditional time, that would run close to the public information build-up to the 2011 census. At that stage even the devolved administration&#151;if there is one&#151;might seek some change.
</p>





<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60419-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, if the Government had wished to have a 10-year canvass in the first instance, we would not have put the provision in place for a potential canvass in 2010. Under clause 2, we are abolishing the annual canvass; there will be a canvass in 2006 and every 10 years. The Bill provides for the possibility of a canvass in 2010, for the very reasons mentioned by hon. Members, but we retain the right for that canvass not to take place if the Secretary of State is advised by the chief electoral officer that one is not needed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60419-15_spnew3"><b> Dr. McCrea: </b> 
 If the chief electoral officer has a duty in relation to favouring a canvass, why should the Secretary of State have the power to override that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60419-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, we are straying into later clauses and amendments, but the Secretary of State has an overriding duty to consider the broad picture, the needs of Northern Ireland and of this House and a range of matters. The Secretary of State has that power, but the circumstances in which the chief electoral officer would recommend the canvass and the Secretary of State would say, &quot;No, thanks, we&#039;re not going to have one,&quot; would be very limited. It would be a brave Secretary of State who exercised those powers. There might be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 159</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>circumstances, however, which we will talk about under later clauses, in which the Secretary of State might want to take those powers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60419-15_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I might have been digging earlier, but I see a hole developing next to the Minister. There is now an inference that there could be a political motivation for not taking the register. There can be no other possible reason for giving the Secretary of State the opportunity to disregard the advice of the chief electoral officer. I want to press the Minister on this salient point. Can he give us a single example of circumstances in which he imagines the Secretary of State would need the power to overrule the chief electoral officer&#039;s guidance?
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60419-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 For whatever reason, the Secretary of State might determine that on financial grounds. [Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] It is possible; I am not saying that that would be the case. In 2004, the cost of the canvass was &#163;1.7 million. I am not saying that the Secretary of State would make a determination against the recommendation of the chief electoral officer, but that is a public consideration for this House. The chief electoral officer might make a recommendation that the Secretary of State felt, in the circumstances at the time, was not worth &#163;1.7 million. That will not be a determination, but it is a consideration.
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60419-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 Surely, in those or other circumstances that we cannot foresee, it would be open to a future Secretary of State to come to Parliament and ask for primary legislation to be introduced, and if necessary expedited, as has happened with Northern Ireland legislation in the past and as will happen in the next couple of weeks. That would enable the dispensation to be granted by a parliamentary decision rather than just by the Secretary of State acting on his own account.
<a name="time_15">
<a name="60419-15_time0"><h5>2.45 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60419-15_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, should the Secretary of State determine to do that, a statutory instrument, which would come before the House for consideration, would be required to cancel the canvass in 2010. Parliament would therefore be able to monitor the Secretary of State&#039;s decision. That statutory instrument would be taken in Committee, and could be referred to and debated on the Floor of the House. It would be voted on by the House. I am simply saying to all Members that the Secretary of State has the ability to override the recommendation should he or she wish to do so. I would not have included in the Bill the ability to have a canvas in 2010 if we did not feel that that was needed. We now envisage that there will be one in 2010, and on a 10-year basis after that, unless the chief electoral officer recommends otherwise, which it is in his power to do; again, I emphasise that that would be difficult for the Secretary of State to overturn.
</p>





<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60419-15_spnew9"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 The Minister is making a valiant effort but failing. Can he not understand that the confidence of the people of the Province of Northern Ireland is fundamental to the success of this legislation? We all know very well that it is unlikely that there will be a Secretary of State from Northern Ireland in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 160</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>foreseeable future. We do not complain about that. We all know very well that it is perfectly possible, certainly for the immediate future, that the Government will have a large majority. We have already said that the Order-in-Council procedure is wholly unsatisfactory, as it is determined upstairs by a relatively small number of Members without the opportunity for amendment, so there is a lack of confidence in the system. When we pass primary legislation, surely it is important to ensure the confidence of the people of Northern Ireland. Why can we not get rid of this qualification clause and fix on 2010?
</p>





<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60419-15_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, I have tried to explain in detail why the power for the Secretary of State is needed. I will deal with that in more detail under the next set of amendments. The Government are committed to making sure that the electoral register is intact, paramount and legitimate in every way, shape and form. The original purpose of the annual canvass was to ensure that. We have given an assurance that an annual canvass will take place next year, and every 10 years subsequently. As a backstop, we have provided for a canvas in 2010&#151;a date picked randomly, I say for the benefit of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury&#151;and for an examination of whether a canvass is needed at that stage to maintain the integrity of that register. If it is needed, it will happen. If it is not needed, according to the chief electoral officer, it will not happen. The Secretary of State has the power to examine the wider public interest at the time, but we would not have put that in the legislation if we had not wished to ensure the integrity of the register. At any time, the chief electoral officer can say, based on his or her obligations under clause 4, that the register is not up to standard, and that the canvass needs to be undertaken to refresh it fully. I hope that that assures hon. Members and that they will withdraw their amendments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60419-15_spnew11"><b> Dr. McCrea: </b> 
 Before the Minister finishes, will he deal with the question of a five-year rather than a 10-year period? He has constantly referred to 10 years, but there is a consensus across the Committee that 10 years is much too long for the integrity of the register to be maintained. Why do the Government insist on retaining the 10-year period regardless of what we say? If an amendment providing for a five-year period were tabled in the other place, would the Government not consider that a more sensible option than a stand-up fight?
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60419-15_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 With due respect to the hon. Gentleman, it is not in my nature to stand up and fight on issues unless they are issues of extreme principle. In my opinion, this is a question of the management of the electoral register. The position is that there will be a canvass every 10 years from 2010&#151;or a canvass in 2006 and another in 2016, depending on what happens. If the chief electoral officer chooses to recommend an earlier canvass, after five years, the Secretary of State will have to reflect on that view and agree or not agree; but the onus will always be on the chief electoral officer to examine the legitimacy of the register on the basis of the criteria in clause 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_156">It is a simple matter. We expect a canvass to be conducted every 10 years. If the chief electoral officer suggests that the canvass should be conducted earlier, the Secretary of State will have to consider the request and make a case for or against it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60419-15_spnew13"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The fact that this discussion has continued for nearly half an hour gives a good clue to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 161</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the fact that there is something amiss. The Minister has given an example of circumstances in which financial expediency might cause the Secretary of State to overrule the guidance of the chief electoral officer, who, after all, must take account of what is reasonable and practicable. The Minister, like me, knows very well that canvass data becomes outdated very quickly, and 10 years would be a ludicrously long time not to update it for. May I suggest a way out of the problem? Before the Bill goes to the other place, may we have a chance to discuss and reflect on the issues, and try to establish a more consensual approach? It is obvious to me that the Minister is doing his best, but not succeeding in convincing a number of Members who feel that the Government have not quite got it right.

 I am always grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s help. I know that he has my best interests at heart, and that he is looking after me and supporting me fully. I am sure that even the hon. Member for Tewkesbury has my best interests, and those of the Government, at heart. However, we have made a judgment. We thought about the matter carefully, and we feel that the 10-year period is sufficient. We have taken account of the fact that the chief electoral officer may make the request. I admit that the Bill allows the Secretary of State to refuse that request, under a range of provisions with which we shall deal later, but I believe that the fact of the request being made would weigh heavily on the mind of a Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60419-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_157">I return to the original principle. The legitimacy of the electoral register is paramount to the democracy of the United Kingdom and of Northern Ireland, and it is therefore central to what the Government are supporting.

<a name="60419-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_158">The Minister was totally unconvincing. It would have helped if he had done a bit of homework, and reflected on what was said by the Secretary of State less than a month ago.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_160">However, this afternoon the Minister, who was listening carefully, will have noticed that not a single voice&#151;apart from his&#151;was heard in support of clause 3. It is regrettable that, in quoting from the part that refers to the power of the chief electoral officer, he omitted the crucial word &quot;and&quot; between paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2). It is not just a question of the wish of the chief electoral officer; he must abide by very relevant registration objectives specified in clause 4. For

<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 162</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>instance, he&#151;or she: we are to appoint a new chief electoral officer&#151;may fear that entries in the register are false. Clause 4 imposes objectives and obligations on the    chief electoral officer, and consequently any recommendation for the Secretary of State to arrange an earlier canvass has been made with very good reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_161">When pressed by various hon. Members, the Minister used an unfortunate phrase. He said that the public interest might just boil down to financial interests. Democracy does not come cheap. As an elector in Northern Ireland, I am offended&#151;as my constituents will be&#151;that a Minister of the British Government should say in the House of Commons that the public interest might mean that an up-to-date accurate register was too expensive.
</p>





<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60419-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I used that as one example, because we are talking about 1.7 million people. There may be many related examples, with which we may deal later. As the hon.

<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60419-16_spnew3"><b> Lady Hermon: </b>

Only the Secretary of State need be satisfied; there are no reviewable objectives or reasonable grounds to determine what constitutes the public interest in this clause.

</p>





<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60419-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 These amendments are similar to the ones in the previous group, and it was perhaps unfortunate that we could not consider them all at the same time. I do not want to try your patience, Mrs. Heal, but I suspect that it is to some degree inevitable that we might have revisit some of the arguments presented previously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_174">We had a long debate on the timing of the canvass. The annual canvass has been abolished: it is now proposed to hold a canvass in 2010, and possibly in intervening years as well, unless the Secretary of States makes an order providing that that requirement does not apply. In intervening years, the chief electoral officer can recommend that a canvass should be conducted, but it will take place only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the public interest requires it. Indeed, the 2010 canvass can be cancelled if the Secretary of State, having considered the CEO&#039;s recommendation, is satisfied that the public interest does not require it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_175">Hon. Members from all parties have expressed concern about what the term &quot;the public interest&quot; means. That is an important matter in Great Britain, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 167</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the fact that citizens in Northern Ireland have generally been treated less well in legal terms than their counterparts in Great Britain means that the vagueness of the term arouses even more concern. I have tabled these amendments to tease out from the Minister the circumstances under which the 2010 canvass, or a canvass in an intervening year, might not take place. I accept that the requirement to keep the debate relevant to the amendments under discussion limited his opportunity to expand on that previously, and I hope that he will be able to say more this time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60419-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is essential to aim for normality, in Northern Ireland even more than in any other part of the UK? Providing for exceptions using a phrase as vague as &quot;the public interest&quot; is, prima facie, rather dangerous. Does he accept that the Government would need a very strong reason for making an exception, especially given that this Bill is in respect of Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60419-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention. He is absolutely right. As I tried to explain, using the term &quot;public interest&quot; in respect of Great Britain is unacceptably wide; to use it in terms of Northern Ireland requires some explanation, with good reason to support it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_176">As I said in an intervention earlier, I am a little concerned about the independence of the chief electoral officer. Perhaps the Committee will forgive me if I fast-forward to clause 8 which states:

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_177">
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;The Chief Electoral Officer . . . is appointed by the Secretary of State . . . A person must not be appointed as Chief Electoral Officer for more than 5 years at a time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_178">Furthermore, he cannot hold office for more than 10 years. By comparison, the police ombudsman is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, although I accept that it is by recommendation&#151;no doubt from the Secretary of State. Why is the situation different for the chief electoral officer?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_179">Clause 8 does not lead us to believe that the CEO would be independent. As I noted earlier, the relationship between the CEO and the Secretary of State will be somewhat incestuous. The Minister says that the 2010 canvass would be cancelled only if the CEO had made a recommendation against it, but surely in the real world the Secretary of State could put pressure on the CEO if he thought it appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_180">I am concerned about the situation, although as we explored it in great depth during the previous debate I shall not repeat the arguments, but will the Minister give us some examples of what the public interest would mean under the clause? He gave a financial example to show why the 2010 canvass might not take place. He has just had several minutes to discuss other possible examples with officials and colleagues, so I hope that he can offer some to show why he feels that the Secretary of State would overrule the CEO. In particular, will he give us his interpretation of what &quot;the public interest&quot; would actually mean?
</p>





<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60419-17_spnew3"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 I shall address my remarks to my amendment No. 27. I remind the Minister that just over 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 168</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a month ago, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State gave us this assurance about measures for the registration of voters:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_181">
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;The measures broadly mirror change being introduced in the rest of the United Kingdom by the Electoral Administration Bill, as the Government believe that it is right that the citizens of Northern Ireland should enjoy the same rights as those of the rest of the UK.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13 March 2006; Vol. 443, c. 1175.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_182">As the Minister reflects on the words of his esteemed colleague, he may care to try to reconcile the differences between the Electoral Administration Bill and this Bill, especially clause 3, under which the Secretary of State has exclusively been given the power to override a decision of the chief electoral officer in &quot;the public interest&quot;&#151;whatever that will mean. The Minister has of course assured us that it means more than a financial interest, although he mentioned financial interests twice in our earlier debate, so we wait with bated breath to hear what else might amount to public interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_183">The Minister may also care to study the Electoral Administration Bill, currently in another place, to which his colleague referred to on 13 March, for a direct comparison in respect of the rights that the people of Northern Ireland should have. There is no provision for a Secretary of State in any other part of the United Kingdom to override the collection of information by an electoral officer. Will the Minister address that inconsistency?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_184">I dislike subsection (2)(b) of clause 3 and the Minister would be well advised to remove it. The inclusion of a reference to the Secretary of State having power to override the decision of the chief electoral officer in the public interest has caused enormous annoyance among Members who have spoken. Only the Government are in favour of the provision. If the Minister does not heed our advice, I urge him to ensure that my amendment No. 27 is adopted, because at least it indicates that where the chief electoral officer is concerned about electoral fraud the presumption will be that a canvass is in the public interest to eradicate that fraud. The matter would be brought to the attention of the Secretary of State by the person most keenly interested in having a valid, proper, up-to-date, modern electoral register&#151;the chief electoral officer.

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para19">
<a name="stpa_189">It is inconceivable that the Minister could come to the Dispatch Box and say that the prevention of electoral fraud was not in the public interest. He can make no logical objection to such a sensible amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para20">
<a name="stpa_190">I would prefer that subsection (2)(b) was withdrawn altogether and deleted from the face of the Bill. However, if the Minister insists on it, I ask him to adopt my amendment to make quite sure that when the chief electoral officer indicates his or her wish to eradicate electoral fraud, it will be in the public interest to hold a canvass.

<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60419-17_spnew4"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 The Minister will obviously be aware from the previous debate that there is real suspicion and concern that the Bill gives the Secretary of State significant override powers when the concept of &quot;public interest&quot; is not defined. Going on form rather than faith, it would be hard to trust any Secretary of State who had such sweeping powers, especially in circumstances where the Secretary of State was not required to exercise them in a defined and clear context&#151;where there was no clear working premise for the exercise of such powers. If the Minister wants us to believe any of the reassurances, I am sure he will accept the amendments, which would define the public interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para21">
<a name="stpa_191">In his closing contribution on the last group of amendments, the Minister told us that the integrity of the registration process must be paramount, yet he offered as the only specific public interest consideration that would lead the Secretary of State to override the recommendation of the chief electoral officer a financial consideration&#151;that in the circumstances, &#163;1.7 million might too much to uphold the integrity of the registration process, which is said to be paramount.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para22">
<a name="stpa_192">The amendments would ensure that the terms used by the Minister are extended to the Bill. If it is good enough for Members to be asked to accept his assurance, it should be good enough for him to include it in the Bill on behalf of Members. That is the point of the amendments, which seek a clear definition of the public interest. We know from so many other occasions that when it is not defined, we are treated to those empty but supposedly magic words, &quot;the public interest&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-17_para23">
<a name="stpa_193">When parliamentarians demand answers and explanations, the explanation that we are given is &quot;the public interest&quot;. Parliament is not allowed proper debate, scrutiny, consideration and exposure of the issues involved. The concept of the public interest is meant to protect the public from stupid decisions, not from proper parliamentary scrutiny.

 I am trying to be helpful to all hon. Members. The provisions would be used in extremis. In normal circumstances, the chief electoral officer is independent of the Government and will make decisions and recommendations that will be acted on by the Government. However, there may be circumstances, a few of which I have outlined&#151;I accept that hon. Members do not share my analysis&#151;in which the Secretary of State does not wish to accept the chief electoral officer&#039;s recommendation. If that is the case, it is in the public interest for the Secretary of State to defend the matter to the public at large, because the electoral officer can, if he wishes, make his recommendation public. It is contestable in the courts, and it can be argued in the public domain. The Secretary of State is accountable to the House for his decisions through discussion, debate and questions. Those are accountability issues. There may be circumstances in which the Secretary of State does not wish to accept a recommendation for an annual canvass by the chief electoral officer. If those circumstances arise, I imagine that there will be all hell to pay but, none the less, they could arise.
</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60419-20_spnew4"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 The Minister is talking about the independence of the chief electoral officer, yet there are provisions in the Bill that chip away at that independence, so he is not the final arbiter on any matter that is supposed to be within his competence. The Minister suggested that he could be weak and could undertake a registration exercise after being approached by the parties. The fact is, however, that in the past, Secretaries of State have moved election dates after an approach from parties. They have justified pursuing things that excluded other parties by saying that it was in the public interest. It never worked, and it was not right. Why are the Government trying to do it with this as well?
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60419-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am in danger of repeating my arguments. I am simply saying to all right hon. and hon. Members that the electoral officer has the integrity of the register at heart. Under clause 4, he is responsible for maintaining the register and its electoral integrity and, as part of that responsibility he may wish to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for an annual canvass. However, there may be circumstances in which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 178</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Secretary of State does not agree with that recommendation, and wishes to override it. In extremis, such decisions may be made on financial grounds, on grounds relating to the census itself and for a range of reasons. I accept that I am pleading with the House in future to trust the Secretary of State, whoever they are, but their reasons for such decisions will undoubtedly be made public. They will be contestable in the courts, and they will be open to judicial review and to question in the House, so there is a safeguard if the provision is used in extremis.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="60419-20_spnew6"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 None of those things may happen, although they are possibilities. The Minister may rule out my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and me, but is he not      concerned that representatives from all the democratically elected parties who sit in this House and who take up their obligations as Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland are deeply disturbed? Has he not been persuaded to think again by the united voice of the SDLP, the DUP and the Ulster Unionists? He must engender confidence in Northern Ireland, which he manifestly has not got.
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="60419-20_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. On a number of decisions I have not had the confidence of all the parties in this House, which is sometimes the nature of politics. As I have said, no one raised that concern in the consultation. I accept the concerns raised by hon. Members, and simply say that the power will be used only in extremis.

<a name="stpa_224">That is an important reason to request that a canvass should take place, but the Minister is in effect arguing that there may be an overriding reason to prevent that register being accurate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_169"><a name="60419-20_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. In extremis, the Secretary of State may find reasons to take that action, and I have tried to indicate to the Committee what they might be. As my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle has said, those reasons include a clash with the census, pressure from political parties and matters involving funding. Clause 4 allows, when responsibilities are determined, the chief electoral officer to ask the Secretary of State for an annual canvass. A future Secretary of State would decide not to accede to such a request only in extremis. However, I will not rule out the possibility that a future Secretary of State might make such a decision, in which case they would have to publish the reasons why, and such a decision would be open to both judicial review and the questioning of this House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="60419-20_spnew10"><b> Dr. McCrea: </b> 
 The Minister has put it on the record that nobody raised the matter in the consultation, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 179</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>parliamentary debates take place in this House. When did the Minister tell the parties that this power was being given to the Secretary of State? When in discussions did he make that point clear to the political parties and allow them to react to it, because my hon. Friends cannot remember that happening?
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60419-20_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 In the consultation, we outlined how the electoral officer&#039;s role will be undertaken when we discussed the role of the Secretary of State and others. If hon. Members are unhappy with the proposals before the Committee, they can vote against them today and they can be raised in another place. Obviously, we will examine the points that have been made in today&#039;s debate. In my view, it is essential that the chief electoral officer has a role in determining when the annual canvass takes place. The chief electoral officer will make those recommendations, but in extremis there may be reasons why a future Secretary of State determines that it is in the public interest not to undertake that canvass and rejects the request from the chief electoral officer.

<p>
<a name="60419-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_225">The professionals in this business are the chief electoral officer and his team. As the hon.

I believe very strongly that the integrity of the electoral register is paramount, because it is on that basis that I, and other hon. Members, speak in this House today. I understand hon. Members&#039; concerns, but I do not believe that they are founded in the likely actions of any future Secretary of State.

 To sum up the Minister&#039;s position, he seems to be saying that if a recommendation from the chief electoral officer were to be rejected, the Secretary of State would have to explain to the public the public interest reason for that. Would not it be far better simply to drop this provision, so that if some extreme circumstances were to arise in future, the Secretary of State could come to the House to explain what they were and could take action at that stage? The Minister has singularly failed to give a good reason why this open-ended provision should be in the Bill.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am sure that that is an alternative scenario that could equally well have been undertaken. However, I imagine that were the Secretary of State to do that at some point in the future&#151;in 2011, 2012, 2013 or 2014&#151;there would be an almighty row in this House, as there will be if the Secretary of State exercises the power under the Bill.

<a name="60419-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_229">It is a recurring theme that Ministers&#151;not this particular Minister, but the Government&#151;are becoming rather isolated on Northern Ireland business. Given that Sinn Fein Members do not take their seats in this House, the Labour party is frequently the only party putting forward the ideas that appear in the Bill. No other party from either side of the House, including the SDLP, is supporting the Government on any issue. Only yesterday, the Government were isolated when a Northern Ireland order was discussed upstairs. Perhaps the Minister should go away and reflect on a number of issues, including that one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_230">I was a little concerned&#151;although perhaps it should not have surprised me&#151;when the Minister said that if the chief electoral officer&#039;s recommendation were to be overridden, he would have the option of going public. Naively, I had assumed that the recommendation would have been made public in the first place. I would be happy for the Minister to intervene on me to clarify that matter. Perhaps I have missed the point, but I had assumed that the recommendation would automatically have been made public. It alarms me that that might not be the case. This will make the incestuous relationship between the Secretary of State and the chief electoral officer, to which I referred earlier, even more dangerous than I had originally assumed. I shall need to reflect on that.

 Does the hon.

The chief electoral officer will, as never before, be the Secretary of State&#039;s chief electoral officer. That is where the real weakness of the chief electoral officer will come from.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that observation. I do not want to put words into his mouth, but he seems to be suggesting that this is going to be a pretty low-grade job.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="60419-21_spnew9"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has teased out of the Minister an admission that is frankly horrifying.

 If we are honest, should we not admit that we have got ourselves into this mess because the Minister is trying to defend an indefensible position? The only way in which he could defend it honestly is by saying that he wants to give the Secretary of State the political wriggle room to make decisions about the electoral canvass in the political interests of a negotiation with one party or another. The chief electoral officer&#039;s objective guidance could therefore be overruled for reasons of political expediency, and everyone except the Minister feels that that would be very bad for democracy.

<br>



<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60419-23_spnew0"><b> Lorely Burt  (Solihull) (LD):</b> 
 The new clause deals with voter registration. In the absence of an annual canvass, it proposes that the electoral officer should confirm the existing details of everyone on the register on an annual basis. Every 12 months, households would be sent a form containing the details of all members whose names appear on the electoral register, and they would have to sign the form to confirm that their details were correct. Household members who wanted their names removed from the register could request that it be amended accordingly; alternatively, people could tick a box to ask for a registration form to ensure that a new member of the household appeared on the register in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_245">Asking people to confirm or amend their details is a simple exercise and would mean that they would not have to reregister every year. In addition, a much more accurate picture of the state of the register could be compiled. Although we are minded to withdraw the new clause so that the Minister has time to reflect on the matter, we give notice that we will resubmit the proposal on Report.
</p>





<p><a name="st_200"><a name="60419-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 I shall be very brief. We have looked at the new clause and have some sympathy with it, as we were not able to make progress on the previous two sets of amendments. I do not want to detain the Committee, but we will consider the proposal in greater detail if it is resubmitted at a later stage.
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="60419-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) for making it clear that she will withdraw the new clause. I feel that it revisits clause 2, which deals with the annual canvass; in essence, mailing households every year would amount to the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_246">The new clause would commit the CEO to undertaking an annual mailing to every household in Northern Ireland. Although that would not be an annual canvass of every individual, it would still amount to an annual canvass, by post, of every household. Earlier, the Committee agreed that there was no need to conduct an annual canvass, in part because of the cost implications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_247">The Electoral Office for Northern Ireland has estimated that it would cost some &#163;300,000 to issue forms to all the households in Northern Ireland. That would cover the cost of the initial posting&#151;which by itself would cost &#163;171,000 a year&#151;the reminder posting that is, sadly, always necessary in such cases, and the freepost envelopes that would also have to be provided. There would be no real benefit for electoral officers.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Apr 2006 : Column 188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_248">Later clauses provide that electoral officers will be able to examine a range of other ways to keep the register up to date. For example, they will be able to refer to the utility companies and other sources, and clause 4 also allows them to look at any method of keeping the register up to date.
</p>





<p><a name="st_202"><a name="60419-23_spnew3"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The Minister said that the provisions in the new clause would provide no real benefit for electoral officers, but the Bill means that there will be no direct connection with voters apart from the canvass to be held once every 10 years. The new clause is a way to prompt him to consider ways to reduce that span of time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_203"><a name="60419-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s logic about voter contact, but the Committee&#151;with, for once, the unanimous support of members of the Democratic Unionist party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives and other parties&#151;agreed that the annual canvass should be abolished, as provided by clause 2. There was no debate, and the decision was unanimous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_249">The new clause proposes that every household be mailed every year, but that would replicate much of what the annual canvass was designed to achieve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60419-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 I remind the Minister that we accepted clause 2 only on the basis that our amendments to clause 3 would be accepted. They would have provided the necessary checks and balances, but they were not accepted.
</p>





<p><a name="st_205"><a name="60419-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not trying to stir up opposition; I am simply making the point that an annual mailing to households would in part replicate the work of the annual canvass. The chief electoral officer will have power to obtain information from public authorities and others to help him to meet the relevant registration objectives under clause 4. That will help him to track changes to the relevant circumstances of individuals, and he or she will be able to identify people who are not on the register but may be entitled to be included. He or she will also be able to track 16 and 17-year-olds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_250">The new clause would be an additional burden, and I am grateful for the indication that it will be withdrawn, as it would replicate, in part, a provision that we are trying to remove.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="60419-23_spnew7"><b> Lorely Burt: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his clear and appropriate response, although I cannot agree that our proposal would equate substantially to an annual canvass. While the electoral officer is trying to contact all the utility companies and to cross-reference and check all the information, I respectfully submit that it would be just as easy, under the new clause, to get a clear and accurate view of who is on the register, for the avoidance of fraud and to deal with important issues on which everyone in the Chamber agrees. The new clause is not untoward in terms of cost or effort in relation to the rewards that it would bring. We shall withdraw it, but we shall resubmit it on Report&#151;

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the issue. Again, however, I am bowing to the will of the chief electoral officer, who has raised concerns with the Government about the potential for fraud if numbers of people registered in the late window; for example, he would not have time before polling day to verify personal identifiers on applications for postal votes. In that context, he has expressed concern about the risk of fraud in the absent vote process. The provisions to prevent individuals who register in the late window from applying for an absent vote reflect his advice to the Government.

Friend the Secretary of State considered it possible that an early election might help to facilitate a return to devolution in Northern Ireland. Obviously, the Government are very concerned to ensure that the Assembly returns to its rightful place as soon as possible, and we have considered different methods on a number of occasions to ensure that the Assembly is up and running in due course.

<br>&nbsp;<br>reasons why, following discussions with the parties, an early election may have been desirable on previous occasions. Again, I can speculate until the end of the sitting at 7 o&#039;clock this evening about what those reasons might be. The point is that we included in the Bill the ability to hold an early election if one were needed because of the circumstances of political discussions on the attempt to restore the Assembly, which the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) wishes to happen as a matter of urgency. If an early election was needed as part of those discussions, we could have called one if the Bill was passed as drafted.

<a name="stpa_261">Following my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#039;s announcement on 6 April, it is clear that the provisions for an early election will not be required, because we have recalled the Assembly for 15 May and set it a deadline of establishing an Executive, if possible, by 24 November, or thereabouts. I forget the exact date, but from memory I think that it is 24 November. We have said that, if the Assembly is not restored by that date, there will be no election for the Assembly. So an early election is not necessary. The circumstances for an early election could have been myriad, and I will not speculate on what could have happened in discussions with the DUP, the UUP, the SDLP, or Sinn Fein, which is not present today.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60419-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 The situation has changed dramatically. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Irish Government, with the response of the Taoiseach on 6 April, have put a different political complexion on the way in which the Assembly could be restored. The Government&#039;s prime objective is to restore the Assembly; that is what we want to achieve. We want to get the Assembly back up and running so that individuals, some of whom are in the Chamber today, can undertake their rightful role of deciding policy on issues to do with housing, culture, sport, planning, agriculture and other matters.

When the Bill was published, the Government&#039;s proposals were to meet the parties, to have discussions with them and to have an outlook of reaching agreement with them to ensure that devolution came back. As part of the armoury of that machinery, an early election may well have been one of the issues that would have led to the unlocking of any impasse that might have been there. Now we have set a clear route in terms of 15 May, discussions, the potential election of an Executive, a deadline for that process and, at the end of that, no elections if an Executive is not formed. We are now in a different position, so I am in the unusual position of not voting for the clauses that we originally envisaged because circumstances have changed.

 Could not people including Members of the House easily take the view that the Government are making it up as they go along?

Is it not the case that, within a very short time, the Government changed gear and completely changed their policy? People in Northern Ireland take the view that the Government are simply making it up as they go along.

 We would love to take great comfort in the journey that these three clauses have made from being necessary as a contingency to being utterly redundant in a matter of weeks. If they had made that journey by going past the certainty of a restoration date and a known future election date for the Assembly, we could have taken such comfort, but, in the absence of such certainty, we cannot. As the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) has said, it seems that the Government are busking on this issue and hoping that whatever happens catches the eye of somebody who passes by.

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="60419-25_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Again, I am trying to offer some form of clarity to the House on behalf of the Government. We want to see the Assembly restored. We are happy to look at any method that will get the Assembly restored, because the rightful people to run the affairs of Northern Ireland are the people who were elected to that Assembly to do so; not me, who represents a seat in north Wales and who flies in and does a job on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland at that time, but ultimately flies out again. The people who are elected and have roots in that community should do that job. As I hope the hon. Member for Foyle recognises, we are looking at the best way to unlock the real gridlock problems that exist between political parties in restoring the Assembly.

<a name="stpa_265">I am happy to look at any suggestions that will unlock that gridlock.

In the absence of those talks, we have put a framework in place whereby we hope those issues can be resolved during the time scale of May to November. In the light of that time scale being put in place, the clauses are redundant. That is the simple fact of the matter.

<a name="stpa_266">If people want to call that a U-turn or a change of Bill, that is fine. I am very unused to withdrawing clauses in a Bill that I supported only six or seven weeks ago in this Chamber on Second Reading, but that is the nature of Northern Ireland politics. Our overriding objective is the same: to restore the Assembly. That is why I commend the withdrawal of these clauses. The Government are looking at a different way of achieving the same objective to make sure that colleagues are back in government as soon as possible.

<br>&nbsp;<br>State and that would have to be taken forward by means of an order in both Houses of Parliament. If the Government have concluded that the Secretary of State is not, under any circumstances, going to want to exercise that power in the time frame that they had previously envisaged, such a power clearly becomes otiose and so there is no point in keeping it in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_268">The political explanation seems to be that, when the Government started off their current political initiative in Northern Ireland at the beginning of this calendar year, they were over-optimistic in their hopes about what could be achieved within a short space of time. They hoped that, perhaps by now, they would have had agreement between the various Northern Ireland parties on the restoration of the devolved institutions. After all, there was open speculation in the media both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic&#151;and I think that it is fair to say that there were suggestions by Ministers themselves&#151;that either in Committee or on Report, we might be presented with proposals to change the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to accommodate changes that might by then have been agreed between the two Governments and the various political parties in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_269">Such a deal has clearly not taken place. We could debate today, albeit somewhat fruitlessly, the precise circumstances in which the power in clause 10 could have been used. We can reflect on the reasons why no agreement has been possible up until now. Some of the problems were of the Government&#039;s own making due to the proposals on terrorists on the run. The Independent Monitoring Commission report that was published earlier this year, which clearly showed that although republicanism was changing, it had not broken with criminality, made things more difficult for the Government. Ministers, and perhaps the Prime Minister especially, finally realised that the underlying mistrust was still deep and could not be overcome in a few weeks, which had perhaps been hoped for at the turn of the year.

<a name="60419-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_270">I remain of the view that the Government&#039;s initiative looking forward to November deserves support.

In the meantime, my party and I will support the Minister in his recommendation that the clauses be dropped from the Bill.

Will she reflect on the position that her party and its then leader, David Trimble, adopted regarding the Assembly election scheduled for May 2003? Her party was instrumental in ensuring that that election was delayed, primarily because its then leader feared the consequences if his policies were put to the people of Northern Ireland. Does she regret the fact that her party played a role in that manoeuvre?

 I am enormously grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that election result. The Prime Minister, in his Harbour Commission speech of October 2002, made it clear that the Assembly election would not take place until after acts of completion. There were no acts of completion by the scheduled date, so the Assembly election did not go ahead. The then MP for Upper Bann did not have the power to take back the words that the Prime Minister had spoken in October 2002. I therefore thank the hon. Gentleman for his reminder.

 Does the hon. Lady think, looking back on what happened in Northern Ireland, that a fear of election results dominated the situation? Let us not argue about whether or not we should have held elections. The argument was that they did not want the Unionist people to be heard. When they were heard, they did not like it so they decided to do away with the Assembly. We had nothing to do with the pulling down of the Assembly, as the hon. Lady well knows.

 The retreat is an admission by the Government that their strategy on elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the restoration of the    Northern Ireland Assembly is in tatters. The Government were hoping that there would be a change of heart among the people of Northern Ireland, that the people would be prepared to see the Assembly up and running again and that the people would be prepared to trust Sinn Fein. They were therefore hoping to use those powers to call an early election to try to change the political composition of the Assembly at an early stage.

Nothing has been done to engender the trust that Sinn Fein should be admitted to government. I take heart from the Minister&#039;s retreat because, although we are not afraid of an election, it means that the Minister, the Secretary of State and the Government recognise that early elections to change the political landscape is a ploy that will not work.

<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60419-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Walker  (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for being granted this opportunity to voice my concerns about the future of mental health services in Hertfordshire. As hon. Members on both sides of the House recognise, mental illness deserves our attention. For too long it has been overlooked and it has suffered in comparison with the more emotive and better understood diseases. However, mental health problems will afflict one in five of our constituents during their lifetime. For many, it will be a passing illness that can be treated and, thankfully, left behind. For others, however, it will be a life sentence both for themselves and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_288">In Hertfordshire, we are lucky to have an excellent mental health trust that does incredible work in supporting people with mental health problems. The Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust makes a real difference to the quality of people&#039;s lives. However, recent demands for budget cuts are casting a long shadow over the trust and its ability to deliver critical services to the community that it serves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_289">At the start of this year, the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust was informed that it had to make a year-on-year saving of more than &#163;5 million&#151;a figure that equates to just over 5 per cent. of its annual budget. To put it another way, based on the figures that the Minister gave the House yesterday, it represents 30 per cent. of the total savings being demanded from mental health trusts across the country. The trust was told that the saving was required as part of its contribution to meeting an overspend in the wider Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire health economy. That overspend is estimated to be close to &#163;100 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_290">The Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust has played no part in creating that deficit. It has lived within its means since its inception in 2001. It has managed its budget efficiently and delivered value for money. Not unreasonably, one might be forgiven for thinking that that is the sort of financial performance that should be rewarded and held up as an example of best practice across the NHS. Instead, the trust is being penalised by a severe budget cut of more than &#163;5 million. What message does that send out to other trusts struggling to balance their books? Penalising them for the debts incurred by their more profligate neighbours will certainly not encourage them to behave in a fiscally prudent fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_291">The scale of the cuts being asked of the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust will have a severe impact on services across the county. In Hertfordshire, we face the following measures: closure of a 22-bed in-patient mental health ward; a reduction in direct-action psychology services; a reduction in day services; closure of the early-intervention psychosis service; reductions in the staffing for community mental health teams; the closure of an acute day treatment unit; staff reductions in mental health in-patient therapies; a reduction in services for people with alcohol and mental health problems; the closure of a day care unit that supports older people with mental health problems and their

<br>&nbsp;<br>carers; a reduction in staff working in child and adolescent mental health services; and a reduction in support for people with learning difficulties. In total, those cuts could lead to more than 70 job losses and have an impact on more than 10,000 service users across the county. The services scheduled for cuts are not &quot;nice-to-haves&quot; on the periphery of the trust&#039;s offering; they are absolutely critical to many of their users.

It ignores the possibility that many carers will have to give up work in order to support patients losing day care services.

<a name="stpa_301">The cuts proposed for Hertfordshire&#039;s mental health services run contrary to the vision recently outlined in the Government consultation document entitled &quot;Investing in Your Mental Health&quot;. That blueprint for the future delivery of mental health services makes many useful suggestions. In particular, it highlights the need for more local care and support to be provided through community-based services. Importantly, the White Paper makes it clear that any reduction in acute beds is possible only as a by-product of effective community services rather than as a precursor to their development.

For example, his South East Hertfordshire primary care trust has received more than &#163;155 million in the past financial year, which will rise to more than &#163;209 million in 2007&#150;08. Collectively, the eight primary care trusts in Hertfordshire received allocations in excess of &#163;858 million in 2005&#150;06, which will rise to &#163;1.1 billion in 2007&#150;08&#151;an increase of about 28 per cent.

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_319">There are now some six assertive outreach teams with about 50 staff, compared to 29 staff in 2001. Six crisis assessment and treatment teams operate across Hertfordshire, compared to none in 2001. Those teams saw nearly 2,000 people last year, some 300 of them from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, and 1,200 were new clients. In the past, the vast majority of those patients would have been admitted to an acute mental health unit, but now they can be seen in the community. That kind of approach has reduced the need for in-patient beds.

<a name="60419-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_320">Members often tell the House that an in-patient ward or unit is closing.

I accept, however, that today we are also discussing changes in the way in which early outreach teams may be offered in the future.

<a name="stpa_321">It is the question of whether people are treated in the community or in in-patient facilities that is most upsetting to campaigners against the cuts. I received a letter today from all the numerous organisations in Hertfordshire that oppose the cuts. The second point in the letter is as follows:

<a name="stpa_323">How can the Minister justify that, given that it involves one of the three priority areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_324">Why did the Prime Minister not mention mental health during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time? He mentioned cardiac care. Is this not the problem&#151;that mental health is always the subject that is left out?
</p>





<p><a name="st_263"><a name="60419-28_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I believe that our action in putting mental health up there as one of the three priorities is the reason for many of the changes that have taken place. I accept some of what the hon. Gentleman has said&#151;for instance, what he said about the early intervention team&#151;and I shall say more about it later, but I would vigorously defend the record in terms of changes in mental health services, and the increased investment in those services over the past two years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_325">When I met the chief executive of the trust yesterday, we discussed some of the changes. There have been significant reductions in spending on agency staff, and the trust should be congratulated on that. I believe that in 2003 some &#163;3.1 million was spent per year on agency staff; that was reduced to &#163;524,000 last year, owing to a successful policy of recruitment to vacancies. Over the same period, spending on agency nursing staff was reduced from &#163;2.2 million to &#163;1.1 million. The trust now employs 506 psychiatric nurses&#151;62 per cent. more than in 2001&#151;and 75 consultant psychiatrists, 78 per cent. more than in 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_326">It is also proposed that some &#163;350,000 be invested in a primary care counselling service model&#151;the hon. Gentleman referred to the need for more counselling services. That will offer a range of therapeutic interventions for those with mild to moderate mental health problems. If this model, which is currently out for public consultation, is supported, it is anticipated that it will reduce demands on community mental health teams and referrals to psychiatrists. In addition, the trust has improved work force efficiency by cutting staff turnover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_327">As I said, there have been some very impressive improvements in the delivery of local services, along with increased investment. But it is true that the health economy in Hertfordshire as a whole faces financial challenges, and that some tough decisions have to be made to address the situation. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is important that organisations get a grip on of the problems that have built up. The task of commissioning mental health services in Hertfordshire falls to the joint commissioning partnership board, which includes representatives from Hertfordshire PCTs and Hertfordshire county council. Each organisation contributes to a pooled budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_328">Hertfordshire PCTs have asked all providers in the area to make expenditure savings, and as the hon. Gentleman said, Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust has been asked to make a 5 per cent. saving, which is the same as that being asked of all local providers. Decisions on where to ask the trust to make these savings were not taken lightly. At a special meeting of the joint commissioning partnership board on 16 February, it was faced with the very difficult task of considering where such savings could be made. It took a strategic overview of service provision, to ensure that the impact 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on patient services was kept to a minimum. Having considered the various options, it agreed a proposed list of savings totalling some &#163;3.2millon, in addition to the &#163;1.7 million-worth of internal efficiency savings already being made. Formal consultation on the proposed changes started on 20 March and will run until 3 May. It is important that Members encourage their constituents&#151;as they doubtless will&#151;to engage as fully as possible in the consultation, to ensure that their views are taken into consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_329">The hon. Gentleman set out some of the issues being considered during the consultation period that cause particular difficulties for those affected. However, it is important to recognise that strategic health authorities, trusts and PCTs need to work together to ensure that the whole health economy in a given area gets back on to a stable footing. I know from my conversations with them that NHS staff need to be reassured that the deficits that have built up over years will be sorted out. Uncertainty can affect both patients and staff, and decisions about how to proceed must be made jointly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_330">The local NHS trust is currently discussing the proposed service changes with staff, and I know that every effort will be made to avoid redundancies. If necessary, and where possible, staff will be redeployed to different teams. Although it is proposed that the St. Julian ward should close&#151;as I understand it achieving savings of some &#163;1.4 million, of which &#163;400,000 will be reinvested in community services&#151;I emphasise that the changes already introduced mean that more people are treated in the community, with the result that they receive attention earlier and do not have to go into patient care.

 The St. Julian ward is the only one in that part of Hertfordshire offering respite to carers whose loved ones are desperately ill. Will the Minister therefore ensure that the consultation process considers its proposed closure very carefully?
</p>





<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60419-29_spnew1"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I assure the hon. Gentleman that the trust will be made aware of this debate, but I hope that he, and the other Opposition Members present, will agree that it is right for the local NHS to get back on an even keel. The proposed changes are subject to consultation: although difficult decisions will have to be taken, I assure the House that every effort is being made to ensure that there is only minimum disruption to services and to jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60419-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">As I have said, the work of the local NHS trust has been extremely impressive. These are difficult decisions, but I repeat that I have been assured that any disruption to services will be kept to a minimum, and that some of the savings will be reinvested in alternative provision.I understand how strongly some hon. Members feel about this matter, and hope that my remarks have helped to reassure them.
