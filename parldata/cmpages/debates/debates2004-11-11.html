<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41111-01_spnew0"><b> 1. Mr. Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): What steps he is taking to promote take-up of the child care element of the working tax credit. [197384]
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41111-01_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 The child care element has been a success, and more than 340,000 UK families are now benefiting from child care help within the working tax credit. That is 89 per cent. higher than the peak of 180,000 under the working families tax credit and the disabled person&#039;s tax credit, and more than seven times more than the number of families benefiting from the child care disregard in family credit. We continue to promote tax credits in a variety of ways, including TV advertising, press campaigns and direct mailing. We also work in partnership with child care providers, including representatives of the Daycare Trust and the National Childminding Association, to ensure that parents using formal child care are aware of the support that they can receive with costs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41111-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lazarowicz: </b> 
 The child care element is certainly good news for many of my constituents, not just because of the benefit that it provides to families, but because it enables the provision of excellent child care in centres such as the North Edinburgh child care centre, which is in my constituency. But as my right hon. Friend has pointed out, there are still people who need this benefit who are not getting it. Can she look at ways of encouraging employers in particular to work closely with the Inland Revenue to ensure maximum take-up of this important credit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41111-01_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I would like to congratulate my hon. Friend, who is working very hard on this issue in his constituency. He should not undervalue the work that Members of Parliament can do with their local employers and trade unions to publicise the availability not only of the child care tax credit, but, from next April, of the &#163;50 a week payment to families, which will be tax and national insurance free. Some 40 per cent. of employees have dependent children. One in four women

<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 906</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>return to full-time work within the first year, and the average cost to employers in recruitment and re-training is &#163;4,300. The Inland Revenue is working with the Daycare Trust and with employers to supply detailed information, and to ensure that such information is available to help not only employees and their families, but the firms themselves, which will then be able to retain their staff and develop their business.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41111-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paul Goodman  (Wycombe)</b> 
 (Con): The Select Committee on Work and Pensions, which is of course dominated by members of the Paymaster General&#039;s own party, said that the child care tax credit is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;not consistent with a childcare vision based on choices made by parents and families themselves, since it is only available to some of them&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">the &quot;some&quot; being those who work in the labour market. Is it not time that we had a simpler system of funding child care, so that choices can be shaped by parents themselves and not by the Chancellor?
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41111-01_spnew4"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 That question simply demonstrates that the hon. Gentleman does not understand&#151;perhaps because his party has never had a national child care strategy&#151;exactly what is on offer to parents. The child care tax credit is available to working parents on low and middle incomes for 70 per cent. of costs. That can be as much as &#163;94 a week for those with a maximum of one child, and &#163;140 a week for those with more than two children. In addition, this Government have increased child benefit&#151;the previous Government froze it&#151;and invested in nursery education, children&#039;s centres and Sure Start. Furthermore, next April we are making available to every family who wish to claim it &#163;50, tax and national insurance free, to help toward their child care costs. That defends quality, provides good outcomes for children and gives parents choice.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend has rightly set out Labour&#039;s very impressive record in putting child care at the centre of our economic life and ensuring its importance. Has she noticed that another party is talking about how important it is? Were she to match it&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41111-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. So far, so good, but perhaps the Paymaster General will answer the question now.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41111-01_spnew7"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I have noticed that a certain party did nothing when in power to invest in child care; for example, unlike this Government, it did not invest in nurseries. Now, it promises to spend &#163;4 billion that it cannot find, having already committed itself to cutting child care as part of its proposed &#163;20 billion-worth of public expenditure cuts.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41111-01_spmin1"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Paul Boateng): </b> 
 The Government have no intention of introducing tax relief for expenditure on private dental insurance, as doing so would be wasteful, poorly targeted and inequitable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41111-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 That is a very disappointing reply. I know that the Government are trying to turn things round and that six new NHS dental suites will open in my Pendle constituency next year&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> They did not expect to hear that from me. The point is that in parts of my constituency there is an NHS dental desert and people are being forced to follow their dentist into the private sector. The nearest dentist with an open NHS list is 30 or 40 miles away, so it is totally impractical for elderly people and others to travel that distance. It seems fair and equitable that, in circumstances where people are forced to take out private dental insurance, they should have the money reimbursed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41111-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 It is neither fair nor equitable. Indeed, it would be a waste of the taxpayers&#039; money currently going into NHS dentistry support teams, which are benefiting my hon. Friend&#039;s and other primary care trusts to the extent of some &#163;9 million. That is on top of the additional resources that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced only recently. I would hope that my hon. Friend would welcome that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41111-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Damian Green  (Ashford)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister should be aware that the NHS dentistry crisis will eventually land in the Treasury. The constituents of the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) are relatively well off. In the town of Ashford, the bulk of my constituency, there are 12 NHS dental practices, not one of which is accepting new NHS patients. Last week, one of them wrote to all its patients saying that they had to take up private insurance because it was no longer practising NHS dentistry. For the bulk of my constituents, NHS dentistry no longer exists. If the Chief Secretary carries on with the complacent tone that he adopts in his answers, I am afraid that constituents will recognise that the Government do not care about the future of NHS dentistry.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41111-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 I am not complacent at all. I recognise that there is a problem, albeit a localised one. I also expect right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House to recognise where the origin of the problem lies. It lies in the disastrous contract of 1990 and in the cuts in training places and expenditure that characterised the Conservative party&#039;s stewardship of the NHS. It is the same old policy of cuts and charges&#151;that is the Tory way. Our way is additional investment in training places and in provisions that are leading to increased and improved dental facilities up and down the country.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41111-01_spnew12"><b> Roger Casale  (Wimbledon)</b> 
 (Lab): May I draw my right hon. Friend&#039;s attention to an article in this week&#039;s <i>Wimbledon News</i>, which focuses on the work of the local primary care trust in raising standards in four NHS dental services locally? Will he continue to invest in increasing capacity and raising standards, and will he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 908</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reject the call of my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and Conservative Members, who talk down the health service, to subsidise private medicine?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41111-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 I have no difficulty at all in rejecting that call and I am glad that my hon. Friend recognises the extra &#163;368 million investment placed by the Government in NHS dentistry, which is leading to increases in the work force with 1,000 additional dentists by October 2005 and an extra 170 undergraduate training places. We are also giving more powers to primary care trusts to decide how to spend their money. We should compare and contrast that with the closure of two dental schools and the cut of &#163;200 million in real spending on NHS dentistry under the Conservative Administration in the mid-1990s. It is the same old story: cuts and charges as against investment and training. That is the difference between them and us.

 The Chancellor&#039;s 66 stealth taxes and his borrowing and spending programme have caused personal debt in this country to reach &#163;1 trillion.

 The hon. Lady does not seem to understand that we have the lowest inflation for 40 years, the lowest average interest rates for 30 years and the lowest unemployment for 25 years.

We have done what the Conservative party always failed to do, and we have low inflation, rising growth and employment, and more investment in the public services.

Does he think that that feel-bad factor is something that the Prime Minister&#039;s new council of economic advisers should look at?
</p>

 There are more people on fixed and long-term mortgages than previously, and that was the subject of the Miles report at the time of the previous Budget. We continue to look at these matters to secure a more successful housing market in the UK. Although house prices are moderating and an adjustment is taking place, it should be noted that low interest rates and low mortgage rates have meant that the level of repossessions last year was at its lowest for 20 years. We continue to give people advice on personal debt problems and other issues, and we will continue to improve our services to deal with companies that unfairly charge extortionate interest rates. However, the secret for the long term is economic stability based on low inflation and low interest rates.

I gave a report to Parliament last year about the importance of flexibility, convergence, investment, the role of financial services and employment to a decision on the euro, and I have no reason to change my judgment that those are the important factors that have to be taken into account. I should have thought that the hon.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41111-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I have to say to my hon.

But we have to get it right, which is why the five tests are important. In particular, we would need more flexible European and British economies and we would need sustainable convergence, which&#151;with the large differential in interest rates&#151;we clearly do not have at present.

More than 50 per cent. of our trade is with Europe, and the single market opens up opportunities for British firms. If we were in the euro there would be a cut in transaction costs, and he must acknowledge that. If we could achieve the increased trade that I have mentioned, economic growth would increase, but the circumstances must be right for the UK.

We shall come to the issue in the Budget next year when I report to the House. If we thought it right to pursue another assessment, we would make another assessment; if we think it is not right to do so, we will not. That is the position that has been agreed by the Government and I believe it commands wider support in the country than the position of the Conservatives, who would never join, and the position of the Liberals, who seem to want to join irrespective of what is happening.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="41111-03_spmin0"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b> 
 The level of taxation is one of a number of factors influencing the economy. The Government&#039;s approach balances finance to improve public services with fairness and sustainable growth, and our tax policies have been successful in delivering stability with strong growth and low inflation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_45"><a name="41111-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 After 66 tax rises, equivalent to a 16.5p increase in the basic rate of income tax, together with a huge increase in public borrowing, when will the Government come clean and advise the British people by how much they will have to increase tax to bridge the growing black hole between their income and their spending plans?
</p>








<p><a name="st_46"><a name="41111-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s figures are quite wrong. On the basis that he uses, there have been 200 tax cuts since 1997, as well. The fact is that there has been a remarkable transformation in the British economy since 1997. Between 1979 and 1997, the UK was the least stable of all the G7 countries except for Canada. Since 1997, we have been the most stable of all&#151;bar none. That is a remarkable transformation and the best foundation for national prosperity and improving public services, and our tax policy has helped to deliver that remarkable improvement.

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41111-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a telling point. The fact is, of course, that the Conservative party&#039;s sums simply do not add up. What is important for everybody in the UK is that we maintain the remarkable record of stability and growth that we have achieved since 1997.

<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41111-03_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 In recent days I have talked to Finance Ministers in Europe and America about our proposed international finance facility. I shall raise the matter at European and G20 meetings next week. Our aim is to secure progress on both debt relief and finance for development during our presidency of the G7 in 2005.
</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41111-03_spnew12"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The non-governmental organisations are generally complimentary about the Government&#039;s record on aid, debt and trade, but there is an emerging worry about the European Union&#039;s attitude to the economic partnership agreements that it is negotiating. The NGOs worry that some of the issues that we have taken out of the Doha round, such as the Singapore issues, are being reintroduced by the back door. Does my right hon. Friend share that worry, and does he believe that we should address it in our presidency of the EU next year?
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="41111-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I think it is important, as our presidency of the EU will focus, as will Britain&#039;s G7 presidency, on getting an agreement with the World Trade Organisation, and we hope that will happen during the course of next year. That agreement would open up huge trading opportunities for many parts of the world, including Africa. We are also concerned&#151;I think this is the gist of my hon. Friend&#039;s question as well&#151;that African countries should have the capacity to benefit from an opening up of trade, and we will deal with the problems of the most vulnerable if trade is more open in the future. It is these two issues that our proposed international finance facility is able to address; in other words, if we are to make an impact on these problems, we will need substantially more resources.

Will he set a timetable for reaching a final decision so that the international finance facility can be up and running and we will start to see some benefit from it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41111-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I applaud my hon. Friend for the work that he has done in promoting these issues throughout the country. It is important to recognise not only that support is growing for the international finance facility as a proposal but that five countries in the past year have committed themselves to reaching 0.7 per cent. for development aid over the next few years. Substantial progress is now being made in discussions about multilateral debt relief as a result of pressure from people in this country such as the Churches, the non-governmental organisations and others. I believe that 2005 can be an important year when we will make a breakthrough. Many countries support the proposal. We also propose a pilot of the international finance facility with the vaccination and immunisation fund so that it can front-load its effort to save lives by making vaccination possible. I believe that progress is being made, but next year when so many people will be active&#151;there will be a United Nations summit as well as G7 meetings&#151;will be an important year for all of us.

 As investment in high standards and skills is central to the achievement of our aim of high and stable levels of growth, we have raised investment in schools from &#163;2,500 per pupil to &#163;5,500 by 2008. Apprenticeships have increased from 70,000 to 250,000, and the number of students in colleges and universities has increased by almost 1 million.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41111-04_spnew0"><b> Lawrie Quinn: </b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend aware of the Confederation of British Industry survey that was published at the conference earlier this week that showed that 98 per cent. of companies&#039; human resources directors are calling for an increase in the provision of vocational education? However, only a quarter of business leaders say that their company is involved in the design and delivery of such training. If companies played a greater role in the creation of such courses, would not there be a beneficial return not only to the companies but to the wider economy? Is there not a gap that the Government want to bridge between the long-termism and optimism of HR directors and the short-termism of some financial directors?
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41111-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has taken a long-term interest in these matters, and he is right that we need to invest more. We also need a partnership involving employers, employees and Government so that, instead of being a nation in which 7 million people are without basic skills and instead of falling behind in some vital skills compared with other nations, we invest properly in the quantity and quality of education.

That can be done only if the nation has a wholehearted commitment to investing in training and education.

 My hon. Friend, who takes a big interest in these matters, is absolutely right. The productivity gap between ourselves and, for example, the United States is greater in retail than in some sectors of manufacturing. In the long term, we must invest more in the training of workers in the service industries, as he suggests. It is interesting that a number of very large companies that have not been involved in training, either through apprenticeships or other means, are now involving themselves, which is indeed the way forward. I believe that a partnership involving management, work forces and the Government, each accepting the responsibility for the future, is the only way forward for a country that will compete not just against the rest of Europe and America, but increasingly against China, India and Asia. We need to be the highest skilled nation, which is what such investment and resources can achieve.

 My hon.

But we must have recurrent and lifelong training available, so that adults can choose a second career and, in some cases, a third and fourth career if it becomes absolutely necessary. That is why the employer training pilots, which unfortunately were not supported by the Opposition, are making such a big impact, which is why employers are now saying that the policy should apply nationally. Again, that demands resources, and we must make a choice: the nation&#039;s long-term priorities require us to invest in education and training.

 Overpayments of tax credits are collected from continuing payments of tax credits wherever possible. There are limits on the amounts by which current payments can be reduced, depending on the claimant&#039;s circumstances. If there are no continuing payments, the money is collected direct and payments can be made over a 12-month period.

 I am sure that the Paymaster-General accepts that the recovery of overpayments can seriously affect the finances of low-income families, yet all attempts to discover the scale of the chaos have been stonewalled. It affects 455,000 families. The Auditor-General concluded that the scale of the errors is unacceptably high, which led him to qualify his audit opinion. Will she accept his demand to provide full information far earlier than July next year, which is her current plan, and preferably before the next general election.

 No inheritance tax is paid on the first &#163;263,000 of any estate.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of inheritance tax&#151;to raise the starting point and thereafter to have a low marginal rate but with no exceptions made on amounts that are subject to the tax?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41111-05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I am satisfied with our approach. We had to take steps to close several avoidance schemes and I believe that that was the right thing to do. A big change in the threshold or reduction in the rate would lead to cuts in public services. I was struck by the comment made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who is reported in an interview published last week as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<a name="stpa_14">I think that he is right&#151;it is not a high priority for most people. Most people want continuing investment in public services and, as it stands, inheritance tax is making an important contribution to that.

I urge the Government to hold fast on inheritance tax.
</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41111-05_spnew14"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. Only about 32,000 estates&#151;5 per cent. of the total and thus a very small proportion&#151;are likely to pay inheritance tax this year. I think that the balance on inheritance tax is about right.

It is only right that I should add to the comments made by the Prime Minister to express deep sympathy and condolences to the Palestinian people on the death of Yasser Arafat.

Will he share my concern at the way the Post Office is dealing in a very cavalier manner with sub-post office closures, when the clear intent of the Government and the whole House, in voting for that legislation, was that the viability of sub-post offices in the most deprived urban areas should be safeguarded?

<br>&nbsp;<br>specific concerns. The other side of the coin, as has been acknowledged, is that the Government have provided huge amounts of money to ensure that the Post Office can get through the transitional phase that it is undergoing at the moment. In those consultations, the difficulty, as has been acknowledged in debates in the House, is that post offices are often private small businesses and must enter into arrangements with the Post Office, particularly if they are loss-making, which creates a difficult set of circumstances.

Given the Prime Minister&#039;s stated priority of dealing with climate change as part of the G8 and EU presidencies, I endorse the need for the Prime Minister to make a statement when he returns from Washington next week. Is it not time that the Government, who are reviewing their climate change strategy, found time for a debate on climate change itself? If I recall correctly, our only opportunity to debate the subject in the last few months was an Opposition day debate on a Tory motion, which was subsequently withdrawn. Will my hon.

I declare a past interest, having been an adviser to the British Legion on VE-day and VJ-day remembrance. We created an instant poppy card that brings in revenue of millions of pounds, in addition to the traditional form of fund-raising for the British Legion. It is very difficult nowadays.

Will the hon.

<a name="stpa_47">The origins of this debate lie in the many conversations that I and my colleagues have had in recent months with general practitioners and those who work in family doctor services. In the years since the 1999 legislation, when fundholding and GP commissioning were lost, GPs have become progressively divorced from the control of primary care as locality commissioning turned into primary care groups and then primary care trusts. The PCTs are no longer the local representative bodies for GPs and health professionals that they should be. Instead, they have become the local representatives of the Department of Health.
</p>

<p>

 The hon. Lady is completely wrong.

Immediately after the 1997 election, the Government said that they were going to develop locality commissioning.

Instead, the outcome is that PCTs are dictated to by the Department of Health.

My constituent asked me to find out from the local PCT what effort was being made to tackle the problem, and what support was available for people like her. The PCT told me that as the disease was not part of the Government&#039;s national service frameworks, no particular support could be provided. Does my hon.

What I said in my opening remarks is born of experience. Recently, a constituent of mine was trying to access mental health services. She and I talked about her efforts for a considerable time, and in the course of our conversation I asked her what her GP had said. She told me that her doctor was fantastic and sympathetic, but that he had no say in the matter, nor any control over what services were available. That is dictated by the primary care trust. My hon.

<a name="stpa_51">This year, in the context of a new GP contract, GPs were looking for a more assured future and for a sense of support for and direction of family services, but unfortunately they have not found that. For example, the contract implies that GPs will take responsibility for the delivery of improved management of chronic disease. However, GPs then hear the Secretary of State say that regional chronic disease centres are to be established and that 3,000 community matrons are to be recruited to look after the elderly with chronic diseases. There was no mention of the role of GPs. They believe that they provide a service to patients as self-employed practitioners, contracted with the NHS. However, they are increasingly dictated to by PCTs and the Department of Health.

 The hon.

He said that many more GPs are now salaried and he suggested that that was a problem. I represent a valleys constituency that has found it very difficult to recruit traditional-style GPs, so the advent of the salaried GP has led to a dramatic improvement in provision locally.

 Far be it from me ever to think that what the hon. Gentleman says is odd.

<a name="41111-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_58">Dr. Lakhani is right in what he says and right to say it. The Government cannot have it both ways. If, as I suspect, they know that they will achieve their aims only through recreating the innovation, energy and responsiveness of GP fundholding, they cannot at the same time put GPs on to a treadmill of providing services as dictated by the Department of Health. The Government cannot seek to recreate the benefits of fundholding and, at the same time, devalue the leading role of family doctor services in primary care.

 Does the hon.

 The point is not that NHS Direct is undesirable as a means of accessing NHS services, nor that walk-in centres are undesirable as a means of improving diversity of provision. We are in favour of diversity of provision. I have spoken about the importance of extending the role of nurses, for example. However, it is important for GPs to be focused on the things that they do best, such as diagnosis and the

<br>&nbsp;<br>management of chronic disease. My objection was&#151;and the hon. Gentleman will recall that this was the subject of his first intervention&#151;that the Secretary of State announces that, for example, the NHS will recruit community matrons who will be responsible for the provision of services to the most elderly, who have a range of co-morbidities and who suffer from chronic diseases. Those are precisely the patients whose care GPs, as family doctors, are best equipped to manage. The relationship between community nursing and GPs is at the heart of the issue, but that is not what the Secretary of State said. It is not that diversity of provision is wrong&#151;far from it&#151;but we need to understand the central role of the GP and family doctor service.

But that is the same Government who eroded the very access to family doctors that people who commute to city centres need. Commuters and office workers want to be able to visit their own GP practice in the evening or on Saturday morning, but those opportunities have gone. The consequence of the contract and the unwillingness of PCTs to commission those services from GPs has meant the abandonment of Saturday morning surgeries across the country.

They want their PCT to commission them to provide Saturday morning surgeries, but they are not being given the commission, so they have been forced to cancel Saturday morning surgeries.

<a name="stpa_61">It is fundamentally untrue to say that GPs have been forced to do any of those things. The GPs were offered a contract and negotiated it. They wanted to be relieved of those responsibilities and chose to be relieved of them.

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="41111-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 The Minister knows perfectly well that, under the terms of the contract, out of hours was defined such that if a continuing level of access to service was required it would have to be commissioned as a locally enhanced service. That is all we seek&#151;a locally enhanced service. We discussed the GP contract on 8 July 2003 for the sum total of one and a half hours&#151;such is the nature of parliamentary proceedings. On that occasion, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;I know from my work as a constituency MP that our constituents place a high premium on around-the-clock access to a GP, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is a defining characteristic of our primary care services. I can give the hon. Member for South Staffordshire the assurances he seeks: we will implement the agreement to ensure that there is no loss of access to out-of-hours services.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8 July 2003; Vol. 408, c. 1050.]</p>

<a name="41111-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_63">For the reasons I have given, we need to be clear about the future of the family doctor service. My colleagues and I are clear. We believe that the relationship between patient and doctor is vital. That does not mean that a patient should necessarily see their own GP every time they visit a practice; nor does it mean that they have to see a doctor if that is not necessary, as the hon. Member for Bury, North pointed out in his intervention. The role of nurses and other health professionals is expanding and it makes good sense to focus scarce medical time on the tasks for which medics are actually needed. However, what that relationship means is that patients want to know that their health needs are understood, seen in context and that one illness is not treated without an understanding of the range of further illnesses and complications that they may experience. That is what patients are concerned about. It is clear that patients value knowing, and being known by, their GP.

 My hon. Friend mentioned practice nurses. Is it not rather extraordinary that the Government&#039;s definition of those eligible for key worker housing does not include practice nurses in GP surgeries? They may have been in the NHS pension scheme for 35 years, yet because some of their salary is paid directly by the GP they are not included.
</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="41111-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I do find that strange. Our constituencies are almost neighbouring, so my hon. Friend and I are both aware of the pressures on health workers and of their need to access affordable housing. I was not previously aware of that exclusion, but the Minister will know of it and I hope that he will take note of my hon. Friend&#039;s point and perhaps discuss it with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. In the past, I have had occasion to press for the extension of the definition of key workers, and my hon.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="41111-13_spnew2"><b> Andy Burnham  (Leigh) (Lab):</b> 
 I am listening to the argument that the hon. Gentleman is developing. He has mounted a critique in opposition to the concept of salaried GPs. He seems to want to uphold the principle that GPs are independent contractors. What would he say to deprived communities, such as the one I represent, where for many years GPs have not wanted to invest their capital and commit themselves? Consequently, GP vacancies are higher in such areas. If he is denying us the right to salaried GPs, what will the Conservative party do for communities such as Leigh?
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41111-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 It will come as a surprise to some of my colleagues&#151;for example, in Hertfordshire&#151;to hear that significant numbers of GP vacancies are experienced only in urban areas. In fact, they occur in many areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">The hon. Gentleman asked what we would do. Of course, we need measures to try to support GPs. I have held discussions with GPs, so I know of the difficulties for a young GP, especially in some urban areas, of taking on the necessary mortgage not only to live in the area, but to buy practice premises. That is not easy as it once was, so of course support is needed. There could be a range of options, such as the PCT purchasing the premises and, in some cases, as I acknowledged to the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), it will be right to employ salaried GPs. I do not dispute that. My point is about the desirability of creating opportunities for GPs actually to be independent contractors. That is the best basis on which to establish the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">The relationship between GPs and patients is one of the benefits that small practices offer patients, but which well-run practices of all sizes can achieve. It is more than simply a matter of service standards; it has a positive impact on the treatment of patients. We should not underestimate the need for effective management of co-morbidities or the benefits that flow from giving patients a framework of information and advice in the management of chronic disease. In both respects, the patient-GP relationship may be instrumental.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">We should also be aware that every GP is an advocate for public health promotion and has the opportunity to make early interventions to combat disease. That will be maximised if GPs know their patients, take responsibility for their patients, assist them in exercising choice and influencing the management of their care, and are progressively able to commission services on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">The value of GPs and the family doctor service in terms of health benefits is clear. As Dr. John Chisholm, a former chairman of the BMA&#039;s GP committee, said in his speech to local medical committees in June:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Health systems based on effective primary care with highly trained generalist physicians practising in the community provide more cost-effective and clinically effective care than other health systems that are less oriented to primary care. Furthermore, the higher is the ratio of family physicians to the population, the lower the hospitalisation rates.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">Central to the role of family doctors should be the opportunity for practices to commission services on behalf of patients. Fundholding was taken up by many GPs and we should look to all practices progressively to take responsibility for commissioning decisions on behalf of their patients. Whenever possible, patients should exercise choice. All patients should have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 948</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>influence and a voice in the management of their care, but we should never underestimate the value of GPs as advisers and commissioners on behalf of patients.

 No.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">If we can be clear about the central role of GPs, why cannot the Government also be clear? In part, of course, it is because their focus is elsewhere. They have talked of hospitals and waiting list targets to the exclusion of all else. It is a condemnation of the Government that it is only now that they are acknowledging the need for the NHS to focus on improved chronic disease management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">Another reason is that the Government cannot let go of central control. Let us take that example of out-of-hours services, which we have discussed briefly. Eighteen months ago, I and my Opposition colleagues sought certain assurances. The Minister, as I quoted earlier, said that there would be no loss of access to out-of-hours services. What did we get? In seven areas, with a population totalling 1.2 million, including South Lincolnshire, we got a service with no GPs at all, and the Minister had to be brought to the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) to answer that point. Saturday morning surgeries have gone. <i>MedEconomics</i> reported recently that the bill for new out-of-hours services is likely to reveal a frightening level of underfunding, which will have a detrimental effect on the quality of out-of-hours services. We were promised that more would be spent and access would be maintained.

<a name="stpa_73">The hon. Gentleman seems to be harking back to a golden age of out-of-hours cover, which, in my experience, never existed. I worked alongside GPs in an out-of-hours service on mental health care; frankly, many of them were knackered&#151;if that is not an unparliamentary term&#151;and should not have been practising because they were exhausted. The hon. Gentleman really needs to address that point.

However I know&#151;because it has been recruiting doctors from Germany to meet its requirements&#151;that it is having difficulty in getting GPs involved. Among the things that we need to be clear about is the fact that GPs in particular will subscribe to an out-of-hours service if they feel that it is structured around their needs, that it will manage risk and take clinical judgments on a basis with which they are happy, and that it will provide a service that is complementary to them. Of course, it must be seen as part of a more integrated service of unscheduled, unplanned care, but that does not mean that it becomes part of a bureaucracy that is no longer accountable to GPs. It is the out-of-hours GP service and it must be seen as such.

<p>
<a name="41111-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_75">NHS Direct was mentioned. It is important to understand how this will work because NHS Direct is gearing up to take over call handling nationally, and that could undermine GP out-of-hours providers locally.

 I shall deal with that point directly; I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As he says, out of hours is not the only area where GPs feel let down. For many GPs, the implementation of the NHS programme for IT is indeed a matter of deep concern. The Government originally said that it was going to be a national strategy for local implementation. In June 2002, however, they said that they would centralise the IT programme.

<a name="stpa_78">Since that warning back in July of last year, we have become aware of serious disquiet among general practitioners about the system that the Government are putting in place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) said, they have put a lot of investment into the EMIS system and 50 per cent. of GPs have adopted it, but this system is not the one that has secured a contract with a local service provider to provide GPs with their IT systems under the new arrangements. The GP contract says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Each practice will have guaranteed choice from a number of accredited systems that deliver the required functionality&quot;&#151;</p>

<a name="stpa_80">It is also my understanding that the Department of Health has assured GPs that they will not be forced to change systems, but&#151;with this Government there is always a but&#151;GPs are being told that if they wish to keep their existing system and it is not one of those offered by their local service provider, they may have to pay for it from their own budget. Not only do GPs have cost concerns about the new system, but they are rightly concerned about moving from a system in which they have invested, that they and their staff are trained to use, and that they trust, to a system that is unfamiliar and untested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_81">Will the Minister today take the opportunity to tell us what consultation he has had with GPs about the IT programme? If a GP wishes to remain with an existing IT system that is compatible with the NHS system but which is not offered by their local service provider, will they be able to do so at no extra cost? Can the Minister assure the House that all new accredited systems can deliver the same functionality as existing systems? What assurance can he give the House that safeguards have been put in place that ensure that GPs who transfer to a new accredited system will not lose any confidential patient data in the process?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_82">It is clear that the Government have a long way to go to convince doctors and the public&#151;and, indeed, many of us&#151;that they were right to take central control of the NHS IT programme, to explain why they have not secured the buy-in from GPs and users that is vital to any IT project, and especially to show that the IT programme will in fact deliver the service and the functionality that GPs require.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_83">The NHS needs to be a primary care-led service, and the family doctor service is the lynchpin to primary care.

GP numbers in the five years after 1997 rose by less than in the preceding five years. The number of applicants for GP training places is way down on five years ago.

I agree with him about the importance of primary care and delivering high-quality health care services to NHS patients. Primary care has always been the cornerstone of the national health service, and our family doctors have always been at the forefront of change and innovation. Primary care is the cornerstone of the NHS because it is where the vast majority of patients are seen and receive their treatment. Ninety per cent. of all patient journeys in the NHS begin and end in a primary care setting. Some 300 million appointments are made in general practice every year. Every fortnight, one in four people in Britain will see their GP or practice nurse.

 I wonder whether my right hon. Friend will respond to something that the Opposition spokesman said. One of the arguments for freeing up the time of GPs is that it allows them to develop sub-specialisms. By chance, yesterday the all-party health group held a session on primary approaches to pain control. It was abundantly clear that GPs had to develop specialisms in order to make early diagnoses and pass their patients on for treatment. Unless we can free up time for GPs, which the Opposition do not seem to have any idea how they would do, it will not be practicable for them to develop such specialisms. Does my right hon. Friend care to say something about that in terms of the logic of what the Government are doing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="41111-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I want to come back to that issue in a moment. It is important to recognise that much of the skill mix and much of the change that has taken place in primary care and the increasing role of other health care workers in supporting primary care and family doctors has been welcomed by GPs. They see it as an important part of making sure that their expertise is concentrated on those parts of their work that they need to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_89">In relation to specialisation in general practice, we have seen some welcome and significant progress&#151;progress that was not seen in the 18 years to which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire conveniently forgot to refer. His vision of primary care is very much the &quot;Dr. Finlay&#039;s Casebook&quot; version, and with great respect, I do not think that anyone in the Chamber today can recall those times. Times have changed and things have moved on. One of my problems with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument today is that, sadly, he does not appear to be in that process of change.

<p>
<a name="41111-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_90">The essence of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument today has been that the Government have failed to support primary care services in our national health service. That is simply untrue. It is a claim that cannot be justified by reference to the facts. He has chosen to ignore every indicator that points in the direction of the progress that is being made. He has ignored the views of Britain&#039;s GPs, having appointed himself today as their national champion. They have signalled in opinion poll after opinion poll conducted by the British Medical Association that their view of the quality of patient care that they are providing is that it is improving, not decreasing. He showed a blissful and wonderful disregard for his party&#039;s record on primary care when it was in government.

<a name="41111-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_91">I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman chose to say nothing about the previous 18 years, but let me remind him and his hon. Friends of one or two of the facts, because they reveal a different story from the one that the hon. Gentleman tried to tell. For example, between 1991 and 1996 there was a fall of 20 per cent. in the number of GPs in training, with a reduction in every single year. So much for his claim to value the role of primary care. Average list sizes are lower today than they were both in 1997 and in 1992. That undermines his claim that we have failed to address work load issues.

That rather puts paid to his argument that we are the ones who are not listening to the views of general practitioners. He has yet again completely failed to establish a clear alternative, which I think is a pretty important yardstick by which people reading and listening to his contribution today are likely to form a view. He does not plan to spend any additional resources on primary care. We know that he has no plans to change the new primary care contracts.

<a name="stpa_93">What the hon. Gentleman has said would make matters worse, not better. He intends to scrap our plans to improve GP premises, because he is against all those national targets. He would take away the right of the patient to be seen by a GP or practice nurse within 24 or 48 hours, because he is against that target as well and would not take any measures to implement it. There would be no targets for recruiting more doctors or nurses in the NHS. He would return the NHS&#151;we know this from the Opposition motion and from what he said today&#151;to the bureaucracy and unfairness of GP fundholding. All that would be a huge step backwards for our national health service. That is why his contribution will be seen as shallow and superficial and devoid of serious proposals.

<a name="stpa_94">I want to set out what I believe are the important facts, but I want to make one thing clear at the beginning. It is not my argument today that every problem facing our family doctor services has been solved. We all know that that is not the case. Neither is it my contention that we cannot improve the quality and range of services on offer to patients. We all know that we can. My argument today is that we are making real progress in expanding primary care services and in the process giving patients a wider range of services to choose from; in short that primary care is heading in the right direction.

That is a mistake on his part because primary care is much more than that. Primary care represents instead a concept of care that can be provided perfectly well by different professionals and organisations. What matters is the quality of care that is provided, not the organisational structure of the care provider who delivers it.

That is not GP led, but it is reaching men, in large part, who would never go near their GP and causing them to modify their behaviour and improve their health, so they are likely to be less of a burden on the NHS and their local GP. Should not those services be encouraged, not denigrated, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire did? Most GPs would support exactly that sort of service.

I am member of the Cemetery Cottages working men&#039;s club in my constituency, and blood pressure testing there is probably a quite a good idea. Of course, she speaks an awful lot of common sense, and she has made much more eloquently than I could the argument that I am trying to make.

 The Minister is proceeding on a misrepresentation of not only what I said, but what he ought to know we have made clear in our policies. I do not define primary care in organisational terms. In fact, we wish to define care increasingly in terms of its being patient centred, with patents having individual care plans. I do not denigrate walk-in centres. I visited one in Loughborough recently, which was run not by GPs, but by emergency care practitioners and nurses, and it was run very well. The point, however, is to understand that patients need the relationship with their GPs to be able to structure the manner in which they gain access to services, to recognise the co-morbidities and to understand how such care is best put together.

If that money were taken away from the NHS, as he intends, it would be quite impossible for primary care trusts to maintain the investment that is going into the NHS front line. Primary care would suffer in the same way as hospitals from those reductions in resources. So there is no accuracy behind his claim that we are not properly investing in NHS primary care services&#151;we are&#151; and his proposals would make matters worse. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is clear from his comments from a sedentary position that he thinks we are investing the right level of resources in primary care.

It is ludicrous for him to say that he was not implying that we were not sufficiently investing in primary care because the motion is about our failure to support family doctor services.

Some 97 per cent. of patients are now able to see a GP within two days, which is a huge improvement on the situation that we inherited. The improvement has been led by the pioneering work of GP practices throughout the country, including in South Cambridgeshire, where 100 per cent. of the constituents of the hon.

That confirms the value of the new services to the public, as does the support expressed for them by the Patients Association.

<a name="stpa_125">The national programme has adopted an incremental approach to building up any new applications or systems. That approach is intended to ensure that implementation is achievable and minimises disruption to the day-to-day business of the NHS. Similarly, it does not imply a wholesale replacement of one primary care system by another. EMIS supply a significant number of systems to primary care practitioners and we would prefer it to be part of the ongoing national programme. The national programme has sought to ensure that EMIS engages with local service providers, and I am aware that the company is continuing to work with the national programme to make its systems compliant. For example, it co-operated with the recent upgrade to GP IT systems to support the quality and outcomes framework, which from next April will drive the GP reimbursement arrangements.

 As I listened to the exchanges across the Dispatch Box, it occurred to me that the proposition is either GP family services on the Finlay model or primary care services on the &quot;Peak Practice&quot; model, as favoured by the Government. The Minister was a little hard on Dr. Finlay, but perhaps he needed to make those points because the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) sounded like an advocate not so much of the consumer of health care, but of producer interests in the health care system. It is essential that the patient be kept at the forefront of our minds and at the heart of our thinking. It was not clear from some of the points about the GP contract whether that was the key consideration.

<p>
<a name="41111-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_130">There can be no doubt that GPs are the backbone of the primary care system. It is right that we are debating the state of family doctor services and their pivotal role. It is also right to acknowledge that there have been improvements. The extra investment is beginning to give us additional capacity. I hasten to add that Liberal Democrats were happy to go through the Lobby in support of that extra investment. Changes such as the new GP contract and the development of practitioners with specialist interests are rightly placing even greater emphasis on the role of primary care in general and GPs in particular. As the Conservative motion and the unselected amendment standing in my name and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends rightly document, areas of concern remain. It is not my job&#151;or any Opposition Member&#039;s&#151;to act as cheerleaders for the Government&#039;s record. Our role is to analyse, criticise

</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="41111-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman talked about investment in national health services, but can he clear up a point about which I am slightly confused? The Liberal Democrats appear to be proposing hypothecation to the NHS of the proceeds of national insurance, but the relationship between the two in the coming financial year would result in NHS expenditure having to be reduced by &#163;4 billion if one simply did that hypothecation. I do not understand from where that &#163;4 billion would come if not from national insurance, and it is not hypothecation if money is brought in from elsewhere.
</p>








<p><a name="st_115"><a name="41111-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman was right to say, &quot;if one simply&quot; hypothecated. I shall happily send him the working paper on which the policy is based, so that he can read it in detail. The paper makes it clear that the hypothecation is spread over an economic cycle, not done one year to the next. That is how the policy would work. It seems an appropriate way to ensure that people see far more clearly how much they pay in taxes for the NHS. I would be surprised if the hon. Gentleman did not want to sign up to that, given that people would understand better how much they were paying into the health service and therefore would be more likely to engage at local level and question whether priorities were correct and whether resources were going to the right areas.

<p>
<a name="41111-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_131">The most recent staffing figures available&#151; I understand that new ones are due to be published fairly soon&#151;suggest that there were 3,435 GP vacancies, a 31 per cent. increase on the previous year. The Minister said that that was no longer the case but did not quote any figure, so I hope that he can tell us today what the most up-to-date survey reveals the number of GP vacancies to be. More telling than the vacancy rate is the fall in each of the last three years for which figures are available in the number of applicants for GP posts. In 2001, there were 6.9 applicants for every vacancy, but that number had more than halved, to 3.3 applicants, by 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_132">Furthermore, the position will worsen before it improves. There is a demographic time bomb ticking away under the NHS work force; the number of GPs who will reach the mandatory retirement age&#151;70&#151; in the next five years will increase rapidly, especially in London and the west midlands. It is clear that there are recruitment and retention issues to be addressed. A change in working patterns has also been noted. Many more GPs are choosing to work part time. As a result, although the headcount of GPs has increased by 4,237 since 1997&#151;a welcome increase&#151;the full-time equivalent has increased by only 2,913.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_133">One of the pressures on the system is the number of people who do not get a choice in which GP they sign up to. Patients in many areas struggle to get easy access to a local GP. Many GPs have lists much larger than the national average, which is about 1,850 per GP; for example, the average Westminster GP is coping with 2,500 patients, and areas such as Barking, Newham and

<a name="stpa_134">Earlier this year, in its &quot;Transforming Primary Care&quot; report, the Audit Commission found that 0.5 per cent. of people every year are assigned to a GP. That might not sound like a large number when described as a percentage, but a significant number of people are affected; about 250,000 people each year are unable to find a GP because of list closures and other difficulties and are assigned to a GP by their primary care trust. The Audit Commission rightly said that this

We believe that patients need to have more control over their health care; they should not just be faced with an array of choices&#151;a choice of five hospitals, say, or&#151;

 I ask the hon. Gentleman to allow me to develop my point before intervening. In my view, patients should be regarded as partners in their care and involved in decision making about their treatment. If that is to become a reality, it must be not be something that is available only to the articulate few. When the NHS improvement plan was published earlier this year, the way in which PCTs and primary care professionals provided support to everyone in their community in exercising choice was left as a matter of local detail, so although the Government have targets for the implementation of the choice programme, there will be variations throughout the country in the support available to make choice a reality for everyone, not just for the articulate few.

<a name="stpa_137">The argument about choice between the Government and the Opposition is advanced in terms of, &quot;My choice is bigger than your choice,&quot; but Ministers must give serious consideration to the extra time that GPs will have to take to make choice a reality for all patients.

<a name="stpa_138">I was exploring whether the patient choice programme will have an impact on GP consultation times and what assessment the Government have made of how much extra time GPs will need to provide the advice and support necessary to make that choice a reality. It is essential that the best use is made of GPs&#039; time, so the roles of other members of the primary care team will have to be expanded. I do not buy the argument advanced by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, that it is not possible to examine critically the range of tasks for which GPs have historically been responsible and determine whether some might more appropriately be discharged by others in the primary care team. I do not know whether that is his view or whether he was quoting the view of others, but my impression was that it is his own view.

<a name="41111-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_139">It is estimated that one fifth of GP appointments are made in relation to minor ailments that could be handled by pharmacists.

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="41111-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 I am sure that is so. We need to re-examine the role of the GP and how some of the tasks hitherto undertaken by a GP can be taken on by others who have a great deal to contribute. For many years community pharmacists have felt undermined and undervalued within the system and as though they were not seen as part of the primary care team. There are now opportunities to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_140">It is not just the role of pharmacists that can be expanded. There is also scope, for example, to develop the role of therapists, particularly physiotherapists. I was struck by a pilot scheme undertaken in the Forth Valley primary care trust over a 30-month period, which

<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 966</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>looked at opportunities for self-referral to NHS physiotherapy services in a primary care-led setting. The study found that that had significantly reduced GP workloads. People were choosing to go not to the GP but to the physio, possibly to deal with problems of back pain. That had a marked impact on individuals&#039; quality of life and reduced GPs&#039; work load so that they could concentrate on other tasks, not least issues relating to the management of chronic disease.

<p>
<a name="41111-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">What is being done with the time that GPs have? The Government&#039;s obsession with targets is of real concern to GPs. For example, follow-up appointments are delayed and deferred to ensure that first appointment waiting time targets are hit. Diseases with a target attached take priority over those without a target. GPs end up playing piggy in the middle as frustrated patients turn up at the surgery asking for their appointment with consultants and others to be expedited. It is not just targets in secondary care that need to be scrapped. The 48-hour access target is leading to all sorts of wheezes to game the system.

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="41111-19_spnew2"><b> Sarah Teather  (Brent, East) (LD):</b> 
 Despite repeated assurances from my local primary care trust that the 48-hour access target should have no impact on forward-planned appointments, I have had a continuous run of complaints from two groups of patients in particular. The first is those who are chronically ill and find it impossible to book repeat appointments with the same doctor, and the second is those who work and want to book an appointment for, say, next Wednesday, so that they can take a little time off work. They find that the only way they can get an appointment is by starting to jam the phones at 8.30 am, book the whole day off and hope that they can get to see the doctor by the end of the day. That has huge implications for going to see a doctor when the situation is not urgent and people simply want to talk something through.
</p>








<p><a name="st_127"><a name="41111-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. Those experiences are reflected in MPs&#039; mailbags. Perhaps the good intentions behind the target are not being translated into reality. My hon. Friend&#039;s example of patients not being able to see the same GP at their next appointment raises concerns about the continuity of care, and there are increasing concerns about access to the GP by those who work away from the area where their GP surgery is located and not being able to get an appointment when they want one.

<a name="41111-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_143">Other wheezes that are being used to game the system have been drawn to my attention by GPs, such as restricting patients to one problem per consultation. I do not know how that works in practice, but it is being tried. Another wheeze involves setting limits on times when patients can call for an appointment and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) mentioned, rationing access because the telephone is engaged all the time. So many people are phoning in that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 967</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they cannot get through to book an appointment. The selective release of appointment slots is a further wheeze.

<a name="stpa_145">It is evident from my mailbag and that of many other hon. Members that people are worried about the loss of Saturday morning surgeries and the difficulties that that will cause. How did the Government arrive at their estimate of &#163;6,000 per GP to provide out-of-hours and Saturday morning services? According to the results of a survey by the NHS Alliance, PCTs are struggling with the logistics, staffing and finances necessary to deliver out-of-hours services. One in five PCTs say that they will restrict services on the basis of quantity or quality or both. On what basis does the Minister reject the findings of the NHS Alliance&#039;s survey? I wonder whether he has looked at it and why he does not consider it an acceptable basis on which to criticise the Government&#039;s approach to the provision of out-of-hours services in the new form under the new contract.

<a name="stpa_146">Where will all the extra doctors come from to staff the out-of-hours services? How much reliance will PCTs have to place on locum and overseas doctors to fill the gap? Many PCTs plan to use NHS Direct services as the front end of their out-of-hours services. However, that will need to be monitored closely in the light of recent research in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. A study published on 17 September looked at the effects on consultation workload and costs of off-site triage by NHS Direct compared to on-site nurse triage in general practice. Patients in the NHS Direct group were less likely to have their call resolved by a nurse and were more likely to have an appointment with a general practitioner. In other words, it was costing more to use NHS Direct. Perhaps that explains one of the cost pressures that PCTs are grappling with. Half of PCTs have said that they will contain the extra costs by delaying investment in new services. How long will they delay investment in much-needed new services?

Serious questions also remain over the cost-effectiveness of the fundholding experiment. Practice-led commissioning must avoid that pitfall, and some of the Minister&#039;s comments this afternoon have reassured me on that point. No patient should be left behind in the new system.

 To be fair to the Conservative party&#151;I am not often inclined to do so&#151;I congratulate it on securing today&#039;s debate and focusing our attention on primary care services, because the debate about health and the NHS in this country too often focuses on secondary care and hospitals, rather than primary care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_158">The motion describes family doctor services as the lynchpin&#151;perhaps it is the bedrock or backbone&#151;but whatever word we use, they are crucial to all our constituents. Given that the Conservative party has focused on the issue today, why on earth did it not prioritise family doctor services and primary care during its 18 years in power?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_159">The Conservative Government left primary care in a sorry state, particularly in our more deprived communities and inner cities. Between 1991 and 1996, GP registrars fell by 20 per cent., which is why we now have a problem with GP vacancies. Let us make no bones about it: the motion discusses problems with GP vacancies and we can lay the blame at the Conservative party&#039;s door&#151;GP numbers were slashed between 1991 and 1996. This Government have barely been in power long enough to see a GP through his training, which takes six or seven years, so we must make that point plain from the start.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_160">The Conservative Government left GP practices in many communities in a terrible state&#151;for example, located in old terraced houses without consulting rooms. The primary care estate, if we can call it that, was in a terrible mess. What are the answers in the motion? The motion discusses the reintroduction of fundholding, but is that really the answer to the problems facing primary care today? Fundholding placed an arbitrary label on patients, which dictated how they went through the system. Treatment was provided not on the basis of how urgently it was required, but according to funding status. Fundholding is incoherent. The motion mentions providing more Saturday surgeries, but it bemoans GPs being told what to do and being subject to targets. How can one want Saturday morning surgeries and also defend GPs&#039; independence as contractors who can dictate their own work load?

<br>&nbsp;<br>practice becoming moribund and lacking a clear vision for the future. The Government&#039;s vision for primary care is beginning to emerge in my constituency. That vision includes high class, modern facilities where GPs want to come and work, in all the towns in my constituency. GPs can obtain professional satisfaction from working in such facilities because space is available to deliver new services and because they can locally develop services previously provided by secondary care. The future of primary care involves GPs developing their skills and their role, which is linked to the quality of premises.

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_162">My constituency contains one of the 42 LIFT pilot areas, and it is probably true to say that our scheme is one of the most developed. A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Atherton site, where a brand new facility for GPs has already been built. The facility is huge and looks like a cottage hospital: it has ample space and includes consulting rooms, while the facility is first class and looks lovely, too. LIFT will take services out of secondary care sites such as Wigan infirmary and Leigh infirmary and put them on the doorsteps of mining communities, where transport is not good and people must travel to access services. That can only be good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_163">The Atherton scheme was one of the first, but a scheme is also in progress in Golborne. The first phase of the Golborne scheme, Leigh health park, has already opened. A new GPs clinic is planned for Hindley in my constituency&#151;it will be located next to the Sure Start building and the swimming baths. Those developments will transform the quality of primary care at a local level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_164">The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), knows that primary care is particularly important in communities that have a legacy of ill health from mining, because she kindly visited my constituency earlier this year. We have much higher levels of chronic long-term illness than other parts of the country and people find it harder to travel because they have mobility problems. That is why it is crucial that these services are developed and improved locally and people are saved from making needless trips to hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_165">General practitioners will be enthused if they are given modern facilities in which to work. That will tell them that they can begin to develop their careers and interests and to deliver far more than they are able to deliver in the cramped and poor conditions that they often have at the moment. The quality of the estate is crucially linked to tackling GP vacancies. Moreover, the improvements that have taken place in secondary care are linked to general practice. As GPs can begin to navigate their patients around the system as capacity is opened up and waiting lists fall, they can once again become the true advocates, or champions, of their patients, because they will be able to assert themselves on their behalf to secure the best of the care that they think they need. The role of the GP is about to flourish again, and it could become a very rewarding job.

<a name="stpa_167">I wholeheartedly endorse the Government&#039;s vision and direction, but funding is also required. As I say, health in my constituency is poorer than in many other parts of the country. The Minister talked about the increases in funding that have gone into primary care. That is indisputable, and they are welcome, but from the viewpoint of a PCT such as mine the imminent three-year spending round must go further in taking all PCTs as close to their target funding as possible. Otherwise, it will not be possible to deliver the desired improvements in general practice and family doctor services in areas such as mine. My PCT is some &#163;12 million below its target funding in this financial year. I am led to believe that in PCTs in other areas where health is even poorer&#151;such as Easington, central Manchester and parts of Liverpool&#151;funding is even further below target. Yet many other PCTs in leafier parts of the country are significantly over the target that the Department of Health says that they need in order to tackle the health needs of their communities.

<a name="41111-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_168">The Healthcare Commission recently recommended that the Government should move much more quickly towards bringing all PCTs up to balanced funding. That is because a couple of years ago the chief medical officer said that death rates in some communities in the north-west and the north-east have not improved since the 1950s. That shames every person involved in public policy, because it has not delivered the health gains to the communities that it should have done&#151;health gains that other parts of the country are enjoying.

<a name="stpa_169">This spending round, in which a significant amount of extra money is going into primary care, gives us the chance to take a great leap forward in lifting the baseline of PCT funding in areas where the need is greatest. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon.

 I promise the House that my speech will be short. I want to raise a constituency issue, which also raises a point of general principle about the way in which the primary care trust operates, certainly in Newcastle and perhaps elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_193">To the south-west of my constituency is a community called Lemington, which has a population of about 9,000. At the bottom end of Lemington, right on the banks of the Tyne, is a relatively underprivileged area where a lot of elderly people live. Because of the private housing that is let, a lot of young single mothers live there too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_194">Until a couple of years ago, there was one doctor working in Lemington. He then left the practice. Having been approached by local people, I asked the health authority how people in Lemington were to gain access to primary care. The health authority told me that there was a perfectly adequate, indeed very good, practice about two miles west of Lemington, in a community called Newburn. In fact, the nearest practice is at the top of the hill. Anyone who has ever walked up the banks of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 977</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Tyne will know how steep they are. The hill leading from Lemington to the nearest community, about three quarters of a mile away, rises 300 or 400 ft. That is not the kind of gradient that an elderly person should be expected to negotiate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_195">At the top of the hill, on a plateau, is a relatively more affluent area called Chapel House and Chapel Park. There are two doctors&#039; practices within 50 m of one another, each with about six partners. I asked the health authority &quot;Do you think this is the right distribution of resources? Would it not be better if at least one or two of the partners in the two practices at the top of the hill moved a little of their operation to the bottom, where the poorest people live?&quot; The health authority said &quot;We will do what we can, but we cannot compel doctors&#039; practices to locate themselves in any specific place.&quot; In that case, I asked, could the authority employ a doctor directly? The authority said that there was a limit to the number of doctors that it could employ directly, and that Lemington did not warrant the appointment of an employed doctor because there were enough doctors in the overall outer-west area. I could not disagree with that in statistical terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_196">The question is, why does the authority not have power to require the two practices at the top of the hill at least to provide some facility at the bottom, where the need is greatest? The irony is that far more people own cars at the top of the hill than at the bottom, where there are elderly people and young mothers, many of them single.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_197">The Government should look at the regulations governing the primary care trust. I do not think it right that we cannot require people who are publicly funded to locate themselves in areas of greatest need. The people of Lemington did not expect six doctors to go down to the bottom of the hill, but it would be an improvement if just one or two of the partners were prepared to work from a centre for at least some of the day, or some of the week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_198">There is, in fact, a new centre at the bottom of the hill in Lemington. It is one of those projects funded partly by regeneration money. There will be some nurses there. That great new facility could be financed because of the increase in health resources, but there is still no doctor for it. That is ridiculous, but the PCT tells me that it can do nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_199">I think that this is a real problem. I hope that the Minister will address it, if necessary taking advice from the health authority in Newcastle. If it turns out that the authority has interpreted its own regulations accurately, I hope that the Minister will consider the possibility of change to provide more flexibility, so that the authority can reallocate resources as circumstances and priorities change.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">This government is obsessed by the need for patients to be seen in 24 hours by a nurse and within 48 hours by a GP. To reach these targets the Modernisation Agency has introduced &#039;advanced access&#039;. This means that in many surgeries patients who need urgent help in fact end up phoning or contacting the surgery for several days before getting an appointment. This means that they are waiting much longer than they used to. It is particularly difficult for elderly people. Doctors should decide when patients are seen and in what priority and should be left to run their own businesses.&quot;</p>

Doctors striving to reach these unrealistic targets solely to reap the financial rewards that this brings, are compromising good standards of clinical care and &#039;Points mean prizes&#039; are now the watchwords&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . The data input requirements that are part of the Quality Outcome Framework mean doctors spend much time staring at their computer screens during what should be &#039;face-to-face&#039; consultations. There is a general feeling of frustration that the data collection is detrimental to patient care. The public, who are ultimately funding the massive increase in health spending, frequently complain to primary care providers that they are seeing little in the way of improvement and know full well that there are lies, damn lies and statistics and do not believe the figures put out by the Department of Health.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_208">Having listened to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), one can see the extent of that inconsistency. The NHS Confederation felt that PCTs displayed a lack of understanding of out-of-hours issues and in general were not ready for the responsibility that they are being given. That is very worrying. It also said that PCTs are seen as being reactive rather than proactive. Few primary care trusts were working positively with GP co-operatives, which were mentioned earlier. Indeed, often, instead of being adversarial, they were actually in conflict. Dr. Mark Reynolds gave evidence, saying that people in PCTs were taking on the job &quot;with no real experience&quot;. If we consider how important the service is, that is very worrying. The Health Committee felt strongly that PCTs across the country were not universally prepared. The Government certainly need to do something about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_209">A local GP wrote to me recently to advise me that there was &quot;considerable concern&quot; about the out-of-hours services being taken over by primary care trusts. He said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;Many are starting a new service with no previous experience. They have not really consulted the GPs in the locality about how the service will run.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_211">Unlike any other hon. Member present, I attended the Committee stage of the Bill that introduced primary care trusts.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;General practitioners were conned with the set up of PCTs. Some five years down the line, the ability of local practitioners to have any influence whatsoever on how services are commissioned or run in their area is minimal.

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="41111-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Kelvin Hopkins  (Luton, North) (Lab):</b> 
 First, I advise the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) to visit his own GP. If he did, he might find that he has an injured foot where he shot himself. Whenever Conservative Members speak about health, I am reminded of the level of health spending when we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 980</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>came to office in 1997. I have the approximate figures: Britain spent 3 per cent. less of its gross domestic product on health than France, and 3 per cent. of GDP is equivalent to about &#163;50 million per constituency every single year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_213">It is no surprise that we still have problems now, because we are still dealing with the legacy of the Conservative years. The Government are certainly making real progress now&#151;it is evident in my constituency&#151;because they have increased spending on health. We cannot have a good health service unless we spend the money on it. I accept that it must be spent efficiently, and we can argue about different systems, but we will never have a good health service without providing the resources. When the Minister said that the Conservatives do not have a leg to stand on, perhaps it is because they keep shooting themselves in the foot, though I shall not pursue that any further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">My Luton constituency has seen significant progress, although there are still undoubted problems. We still have &quot;single-handed&quot; GPs who are quite elderly and have long lists and they over-refer to hospitals perhaps because they cannot cope with the number of patients or perhaps because they are worried about diagnosis. My own GP practice is a group one and it is extremely good. It is now embarking on screening for blood pressure and other risk factors for the over-50s. That is new and did not happen a few years ago. It is also easier to get an appointment at short notice these days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">However, there is still a serious shortage of GPs in Luton. When PCTs were set up, I was a little dubious, but the PCT in Luton is truly excellent and making substantial progress in introducing new systems. Only a few weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State opened a new walk-in centre, and I was also present when my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health opened another superb health centre just this week. The new centre was initiated by our PCT, which shows that it is working well with local GPs and doing really good things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_216">We also have an excellent hospital in the area, which is making a great contribution. It is working together with the PCT, and I am very pleased about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">At one time, I was seriously worried that there might be an extension of contracting to private companies. That has not happened, at least not yet. I hope that Ministers will resist that temptation, otherwise we might fall into the problems described by the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne). I want an integrated health service whose component parts work coherently together. I do not want a health service that is disparate, subcontracted, and the province of competing private companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_218">As I said, there has been tremendous progress in Luton. From the day it opened, the walk-in centre in town has attracted many patients. It is always full and does a great job. It attracts people&#151;for example, the classic male&#151;who are normally reluctant to see their GP and who feel uncomfortable about seeing a doctor. It is much easier for such people to drop into the walk-in centre and talk, for example, about the pain that they may have in their leg. Making it easier for people to see doctors is part of the way forward.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_219">It is obvious that we need to train more doctors. As the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said in Health questions last week, Bedfordshire faces a serious problem with its GPs. That problem is especially severe in Luton, but we are moving gradually to a world in which there is greater direct employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_220">Mention has been made of salaried doctors. The doctors in Luton&#039;s walk-in centre are employed directly, and that is the direction that we should follow. Indeed, I believe that Nye Bevan would have preferred to create a service based on directly employed doctors in 1948, but he had to make some unavoidable compromises. I think that he would have been very pleased to see the move towards direct employment and the establishment of a coherent health service in the public sector. I hope to push my Government in that direction if I possibly can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_221">Group practices and centres such as I have described can afford to have specialisms and to employ a range of doctors. In my constituency, there are a number of minority ethnic communities, whose members might prefer to see a doctor who comes from their community and speaks their language. Moreover, women might prefer to be examined by a woman doctor rather than by a man. Group practices in a modern health service can provide such things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_222">I do not criticise GPs, as they do a tremendous job, but the old, single-handed practices run by a Dr. Finlay-type figure are a bit of a dying breed now. They did a wonderful job in their day, but we are moving to a new era. We should aim to provide what people need, and not try to match the folksy image that appears on television.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="41111-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hopkins: </b> 
 We all want to have a personal relationship with a doctor, but I think that there will be a gradual convergence and that walk-in centres and medical centres such as I have described will offer services very similar to those available in the past. Patients will have a permanent relationship with one doctor, or with a group of doctors. For instance, I am not concerned about which doctor at my group practice I see. The practice has all my records and the doctors know me well, so there is no problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="41111-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Doug Henderson: </b>

 Yes, but I suspect that in those days only those who could pay were able to walk in. We are talking about a free health service, and there is a big difference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_223">My next point has to do with funding. As is the case in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), Luton is millions of pounds below its fair funding target. We have serious health problems with diabetes and heart disease, because of the nature of the population. We have a growing problem of HIV in Luton, partly because of people coming in from elsewhere. Those factors cause enormous pressure on our local health service and we need considerably greater funding.

<a name="stpa_224">Mental health services are also substantially underfunded across the country. Indeed, mental health provision is a Cinderella service, certainly in Luton. We have superb facilities and great doctors, but there are not enough of them. As a result, serious mental health problems in Luton are going undetected and untreated for lack of resources. That lack of resources stems from what the Conservatives did in their time in government, not from what our Government are doing now.

<a name="stpa_225">I wish to focus specifically on that issue. The IT programme in the NHS is undoubtedly of huge importance, but GPs have serious concerns about it, not least because they are, at the moment, the controllers of information about patients.

<a name="stpa_226">Worryingly, many of the characteristics of the most famous IT fiascos in the public sector&#151;there are examples almost everywhere one looks&#151;are exhibited by the national programme. The first is what the elder George Bush called &quot;the vision thing&quot;. While for most undertakings some sense of where one is going is necessary, a grand vision for IT projects can be the most dangerous thing to have. Tony Collins, the specialist computer journalist, writes in his book &quot;Crash: Ten Easy Ways to Avoid a Computer Disaster&quot;:

</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para15">

<a name="41111-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_230">The third characteristic of IT disasters, which will be worryingly familiar to students of such matters, is a high turnover of staff involved. Sir John Pattison, one of the original architects and the first senior responsible owner of the programme, has gone. Lord Hunt, who was the Minister in charge, has gone. Richard Granger, the director general of IT in the health service, slums along on a salary of &#163;200,000 and is the highest paid civil servant in the UK, but he earns a lot less than he would in the private sector. I attended a conference recently that had promotion stands for local service providers and I mentioned to one of them that I had heard that Richard Granger would be moving on soon and they said that they had heard that too. We shall watch eagerly to see how long Mr. Granger remains in his job now that the LSP contracts have been let. Of course, he was never responsible for clinical buy-in to the programme; it was explicit that he had no responsibility for getting clinicians involved. The Department of Health suddenly noticed that that was a bit of a problem, so rather late in the day&#151;in March 2004, two years after the announcement of the programme&#151;it appointed Dr. Aidan Halligan, the deputy chief medical officer, as the joint senior responsible owner of the programme. Yet six months later, in September, we found that Dr. Halligan was to return to his native country to take up a post as the head of the health service in Ireland, having achieved more or less nothing in terms of clinical buy-in during his six months in the job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_231">The fourth characteristic is indeed buy-in and most projects that do not work fail in that respect. That is where the alarm bells really start to ring. What must be, even for students of IT disasters, the locus classicus of such disasters was the Wessex regional health authority, where there was a Department of Health project for a central system that had to be imposed regionally, and a key issue was the failure to achieve clinical buy-in. It simply did not happen, so the district health authorities refused to fund the project and the Department had no choice but to cancel it. The fear is that primary care trusts will be put in a similar position and will not have sufficient funding to make the programme work, especially when their clinicians do not want it, do not like it and do not trust it anyway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_232">Clinical buy-in is incredibly important, because clinicians need to understand who has put the data into the system. They are unlikely to trust data unless they know how it was acquired and whether it is reliable. There is also a huge question about who will have access to such data. Are the proposed controls on access and the security protocols adequate to the task? Do they meet the concerns of GPs and patients about maintaining the privacy of what is often sensitive information? There is implied consent in data going up to the national spine in the programme; even if patients do not give consent, the data will be wrapped so that it is not easily readable. I was told today that consultants can look at any data, including that of patients who are not their own, and change the consent tag without

<br>&nbsp;<br>obtaining the patient&#039;s permission. There are serious concerns about access to data, as well as about clinical buy-in generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_233">The fifth characteristic often found in failed IT projects relates to funding. The Minister of State, who, sadly, is not in the Chamber at the moment, did what can only be described as a magnificent job in adding to the confusion in an interview on Radio 4 a couple of weeks ago, which was lovingly and forensically reproduced in <i>Computer Weekly</i> under the headline, &quot;Health Minister adds to uncertainty over implementation costs of the NHS IT plan&quot;. It included a photograph of the Minister in which he is gesturing. I think that he is trying to explain something but unfortunately his expression makes him look like a white rabbit caught in a headlight, so whether he is on the receiving end of something or trying to give an explanation is not clear. What is certain, however, is that he did not make things easier to understand when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;We think it is going to cost the same&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_234">In other words, the &#163;1 billion currently being spent on IT in the health service will cover all the changes required, taking no account of the fact that there is a series of IT issues in the health service, such as finance, payroll, manpower, staff rostering and the procurement of food and clinical and other services, as well as specialist equipment for immunisation programmes, none of which has anything to do with the national programme for IT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para22">
<a name="stpa_235">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) received a little more clarity when pursuing a question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison). The Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;Future funding to the NHS determined by the SR2004 expenditure settlement will enable trusts to achieve the target of 4 per cent. for total NHS spending on IT, set by the 2002 Wanless Report.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 393W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para23">
<a name="stpa_236">Four per cent. is much higher than the current figure so that is not consistent with the statement, &quot;We think it is going to cost the same&quot;. Any light that the Minister of State can shed in the wind-up will be most welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para24">
<a name="stpa_237">To summarise, we have a massive vision, even though we know that in IT the vision thing is one of the most dangerous elements; indeed, it is a key ingredient of any computer disaster. We have lack of consultation on a spectacular scale. We have a high rate of staff turnover, although it has not yet reached the rate achieved during the implementation of the national probation service information systems strategy, which had seven programme managers in seven years, five of whom knew nothing about project management. One fears that we may be reaching that point. We also have a lack of buy-in&#151;always a key worry, and in this case buy-in by clinicians, the people who matter the most&#151;and we have huge questions about funding. This is a hardly a recipe for certainty or confidence and it is hardly surprising that <i>GP</i> magazine has said of the national programme for IT in the health service that it is likely to be more of a fiasco than the dome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para25">
<a name="stpa_238">All of this is before one takes into account the effects of the new GP contract, and the way that it interlocks and dovetails, or, rather, does not interlock and dovetail, with the local service provider contracts that Mr. Granger has been so busy letting at such a high 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 985</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>speed. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned, the GMS contract says in paragraph 4.34:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;Each practice will have guaranteed choice from a number of accredited systems&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para26">
<a name="stpa_239">but the local service provider contracts, which are roughly &#163;1 billion apiece across the country, say more or less the opposite; that LSPs can impose a main system on local commissions with one alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para27">
<a name="stpa_240">This brings us back to a point that was made earlier about the EMIS system, which is currently used by 55 per cent. of general practitioners, which is not involved in any of the local service provider contracts, unfortunately; mainly because the company could not get professional indemnity insurance because of the risks that insurers thought that it, as a relatively small company compared with the very large contractors who are LSP contractors, would have to take on. So we have the ludicrous situation in which GPs are in some cases having to turn away from a system that works, the EMIS system, and turn towards a system that in some cases has not even been written yet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para28">
<a name="stpa_241">Until recently I was not familiar with the phrase &quot;vapourware&quot;, but I am told that it means a system that exists, so far, only in someone&#039;s head; it has not even reached the back-of-the-envelope stage. No one who knows anything about EMIS or Vision or any of the other systems would say that they are perfect, but at least they were incrementally developed. They were not infected by the vision thing, they responded to what local clinicians wanted, they have continued to change in response to the needs of GPs in helping their patients, and GPs like the systems and want to carry on using them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para29">
<a name="stpa_242">The Department reckons that, given the choice between getting something for free and having to pay for a system like EMIS, GPs will choose to go for something that is free. The Department is probably right that some of them will, but I think that it will be surprised, and I predict that many GPs will choose a system that they know, trust and understand, even if they have to pay for it. The point is that they should not have to pay for it; there should be no discrimination in funding between systems that GPs can rely on and ones that are still in the ether.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para30">
<a name="stpa_243">The areas that I would like to see the Minister focus on in the wind-up are as follows. First, specifically in relation to EMIS, will the Minister give a guarantee that there will not be an imbalance in the funding between systems such as EMIS and systems provided by the national programme for IT? Will Ministers listen to GPs&#039; ongoing concerns about the potentially huge problems of data transfer? The other day I received a letter about that from a GP in Suffolk; the problems are potentially enormous. Can the Minister say whether the national programme understands better the benefits of the project rather than the risks, because where things go wrong it is nearly always the case that people have underestimated the risks?
 
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para31">
<a name="stpa_244">Should &#163;6 billion of contracts have been signed before it was known what the overall costs would be, including the costs of local implementation, before it was known what changes in business processes would be necessary, before it was known whether clinicians would use systems that were sought to be imposed centrally, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 986</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>before it was known how the benefits would be measured, before it was known whether GPs would oppose any handover of control of the confidentiality of their patient records and before it was known whether there were enough in-house skills to translate national plans into local action?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-23_para32">
<a name="stpa_245">Finally, the National Audit Office, interestingly, has already announced an investigation into the national programme, which may shed light on some of these questions. But in the meantime I look to the Minister for an assurance that GPs will not be forced to replace trusted, well developed, well understood systems that provide what they want and enable them to help patients, with distrusted, less well developed, less well understood systems that may end up costing taxpayers a fortune without delivering what is required.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="41111-24_spnew0"><b> Dr. Andrew Murrison  (Westbury) (Con):</b> 
 We have had a good debate this afternoon. We have had a total of six Back-Bench speeches and some very good contributions indeed. It is regrettable that the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) was not listened to more closely by the Minister who replied to him. The Minister gave us a rendition that he had clearly written some time ago. My hon. Friend was trying to be helpful, as always, and it is a pity that his remarks were not reflected on more closely when the Minister came to make his speech. I am sure that his colleague will not fall into that trap when she comes to make her comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_246">It is a time of enormous change for general practice. It is arguably the time of greatest change since the inception of the national health service&#151;in many respects, perhaps even greater than that. Many practitioners and certainly the general public are perhaps not aware of the enormity of what is going on. The bedrock of primary care is shifting. Doctors will no longer have a 24/7 commitment to patients; patients arguably will no longer have a doctor whom they can truly call their own. Functions previously carried out by physicians are now being carried out by others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_247">General practice was once the lynchpin of British health care and one of its most attractive features; it was unique in the world and renowned throughout the world. It may be that the changes that are under way will improve health outcomes. We must always be on the lookout for how we might improve services, but change brings risk and the risk is that a unique and cherished part of health care delivery in this country is beginning to decline. That is certainly the impression that one gains from talking to many medical colleagues. They have the feeling that perhaps they have seen the best. We have heard some humorous references in the debate to &quot;Peak Practice&quot; and &quot;Dr. Finlay&#039;s Casebook&quot;. We can joke and laugh about it, but in truth I suppose most people&#039;s ideal vision of a general practitioner is someone who has time to listen, to manage chronic conditions and to have a long-term relationship sometimes over many generations with a family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">With so much change, there is little wonder that many in the medical profession are struggling to determine where they will fit into the new scheme of things. Many have accepted the new contract, but privately they fear for their future and that of their calling.

<a name="stpa_256">The new GP contract has thrown up a number of what are, I think, unintended consequences. We have heard about the demise of the Saturday morning surgery. It is perhaps ironic that, when we are seeing a reduction in out-of-hours services and Saturday morning services, we see the creation of walk-in, quick and easy clinics at railway stations. Most of our constituents want to see their own doctor if they possibly can, and I wonder about the Government&#039;s priority in that respect.

<p>
<a name="41111-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_257">I should like to talk briefly about community hospitals. Again, an unintended consequence and perhaps something that the Government have not thought through properly is the threat to community hospitals. I have four such hospitals in my constituency, two of which have been badly affected by the new GP contract and threatened. Previously, GPs have given their services more or less for free to community hospitals because they have been on call out of hours and can bolt on their services to community hospitals relatively easily. Now that they no longer work out of hours, they are looking again at that commitment to community hospitals. Community care cannot be provided without out-of-hours cover. GPs would like to cover community hospitals in most cases; but, frankly, they are more or less doing so for free, and I very much hope that the Minister will consider that and reflect on the fact that the framework document for the new GP contract referred to the need to negotiate terms for GPs who work in community hospitals, but that was the last that we heard of it.

Members would like to see a wellness service&#151;that is for sure&#151;but those health MOTs and health checks should be based on evidence.

 Opposition Members have asserted that the Government have failed to support family doctors. However, as the Minister of State, my right hon.

Support for NHS general practice has never been greater.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_264">There has been an unprecedented increase in investment in primary care under this Government. Expenditure will have risen by &#163;6.8 billion in England by next year and by &#163;8 billion in the UK as a whole. We have fostered innovation, with a greater range of services being offered to patients. We have increased the importance of primary care in the NHS and we have improved the rewards for NHS workers in primary care, both financially and in terms of professional responsibility.

<a name="41111-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_265">The hon.

There are already some 1,300 GPs with special interests who are delivering a range of extended services in local settings that are convenient to patients. There are 1,169 more general practitioners than in 1997, and 3,280 more practice nurses. Record numbers of doctors are training to be GPs&#151;almost 80 per cent. more than in 1997. We have introduced the new contract for GPs&#151;unlike the previous Administration who imposed one&#151;, which will considerably improve their quality of life and increase recruitment and retention. That is hardly bashing doctors.

It is an NHS in which general practitioners and nurses have a greater say on how their patients are treated, and an NHS that is tailored to the needs of individual patients.

The fact is that under the Labour Government the NHS is getting better. We have record investment, 100,000 more doctors and nurses, the largest ever hospital building and equipment programme, better working conditions for all NHS staff and better treatment for NHS patients. Labour will keep the NHS free at the point of need. The increased investment that we are providing benefits the many, not the few.

This Government will never remove &#163;1.2 billion from the NHS to subsidise the well-off few who pay to go private. That is exactly what the Tories&#039; patient&#039;s passport would do.

It is a fantastic tribute to the hard work and dedication of GPs and NHS primary care staff. It shows that the public support the NHS, and so do the Government. I urge the House to reject the Opposition motion and support the Government&#039;s amendment.

<a name="time_14">
<a name="41111-27_time2"><h5>4.56 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_183"><a name="41111-27_spnew2"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore):</b> 
 I begin this important debate by welcoming the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) is going to respond to it. I am well aware that over the past year or more, he has had many discussions with members of the off-road biking fraternity and sorority, and that he has always been frank and straightforward in discussing with them what are often contentious issues. He has sometimes faced undue criticism, particularly in the off-road biking press and newsletters, but I commend him for taking a reasonable and reasoned approach at all times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">Motor cycling of any type should carry some form of Government health warning. Mothers and fathers throughout the land warn their sons and daughters off all forms of motor cycling because it is dangerous. Well, those whose sons and daughters are MPs should warn them against dabbling in the politics of off-road biking, because doing so can certainly prove very dangerous for one&#039;s political health. This is the crux of the matter. For any politician&#151;be they an MP, a parish-pump community councillor or a county councillor&#151;getting involved in tackling off-road biking requires either great courage or absolute stupidity; I leave the House to decide which I am guilty of. Generally, it is better to ignore this issue and bury one&#039;s head in the sand. Why? Because an errant politician who enters this sometimes battlefield of off-road biking risks being mown down in the crossfire between those who want to take part in this activity&#151;those who love it, but who are hunted up and down the country until they find the sanctuary of a place where they can legally ride their bikes&#151;and those who want such people to be hanged, drawn and quartered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">So why on earth have I entered this battle zone and tempted the Minister in with me? Frankly, I am weary of receiving a postbag full of endless complaints about nuisance behaviour arising from off-road biking. People who should know better are riding very powerful machines up and down cycle paths and pavements. Weekends are frankly too short for my constituents to have to put up with the incessant buzz-saw noise of such machines riding up and down their back terraces and in neighbouring fields. Linked to off-road biking is a massive trade in stolen bikes and various drug-related activities. Moreover, I get annoyed when, on walks on the Sarn Helen Roman path across the Brecon Beacons, three bikes hurtle out of the mist towards me; or when, on walking along the cycle path in Blackmill with my children on push-scooters in front of me, bikers come down it&#151;at speed&#151;towards them, because it is the easiest way to get to the petrol station without risking the police stopping them on the highways, on which they are not allowed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">But there are other reasons why I have tempted the Minister to join in this debate. First, there are youngsters, parents and grandparents who want to pursue this activity legitimately without being chased by the police or being derided by their neighbours. I am talking about the ones who have a responsible attitude 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 1000</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to this sporting activity, but feel marginalised because they have nowhere to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">Another reason for the debate tonight is that the police, local authorities, community safety partnerships and many other agencies are now waking up to the fact that this is a growing issue. Also, the motor cycle industry has suddenly realised that there are commercial dangers if it does not tackle its own responsibilities. Finally, riders themselves and their organisations have come to realise that their existence is under threat unless they take responsibility for their own actions and the actions of others who are giving their sport a bad name.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_285">In common with many other people, I have come to realise that it is all right to bury one&#039;s head in the sand like an ostrich, but when the feathers get ruffled and the backside gets kicked, it is time to recognise that there is a problem. It is then time to pull one&#039;s head out of the sand and tackle the problem head on. I am not directing all of this specifically at the Minister; it is for every Member, every councillor and community officer throughout the land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_286">I would like to commend to the Minister the approach promoted by the Auto-Cycle Union, which is the governing body for motor cycle provision in the UK. As part of a Government-funded national strategy for off-road motor cycling, a report was published in August this year, which identified 10 key issues that need to be addressed. Of those, most Members will probably be most familiar with the sixth, which is about noise pollution. That is what fills hon. Members&#039; postbags and what is often put to us at our surgeries. We know that many people are annoyed at the excessive noise outside the House. We realise that many people, after mowing the lawn, want to put their feet up and are annoyed when all they can hear is noise from bikes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_287">Equally valid, however, is the second point&#151;the lack of understanding about the activity and a lack of awareness and education about provision and, indeed, about the law that currently applies to off-road biking. That applies to parents, landowners and communities. More importantly, the 10 issues highlighted in the report reveal conflicting demands. As well as being a keen hill walker, I also enjoy the activity of off-road biking. It is very difficult to mix the two, which brings me to the need to have off-road provision in the right places at the right times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_288">There is a long-standing tradition in this country of unconstrained use of this activity, but unlike in America and other countries, we do not have a tradition of control. I can remember when, as a youngster, I used to go out with my brother and take my scrambling bike across the road to a piece of waste ground in Gowerton known as &quot;the Slag&quot; and we used to ride for hours. But that was in the days when it was a fairly minority activity. Nowadays there are bigger and noisier machines, and many parents and grandparents buy expensive bikes for their children to use. The problem has grown, so we need to look further into the need for controls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_289">Many other issues are highlighted in the report. The most fundamental issue, on which everything else hangs&#151;unless we want simply to ban the activity out of existence&#151;is No. 1 on the top 10 issues. I refer to the lack of legal off-road facilities and the real problem 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_290">I realise that some of the issues do not fall under the Minister&#039;s remit, but the need for a cross-cutting approach at local and national level remains the key to the solution. Providing a holistic solution to the problem is the biggest challenge. I have already raised some of the issues with other Ministers, including Cabinet Ministers. I note, in passing, that the Labour Government should be commended for trying to produce some joined-up thinking on the matter. Only a few years ago, the Government established the Government Motorsport unit in Northampton. It was funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, but pulls together the whole range of motor sport interests from the DTI, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the regional development agencies&#151;for the east of England, the south-east and the east and west midlands. My right hon. Friend will notice that there is no mention there of any Welsh interest, but perhaps he and I can look further into that after the debate. We may be able to work together to rectify the problem.

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_291">There are some people&#151;I am probably known as one myself&#151;who adopt a very tough stance on nuisance behaviour. I know that some people want us to throw the book at those who cause a nuisance through off-road biking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_292">In that connection, I commend the south Wales off-road police bike team. It remains desperately in need of a minimal amount of sustainable funding from local authorities in south Wales, but it mounts aggressive operations to clamp down on the illegitimate and dangerous use of off-road bikes. The last time that the team went out, it combed the Garw, Llynfi and Ogmore valleys and all the way down to the M4. Around 30 riders were caught and cautioned, and four bikes were confiscated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_293">Police in Durham and elsewhere in the country do not merely confiscate bikes. They also crush them so that they are taken out of the system and cannot be stolen. However, my preferred approach would be to provide opportunities for people to pursue off-road biking, and then come down hard on people who abuse that right. Also, instead of confiscating and crushing bikes, I believe that we should reuse them as part of a scheme to train young people in riding skills or mechanics. For the network of youth offending teams, an asset of such value as a motor cycle could be put to good and constructive use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_294">However, that means that facilities need to be provided so that we can take advantage of such an approach. Adequate provision for off-road biking would mean that the police could be involved, as they are in existing schemes in some parts of the country. Officers could then work with youngsters and give them skills and safety awareness, and they would no longer be seen merely as the long and tough arm of the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_295">The fundamental question remains: how can we clamp down on the miscreants&#151;those uninformed and, frankly, idiotic people&#151;if we do not provide the facilities as well? We have to adopt the stick-and-carrot approach, and recognise that off-road biking is as legitimate as any other activity.

In parts of the UK, including some in Wales and Scotland, local authorities and countryside agencies have taken that step, but other areas have not.

<p><a name="st_184"><a name="41111-28_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 My hon. Friend will know that, to be fair to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, it has conducted its own survey of the issue, linked to the introduction of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. I have been involved in correspondence with a constituent who has worked for one of the off-road associations to see how they can prove, by mapping historical routes, that they have traditionally been used by off-road motor cyclists. That is the right approach, but the associations do not have the resources or the time to pursue it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_185"><a name="41111-28_spnew1"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 That is a valid point. Another difficulty is that the problem is not considered one of the top three issues, but for some constituents off-road motor cycling is a major problem because it is focused intensively in certain areas. I commend the work that DEFRA has done on the issue, but one of the advantages of the ACU approach&#151;it is sponsored by the Department for Trade and Industry, but also has cross-departmental involvement&#151;is the local government support unit. The unit helps local authorities, the police and other agencies to target effectively their use of resources, to ascertain the level of demand and to work on the training of instructors and riders. It is amazing that, at a time when we have an increasing level of conflict in the countryside between different uses for land, it is possible for people with no training in using a vehicle to ride across the hills. That needs to be tackled and the ACU approach, through the local government unit, makes that clear.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_309">The ACU approach also stresses the full involvement of local stakeholders, because the burden should not fall wholly on the shoulders of local authorities or countryside agencies. It needs to be taken up by everybody with an interest in the matter.

<a name="stpa_310">At the risk of offending St. Francis of Assisi, whose prayer has already suffered ignominiously at the hands of other politicians, more famous or infamous than me, may I propose the following words to my right hon. Friend the Minister, who has great sympathy with the approach the ACU suggests? Where there is noise, let us bring noise control. Where there is no training for riders, let us, as the ACU suggests, bring standards for the training of riders and instructors. Where there is anarchy on our hills and in our back streets, let us bring order and structure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_311">The Metropolitan police and others have asked me to raise this final point: where there is anonymity of riders, let them be known through clubs and organised structures. One of the major problems in trying to control off-road biking is how to find out who the riders are and how to find out when&#151;if they are not in open competition&#151;their bikes do not have to be registered or licensed. I especially commend the work of one motor cycle manufacturer, KTM, which has already agreed to data tag electronically every new bike it sells in the UK. The cost adds about &#163;50 to customers&#039; bills, but the company thinks it is worth doing&#151;as do the Metropolitan police and the ACU, which is the governing body&#151;given the difficulty of enforcing controls on the off-road biking fraternity. Responsible riders will always work with us, but what about those who do not? The advantage of the tagging system, which I strongly commend, is that we can identify the riders and if they cannot prove that they own the bike, we can confiscate it and take appropriate action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_312">In conclusion, I urge my right hon. Friend, who approaches everything that lands on his plate with a fair dose of rationality and political courage, to work with his colleagues and encourage the efforts of the local authority support unit. In all his work with agencies and local authorities throughout the UK, will he try to disseminate best practice in providing off-road facilities, in the right place, at the right time? In short, we already know what works; there are very good examples. The Government have recognised what works, so let us try to get the message across to every part of the country: this is win-win for local communities and off-road riders.

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">The Government recognise that the issues surrounding motor cycling are complex; they involve wide-ranging issues. In terms of on-road riding, representatives of the Department for Transport have been meeting representatives of motor cycling interests in an advisory group on motor cycling, which has recently reported to Ministers. Its final report was submitted in August, and Transport Ministers are reflecting on its conclusions in developing an on-road motor cycling strategy.

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_317">My initial comments referred to the situation in England, and as my hon.

<a name="41111-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_318">However, these issues are being addressed in a variety of ways. In particular, the ACU strategy to which my hon. Friend referred is first an outcome of work with the Department of Trade and Industry. In terms of my responsibilities, we have recently consulted on proposals that would have an impact on the recreational activities of users of motor vehicles to the extent that they would prevent further expansion of the rights of way network to motorised traffic in inappropriate circumstances.

As a result I asked them to take ownership of the problem and to work with us to tackle some of the key issues. The achievement of my hon. Friend and other Members of the House was to persuade representatives and the industry not to be negative about the consultation we were undertaking but to engage with it, and I am grateful to him for that because it has indeed proved constructive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_320">We set up a time-limited group consisting of the main motorised interest groups and organisations, to look at how the Government&#039;s proposals to deal with motor vehicle use on rights of way might be better delivered. One of the issues that the group is considering is the

<br>&nbsp;<br>provision of alternative sites that might assist in accommodating motor vehicles that might otherwise be used on rights of way. The group is reporting to me in the next few weeks and I give an assurance that I will consider very carefully the recommendations that emerge to address the provision of alternative off-road sites. Indeed, I will undertake to extend the work of the time-limited group if it is clear that it can make a valuable contribution in working with the Government in determining the way forward.

<p><a name="st_187"><a name="41111-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 Is it possible that the mapping exercise undertaken by those who engage in off-road riding could be fed into that work, so that we could see whether a compromise might be reached between the walkers and the riders? As my right hon. Friend knows, that is the worst dilemma; it is not just about who he upsets but whether they upset one another.
</p>








<p><a name="st_188"><a name="41111-28_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I will come to some of these issues. One of the great characteristics of access to the countryside is that people want to use that countryside in a variety of different ways. Sometimes it is a question of organisation so that people have the opportunities to enjoy their pursuit without interfering with the quiet enjoyment of the countryside by others. Sometimes it is a question of changing behaviour, and on some occasions a question of getting people simply to obey the law. But these issues are better dealt with by people recognising that the commonality of interest in access does give rise to difficulties, that they need to be talked through and that people need to be considerate of others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_321">I am very happy when I see representatives of particular groups of users coming forward with constructive suggestions and being willing to engage with Government and with one another in looking for ways forward. It is worth pointing out that in every part of the country, rights of way groups have now been established. They give an opportunity not just for landowners and walkers to relate to one another, but for other types of use also to be reconciled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_322">Access to water is a big issue. The Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon.

There is no magic wand that suddenly creates the possibility of access, but the more people recognise that we live in an island where access to the countryside in a variety of different ways is important, and that that countryside must be used responsibly and considerately, the more we are likely to find the answers to the issues that we are debating, like those that we are debating tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-28_para14">

Once our officials have looked at these common issues, I will meet with ministerial colleagues to consider the way forward. From my Department&#039;s perspective, off-road sites also offer opportunities for farmers and landowners to take part in diversification, possibly utilising grants through the rural enterprise scheme, provided that the use is appropriate to the surrounding conditions and environmental considerations.

<a name="stpa_325">I have to point out that purpose-built sites provide only one part of the solution.

Users who fall into the category of the irresponsible and illegal will not necessarily change from their current practices and go to use organised sites. There will still be those recalcitrant users who continue to drive or ride wherever they please, irrespective of the impact on others. This is why better education and better enforcement of existing offences are vital. The proposals in our consultation paper to that effect were universally welcomed.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way. He has been generous. Does he agree that one way round the problem is the organisation of club structures? Clubs are not only a small clique of people with expensive machines; clubs organise outreach events with trailers in parts of the community where youngsters cannot afford to get to such sites. Clubs organise not just within a small group of people but within a whole area to bring people on board wherever possible.

<a name="stpa_327">Highway authorities are encouraged to take positive steps to identify suitable sites such as disused quarries for inclusion in local plans.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Nov 2004 : Column 1008</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ways in which we regulate motor cycling. When off-road motor cycles, such as scramble or trial bikes, are used on the highway, they must comply with highway regulations, have vehicle excise duty paid and be safely constructed in terms of lighting, braking, tyres and so on. Traffic law applies&#151;for example, in respect of dangerous driving&#151;and riders must hold a driving licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore referred to the fact that riding or driving any vehicle on the pavement is also an offence. I know that the fact that something is an offence is not necessarily the same as being able easily to enforce the behaviour that we expect and is required by law. However, such offences became subject to fixed penalty notices on 1 August 1999, which has made enforcement by the police easier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_331">On another issue that my hon. Friend raised, the police were given new powers in January 2003 to seize motor vehicles being driven in a careless and inconsiderate manner on-road or off-road without authority and in a way that causes or is likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. Furthermore, a general power exists for the courts to enable them to confiscate vehicles used in the commission of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_332">Other powers allow prosecution against dangerous driving and the careless and inconsiderate driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, and a rider of any such vehicle causing death or bodily harm to any person whatsoever by wanton or furious driving could be prosecuted by the police. To complete the picture, other powers may be relevant. For instance, charges may be brought for breach of the peace and causing a nuisance. Local authorities have the powers to prevent or abate noise nuisance. Those powers could apply to the use of off-road motor cycles, and it would be for the local authority to judge whether a problem could be deemed a statutory nuisance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41111-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_333">As scramble or trial bikes are classed as off-road vehicles when they are used off-road, however, other statutory requirements that relate to on-road motor cycles do not apply. So there is no minimum age restriction, nor any requirement to hold a driving licence or insurance or to wear a safety helmet. We currently have no plans to extend those provisions to the off-road use of bikes. Given the nature of off-road use, which tends to be infrequent, often on private land and usually over difficult terrain, effective enforcement would require a considerable commitment of scarce police resources.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_334">I would underline the point that there is a complex range of means by which nuisance and illegal activity can be dealt with, but it is far better if we can create an environment in which the responsible use of motor cycles takes place primarily in areas where they do not cause a nuisance and if there is a separation, as my hon. Friends the Members for Ogmore and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) suggested in their contributions this evening. That will allow people to enjoy the responsible use of motor cycles and other users of the countryside will not have their peace disturbed, thus enabling everyone to benefit from the appropriate enjoyment of the countryside.
