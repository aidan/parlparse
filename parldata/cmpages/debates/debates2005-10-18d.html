<a name="stpa_o5">Will not the role of the Advocate-General become increasingly important if Labour Ministers such as Malcolm Chisholm in Edinburgh put themselves at loggerheads with Home Office Ministers on issues such as the disgraceful practice of carrying out dawn raids on the families of asylum seekers whose applications have been refused?

<a name="51018-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_o6">Responsibility for asylum rests with the Home Office and the hon.

I do not think that the fact that the Advocate-General is not in this House is a particular issue. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Scottish Executive and the Home Office are in discussions. Everyone wants to ensure that where it is necessary to remove people from this country, it is done in as humane a way as possible. We equally recognise that there are many cases that prove to be difficult. The Home Office and the Scottish Executive are working closely together and will continue to do so.

 (Lab): What discussions he has had with the First Minister about the level of business rates. [17063]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51018-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Scotland  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 I have regular discussions with the First Minister, covering a range of issues. The Scottish Executive&#039;s announcement of an alignment of the business rate poundage with England over a period of two years is good news for Scottish businesses.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 685</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51018-01_spnew6"><b> John Robertson: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his response. I know that he will join with me in congratulating the Scottish Executive on its forward thinking. Let us hope that it will bring the right environment for growth in the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-01_para7">
<a name="stpa_o7">The next time my right hon. Friend talks to the First Minister, will he ask him about the business rates for Glasgow? Since the mechanism was introduced by the then Conservative Government&#151;they took all the business rates for Scotland and put them into a pot&#151;Glasgow has lost, in general terms, about a third of its own money. Will my right hon. Friend ensure that when there is even less money going back into the pot Glasgow gets its fair share for once?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51018-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I shall certainly endeavour to talk to the First Minister about that at some stage. I am told that Glasgow has received total Scottish Executive grants of more than &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion, which is something to be going on with. The whole issue of whether non-domestic rates incomes should be retained was considered by the Scottish Executive city review team in 2002. The Scottish Executive established a cities growth fund, which has allowed &#163;172&nbsp;million to be made available to councils. I suspect that whatever system is chosen will have some imperfections, but I would not want my hon. Friend to think that Glasgow was completely losing out. The sum of &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion is a sizeable contribution to the city and is doubtless very much needed. As we all know, Glasgow has made huge efforts in the past few years to transform itself, which is why it is now one of Britain&#039;s foremost cities for retail.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51018-01_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State&#039;s colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have done a U-turn on business rates, which is a change for which Scottish Conservatives have been calling for five years. During that time, Scottish business has paid some &#163;800&nbsp;million more in taxation than it should have done. Will the Secretary of State apologise for what was clearly a mistake?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51018-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 It was drawn to my attention the other day that a by-election was held in Dumfries&#151;which used to be a Tory stronghold&#151;in which the Tories got six votes. The hon. Lady&#039;s question perhaps illustrates why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-01_para8">
<a name="stpa_o8">The hon. Lady must know that Administrations adjust their policies from time to time, in this case to help business. The fact that a Labour-dominated Administration chose to reduce rates shows their commitment to helping Scottish business. I am also bound to say that I do not recall hearing anything from the Conservatives on the subject in the past five or six years, which shows what a hopelessly ineffective Opposition they are, north and south of the border.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51018-01_spnew10"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 Absolute nonsense. We called for that reduction in business rates because we are the party of business and understand that it should have been done long ago. There is no doubt that Scottish business has suffered compared with business in the rest of the UK. The correct decision has at last been taken, but why will it not be introduced until 2007? If it is needed so urgently, should not it happen now? If the elections 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 686</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the Scottish Parliament were next year instead of in 2007, would it be done next year? After all, it is clearly a political, not an economic, decision.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51018-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The hon. Lady just said that it was a necessary economic decision: she cannot have it both ways. The change is being phased in because it has to be paid for. I would have thought that the Conservative party, even in its present state, would accept that to spend money one needs to identify where the savings will be made, and that sometimes takes time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-01_para9">
<a name="stpa_o9">The Scottish economy is doing well&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, it is growing at above the trend rate of growth and we have the highest level of people in work that we have ever had. Contrast that to 20&nbsp;years ago, under a Tory Government, when 3&nbsp;million people were unemployed nationally and there were huge levels of unemployment in Scotland. The Scottish economy is completely different from what it was 20&nbsp;years ago, and that is partly due to what the Scottish Executive are doing, although much of it has to do with the conduct of the economy by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We have seen sustained growth when other countries have had recessions&#151;the difference is there for all to see. Scotland is doing well at the moment. We need to do better still, of course, but we are doing a lot better than we would ever have done had the Conservatives remained in office.

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51018-01_spnew12"><b> Michael Connarty  (Linlithgow and East Falkirk)</b> 
 (Lab): When my right hon. Friend discusses the consequences of the business rate setting with the First Minister, will he ensure that they take into account the result of the equal pay and single status agreement, which should have been implemented in 2002? More than 100,000&nbsp;women are owed back pay to 2002, which could cost local authorities more than &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion. Will my right hon. Friend ensure that that money is available in the financial settlement for Scotland to enable that back pay to be paid, even if the business rates are equalised with England?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51018-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The Scottish Executive had their spending settlement agreed in the spending review last year, and that will not change. As the First Minister has made clear, both the Scottish Executive and local authorities have to live within their budgets, whatever happens in those discussions.
 
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51018-01_spnew14"><b> John Barrett  (Edinburgh, West)</b> 
 (LD): As the Scottish business rate poundage is now heading down to the English level, there is every prospect that the overall rates burden in Scotland will be lower than that in England. What steps will the Secretary of State take to promote Scotland&#039;s new competitive edge to potential inward investors from Europe and more widely, to ensure that the Scottish economy gains the maximum benefit from the bold step agreed by the Scottish Executive and announced by Nicol Stephen?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51018-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I think that this is a somewhat sterile debate, but it is certainly my recollection that although the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Liberal colleague north of the border may have muscled in on the matter, the decision was very much that of the First Minister, as we would expect.

<a name="51018-01_para10">
<a name="stpa_o10">I welcome the hon. Gentleman, who is standing in for his colleague as Liberal spokesman&#151;the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) has other business, and I quite understand that&#151;and, as a fellow Edinburgh MP, he will know that there are many examples in Edinburgh, as well as other parts of Scotland, where firms have chosen to set up in business. Perhaps a striking example is the fact that the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is now the fifth or sixth biggest bank in the world, has chosen to locate its global headquarters in Edinburgh. It employs a substantial number of people, and it and other financial service providers in the city have done a great deal to advertise the merit of doing business in Scotland. That is why I told the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) a few moments ago that Scotland is doing an awful lot better today than in the past. Of course, we need to improve our productivity and so on, but the economic picture in Scotland is pretty good at present, and we will build on that with a stable economy, as well as with the other measures that will be taken by the Government here and the Scottish Executive at Holyrood.

 My right hon. Friend and I keep in touch with colleagues in the Ministry of Defence on a range of issues, including the current consultation on the Met Office network.

<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51018-02_spnew0"><b> Jo Swinson: </b> 
 Bearing in mind the unique nature of Scotland&#039;s weather, does the Minister feel that it is appropriate for Scotland to be left with no civil meteorological office?

</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51018-02_spnew1"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The hon. Lady pre-empts the ongoing consultation exercise&#151;and no decision has been taken on that, as she well knows. Indeed, I think that she was present during the Adjournment debate in July, which was sponsored by the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), when the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), said very clearly that he was willing to consider any representation that might be made. Obviously, the option of keeping the Aberdeen office open as a centre of excellence is part of the current consultation, which is ongoing, and I shall certainly not pre-empt its result.

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51018-02_spnew3"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. It is true that discussions are taking place today between key stakeholders and officials in the Met Office. Those discussions are the direct result of a clear commitment that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary made in the House, namely, that if options were proposed he would consider them very carefully. Those at today&#039;s meeting will consider whether the talks can produce another definitive option, which may then result in the consultation period being extended. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) suggests, there has been a clear, open and transparent consultation, which is continuing.

 Given the Scottish nationalists performance in recent Scottish elections, they can hardly claim to speak for the majority of people in Scotland.

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It is a significant historical event, whatever people&#039;s individual views of its merits, or otherwise. It is far too early to be able to put forward any definitive plans, but discussions are ongoing. As well as looking at the tremendous success of the UK over 300&nbsp;years on the anniversary, I hope that we will be able to look to the future and Scotland&#039;s role in the Union in the 21st century&#151;in a globalised economy with the threats of the fast-developing world&#151;so that we can think about not only our historically tremendously successful country, but a confident nation that is looking forward to a confident future and the next 300&nbsp;years of the Union.

 The way that the hon. Gentleman puts that is not right. I agree, of course, with his comments about the Lord Chief Justice. There is a great deal of practical working between the judiciary and the Government. For example, I quote the work of Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, who, when president of the family division, made many helpful contributions to the development of policy in relation to family proceedings, care proceedings involving children and domestic violence. Sir Igor Judge sits on the National Criminal Justice Board, together with criminal justice Ministers, the police and prosecutors. They work sensibly together. It is for the Government to propose legislation to the House, for the House to decide in its wisdom what to pass into legislation, and for judges, with the assistance of the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;introduced by the Government, to make a decision on a case-by-case basis.

 We do not want a situation in which a defendant is charged and brought to court but the case cannot proceed because the victim has not turned up as a result of intimidation, or because a witness has not turned up because the case has been adjourned a couple of times.

 The &#163;46&nbsp;fee is often mooted in favour of the junior Bar and is sometimes done so in a way that implies misunderstanding.

 We want to ensure that people have the choice of voting by post, which is an increasingly popular way of voting.

 The hon. Gentleman is not right to say that we will not countenance it. In the Electoral Administration Bill, we are making provision to pilot the testing of individual identifiers and signatures. The right way to proceed is on an evidence base. We need to achieve three things to ensure the legitimacy of democracy. The first is that everyone should have access to a vote, which means everyone who is eligible being on the register. The second is that everyone should want to vote, which relates to high turnouts and to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) about postal voting. The third is that nobody should fiddle the vote. We need to focus on all three, and to have measures that will work across the board. That is what we shall be doing.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51018-05_spnew10"><b> Nick Harvey (representing the House of Commons Commission): </b> 
 The issue of contract cleaners&#039; pay was discussed by the Commission on 18&nbsp;July and again yesterday evening. The Commission took note of the progress in the ongoing negotiations between the cleaners&#039; employers and the Transport and General Workers Union. It also took note of the offer from the employing company, Mitie, of a pay increase to its staff from &#163;5.20&nbsp;to &#163;6&nbsp;per hour, funded through internal efficiency savings. The Commission also confirmed that it had no plans to increase the contract&#039;s value. Improved on-site accommodation for the contract staff has now been provided.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="51018-05_spnew11"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Even Thomas Gradgrind and Ebenezer Scrooge would balk at the Dickensian cleaning contracts in this place, which have driven wages down to poverty levels. Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the Commission has a role to play in settling this dispute? Will he ask the Serjeant at Arms to convene a tripartite forum of contractors, unions and House staff, with the aim of overcoming the impasse that is bedevilling progress in this unnecessary dispute?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="51018-05_spnew12"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 The issue of pay and conditions is a matter for the employer and the work force. Let me make it crystal clear to the House that the authorities of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 700</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the House have done, and are doing, what they can to help to resolve this issue. However, the Commission has authorised me to reaffirm that it will not increase the &#163;2.2&nbsp;million value of the contract. It cannot become directly involved in the negotiation of terms and conditions, which are a commercial and, ultimately, a legal matter between a contractor and its staff. The authorities of the House are, however, being kept informed of the progress in these negotiations, and will continue to do what they can to assist in achieving agreement as fast as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="51018-05_spnew13"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham)</b> 
 (Con): May I put it to the hon. Gentleman that his answer to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) is not entirely satisfactory? Some of us think that it is not really good enough for the House of Commons Commission to hide behind the cloak of a contractual negotiation between employer and employee. As one who signed the early-day motion tabled by the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik), may I put it to the representative of the Commission that it would do the Commission great credit if it were to intervene in such a way as to offer hope to the people who toil incredibly hard in this House for a pathetically insignificant reward?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="51018-05_spnew14"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 The House of Commons lets contracts for a wide variety of services within the organisation. It would be highly unusual if, halfway through one such contract, we were to renegotiate its value, and it would become impossibly difficult for the House to hold the value of any other contract on a wider front if we showed a willingness so to do. I reaffirm that the House authorities have worked with the employer to help it to find substantial savings within the contract. Parts of the building will be cleaned less frequently than before, and some will be cleaned during the day rather than in the evening. When we let this contract, however, it was not given to the lowest bidder. All bidders gave indicative pay rates, which we insisted had to be set at a level that would minimise staff turnover. Indeed, staff turnover on this contract is much lower than the industry average, indicating a degree of satisfaction on the part of the work force.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="51018-05_spnew15"><b> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Is not the crux of the matter that the people about whom we are talking are not being paid as much as those directly employed by the House of Commons? Why should there be such a difference? Does not the Commission have a responsibility to ensure that all those who do such essential work are paid decent wages, which is not what has happened so far? The people who have been employed by the contractors have been treated disgracefully, and it is about time that the House of Commons put the whole matter right.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="51018-05_spnew16"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 The wages and conditions on these contracts are comparable with equivalent contracts in the area and with the market rate. The pay of in-House cleaners reflects two points: first, that they work in sensitive areas, where it was felt that the service should not be contracted out; and secondly, that they are paid within a pay system that covers the majority of the House&#039;s employees. Therefore, internal relativities as well as market factors have had to be considered when settling the level of pay for in-House cleaners.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_2">I am delighted to have an opportunity to present this Bill. I believe that it is an extremely important measure, which the Government should implement if we are serious about reducing smoking in this country, particularly among younger people. The stimulus for the Bill came in 2004, when the Government published their White Paper &quot;Choosing health: making healthier choices easier&quot;. The White Paper contained a chapter dedicated to the reduction of smoking through a number of different initiatives, none of which included raising the age at which people could buy tobacco. I found that something of a mystery at the time, especially in the light of the BBC&#039;s 2004&nbsp;Healthier Britain survey, which revealed that 80&nbsp;per cent. of the public&#151;particularly those aged between 18&nbsp;and 24&#151;supported such a move.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_3">Since then, I tabled two early-day motions during the last two parliamentary Sessions proposing such a measure. My early-day motion 226, which I tabled in May, has already attracted well over 50&nbsp;signatures in this Session from Members in all parts of the House. It states that this House calls on the Government to give serious consideration to raising the minimum age of sales of tobacco from 16&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;years to bring it in line with sales of alcohol. I urge all Members who have not already signed it to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_4">My main reason for introducing this Bill&#151;other than its obvious beneficial impact in terms of preventing youngsters from smoking&#151;is that in the past couple of years the Government have made great strides in the age-barring of many other products. For example, under the terms of the Gambling Act 2005, the use of many gaming machines will be restricted to over-18-year-old players. Through the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, the Government intend to raise to 18&nbsp;the age of sale of airguns and dangerous knives. Such measures doubtless enjoy popular support, so it is common sense to implement a similar measure in respect of tobacco. Doing so would show unequivocally that this Government do not condone young people smoking to the same extent that they do not condone young people drinking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_5">My Bill would not be a world first. A number of European countries&#151;including Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Iceland, Malta, Norway and Poland&#151;have already introduced such a measure. North of the border, Scotland is considering implementing such a measure through the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, thanks to the tabling of an amendment by my Scottish Labour parliamentary colleague, Mr. Duncan McNeil, the MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde. So in effect, we would be following in the footsteps of some of our enlightened European colleagues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_6">Of course, my Bill would not totally stop young people smoking, but it would impact on the number who become smokers in their teenage years, which is when some 80&nbsp;per cent. of smokers begin smoking. The best 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 706</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>example of the impact of such a measure can be seen on the island of Guernsey, where the age of sale was raised to 18&nbsp;as long ago as 1997. Before then, the number of young smokers in Guernsey was roughly the same, as a percentage, as in the rest of the UK. But by 2003, thanks primarily to that measure and to the setting up of an appropriately named organisation, GASP&#151;the Guernsey Adolescent Smoke-free Project&#151;the number of young people reporting that they smoked had reduced by half. Now, nearly twice as many youngsters smoke in the UK as smoke in Guernsey, and when questioned, only 3&nbsp;per cent. of Guernsey&#039;s 11-year-olds said that they thought they would smoke when they were older. Guernsey is now credited as being the world leader in reducing smoking among young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_7">So there is clear evidence that raising the age of sale can reduce the number of youngsters who smoke, and I am delighted to say that my Bill enjoys the support of a number of different organisations and agencies, such as the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation and the Trading Standards Institute, to name but two. Having spoken to Mike Unger, the chief executive of the foundation, I know that he is very supportive of my Bill. The foundation is currently funding a 12-year study into children&#039;s attitudes to smoking and it has just published the primary results. I am sure that the Government will want to look at its findings in great detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_8">The TSI, which is responsible for enforcing the laws relating to age-restricted sales&#151;including sales of tobacco&#151;across England and the rest of the UK, also strongly supports my Bill. In 2004&#150;05, trading standards services prosecuted some 117&nbsp;retailers for selling cigarettes to children aged under 16. The retailers received penalties ranging from a conditional discharge to fines of up to &#163;1,000; many more received cautions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_9">After its annual conference in June this year, the Trading Standards Institute, in a press release entitled &quot;Call to raise age limit on cigarettes to 18&quot;, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The age limit on cigarette sales should be raised to 18, bringing tobacco into line with other age-barred products that have a detrimental effect on public health&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_10">The call for action is also backed by the local authorities&#039; co-ordinators of regulatory services. Stephen Butterworth, the TSI&#039;s lead officer on health, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;TSI supports the thrust of last year&#039;s Government White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, which aims to improve public health by encouraging healthier choices. With that in mind, we do not believe the Government is right to leave it to 16-year-olds to make the potentially life-threatening choice of smoking or not.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_11">Mr. Brandon Cook, TSI joint lead on age-restricted sales, added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;We believe that raising the age limit to 18, combined with stronger penalties against shopkeepers who repeatedly make underage sales, would make it more difficult for young people to regularly get their hands on cigarettes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_12">The TSI has previously requested raising the age to 18&nbsp;without success and it is TSI policy to continue to press for action on the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_13">It is also my intention to continue to press the Government on this issue. The current age restriction on tobacco dates back to the beginning of the last century&#151;well before scientific evidence was available to demonstrate the real health impact of smoking.

<a name="stpa_17">First, may I say that the motion is intended to assist the House in using our available time this afternoon on Report to the very best possible effect? We have made good progress on the Bill thus far. There have been seven days and 11 sittings in Committee, starting on 5 July and finishing on 21 July. We had a timetable motion in Committee in order to ensure good progress, and as a result of the knives, only clauses 12 and 13 and parts of clause 5 failed to be discussed&#151;some seven groups of amendments in all. We certainly debated far more than seven groups of amendments in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_18">Although I should point out that there was plenty of time to raise issues, I am told that we spent, in total, some 26&nbsp;hours and six minutes in all. We were even offered the possibility of a final sitting on the afternoon of 21&nbsp;July, but in the event it was not needed or required by Opposition parties. We thus had more than sufficient time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">Because of the need to make the best use of available time, we propose to divide today&#039;s timetable with knives at 5.45&nbsp;and 7.15&nbsp;to ensure that all parts of the Bill are properly scrutinised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_20">I readily recognise that there are important and serious matters for us to discuss, but we need to parcel up the business in this way to allow for Third Reading at 9&nbsp;pm as normal. If hon. Members want to debate the Bill, they should accept the motion and let us get on with that debate. The House will surely agree that it would be better for us to spend time this afternoon debating the Bill and the substantial matters before us rather than taking time to debate at length whether or not to timetable the debate. With that in mind, our motion will help order our debate sensibly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51018-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nick Gibb  (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con):</b> 
 Is the Minister programming the discussion on the Bill because he personally as a Minister believes that the advantages of the Bill are overstated?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 709</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51018-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I shall take that as a question specific to the programme motion, which of course it was. The matters before us are very important. There are three distinct categories, all of which need discussion. If the hon. Gentleman resists the urge to vote against the motion, my views will come out in due course.

<a name="time_3">
<a name="51018-07_time1"><h5>3.46&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51018-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Edward Garnier  (Harborough) (Con):</b> 
 I am used now to the Minister, either from that Dispatch Box or in Committee, demanding less time for this important Bill to be discussed and, lo and behold, here he comes again with the same request. Of course, it is not a request but a demand; a demand that this House will no doubt need to consider carefully. I hope that, in due course, we will test the opinion of the House. Whatever blandishments are put forward by the Minister, I urge the House to reject the motion yet again to curtail debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_21">This is not some statutory instrument or anodyne piece of business. This is one of the most important Bills that we will discuss during this Session. The Bill utterly alters the status of the state and its relationship with the individual. Yet as we predicted in Committee, the Government are curtailing debate. We have about seven or eight different areas of discussion to deal with this afternoon, and the Government seem wholly incapable of producing the necessary arguments to justify this curtailment of discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_22">I shall not detain the House this afternoon by dignifying the Minister&#039;s remarks with a lengthy response, which would be to fall into the trap that he has so candidly placed before us. However, the Bill contains approximately 60&nbsp;powers to be given to the Home Secretary, who is no longer in his place, to make secondary legislation. It is a radically dangerous way to legislate and it is even worse that the Government are curtailing our ability to discuss it. I urge all hon. Members with any understanding of the word &quot;democracy&quot;, or of the expression &quot;Let us scrutinise this legislation&quot;, to vote against the programme motion, which is unnecessary and wholly ridiculous.

<a name="time_4">

</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51018-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 As the Minister said, the sessions in Committee were good, but they were exactly that: Committee sessions. Today, we have an opportunity for the whole House to have a say and it is important that we allow adequate time for a full discussion of all the issues that arise from this extensive Bill. Frankly, my fear is that although we have been careful in seeking to retain a tight focus in respect of the amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friends&#151;as, indeed, have the Conservatives&#151;the operation of the knives will be such that we will not be allowed to have a full discussion of all the matters of importance that ought to be scrutinised by this place. Accordingly, should a Division be called, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will not support the Government.

<a name="time_5">
<a name="51018-07_time3"><h5>3.50&nbsp;pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51018-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</b> 
 I rise to support the observations of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 710</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mr. Garnier). The Minister in his opening remarks said that the motion was for the assistance of the House so as to make best use of the time available to us. The time available to us is the amount of time provided by the Government. If they truly wanted to assist the House, they would have given us a great deal more time, especially as the Bill will not come into early effect. The reality is that there is ample time for proper consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_23">My hon. and learned Friend sketched out the principal arguments against timetable motions of this kind, and I shall add one or two further comments. First, we must never forget that the Report stage is the only opportunity for Members of this House who were not members of the Standing Committee to scrutinise the detail of a Bill. On this occasion, they will be allowed no more than five hours for that detailed scrutiny. In my view, that is wrong in principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_24">My second point which is rather different, although the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) alluded to it when he spoke about retaining a tight focus when framing his amendments, is that hon. Members faced with tight guillotines often do not table the amendments that they would table if more time were available. As a consequence, Bills are not being scrutinised properly. The grossest example of a Bill that was not properly scrutinised is the one that became the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which has been criticised time and again, in the Court of Appeal and elsewhere, for its inadequate construction and the poor scrutiny that it received here. The same thing is happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_25">I hope that the House will never allow a timetable motion to go through without a protest and a vote. The Government say that that will circumscribe debate. Although true, that is unworthy of this House&#151;but typical of this Government.

<a name="time_6">
<a name="51018-07_time4"><h5>3.51&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51018-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Richard Shepherd  (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</b> 
 I, too, rise to support what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) said from the Front Bench, and the comments that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) has just made. My distinguished colleague was right to say that the time available is the amount of time that the Government set.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_26">The Government expect their supporters to march into the appropriate Lobby to support the proposition that it is fair to devote an hour and three quarters to the Bill&#039;s central contention, which is that a national identity register should be set up. This is a profoundly important piece of legislation, yet the Government say that the time allotted will be sufficient for scrutiny by Back-Bench Members from every party who could not attend the Standing Committee, or who were not put on it in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_27">The Bill was in Committee for only seven days, and the Minister made much of the fact that it received 26&nbsp;hours and six minutes of consideration. In any Parliament before 1997, that would have been laughable. This Bill affects every citizen of this country. With the fines that it can impose and its proposals for a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>national identity register, it reaches into every particular of identity, yet it is not being discussed in the traditional manner on the Floor of the House of Commons.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051018/debtext/51018-08.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51018-08_spnew0"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the motion represents a travesty of parliamentary scrutiny, given the mass electorate that will be affected by the Bill? Is not that underlined by the fact that each amendment in the first two groups, although they relate to the very essence of the Bill, will receive only eight minutes of consideration&#151;and that is on the rather unlikely assumption that there are no votes? Is not that an absolute disgrace?
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51018-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 I could not agree more. The essence of the argument is that at the heart of the Bill is a change in the relationship between an individual&#039;s identity and the Government. Outside wartime emergency regulations, that represents a complete change in our relationship with the state. The Government think that a total of 26&nbsp;hours and six minutes in Committee discharges their responsibility to this House and to the people whom we represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_28">This Bill is important, but we face yet another guillotine. It has been said that the Government rule by guillotine, not by winning arguments in debate. That is why the House should reject the motion.

<a name="time_7">

</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51018-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) and my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) for pointing out a number of vital matters. I heard one of the Ministers refer to the Leader of the Opposition in the context of the Bill. He will know that I have had the gravest doubts about the way in which the Bill was presented on Second Reading. When the matter was decided in 1995, it was pursued on a voluntary basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">I heard the Minister this morning on the &quot;Today&quot; programme refer to an enabling Bill. The enabling process changes the nature of the operation completely and will not allow proper debate. As the Minister well knows, the reality is that in the context of what the Information Commissioner said, this is about state surveillance. That is why I presented George Orwell&#039;s book &quot;1984&quot; to the Home Secretary who, to his disgrace, is not here this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_30">With great respect to you, Mr. Speaker, Standing Orders have been taken over by the Executive, and that has led to the situation today. They should be returned to you. This is the constitutional question that we face. Matters related to guillotines and programme motions should be decided not by the majority in the House but by indisputably distinguished and independent parties&#151;in particular yourself, Mr. Speaker. It is a disgrace to hear Ministers from the Home Office suggest otherwise.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51018-08_spnew4"><b> Ann Winterton  (Congleton) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Would you look into the fact that on two occasions since we returned to the House what is known as the chauffeurs&#039; entrance has been closed during a Division? I understand that responsibility has passed from the police to the security services in the House, and I wonder whether you could ensure that in future when the Division bell rings entrances are open so that Members of Parliament can come to vote as soon as possible.

<p><a name="st_17"><i>As amended in the Standing Committee, considered.</i></p>








<a name="time_9">
<a name="51018-09_time0"><h5>4.13&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51018-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be recommitted to a Select Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_33">Members hold many serious reservations about the Bill, and even more reservations are held by people outside the House. That is not reason in itself to recommit to a Select Committee; indeed, there is opportunity under the normal Committee and Report process for us to consider the principled reasons, but the Bill, almost more than any other, depends on the practicalities. If it does not work, if it costs vastly more than the Government say it will cost and if conclusions can be drawn about the scope of the information stored on identity cards, the enabling Bill&#151;on repeated occasions, the Minister has stressed that it is enabling legislation&#151;has completely different connotations and the House ought seriously to consider them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_34">I accept that the Standing Committee process is, in many ways, a good means of examining the detail of a Bill&#151;line by line&#151;but it is difficult for a Standing Committee to perform the same role in respect of this enabling Bill. The process is thus imperfect and does not allow hon. Members to consider matters in depth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_35">The Committee that considered the Bill certainly did not have the opportunity to examine issues in detail, many of which the Government raised following the conclusion of the 11th sitting on 21&nbsp;July. Indeed, the Home Affairs Committee undertook an in-depth examination, but that&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51018-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. There are far too many private conversations in the Chamber, which is unfair to the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51018-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I am grateful, Mr. Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_36">The Home Affairs Committee reported on 20&nbsp;July 2004&#151;more than a year before the end of the Standing Committee process. The House has thus not had the benefit of the inquisitorial method of working that Select Committees use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_37">Three matters of principal concern have arisen since the end of the Standing Committee, the first of which is costs. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have repeatedly raised the question of costs throughout the passage of the Bill because it is critical to our understanding of what the national identity card system will mean. Some of us believe that the large investment that the Government propose would be better spent on other forms of detecting and preventing crime, but that is an aside. We need to know the Government&#039;s intentions, which were made clear only in the past few days through what the press described as a string of concessions to critics in an effort to avert a rebellion. I do not know whether a rebellion will be averted, but I do know that the House is entitled critically to examine the Government&#039;s costings. We must be assured that the costings are robust and capable of being realised. We especially need to examine the Minister&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 718</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposed arrangements to recoup funds from other Departments, which will be critical to the working of the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_38">Secondly, we must consider something that is rather inelegantly called function creep. The Minister has been somewhat undermined by his colleagues in the Cabinet Office, because the Government&#039;s chief information officer&#039;s draft information technology strategy has been leaked over the past few days. On identity cards, it is important to note that the document reveals:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Identity management is a subject whose time has now arrived.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_39">It says that the Government are leading the debate on identity cards and will be using it as part of a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;suite of identity management solutions&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_40">to enable public and private sectors to provide cost-effective electronic services. The document also says that data sharing will increase under new proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_41">Those are legitimate matters of concern for many hon. Members, so we want to find out what the Cabinet Office proposes and whether the Home Office agrees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_42">Thirdly, the efficacy of the proposals&#151;their ability to do what they say they will do&#151;is a matter of huge concern among many hon. Members. In the past few days&#151;after the Standing Committee concluded&#151;we found out the results of tests on the card system. The system works perfectly well&#151;unless a person is disabled, has dark skin, has brown eyes, is bald, or is wrinkled. If someone makes the mistake of being bald and wrinkled, the system tells them that their head is upside down. If a person is a labourer, typist, or pianist, the system does not work. The system does not work if a person undertakes a voluntary change of appearance, which rules out every teenager in the country. If people make the mistake of ageing, identity card technology is not for them. In fact, it has been revealed that one in 1,000&nbsp;cases result in a misidentification. As 13.5&nbsp;million people a month go through British airports, there will be 13,500&nbsp;misidentifications every month, which will do wonders for the queues at security checks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_43">The Minister&#039;s response is that multiple identifiers will cure that problem, but I draw the House&#039;s attention to the front page of today&#039;s edition of <i>The Scotsman</i>. It says that ID cards equal more fraud and quotes at length Mr. Jerry Fishenden, the national technology officer for Microsoft&#151;a company one would expect to know something about the subject&#151;who says that the identity card scheme as envisaged will result in &quot;massive identity fraud&quot; on a scale as yet unseen. On balance, I prefer the evidence of the Microsoft bosses to that of the Minister, but it is for a Select Committee to look in detail at the proposals. It could call Mr. Fishenden to give evidence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51018-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51018-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I do not think I would be in order if I accepted an intervention, as I am giving a statement of the reasons for recommittal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_44">It is essential that, before the Bill leaves the House today, a Special Select Committee should have the opportunity to take evidence, examine witnesses and give the House the benefit of reasoned advice on this subject. I shall close with a quote from the Minister of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 719</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>State, who will tell me in a moment that he agrees with the recommittal motion and that this is a matter that should go before a Select Committee. He said that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;the arguments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have shifted away from civil liberties to practicalities and costs, and those are the issues we must address&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_45">The Government must address those issues, but so must the House if it is to do its job properly. It cannot do so within the confines of Report and Third Reading as envisaged in the programme motion. The Bill must return to Committee if the House is not to divest itself of its responsibilities and leave it yet again to another place to do the job that we should be doing as the primary Chamber.

<a name="time_10">
<a name="51018-09_time1"><h5>4.22&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51018-09_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I fully intend to give the motion the short shrift that it deserves. The matters of substance about which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) spoke will be dealt with, not just by the House in our remaining time today but by the other place. As the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) will agree, we look at things 61&nbsp;times whenever matters of substance and detail come back to the House. As I have repeatedly said, this is enabling legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_46">As for the history of the proposal, the simple fact is that the Bill and the policy underlying it have probably received more consultation and scrutiny than most legislation. That started in 2002&nbsp;with an initial six-month public consultation on the entitlement cards and identity fraud consultation paper. An inquiry by the Home Affairs Committee began in 2003&nbsp;following publication of the Government&#039;s policy statement on the introduction of identity cards in &quot;Identity Cards&#151;The Next Steps&quot; in November 2003. The draft Identity Cards Bill was published in April 2004.
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51018-09_spnew7"><b> Mr. Winnick: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51018-09_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I am not permitted to do so, for the reasons already given by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_47">The draft Bill was published in April 2004, and the Select Committee went on to undertake formal pre-legislative scrutiny of it, publishing its report in October 2004. We then introduced the first Identity Cards Bill in November 2004, and its Committee stage consisted of eight sittings totalling 24&nbsp;hours. I know that that will not please the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), but it is a normal time scale. That Bill was passed by the House in February 2005&nbsp;but ran out of time in the House of Lords because of the May election. Prior to the election, there were two full Select Committee inquiries and full determination by a Standing Committee of the House. To suggest that the Bill has not been subjected to due scrutiny is nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para15">
<a name="stpa_48">The Bill has come back before us after due process in a Committee for 11&nbsp;sittings over seven days, a total of 26&nbsp;hours and six minutes. That six minutes may include the time that there were two Liberals present in Committee. For the substantive part of the debate, there were not two Liberals present, for whatever reason, yet they have the cheek to propose to the House that the Bill be recommitted to a Select Committee. For 90&nbsp;per cent. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 720</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the time they could not be bothered to have their full complement at the Standing Committee. That is outrageous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-09_para16">
<a name="stpa_49">The Bill is very similar to the one passed in February. Because it is an enabling Bill, as I said, much more detailed work will be undertaken by the House in the usual way before the cards are introduced in 2008. It is right to put the legislation in place now so that we can start to put in hand the detailed arrangements for procurement and for building the scheme, and to establish a new agency based on UK Passport Service to be responsible for issuing ID cards. All those matters of detail will have been discussed by the House on 61&nbsp;occasions, which is right and proper, given that it is enabling legislation. I am sure the House will agree that we would spend our time far better this afternoon debating the substance of the Bill, rather than a silly little motion from the Liberal Democrats.

<p>
<a name="51018-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">The purpose of the amendments is to question in detail precisely why we are setting about this extremely difficult, demanding and intrusive piece of legislation. We have already heard the contradictory explanations for the purpose of the register and the card. For instance, on 3&nbsp;July 2002, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who was then Home Secretary, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;I accept that it is important that we do not pretend that an entitlement card would be an overwhelming factor in combating international terrorism&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_60">Later, however, in answer to a question from another Member of Parliament, he said that he would not rule out the possibility of

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;their substantial contribution to countering terrorism&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3&nbsp;July 2002; Vol. 388, c. 231, 236.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">I hope that the Minister will explain how those statements now stack up, after the relatively short space of three years. In the light of the events of 7&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;July, can the former Home Secretary&#039;s opinions be reconciled with the Minister&#039;s adapted view of the register and the card?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_62">In December 2004, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside told Parliament that the security services had advised him that 35&nbsp;per cent. of terrorists used false identification. The general secretary of Interpol, Ron Noble, told the House of Lords Home Affairs Committee that all terrorist incidents involved the use of a false passport. However, when he was challenged about that claim, he was unable to present evidence to support it. In 2004, Privacy International published the findings of the only research ever conducted into the relationship between identity cards and terrorism. It found that there was no evidence to support the claim that the cards could combat terrorist threats. Its report stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;The presence of an identity card is not recognised by analysts as a meaningful or significant component in anti-terrorism strategies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_63">The events of 7&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;July obviously brought this issue into much closer focus. I thought it instructive that the current Home Secretary pointed out at the time that even if identity cards had been used, they would have made absolutely no difference to the events of those two days, which the Minister and I both remember clearly, as we were in Committee on at least one of those days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_64">If this card is designed to combat terrorism, how can it do so against the sort of terrorist that we saw operating in this country in July? This country has tried identity cards previously in the shape of specialist driving licences, as issued in Northern Ireland. They were never broadcast as such, but they were a distinct attempt to try to contain terrorism using a form of identity card. They failed&#151;I can vouch for that, as I was there at the time. The great benefit to us 10, 20&nbsp;or 30&nbsp;years ago was that those terrorists with whom we were dealing were identifiable, as many of the families involved had been engaged in terrorism for years, so it was a fair bet that a son or daughter born to a particular family might have subversive views. That is not so with the new brand of terrorist.

 In relation to Northern Ireland, I agree that there have been attempts 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 727</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>at introducing one form of identification or another down the years. Does he agree that were there any evidence whatever to suggest that formal identification methodologies had been effective in Northern Ireland, the Government would have provided it, yet there has not been a single occasion on which they have been able to do so in the entire history of the identity cards debate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51018-12_spnew1"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am grateful for that intervention, and I will answer the hon. Gentleman by saying that it was my experience that this quasi-identity card&#151;which was issued first in the mid-1970s, I think&#151;had a converse effect to that which the Government sought. As he will remember, anybody who had such a card or driving licence on their person had a pass, which, if shown to police or soldiers, gave them free passage. So, it had precisely the opposite effect to that which was intended. If the cards had worked in Ulster, why was their further use not developed? Why was biometric information not added to those cards when that experiment was tried? Empirically, the experiment failed to control terrorism, and I believe that it will do so again. From the mouths of Ministers, including the Home Secretary, it is acknowledged that identity cards would not have affected how &quot;clean skins&quot; operate inside this country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51018-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Adrian Bailey  (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument, and I accept that identity cards would not prevent a particular incident from taking place. However, their use and a register would make it much easier to identify people using multiple identities subsequently, and would therefore aid their capture and reduce the global pool of would-be terrorists.
</p>








<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51018-12_spnew3"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 That is a fair point. If that is the case, however, first, let us confirm that the biometrics and technology will work to allow that to happen. Secondly, why did the Home Secretary say in July that identity cards would not have affected the two sets of attacks? I do not know. Conceivably, if the card can be made to work, if the biometrics are feasible, and if it comes in at a reasonable cost, there may be something in it. I see nothing at the moment that suggests that it would work, however.
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51018-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bailey: </b> 
 I cannot recall the Home Secretary&#039;s exact words in July, but I do recall a discussion about the use of identity cards in Spain to identify the Madrid bombers, and about mobile phones. Because it was necessary to register an identity card when buying a mobile phone, it was possible to track down the bombers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51018-12_spnew5"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 That is not the point that the Government are making. The bombers in Spain were identified as a result of a number of basic mistakes that they made with the use of mobile phones. The fact that evidence had been well maintained and recorded, and had been used by both the mobile phone companies and the police&#151;as well as the curiously amateurish behaviour of the terrorists&#151;allowed the terrorists to be identified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_65">The hon. Gentleman did, however, make a fair point. The bombers who killed themselves on 7&nbsp;July did two things very deliberately. First, they made sure that their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 728</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>faces were recorded by cameras before they went to their deaths. Secondly&#151;this is really the point&#151;they made sure that they had on them forms of identity so that their bodies could be identified, and they would reap whatever rewards they thought they might as a result of claiming responsibility for their acts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51018-12_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham): </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Spanish identity card played no role in the detection of those responsible for the Madrid bombings?
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51018-12_spnew6"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 It certainly played no role in preventing the bombings, although it helped when linked with telephone records.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_66">Had identity cards been on the bodies of the 7&nbsp;July bombers, that would have been frightfully helpful; but that is not the point. The cards are not about trying to identify dead bodies. They are about what we call preventing terrorism.
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51018-12_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The bombers in Spain were still alive, and the police and security services were able to locate them rapidly. That may have prevented them from carrying out further damage and destruction.
</p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51018-12_spnew8"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b>

 I think that this is a bit of a red herring. The amendments are concerned with how we can make the register more robust. Loopholes in the Bill need to be tightened.

 I agree with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood). Is not the point that the Spanish identity card has a very different scope from the card proposed in the Bill, which includes an enormous database? The Government could obtain the advantages that they believe the Spanish card provides with a much simpler system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51018-12_spnew12"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_68">In the context of terrorism, the card stands condemned by its own statements and indeed those of Ministers. Let me amplify a point I made earlier. In 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 729</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>January this year, a mess tent in Baghdad was blown to pieces. There were 43&nbsp;casualties, both Iraqi and American. It seems likely that the suicide bomber who blew them up was an Iraqi policeman, and that he was carrying an identity card that allowed him to get through the security checks and to penetrate to the very centre of his target before detonating his bomb. In some ways, such a card would not impede terrorism; indeed, it might actually help it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51018-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Do we not need to know from the Government precisely how helpful identity cards and the register would be in the detection and prevention of terrorism, so that we can judge whether the system&#039;s disadvantages would be outweighed by such help? Is it not true that at the moment, the Government are offering the blanket statement&#151;sometimes it is a blanket statement&#151;that this provision will be frightfully helpful in dealing with terrorism, but that on other occasions, they say that it will not be quite so helpful? What we really need to know is how helpful it would be, so that we can properly judge whether it is worth the candle.
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51018-12_spnew14"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention and he is absolutely right: we need to ask ourselves whether this card is really going to deliver the promises that have been made. I have made the point, I trust, that the Government&#039;s view changes by the day. On First Reading, which I had the perhaps tainted pleasure of attending some months ago, terrorism played a big part in the Bill&#039;s logic. When we went through the Bill for the second time, the Government&#039;s line suddenly changed after 7&nbsp;July. In a way, it is lucky for them that the House rose on 21&nbsp;July, before these issues could be examined in any great detail.
</p>








<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51018-12_spnew15"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley) (Lab):</b> 
 I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s military background and for the great knowledge that he brings to this House, but I am a little bit concerned about the example of the mess tent bombing that he mentioned. He said that the ID card allowed the bomber to access the tent and then to explode the bomb, but even if the bomber had not possessed such a card, he would surely have had some kind of pass; in fact, without one he could not have been a member of the police force. We should also consider the example of this House, which gives passes to people so that they can enter it. So trying to argue that the ID card allowed the bomb to be planted in the mess tent is stretching the House a little.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51018-12_spnew16"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I would not wish to stretch the House in any way, shape or form, and nor would I wish to stretch my credibility with the hon. Gentleman. I was trying to expand on, perhaps even dilate on, the point that a form of identity can&#151;can&#151;assist terrorists. Obviously, the circumstances in Iraq are very different from those that we face today. The fact remains, however, that had the identity card scheme been in place, such cards would quite legitimately and properly have been with all the bombers who died on 7&nbsp;July. They 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 730</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>might have been very useful in identifying their shattered remains, of course, but they certainly would not have prevented terrorism.

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51018-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson  (Belfast, East) (DUP):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in giving way. Is it not true that the more the security forces rely on identity cards, the less alert they will be to other factors? In the Iraq case that was mentioned, the person in question probably waved the identity card and managed to get straight in. But if similar circumstances arise in the United Kingdom, it is very likely that terrorists who do not want to be detected will have false identity cards, and that they will therefore be waved through the various systems of checks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51018-13_spnew1"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 Possibly, but such terrorists need not necessarily have false identities. Having a proper, pukka, legal, straightforward identity will not prevent terrorism. I was a serving soldier in Northern Ireland when the illustrated driving licence was introduced&#151;it was introduced first with a photograph and then with a thumbprint&#151;and we were told that it would be the solution to terrorism. Much of the terrorism in Ulster was conducted by people using cars, trucks and the like, and we were told that the licence would solve the problem. It did not. On the contrary, the tired, wet, exhausted and distracted soldiers saw that piece of identity as a pass&#151;something to assist rather than impede.

 There may be a number of circumstances in which possession of an identification card helps to prevent terrorism, but in the majority of cases, that will be so only if the possession and carrying of the card is made a mandatory requirement of law. That, of course, is expressly excluded by the Bill. Does my hon. Friend agree?

 As usual, I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for his intervention. He is quite right that the carriage of the card&#151;though the register may have some useful purposes&#151;is not required by the Bill. Having sat through several Committee sittings, I know that we were told that enabling legislation could be introduced quickly to compel people to carry the card, but I absolutely take my right hon. and learned Friend&#039;s point.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51018-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend is being notably generous in giving way. This provision pertains to who is to maintain the register and what is to appear on the card when it is issued. I am very concerned both about what is going to be on the card and about who will have access to it. For example, could clause 1(4)(d) oblige every employer to check every potential employee and, if so, how will employers do that and how will they gain access to the register?
</p>








<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51018-13_spnew5"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b>

The fact remains that the benefits of both the register and the identity card are highly dubious and I do not accept the claim that they will prevent terrorism.

 As others have said, the hon. Gentleman is being extraordinarily generous in giving way. He is establishing some important points, but before he finishes, will he comment on the fact that the card will not only articulate identity, but allow the actions of the bearer to be traced? It is both a contact card and a contact-less card. As one enters a public place, the card establishes that one has been there. When an individual possesses the card, the actions and activities of its bearer are traceable. That is an important matter, which has not been at the forefront of debates on the Floor of the House, though it may have been mentioned in Committee.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51018-13_spnew7"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I can certainly confirm that the human rights elements of what might be called the Big Brother aspects of the card have been explored thoroughly in Committee. To my mind, those aspects are hugely disagreeable, but if the Government wish to control a population, put a population under surveillance or poke their nose into every detail of someone&#039;s life, I can see that those aspects could be viewed as highly desirable. I would reply to the hon. Gentleman by posing the question whether the card could ever work.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51018-13_spnew8"><b> Matthew Taylor  (Truro and St. Austell) (LD):</b> 
 Pursuing that point, is not the opposite likely to be the case? Is not the process of registration of tens of millions of people built around the same paper process that we already use to identify people and is it not capable of being abused? Could we not be creating an opportunity for thousands or even tens of thousands of false identities to be created at the very process of registration in the first place&#151;carrying over all the weaknesses of the present ID systems? Once the card is issued, the biometric data can tell us that this is the person who holds that card, but it certainly does not tell us that it is a genuine identity.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51018-14_spnew0"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend recall that I questioned the Prime Minister about this matter? Although the Labour-led Welsh Assembly voted against requiring the use of identity cards to access public services, the Prime Minister was not willing to give any indication that there might be an exemption for Wales. That makes me believe that the Government are hell bent on introducing the provision, and that they are not simply giving themselves the option to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51018-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point, and it is clear that there will be different modes of operation in different parts of the UK. He has highlighted the situation in Wales, but the Scottish Executive have already made their position clear. In the public services for which they are responsible&#151;that is, health, education and policing, in the main&#151;the Executive have stated that they have no wish to use identity cards. It seems, happily, that the influence of the control freaks in No. 10&nbsp;Downing street lessens the further one gets from London.
</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51018-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making a very persuasive speech. Is not his argument supported by the Select Committee report, which states, in terms, that the purpose provisions in clause 1&nbsp;are too widely drawn? The report says that those provisions should be narrowly confined, and offers some recommendations in that respect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51018-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right, and his intervention allows me to explain why the concerns about the widely drawn nature of the purposes in clause 1&nbsp;are important. The debate is not simply about the possession of an identity, but about how the Government have constructed their proposals. They intend to set up a register of the information provided, and then the Bill details how that information is to be used&#151;when, where, and for what purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_79">In effect, the Bill establishes a personal footprint for each individual that the Government can access&#151;apparently at any time and for any reason, just about &#151;to find where people have been and what they have been doing. As I and others have said in the House before, the Bill redefines the relationship between the citizen and the state, or the individual and the Government. It seems to proceed on the assumption 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 734</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that, in some way, the people are accountable to the Government. My contention is that that should be the other way around&#151;that the Government should be accountable to the people. If the Government need access to the personal footprint that I have described, they should provide a coherent and compelling reason.
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51018-14_spnew4"><b> Matthew Taylor: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes exactly the right point about how widely drawn are the powers of the state, as set out in clause 1. However, we know from the Cabinet Office leak that the Government also foresee that the information will be used by the private sector. Does my hon. Friend agree that a person&#039;s identity number and card may be required by a growing number of private-sector organisations, as validation of that individual&#039;s identity? As a result, those organisations will build up data around that number, and the Government may well be able to buy into that data. Is not this a system for allowing the collection of an almost infinite amount of information about individuals&#151;by the Government, and by those who might try to access various forms of data networks about people? The latter may pay for that information, but they might also procure it illegitimately, by breaking into those data networks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51018-14_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>

 There is very little that I need add to my hon. Friend&#039;s intervention, other than to say that he makes a good point about function creep. That becomes possible because the purposes are so widely drawn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_80">Government amendment No. 2&nbsp;is unexceptionable. However, given the catalogue of examination that the Minister of State outlined earlier in response to the motion in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), it is remarkable that the Government should still feel it necessary to table their own amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_81">The Minister of State was pressed in Committee on clause 7, which is the mechanism by which identity cards may be made compulsory. I read press reports during the summer months which suggested that the Minister had accepted during a Home Office seminar that the so-called super-affirmative procedure was defective and unworkable. Is that the case? If so, why have the Government not tabled amendments to rectify the defects today?

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51018-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 I am one of those in the House who believes in identity cards. My problem with the Bill is that the Government have shown an infallible ability so to form it that it drives away from their support the very people whose support one would have thought that they could have gained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_82">The amendments go to the heart of the matter. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) has rightly pointed out that with this Bill the Government have given themselves every possibility to do almost anything in any circumstances. Many of us who are not unhappy with the concept of an identity card are unhappy with the concept of a Government who give themselves powers like that. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 735</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Governments have an insatiable desire for power and therefore will use it in ways that most of us will find unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_83">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) made the point that seems to me central to this issue. If we are to agree with the Government that we should have identity cards, we need to know three clear things. First, what restrictions on the use of identity information will the Government put permanently in place and what mechanisms will they use to do so? We need to know the scope of the legislation. These clauses show that the scope is in no way restricted. It is envisaged to be as wide as the Government think it should be at any particular time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_84">The second issue that the amendments raise is what the Government think that the identity card might do. I happen to think that there are certain areas in which it would be helpful and useful to have a unique register of everybody&#039;s name and address. It is possible to argue that that could be portrayed on a card. I happen to think the other way round from my hon. and learned Friend; I think that the register is more important than the card. Be that as it may, there are mechanisms by which this could be done. What the Government cannot do is to claim for identity cards things that are self-evidently not true. The Government in so doing are driving away people who might otherwise have been corralled. It seems to me that the Government are making a series of claims, hoping that one way or another they will pick up the support of all sorts of people whose support they would not otherwise have gained. In fact, the opposite is happening. As each of these claims is made and found wanting, people begin to ask whether the whole idea is a sensible one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_85">The third issue that the amendments raise is what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough referred to as &quot;Will it work?&quot; Unless we know its scope and what it is supposed to do, we can make no judgment as to whether this particular scheme&#151;let alone the technology, which one cannot deal with on this group of amendments&#151;will work. None of these things seem to me to be evident from the Bill. It is an inconvenience of the House that in these days of truncated debates and the significantly underused potential of Parliament, the only way in which we can get at these things is by tabling amendments such as this and asking for sensible responses. So I put three simple questions to the Minister. Will he put in the Library a list of the specific purposes of the Bill? What does he think he will be able to do after he has got it that he cannot do now? Will he, perhaps with a little narrative, describe incidents that could have been better dealt with if only he had had this particular equipment? That seems to me to be what any sensible person would do if they were running a business and thinking of spending a lot of money. They would ask how they could be in a better position and whether the solution would have been cost-effective if applied to their past actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_86">Perhaps the Minister could explain the role of the identity card in the prevention of terrorism. I can see that it would be useful in circumstances in which someone claims to be Mr. Jones to check whether they are indeed that person. That is a satisfactory concept, but I cannot see how widely that could be used in the direct battle against terrorism. The Minister should tell us more about that.

We have heard such contradictory views from the Government about how ID cards could be used against fraud, how much that might save and how many people might be involved, that it is difficult for any sane person to make a judgment.

 Well, clause 1(4) may outline the purposes of the Bill, but it is on such a broad canvas that it is like a Tintoretto painting, with many little figures.

 My right hon. and learned Friend has underlined the point that my metaphor of a great painting is far too small.

The hon.

I am not saying this from any antagonistic position. I want identity cards&#151;they are a good idea&#151;but the Minister is making it quite impossible for anyone who is logically, sensibly approaching this matter to vote for the Bill, for we know nothing about all the key issues. Without that knowledge, how am I to reassure my constituents, whom I have always told that I want identity cards&#151; I have always supported them&#151;that this proposal does not run counter to everything else that I have ever told them?

It seems to me that the Bill would be acceptable only if it were entirely independently controlled and all these issues were decided not by the Government and not by the weight of government. Frankly, these decisions are too important to be made by people who are parti pris. For the Government to decide what they think is in the public interest when what they will decide is what they think is in their interest, which is a wholly different thing, seems to be too great a power for the House to give to the Government. Therefore, I ask the Minister, please, not only to answer my questions, but to seek a different format that will ensure that, in this the mother of Parliaments, we do not give away to the Government powers that no previous generation has ever been willing to give.

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="51018-16_spnew6"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I want to finish answering the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">The link between those basic facts and the unique identifier puts the individual citizen in control of the use of their data. They alone can put that personal stamp on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 740</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those basic facts and they hold the key to their use. That is one of the main arguments for the system. It is a basic identification system, not the elaborate database about which my hon. Friend seemed to have concerns.
</p>








<p><a name="st_123"><a name="51018-16_spnew7"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend explain how the Government&#039;s proposals, which involve storing 10&nbsp;fingerprints, facial biometrics and two irises on the national database, will achieve his objectives more effectively than the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, under which just a face and fingerprint are stored on a chip on a card that people carry?
</p>








<p><a name="st_124"><a name="51018-16_spnew8"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. We had to take a decision on the extent to which biometrics would be collected when enrolment was carried out. We believe that it is right to ensure that it will not be necessary to bring people back for further enrolment two or more years after their initial enrolment. The combination of different biometrics will give the high standard of identification check that we want.
</p>








<p><a name="st_125"><a name="51018-16_spnew9"><b> Stewart Hosie  (Dundee, East) (SNP):</b> 
 The Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, of all bodies, has put together information about the use of multiple biometrics. Far from creating fewer false accepts and false rejects, the reverse can be the case in certain circumstances, so multiple biometrics do not necessarily lead to the results that the Minister wants. His assertion in reply to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) was thus not correct, so will he comment on the fact that using multiple biometrics will not deliver the beneficial results that he wants?
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="51018-16_spnew10"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 We will proceed to a full technology trial if the Bill receives Royal Assent. In the interim, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the report by the National Physical Laboratory, which examined the matter in detail and concluded that biometric systems could be used in the way in which we propose. I also refer him to experiences in the United States, where such systems are already in widespread use. The technology is not new and coming to us only now, but established and used today throughout the world to prove people&#039;s identities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_127"><a name="51018-16_spnew11"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b> 
 The German Federal Parliament&#039;s Office of Technology Assessment warned that introducing biometrics on such a scale would be a &quot;gigantic laboratory test&quot; and that face recognition was known to fail. Other bodies throughout the world argue the case against what the Minister says.
</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="51018-16_spnew12"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The European Union has already agreed to move in the direction of requiring the widespread use of biometrics. The United States has also taken such a decision in principle, as has the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak referred a few moments ago. It is up to the hon. Gentleman if he wants the British Government to stand back from that and thus ensure that British citizens have second-class passports that will not enable them to travel with freedom and convenience in the future, but Labour Members will not take that decision.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51018-16_spnew13"><b> Mr. Marshall-Andrews: </b> 
 The Minister said that it was not the Government&#039;s intention to create a vast body of information and that the Bill sets out what may be stored on the database. However, he is aware that Ministers will be enabled by secondary legislation to add to the categories of information on the database, which causes great concern to many of us. Will he comment on that and, especially, the report in today&#039;s edition of <i>The Guardian</i> that the Government will give an undertaking that that power could not be used? I do not know where that provision appears in the Bill, so I would grateful if the Minister dealt with the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_130"><a name="51018-16_spnew14"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 We do not have time to consider Government amendment No. 1, but I refer my hon. and learned Friend to it because it will give him the reassurance that he wants. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raised the legitimate point in Committee that clause 1(5)(g) suggested that personal sensitive data could be covered by the Bill, such as those on the police national computer. We have thus tabled Government amendment No. 1&nbsp;to rule out the use of sensitive personal data, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998, with which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) will be familiar.

 I will press on, because I do not have much time.

<p>
<a name="51018-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_96">Terrorism was raised by many Opposition Members. No Minister has ever claimed that the proposal is a silver bullet to deal with terrorism, but the scheme as conceived will provide the security services and the police with a useful tool, enabling them to tackle and identify individuals responsible for terrorism. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) asked me to give a definitive statement explaining why the measure is useful in tackling terrorism. I refer him to the head of the Security Service, who said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;ID cards will make it more difficult for terrorists to operate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_97">We must listen to the security services, and we must take on board the points that they make. The right hon. Gentleman will remember better than me debates in the early 1990s about closed circuit television in which the same fears about a surveillance society and function creep were expressed. No one in this country can doubt the role that CCTV played in the aftermath of the London bombings.
</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51018-16_spnew17"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I acknowledge what the head of the Security Service said, but where is the proof? Where is the evidence? Can the Minister point to an incident that was prevented at a certain time and place in a certain country because of the possession of such an identity card? Have things been improved?
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51018-16_spnew18"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The argument is clear. The main strength of the biometric system is that individuals can only register their personal details once, because they have only one set of biometrics to register. Terrorist 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>networks around the world rely and thrive on the use of multiple identities. They use multiple travel documents and passports. Tackling that is one of the Bill&#039;s key strengths.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51018-16_spnew19"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The Minister and the Government have failed to answer a fundamental question. Can they guarantee that the system is not open to corruption? If the Minister wishes to be taken seriously on the issue, can he give a 100&nbsp;per cent. commitment that there is no opportunity for corruption within the system itself?

 All afternoon we have heard from Liberal Democrat conspiracy theorists who seem to think that this is about creating great things that will be used to control people. However, is the hon. Gentleman confident that the system for issuing passports is as secure as it could be? If he does not accept the new system, how does he propose to make the passport system more secure?

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="51018-17_spnew2"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I will not give way, but as the hon. Gentleman has raised the issue on many occasions I shall give him one instance of a serious crime that identity cards could help to prevent. Last week, on Tuesday 11&nbsp;October, <i>Metro</i> revealed that a fraudster who created 130&nbsp;false identities to swindle hundreds of banks out &#163;1.1&nbsp;million was jailed for five and a half years. Identity fraud is not a figment of our imagination&#151;it is a real problem that affects more and more of my constituents and perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#039;s too. The issue is repeatedly brought to our attention, so it is right to take action against it.

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51018-17_spnew3"><b> Mark Fisher: </b> 
 As we will not be able to debate Government amendment No. 1, will my hon. Friend explain the difference between a &quot;registrable fact&quot; and &quot;information&quot;? How does &quot;information&quot; differ from a &quot;registrable fact&quot;?
</p>








<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51018-17_spnew4"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Government amendment No. 1 clarifies the definition of an identity card by means of a minor amendment. The information mentioned in clause 1 is qualified by the additional reference in Government amendment No. 2. That gives my hon. Friend the assurance that he seeks.

<a name="stpa_103">It would thus remove one of the most important elements of compulsion from the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_104">The content of the register and its use is probably the major issue for me. The register will be different from anything else that is being constructed in parts of the world where identity cards are used or biometric passports are being introduced. No other register of which I know has the audit trail that was mentioned earlier. The Government clearly have a problem when they say, as they have said from the beginning of the debates on identity cards, that the system will initially be voluntary. There is a contradiction between claiming that it will be voluntary and getting people on the national identity register. The amendment deals with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_105">A related issue is defining exactly what constitutes a designated document. There is no doubt from comments in previous debates that a passport will be a designated document. That may apply to other things. From reading the Committee proceedings, a designated document might be a Criminal Records Bureau letter, a firearms certificate or a driving licence. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 748</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That information is important because it affects the scope of clause 5&nbsp;and those who will have to register under it to get a document that they may want or need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_106">Dealing with compulsion is at the heart of the amendment. Compulsion crops up in different forms in various clauses. The Government have clearly said that the Bill does not provide for compelling people to carry an identity card. There will be no compulsion, without further legislation, to produce an identity card to access services. There is no compulsion to have a card and be registered. However, the tactics are clear: the measure is an enabling Bill and, ultimately and inevitably, having a card will be compulsory. It will certainly become compulsory to register. It became clear during previous debates that that is the ultimate aim. The tactic is obviously to leave the difficult cases until the end. They include people who do not have passports or driving licences, such as those who are elderly or infirm, and those who are difficult to tackle because they have chaotic lifestyles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_107">However, clause 5&nbsp;provides for compulsion from day one in a slightly more subtle form.

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="51018-18_spnew2"><b> Dr. Nick Palmer  (Broxtowe) (Lab):</b> 
 I apologise for missing the first moments of my hon. Friend&#039;s speech. Does not he agree that even the Bill&#039;s critics have said that it is desirable to test the concept of identity cards on a large number of people, otherwise we cannot get a fair impression? What is more natural than to test them on people who seek official documents, such as passports?
</p>








<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51018-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 Some people might be prepared to be involved in trying out an ID card but let them make that choice rather than compelling them to do it. Let me be clear about what has been said previously. Some people have said to me that our manifesto contained a commitment to ID cards. Let me therefore quote the relevant passage. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_108">the part that is especially relevant to the amendment&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_109">Any normal person&#151;by that I mean people outside this place&#151;would interpret that as, &quot;When I renew my passport, I can choose whether to go on the register and have an ID card.&quot; That is what &quot;initially voluntary&quot; would mean to anyone who read it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_110">However, the clause does not provide for something that is truly voluntary and the amendment tries to remedy that. Indeed, I am being generous because the amendment would provide for more than the manifesto outlined. It would apply not only to passports but to other registrable documents. To all practical purposes, the clause provides for compulsion.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51018-18_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 May I check that the hon. Gentleman and I share the same interpretation? The announcement yesterday that one could get a &#163;30&nbsp;identity card and buy a passport separately does not mean that, when one buys a passport, one would have the option of saying, &quot;Thank you for the passport but I don&#039;t want the ID card.&quot; Unless the amendment is accepted, one would be made to have the ID card.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 749</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51018-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. The Bill clearly provides that, to get a designated document, a person &quot;must&quot; include an application to be entered on the register. One could claim that the person did not necessarily have to be presented with an ID card, but being on the register is what matters. The implication is clear. Not registering would mean no renewal of a passport or new passport. According to what constitutes a designated document, it could mean no driving licence and no Criminal Records Bureau check. Of course, I could decide that I did not want a passport. I could decide not to travel, drive or apply to the Criminal Records Bureau. The implication is that, by not registering, I would lose abilities or what some of us regard as rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_111">It has been accepted for hundreds of years that a British citizen has a right to leave and re-enter the country. The passport has traditionally been a travel document that facilitated one&#039;s ability to leave and return to the country. However, if the Bill is passed in its current form, I cannot exercise that right without registering my biometrics.
</p>








<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51018-18_spnew6"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman also agree that many of us would be willing to accept an international agreement that, to travel internationally and have a passport, certain other information had to be given, but that that is entirely different from having to comply with the new Big Brother system, fill in a form and register in order to remain in our country and live here, without any international travel obligations? I will buy one but I shall never be persuaded of the second.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51018-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 There is a question of choice involved: do we want to travel internationally? It might well be that, under international agreements, other information has to be stored. I do not have a problem with having biometric data on a passport; that is not the issue for me. The issue is the register, the database on which all that biometric and other information is to be stored.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051018/debtext/51018-19.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51018-19_spnew0"><b> Kali Mountford  (Colne Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend explain how he envisages a biometric passport working without the support of a register? If such a passport is presented in a country that requires a biometric passport without there being a register to check that the information is correct, how on earth is it to operate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51018-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 That question ought to be put to just about every other country in the world that is introducing biometric data on passports, because they are not going to have a national register such as the one proposed in the Bill. For instance, biometric passports are being introduced in Germany, yet German law specifically prohibits the construction of a database using that information. Biometric documents are also being introduced in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Those countries are going down the road of introducing biometrics, but without setting up a national database.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_112">The United States is often cited as the reason for our introducing biometric passports, because we will not be eligible for its visa waiver scheme if we do not have them. When we turn up at the airport in the US, a machine will compare the biometrics on our passport with our own personal biometrics. That is how the system will be used. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 750</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>A comparison will be made between the document that we are carrying and our personal biometrics. That will show that I am the person whose biometrics are on the document. The United States will not then try to check back to a national database, either in this country or anywhere else. If it wished to, there would need to be some serious amendments to the Bill to allow access by other countries to the information on our national register.
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51018-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ellwood </b> 
: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, to ensure that a terrorist did not get on to an aeroplane, if everyone were compelled to be on a register, their ID card would somehow have to be verified, to prove that they were the person whose details were on it? That means that we should need some form of verification device at every airport. That would make the ID card redundant, because everyone would be on the register, and the Minister confirmed earlier that there would be verification systems at airports. The question of whether ID cards should be compulsory is therefore academic.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51018-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 We must be careful not to exaggerate what can be done through biometric checks at airports or anywhere else. It is possible to check whether I am the person whose details are on a card. But let us consider the number of people who come in and out of the UK or any other major country every year. About 80&nbsp;million people, of whom 60&nbsp;million are British citizens, come in and out of British airports each year. It is inevitable that many of them will be travelling without biometric documents for a long time to come. We must be careful not to exaggerate the level of security that we can achieve. I am not suggesting that we should not make those checks if they can be made, but the issue that really concerns me is not the general principle but the question of compelling someone who applies for a biometric passport to be on the register.
</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="51018-19_spnew4"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government&#039;s need to use this element of compulsion to get the scheme started suggests that it would not be a popular scheme if it were left to the voluntary initiative of individuals to decide to register on the database? By doing this, are not the Government recognising that the scheme will be unpopular?
</p>








<p><a name="st_169"><a name="51018-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 The scheme will get less and less popular as people learn more about it. That is already happening, and it will continue once it starts to roll out. This has already been experienced in other countries: Australia is an obvious example. The more people knew about the system as it started to come into operation, the less popular it became. As I said earlier, the tactic is very clear: try to do the easy ones first. Someone who is applying for a passport, and who needs that passport, will feel that they have no alternative. They will feel that if they do not put their name on the register it could cause them serious problems in other ways.

<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51018-19_spnew6"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 On a point of clarification, my hon. Friend cited Denmark as an example of a country that was introducing biometric passports without a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 751</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>compulsory register. I used to live in Denmark, and I know that it has had a compulsory personal register for more than 40&nbsp;years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="51018-19_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 There is a difference between a personal register and one that contains all our biometrics. My understanding is that Denmark is not going to have a register that contains all the biometric information as well. So the checks that are carried out there will be on a one-to-one basis using the passport. That is certainly the case in a number of other countries.
</p>








<p><a name="st_172"><a name="51018-19_spnew8"><b> Lynne Jones </b> 
: The passport authority already has a database containing all the information submitted when we apply for a passport. However, that is a static database that contains only our name, address and the other details that we submit. It does not have all the potential of the Government&#039;s proposed database for audit trails and for tracking where we are going or inquiring about our whereabouts. Neither does the present database have the vast complexity that will render the new one liable to all kinds of problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="51018-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. We all know that information about us is stored on databases. The question is whether the proposed database is acceptable. Is it something that we want?
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51018-19_spnew10"><b> Mr. Gummer </b> 
: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has noticed that, in this discussion, we are changing fundamentally the attitude towards passports. The passport is not a privilege offered by the Government to citizens. It is a right of citizens to get the support of their Government when travelling abroad. If the Government insist that we cannot have that right without compulsorily entering into something else, it is the first example of a change in the relationship between Government and subject. This is not an easy thing to bring about; it is a fundamental change to what the passport means. Inside our passports, there is a promise by the Government to do all that they can to enable me or any passport holder who is a British subject to move round the world unhindered. However, it will now become a privilege offered by the Government to such people as will sign up.
</p>








<p><a name="st_175"><a name="51018-19_spnew11"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 That is a very important point. I referred to it earlier when I mentioned the right to leave and re-enter the country. These proposals do represent a change in the nature of the passport. In fact, they are beginning to change the passport from being a document that facilitates travel and can be used to seek assistance if needed to one that is becoming a sort of identity document.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_113">It is strange that an EU citizen exercising freedom of movement will be able to come in and out of the UK without having their data recorded on the national register, unless they want to remain here for more than three months. As a British citizen, however, I might find myself in the position of not being able to leave the country without having my biometrics recorded in that way.

So we should have not only the three-month allowance for tourists&#151;or touring terrorists, or anyone else&#151;but a hole on the western flank.

That is a wholly unhealthy way to design a piece of legislation, and it is even more unhealthy for Parliament to give the Government unseen powers over the citizen and the way in which he or she conducts his or her life.

Clause 5, however, deals with applications relating to entries in the register, and with the powers that the Home Secretary will give himself, which we have not seen in any written form, to compel us as citizens to do what he wants. For example, he will be able to compel us to provide such information as he thinks fit&#151;which is undefined&#151;for the purpose of verifying information that may be entered in the register about an individual in consequence of his having made an application to go on the register. One is given the impression that applying to go on the register is something for which the Government are deeply grateful, and that it is a voluntary activity, but it is not&#151;it is distinctly compulsory and the limits of the Secretary of State&#039;s powers are undefined.

If we consider the creeping way in which the Bill gives powers to the Government, it might well be that aspects of this data register will be available to certain private companies. As the Government farm out their functions to private companies, and if that is to work properly, those private companies must have access, if not to the whole of the information, at least to sections of it.

Of the 772&nbsp;people who submitted their fingerprints in Leicester, 642, or 83.16&nbsp;per cent., were identified correctly&#151;the lowest rate of any test centre in the United Kingdom&#151;and there was a failure rate of almost 17&nbsp;per cent. in matching the individual to the fingerprint. Across the country, approximately 45&nbsp;million to 48&nbsp;million people over the age of 16&nbsp;will be required to add to the convenience of this Government by providing an entry on the register and giving in addition the information found in the schedule. Seventeen per cent. of between 45&nbsp;million to 48&nbsp;million people is a very big number, and yet this is the system that the Government are compelling us and our constituents to adhere to.

It will, however, become increasingly a matter of practice and a matter of compulsion&#151;if not as a result of legislation, because people will be stopped and searched in the streets, and required to show their identity cards when entering the hospital, the library and, I gather, even the video store.

 I will be brief. The Government have sought to curtail this debate and I do not want to aid or abet them. The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) pointed out the serious concerns that exist about the effective compulsion in which the introduction of the identity card system and the attendant database will result. Given that possession of an ID card is linked so closely to entitlement to basic services such as housing, health, use of libraries and education, we are indeed, in effect, talking about compulsion.

<a name="stpa_132">The distance that people live from registration centres&#151;one of the issues with which our amendments deal&#151;is crucial to take-up of the ID card and, therefore, to entitlement to those basic services. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) referred to the various rural areas in which distance from a registration centre will be crucial to take-up. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He could indeed have mentioned rural and isolated areas such as those in Bournemouth and Cambridge, along with those in my own constituency.

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her observation, but she might want to consider that 70&nbsp;is a very small number, given the large rural areas that exist in this country. If we divide the population coverage by that number of centres, it is clear that accessing them

 Of course, it is a question not only of distance but of the ability to get to a registration centre. The islanders of Colonsay have only three boats a week to the mainland, and if there are to be only 70&nbsp;registration centres, it will take them at least three days to get to a centre and back again. If the date specified by the Secretary of State happens to fall on a Friday, they will have to leave home on a Wednesday and will get back the following Monday. That is ridiculous.

 I am extremely grateful to my hon.

There are great problems with the public transport services in rural areas such as mine.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I feel in no way comfortable with the idea of living in such a society. He has moved us on to the important issue of people becoming excluded from basic services not because they live in rural or isolated areas, but for other reasons. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough referred earlier to the 20&nbsp;per cent. of people who will never have a passport. Perhaps even more worrying and illuminating is the significant proportion of people who are not, and are never likely to be, on any electoral roll, and who effectively duck out of society. Some may say that they should not exclude themselves in that way, but we are talking about a group of people consisting predominantly of Travellers, young people, elderly people living in isolated rural areas, and people with mental health difficulties. They will exclude themselves from registration and will, therefore, effectively become non-persons. That should worry us all.

 I should like to spend a short time discussing the important amendment No. 5, which deals with the central vice and evil of the Bill&#151;compulsion. There is no point debating the Bill without debating the issue of compulsion. It is in the Bill: it can be made law by secondary legislation and it can be introduced into law by various crafty devices that are already set out in the provisions. The British people have no idea what they will be required to do under the Bill if it becomes law. If they did, there would be no question of any opinion poll saying anything other than that they were totally, or nearly totally, against it. In the short time available, I want to put into historical context the issues raised by both Front-Bench spokesmen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_139">Not since the Domesday book in 1068&nbsp;have we seen anything like it. That was a system of registration put into effect by the Normans&#151;or the new Normans, as I suspect they were known at the time. Not since then have the British people been required to attend, with their families, at a certain place at a certain time in order to have their heads measured and the colours of their eyes taken. To be fair, under the present Bill, people will not have to declare the number of livestock that they possess or the items of clothing that they wear. However, we should not get too excited, because under the terms of the secondary legislation, people could be forced to give any other information that the Secretary of State prescribes.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_140">I have to say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that there are many people in my constituency who simply will not do this. They will not do it&#151;full stop. Some may do it and there are doubtless some that conform to the model citizen that new Labour imagines in the south-east of England. However, a very large number&#151;I can see them in my mind&#039;s eye as I speak&#151;find it difficult enough to go 100&nbsp;yd down the street to exercise their right to vote and they simply will not comply with the Bill under any circumstances. Social stress will be the result.

Pointing to his adolescent offspring, he will say, &quot;They have to have their heads measured as well&quot; and I will confirm that

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is absolutely right. He will then say, &quot;Why did you vote for this Bill?&quot; I will then experience the glory of being able to say that I did not vote for it and that I voted against it at every conceivable opportunity. My constituent will want to know what will happen if they all refuse to have their heads measured.

 I am following my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s argument closely.

 Yes, indeed. I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, as I was going to become a little more serious and make precisely that point. I would have to tell my constituent that he could be fined or sent to prison, at which point I would be looked at with complete disbelief&#151;that in the 21st century we have passed a law that requires our citizens to comply on pain of fine or imprisonment. I would also point out that this is not even the worst part of the Bill, but an exemplification of what lies behind it. I would have to point out that when they have had their heads measured and their eyes photographed, they will then form part of a massive registration process, to which they have no access or control. I will explain that that was why I voted against the Bill.

</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51018-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Marshall-Andrews: </b> 
 I am pleased to answer that question. The answer is yes, I did. Neither was it the only part of the Labour manifesto that I told my constituents I was not standing on&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I had pared it down quite thin by the end of the campaign. What I will be able to say to my constituents&#151;it may mean that I will get re-elected, despite the fact that I will be standing on a Labour ticket&#151;is that I voted against what I considered to be the most illiberal piece of legislation that the House has been asked to pass for half a century and quite possibly&#151;pace the Bill on terrorism&#151;into the foreseeable future.

 The House owes a debt of gratitude to the mover of amendment No. 5. The whole issue is about liberty. It is about our liberty and the liberty of those we represent. The Bill makes it quite clear that, at the designation of the Secretary of State, an application for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 762</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>something that we have taken for granted all our lives&#151;the right to apply for a passport, to access our national health service or whatever comes to the Secretary of State&#039;s mind&#151;will be dependent on showing our subservience to the state. In providing the state with one coherent datum on our whole identity, we are giving it the power to follow us wherever we go. That is what the Bill is about and why it constitutes a deep and savage attack on what this country has stood and fought for across the centuries.

<a name="51018-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_142">We did not acquire our liberty lightly. Our liberty is not just a thousand years old. It was through the work and struggle of people across this nation that the long march of everyman secured for us our relationship to the state. It is our state, but the Bill and its clauses say otherwise. The Bill says no. The Bill says otherwise: that the state will measure, identify and control all our citizens for purposes that are lost in the Bill, but which can be designated by the Secretary of State by orders in what is essentially a dreadful enabling Bill.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51018-22_spnew6"><b> Martin Linton  (Battersea) (Lab):</b> 
 We have heard a lot of rhetoric tonight and we can congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). His amendment would change only one word, but it is the crucial word of the Bill. I happen to take the opposite view to his, but I recognise that this is the central part of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_145">Let me take my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow back to the beginning of the process. We have had several White Papers, the first of which, issued by the Home Office, distinguished between different possible schemes: a voluntary scheme; a scheme called at that stage a universal scheme, under which the card would have to be held by everybody; and a compulsory scheme, under which everyone would have to carry the card. From the start, the last option was excluded and the Government looked at either a voluntary scheme or a universal scheme, which we would now call compulsory: compulsory to have and not to carry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_146">One of the crucial arguments came from the opponents of ID cards, who said that any such scheme would have to become compulsory, or it would be useless. There was no point in discussing the subject on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 763</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the basis of a voluntary scheme, which would not work and would not fulfil the most fundamental objectives. In the response to the White Paper, it was recognised by both sides that there was no point in proceeding with an ID scheme if it were to be purely voluntary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_147">That emphasises something that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow must know, as he and his colleagues advanced the argument at that stage. If the amendment were passed, it would be a wrecking amendment and would cut out the heart of the Bill. Anyone with an open mind who is listening to what my hon. Friend says about the amendment must bear in mind the fact that the purpose of the amendment is to disable the entire Bill and to make it of no value.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_148">At the end of the day, we must look at the fundamental point of the Bill&#151;that we should have a list of names of all the people in this country. We already have many lists of names: a national insurance list of about 40&nbsp;million names; the Inland Revenue list containing a similar number; the Passport Agency list of 38&nbsp;million people; and the council tax registers, which contain a similar number. The electoral register contains 40&nbsp;million people&#039;s names. The only difference between the national identity register and all these lists is that the national identity list will be correct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_149">For example, the national insurance register has 75&nbsp;million names on it, so clearly it cannot be correct. We cannot be sure that all the other lists are correct. The advantage of the national identity register is that we would use modern technology to ensure that the list that we have of people in this country is correct. Biometric technology will enable us to do that for the first time in our history.

 We need to start with those matters on which we all apparently agree, certainly in terms of official party positions. As I understand it&#151;although one would not have thought it, given some of the contributions&#151;all parties agree on biometric passports. That is on the record. One cannot have biometric passports without the infrastructure we are talking about bringing in by 2008. We simply cannot organise biometric&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Infrastructure was the word. The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) should calm down and listen. He may have been excited by the fourth-form contribution of his hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron); I certainly was not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_152">By infrastructure, I mean contact centres and how we capture biometrics. Everyone should agree as a starting point that that is necessary for the biometric passports on which we all agree. The argument is not about how many centres there should be; 70&nbsp;may be enough with mobile facilities, but it may not be enough. That is a matter of detail that, of course, needs discussion in terms of the roll-out of biometric passports, which will happen whatever happens to the Bill tonight. That is a position with which every party in the Chamber agrees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_153">The argument, put quite fairly by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), is about the link beyond that to ID cards. My hon. Friend makes a perfectly fair argument, one made in Committee and before. I am not going to say that this is a wrecking amendment, because such an amendment would not be selected for debate, as it would not be in order. However, unpicking the ID card from the passport would drive a coach and horses, to coin a phrase, through the entire structure of the system that we aim to produce. I freely accept that that may be what my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow is seeking to do, but we must not run away with the notion that we will not have biometrics if this Bill fails. The question of whether 70&nbsp;contact centres will be sufficient to do the necessary biometric work will not go away, as all parties agree with biometric passports.

<p><a name="st_232"><a name="51018-24_spnew1"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 This simple amendment provides that an identity card issued to an individual must be free of charge. Ministers will not be surprised by the amendment, because we have already debated the point in Committee and will no doubt talk further about it tonight. The cost of the card is one of the most crucial elements of our debate. If we believe that the card is right and will, in due course, have to be possessed, if not carried, by everybody in the country, how on earth can we make the sort of charges for it that we have heard about in the past few months?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_161">The identity card will come in a package with the passport. I shall come to the combined cost of the card and passport in a moment, but we have heard already that some 20&nbsp;per cent. of the population never need to have a passport. How much does the Minister propose to charge those who do not want passports, only cards? It is the nation&#039;s job to support its citizens&#039; travel abroad, but why should a fee be charged for ID cards?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 771</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">The possible costs cited vary. &quot;The Identity Project&quot; states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;The Government originally asserted that the cost of the passport/ID card package, that is valid for 10&nbsp;years, would be &#163;85, but six months later this increased to &#163;93.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_163">In Committee, the Minister was chary of allocating a cost to the card. He skirted around questions about how much the card alone would be and whether it would be possible to issue a card without a passport. He gave us the tantalising figure for the cost of the passport of some &#163;63. By a simple process of subtraction, the card would therefore cost about &#163;30, but the Minister was hesitant about agreeing to that sum. However, now we hear from the Government that the figure is about right. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why he was so reluctant to talk about the cost of the card alone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_164">The costs of the card alone will not be confined to compiling the register and then issuing the cards, with all the associated equipment necessary. Some reference has already been made to the article in <i>The Scotsman</i>, which claims that ID cards will lead to massive fraud. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;Jerry Fishenden, the national technology officer for Microsoft, says the proposal to place &#039;biometrics&#039;&#151;or personal identifiers such as fingerprints&#151;on a central database could perpetuate the &#039;very problem the system was intended to prevent&#039;. He says Ministers &#039;should not be building systems that allow hackers to mine information so easily&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_165">As we asked about an earlier amendment, if rubbish is put in, what rubbish will come out? If the scheme will be wide open to fraud, as the article suggests, how will we offset the costs? Will a margin be included in the charge for ID cards and passports?
</p>








<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51018-24_spnew2"><b> Dr. Palmer </b> 
: The hon. Gentleman is sliding back and forth between the issues of cost and charge. The amendment relates to the charge the user will pay for the card to be issued. It is reasonable also to discuss the cost to the country, but that is not the subject of the amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51018-24_spnew3"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 As always, I am grateful to my fellow Nottinghamshire Member of Parliament for his observations. If he will allow me to develop my argument, I am sure that he will receive full satisfaction&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, for less than &#163;30, I expect.

<a name="stpa_166">I would be interested in the Minister&#039;s view on how fraud will be offset in the charge for issuing cards. &quot;The Identity Project&quot; goes on at length about the cost projections for the card&#151;what it will cost individuals, and what it will cost the nation. It talks of the costs of issuing cards over a 10-year period, based on passport service figures; of card readers for the public sector, as envisaged in the Bill; of the national identity register; of the total cost of the national identity register infrastructure; of managing the national identity system; and of specific other staff costs over a 10-year period. The lowest estimate in the report is more than &#163;10 billion. I shall not exacerbate the situation by mentioning the higher costs, because they are difficult to quantify, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 772</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;10 billion is already a massive sum. How can the Minister expect the nation, and the individual, to foot the cost for the register and the card?

 As usual, the hon. Gentleman makes a useful and helpful intervention. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to outline exactly how much this scheme has already cost us, even before it has been approved by Parliament. How much of the national treasure has been invested in something that will&#151; I hope&#151;lead nowhere?

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_167">What will be the cost to the individual? If the Minister tells us that the package comes to just under &#163;100, will everyone have to pay that? Are those who are on benefits likely to be asked for the same sum? If so, where will that money come from? How will they pay? Is it more likely, as I suspect, that those who are better off will end up being asked to subsidise those who cannot afford either passport or card? I should be very grateful to the Minister if he made it clear to me how that lies.

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_168">I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), but I cannot close on the amendment without mentioning opportunity cost. In my view, even I were persuaded of the need for both a register and an identity card, I would question very carefully whether we are putting those massive sums&#151;most modestly assessed at &#163;10&nbsp;billion and probably much more&#151;into the correct place if we want to stop the sort of ills that we have heard about, not least of which is terrorism, a subject in which I clearly have a great interest. Is the money being spent in the most efficacious fashion? Is it likely that a register and a card will have the effect that we hope to achieve? I suggest that the opportunity cost of the register and the card is absolutely out of proportion to the perceived benefits that either or both might deliver.

 The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that I am very keen to know what the amendment would cost.

</p>








<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51018-24_spnew7"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not surprised if I say that I have done no such calculation. As far as I am concerned, the scheme is not a starter. I have moved the amendment simply to challenge the Government and to make them explain how they can request such sums. I believe that if these cards are issued&#151;if we ever get to that dreadful and parlous state&#151;they should be free to those who will be forced, first, to hide them in the bottom drawer of their wardrobes and, in due course, to carry them.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 773</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reflect the issue raised by the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer). I strongly support ID cards&#151;my Select Committee produced a report on them a year ago&#151;but believe that costs must be contained as much as possible and that we must procure effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_169">On the issue discussed in the amendment, the Government&#039;s approach is okay. In practice, despite the blood-curdling rhetoric of an earlier debate in which reference was made to the prospect of people being frog-marched 80&nbsp;miles to have their heads measured and then charged 100&nbsp;quid for the privilege, a certain amount of sheer politics rather determines that that is not likely to take place. So making provision for a charge is reasonable, but it is important that the overall cost of the scheme is contained. I have concerns about some elements of the approach that the Government are taking to the procurement of the scheme. Those issues were raised by the Home Affairs Committee well over a year ago, and I must tell my hon. Friend the Minister that progress has been a little disappointing until now. I should like to reinforce a few of those points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_170">First, there are some elements in the design of the scheme that I suspect will not turn out to be cost-effective. Some of those elements were referred to earlier. In particular, the cost benefit of including addresses in the scheme may well turn out not to be that good. It is an irony that one of the advantages of moving to a biometric national identity register is that someone&#039;s address becomes a less important part of their identity than in the current system, where their address is an important statement about who they are and how to prove who they are. The ability to strip out of the system the cost of constant re-registration in cities such as mine where 25&nbsp;per cent. of the population move every year would be of enormous benefit. The Minister will need to return to that issue in practice. That does not necessarily affect the detail of the legislation, but it is an important issue.

<a name="51018-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_171">The second issue relates to procurement. Biometrics were discussed earlier this evening. One of the recommendations made by the Home Affairs Committee more than a year ago was that Sir David King, the chief scientific officer, should be invited to oversee and judge the preparedness of biometrics. I was pleased that that recommendation was accepted by the Government a year ago. However, a year later, the committee that Sir David was to be invited to lead has not yet met. Some of the problems that the Government are having with the debate about systems&#151;those that suggest that wrinkled, bald-headed men have their faces on upside down and all the other issues that we have heard about today&#151;would be put on one side if we had the simple assurance that the chief scientific officer was going to do what the Select Committee recommended a year ago and give the green light, or the red light, to the preparedness of the technology. That would be an enormously important step. The Government agreed to it in principle more than a year ago, but no action has yet been taken. That is a shame.

 The right hon. Gentleman may be further concerned to hear that, before we broke for the recess in July, I tabled 10&nbsp;or 12&nbsp;written parliamentary questions to a number of Departments of State to find out what steps they had taken to prepare for the national register and the identity card system. Not one of them, not even the Home Office, was able to say that it had done anything meaningful to prepare for the scheme. The Treasury, the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Defence, the Northern Ireland Office&#151;none of them had done anything sensible to meet the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s Committee&#039;s concerns.
</p>








<p><a name="st_241"><a name="51018-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 That is an interesting point. Although the Select Committee supported the ID card scheme, one of its recommendations was that it felt to us a year and a half ago as though this was a Home Office scheme that the rest of Government was watching&#151;those were not our exact words, but that was the sense of them&#151;rather than a cross-Government scheme to which the whole of the Government were committed. I fear that what the hon. and learned Gentleman recounts rather supports that view. Those are not reasons to vote against the Bill&#151;we need the scheme&#151;but it is right to put down warnings that, unless those issues are addressed, the scheme may well not be successful.

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that a cultural barrier lies in front of the scheme, to which he has just alluded? All Departments must be involved in delivering savings and process changes to make the collection of national identities work for them. Yet they must also step back in the management of the project and allow someone to deliver it without their direct control. That presents a management conundrum, which I admit, as someone who has had to manage projects, would be scary in the extreme.

 Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman responds to that intervention, I remind him and the House that these amendments relate to what the public must pay for the cards. The cost of producing them is therefore irrelevant, so a wide-ranging debate on that aspect is not acceptable. The debate is specifically about what people must pay for the cards.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="51018-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for your advice and tolerance up to this point.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_172">There seems to be a lack of willingness in the Home Office at the moment to adopt what is generally called an open process to procurement. That does not involve openness about whether we are advertising according to the normal European procurement processes and so on. There are essentially two approaches to procurement that will have a big effect on the design and cost of the scheme. The first is one where, having defined the broad outcomes and objectives of the scheme, the Government tender for one or more suppliers to provide a black

<br>&nbsp;<br>box&#151;computer software or a certain type of card&#151;that will deliver what they want. The second approach is one where all the major issues about the design of the software, the structure of the identity register, the choice of card and the choice of different types of chip on the card are made publicly available and there is the widest technical and scientific scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_173">Traditional Government procurement has taken the view that the savings in cost achieved by the black-box type of procurement outweigh the advantages of a wider scrutiny of the proposals. Having looked at procurement around the world, the Select Committee came to the opposite view: the most open technical procurement, with the best scrutiny, was most likely to deliver systems that worked at the lowest possible cost.

However there is some merit in the Conservative proposal, as there is too in amendment No.19, which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) has yet to move. There will be a cost to us all, whether from those who have to get the card at a flat rate or through general taxation, which is a burden that falls on us all. Both the Conservatives and Government Back Benchers are offering the Government a way out.

<a name="51018-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_176">The Government are stumbling towards a new plasticised poll tax. It is worth recalling why the poll tax was unpopular. It was a flat-rate tax, which bore no relation to ability to pay. In that sense, it was regressive. What the Government are suggesting is, at the very least, a similar flat-rate levy. Much of the opposition to the poll tax was not from principle, although that was at the root of it; the serious opposition, at least in Scotland, arose from the recovery process. We saw local authority-instructed sheriff officers carrying out poindings and warrant sales for the recovery of a civil penalty, the poll tax. The Bill suggests that failure to pay the fee for an identity card will incur a civil penalty. We are presented with the spectacle that a Labour Government will be sending out sheriff officers to carry out poindings and warrant sales for the recovery of a civil penalty&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality says from a sedentary position that that is not true.

They said that those sums should properly cover the costs and be effectively and efficiently spent, which I wholeheartedly support. When there was discussion and consultation on charges for ID cards themselves, the Government honestly said that they wanted to keep any charge to a minimum, yet ensure that it would cover the costs of implementing the scheme. That was why we reached the point in June during which it seemed almost as though negotiations were going on in the Chamber between Labour Back Benchers and Front Benchers about the breakdown of charges between the passport and ID-card elements of the scheme. We were told at that stage that the Home Secretary was looking at trying to keep the charge of the card down to &#163;30.

<a name="stpa_181">A &#163;30&nbsp;charge on top of the charge for a passport&#151;that takes the charge to &#163;93&#151;might well be reasonable for some people, but the figure is based on the Government&#039;s estimate of the costs of the scheme. The charge is designed to cover the costs, but what will happen if the costs have been underestimated? The Government estimated that the passport and ID scheme would cost &#163;5.8&nbsp;billion over 10&nbsp;years, which was the basis on which we calculated a charge of &#163;93. I must say that I could spend &#163;5.8&nbsp;billion on many more productive things than an ID card scheme, but let us put that principled argument on one side.

<a name="stpa_182">The London School of Economics report that analysed the scheme, which has already been cited, gave its lowest estimate of the cost of the scheme as &#163;10.6&nbsp;billion.

 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern. Is he aware that the increase to the charge for a passport between this year and next will be &#163;15.57, which will be set to take account of only minor changes: the facial biometric and the system of interviews? However, it is estimated that the charge will increase between 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and the full implementation of the scheme by only &#163;5.07, although fingerprint and iris biometrics will be introduced and the changing database will be set up during that time.

If costs go up, they will thus lie with the Home Office and the only way in which it will be able to recoup the money will be by increasing the charge for the identity card.

 That is one option. However, we are all aware of the stringency of the Treasury&#039;s activities across Government Departments, so the other option would be that the Home Office would have to swallow its own smoke by using its budget, which would lead to cuts in other services, such as probation, prisons and policing. If costs escalate, the options are to increase the charge for the cards, or to cut services in the Home Secretary&#039;s remit.

One criticism in the LSE report concerns the Government&#039;s inadequate attention to the danger of fraud deep within the system. In future, the Public Accounts Committee will have a field day with the scheme overall and specifically the massive computer project.

 I shall focus on the KPMG report, which has not been fully disclosed but makes reference to a weakness in sensitivity analysis on costs in the project.

 My hon. Friend has spotted an incentive in the Bill for people to go into hiding and to refuse to pay. I am more concerned, however, about people who will struggle to pay the initial charge. If the project goes wrong and costs increase the charge imposed will have to go up. As a result, those people will not be able to bear that burden. I agree that resentment will build up. This debate mirrors debates about the poll tax in that it has been said that the present proposed charge is much fairer as it is a one-off cost that people will not mind paying. I think that they will. What happens if they refuse to pay? Do we really wish to go through the experience that we are now having with council tax of imprisoning vicars?

 As always, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I accept your advice, but the question of opportunity cost bears on what people will have to pay.

The LSE estimates that have been quoted&#151;the &#163;10&nbsp;billion to &#163;19.2&nbsp;billion, which would result in a cost for the individual of &#163;170&nbsp;to &#163;230&#151;are the best and most reasonable estimate available.

In the absence of any assurance, quantification or solidity underpinning the Government&#039;s position, it is entirely legitimate to ask how the charges will be extracted from the population. When the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) asks about poinding and warrant sales, those are legitimate questions.

Although in this case the erosion of civil liberties may not appear too severe, that must be taken in conjunction with the various other erosions of civil liberties that have occurred since we took power in 1997. The erosion of civil liberties is becoming increasingly worrying, and I look forward to the day when a Labour Minister stands at the Dispatch Box and announces an increase in civil liberties, rather than their curtailment.

We hear about driving licences and passports, and the fact that people have to pay for those. But with very few exceptions, nobody is obliged to purchase a passport, because very few people are obliged to go abroad. They go abroad because they choose to. The same can be said about obtaining a driving licence. Very few people are obliged to drive a motor car, so they are not obliged to purchase a driving licence.

Even at this late stage I ask the Government to think again. I have not mentioned costs or the merit of costs, because I do not want to stray into those matters. Any Member or Minister who is concerned about the cost should bear in mind that there will be a far greater incentive to keep the cost down if the Treasury must bear the cost than if it falls on the individual.

 I share the concerns about the cost of identity cards and the charges that will ultimately be levied for them. The Government have given us no indication of the way in which their estimate of &#163;580&nbsp;million or so a year for the cost of the scheme is broken down between what is necessary to comply with international requirements for passports and what is needed to create their comprehensive identity scheme, which is about not only identity cards but the national identity register.

<a name="51018-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_210">The Government claim that international requirements account for 70 per cent. of the cost of the scheme. However, let us consider the figures that we have. The current cost of our passport is &#163;42.36. Next year, that will increase by the substantial amount of &#163;15.57 to &#163;57.93. I asked the Government for the reason for the increase and they replied that it was largely due to the delivery of several key counter-fraud initiatives, notably interviews for all first-time applicants, links with other public sector databases and the full implementation of facial biometric passports. That is just for the facial biometric, not for the other biometrics that will be required. Yet the cost of the full implementation of the scheme will be &#163;93, to include &#163;30 for the ID card. The passport, without the ID card, will cost &#163;63. That is an increase of only &#163;5.07, which implies only an additional 10 per cent. cost for the minimal requirement of the facial biometric.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_211">These figures beggar belief. How are we going to achieve all the additional biometrics&#151;all 10&nbsp;fingerprints, plus iris recognition and the facial biometric&#151;and the implementation of the national identity register with all the continual changes involved, for that amount? This is not comparable with the present UK passport database, which is a static database. Between 2006&nbsp;and 2007, we shall move over to the full implementation of the scheme, with its constantly changing database, yet we are told that it is going to cost only an extra 10&nbsp;per cent. Even the cost of the whole package, at &#163;93, still represents a fairly modest increase for such a huge change in the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_212">The Government are giving us assurances about keeping the costs down, but perhaps the best way for them to achieve that would be to abandon this scheme and do what the Americans, the Germans and all the other European countries are doing, which is to have an ID card or passport that has just a few simple biometrics and no central database.

<p><a name="st_288"><a name="51018-29_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Over the past hour or so, the debate has arrived at the point of concern for most people in the country, namely, the cost of the scheme to individuals and its cost more generally. I do not believe that many people will be persuaded by the great perorations on liberty that we have heard tonight. They can see the purpose and the benefits of the identity card scheme and they want to know whether it will be affordable. That is the bottom line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_213">Many good points have been raised on both sides of the House tonight, in what has become a more reasoned debate since about 7&nbsp;o&#039;clock. There has also been hyperbole on both sides, and the poll tax has been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 788</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>mentioned on a number of occasions. There is quite a difference between a proposal for people to pay between &#163;800&nbsp;and &#163;1,000&nbsp;a year, and one for an identity card that will cost &#163;30&nbsp;for 10&nbsp;years. They are not directly comparable, and it did the debate no good to make that comparison.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_214">There is however some common ground between us. We all have a vested interest in ensuring that the overall costs of the scheme&#151;and therefore the cost to the individual&#151;are as low as possible. I shall address the two matters separately: the cost to the individual, and the related point that was so eloquently raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) about the cost of the scheme overall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_215">Amendments Nos. 7&nbsp;and 19&nbsp;raise a point of principle&#151;interestingly, it was raised by Members on the Conservative Front Bench&#151;about making the cards free of charge. While we agree that the charges should be kept as affordable as possible, there is clearly an issue involved in whether there should be any charge at all. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Bill Etherington) put forward his argument on that point very clearly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_216">We believe that the card will bring a range of benefits to the individual, in terms of everyday convenience, and of enhancing their ability to protect their own identity data against misuse. Individuals will also benefit from being able to use the card as a travel document within the European Union. That, of course, is a benefit to the individual, and is consistent with the charge that is levied for a passport at the moment. The question raised by the amendments is whether the cost of the scheme should be met entirely from general taxation&#151;I believe that that was the thrust of the contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and for Sunderland, North and of the Conservative amendment&#151;or whether it is right to set a charge that reflects the benefits to the individual while also ensuring that it is affordable.

<a name="time_25">
<a name="51018-29_time0"><h5>8.45&nbsp;pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_217">I want to take head-on the point raised repeatedly in the debate about the opportunity cost. During the general election campaign, I lost count of the number of times that the Liberal Democrats said that they would use the money from the national identity card scheme to put more police on the street. That was an entirely spurious argument, as there is not a great big pot of money that can then be allocated to pay for more police on the beat. Our proposal is for a scheme based on recovery of charges from individuals. The argument that there is a big amount of money to be allocated either to ID cards or some other public purpose, such as CCTV in Bournemouth, is not therefore correct.
</p>








<p><a name="st_289"><a name="51018-29_spnew4"><b> Tim Farron: </b> 
 Is the Minister therefore saying that the entire cost of ID cards will be borne by citizens paying up front for the card, and not by the taxpayer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_290"><a name="51018-29_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 That is precisely the basis on which the scheme has been developed&#151;that the costs of running the scheme will be recovered through charges to the individuals and organisations who use the service. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 789</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The idea that the money could be diverted to a wish list of other things, whether CCTV in Bournemouth or more police on the beat, simply does not stack up.
</p>








<p><a name="st_291"><a name="51018-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ellwood: </b> 
 The Minister makes an important point, but does he not agree that we would have a much more transparent, useful and interesting debate if we had the costs in front of us today? People have been stabbing in the dark using independent reports, whereas if the Government had done their homework before coming to the House, we would be able to have a proper debate, and the nation would be in a better position to judge whether the scheme is worth it or whether we should spend the money elsewhere.
</p>








<p><a name="st_292"><a name="51018-29_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman, who was a member of the Standing Committee, should make that comment at this point. Detail has been laid before the House on the annual costs of the scheme, and he had access to documentation during Committee showing the cost as &#163;584&nbsp;million a year. He will also know that information about the benefits of the scheme, in terms of value realised per annum, which has been raised on many occasions today, has been made available. Some detailed work has been done on that, and it has been quantified at &#163;650&nbsp;million to &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion per annum. The scheme therefore has a considerable net present value.
</p>








<p><a name="st_293"><a name="51018-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 Can the Minister confirm that one of these sources of income will be other Departments? That being the case, can he tell me where those other Departments are getting their money from?
</p>








<p><a name="st_294"><a name="51018-29_spnew9"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is referring to other Departments making a contribution to the scheme, or whether he thinks that they will pay an annual charge. My point is that the costs of the scheme have been developed according to costs paid by individuals to be enrolled and issued with a passport and identity card, and costs paid by organisations that use the scheme.

<p><a name="st_295"><a name="51018-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 How is it possible for the House to place any credibility on the Government&#039;s estimates when they have palpably not answered the questions posed by the Select Committee, which one of the friends of the Bill posed to the Minister earlier this evening? If those have not been examined properly, which is the word of the Select Committee Chairman, how can any credibility be placed on the Government&#039;s costings?
</p>








<p><a name="st_296"><a name="51018-30_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I shall talk about the issues raised by the Chairman of the Select Committee now. I listened carefully to what he had to say. As always, he made a number of extremely valuable points&#151;and I hasten to remind him that he prefaced his remarks with the comment that he was a supporter of the scheme. I think he said that the case was compelling. Does the hon. Gentleman recall that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_297"><a name="51018-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 Yes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51018-30_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I do as well. I welcomed the Chairman&#039;s observations: he made a number of sensible 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>points, and it behoves one in my position to note them carefully and respond to them properly. One of them related to addresses&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_299"><a name="51018-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 My hon. Friend touched on the net present value of the project. Will he place in the Library a calculation of its value, and its exposure to sensitivities? That would be useful to us during the remainder of the Bill&#039;s passage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_218">My hon. Friend referred to other stakeholders. I assume that he was thinking of the private sector and the contributions that it might have to make. Can he give us any idea of the basis on which we can place any reliance on what those concerned have said so far? In fact, they seem to have been silent on the subject.
</p>








<p><a name="st_300"><a name="51018-30_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend mentioned the KPMG report earlier. We have said that a summary of the report will be published shortly. I shall be happy to make it available to any Member who would like to read it.
</p>

</p>








<p><a name="st_301"><a name="51018-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 My first point was about net present value, which was not precisely what the KPMG report addressed. It was addressed more in the Office of Government Commerce analysis. My second point related to the assumptions made about private sector contributions to the success of the project, and the extent to which we could rely on those involved in view of their relative silence to date.
</p>








<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51018-30_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 As the scheme progresses, we shall seek to share more information. The Chairman of the Select Committee made the valuable point that being open about the procurement process could strengthen the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_220">My right hon. Friend also mentioned the possible cost of constant re-registration by people moving house. As he will know, addresses are currently printed on the front of driving licences. I do not think it would be sensible to require people to obtain a new identity card every time they moved house. We want a system enabling people easily to communicate a change of address to those who run the scheme, but I take his point. He also mentioned the chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, and the recommendation that a group should be established to consider the efficacy of biometrics. I can tell him that a biometrics assurance group, a Government group, is being set up under Sir David&#039;s chairmanship.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_221">The issues are coming into sharper focus now that we have reached a point at which rigorous testing is necessary. Regular meetings have already been scheduled for the next 12&nbsp;months, and the Home Office has recently appointed a senior biometrics adviser from the private sector.
</p>








<p><a name="st_303"><a name="51018-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 May I bring this particular issue into even sharper focus? The Minister has said, a year after the Select Committee&#039;s report, that the Government are taking on board the point about addresses, and that it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 791</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will be easy for people to notify the authorities about a change of address. What will happen if they do not do that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_304"><a name="51018-30_spnew9"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill, he will know that people are required to notify the authorities of a change of address. I want to ensure that they can do that easily and quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">My right hon. Friend asked whether this was just a Home Office scheme that would be examined by the rest of Government, or a cross-Government scheme. He may know that a cross-departmental group of Ministers from the main Departments with an interest in the scheme, chaired by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, is looking in detail at all the issues that he mentioned. It is looking at how Departments can plan now to build the national identity register into their work, so that we can get maximum benefit at the earliest possible stage. However, my right hon. Friend&#039;s point was well made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_305"><a name="51018-30_spnew10"><b> Tim Farron: </b> 
 On consulting other Departments and the costs that have yet to be built in, does the Minister recall his answer to me in Committee? He said that members of staff operating and administering the scheme would be deemed to be in positions of trust. Has he established how much it will cost to ensure that that vast army of people are security cleared and police checked, and has he consulted the trade unions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_306"><a name="51018-30_spnew11"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I remember saying that to the hon. Gentleman, and I will of course take on board those issues as we move forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_223">Let me deal directly with the cost to the individual&#151;the issue that those listening to this debate want most reassurance on. As the House knows, on Second Reading my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary gave a commitment that he would seek to introduce an ID card cost that we believe is affordable and fair to the majority of the public. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) said that we danced round this issue in Committee, and I am happy to tell him this evening that the Home Secretary has confirmed that a &#163;30&nbsp;fee for a stand-alone ID card would be a fair price to pay. We believe that, crucially, it is affordable&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_307"><a name="51018-30_spnew12"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Perhaps I might seek some advice. Would it be in order for you to ask the Minister to conclude his speech, so that I might have time to withdraw my amendment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_308"><a name="51018-30_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 It is certainly not for me to determine that. The Minister has the Floor, and when he decides to sit down is entirely up to him.
</p>








<p><a name="st_309"><a name="51018-30_spnew13"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I shall endeavour to give the hon. Gentleman the reply that he asked for. We have been able to set this fee, but the one qualification is that before we enter the procurement stage, it is of course difficult to be hard and fast about the fees that could be charged. But we think it right at this stage to give those

<p><a name="st_311"><a name="51018-30_spnew15"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I shall give way one more time, to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who was a member of the Standing Committee.
</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="51018-30_spnew16"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Will he clarify what will happen in the case of a lost, and particularly a stolen, card? Will the assumption be that the person in question has to pay for full cost recovery, or will tolerance be shown, so that the poorest, who may prove most subject to theft, are not asked to make the greatest contribution?
</p>








<p><a name="st_313"><a name="51018-30_spnew17"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a fair point, and we are looking at whether a replacement fee can be introduced. In cases where people lose their card, it should not be necessary for them to go through the whole process again and to pay the full price of a card. Such issues will be clarified as we get into the next stage of the scheme. My hon. Friend may find more reassurance in clause 37, which sets out the wide range of powers to set fees and allows for the payment of fees in instalments. As I pointed out, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, in setting the &#163;30&nbsp;stand-alone fee, said that we believe such a fee to be fair. It also means that not everybody will have to pay for the cost of an identity card and passport. The stand-alone fee deals with one of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Newark, in that it gives people a choice. They can choose whether to purchase an ID card, at a cost of &#163;30, that will enable them to travel within the European Union, or to purchase the two documents&#151;the passport and the ID card&#151;the current combined unit cost of which is &#163;93. However, the &#163;30&nbsp;card will not be a cut-price or inferior card, as has been suggested in some parts of the media.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_224">Amendment No. 19&nbsp;seeks to exclude from clause 37&nbsp;the power to charge for ID cards. We believe that that is not the correct thing to do at this stage. We of course want people to register with the scheme, but a charge of &#163;30&nbsp;is affordable, particularly if they can pay in instalments. By way of comparison, several other EU countries charge for ID cards. France, where the ID card has traditionally been free of charge, is now looking to charge for the new biometric card, which will be introduced there soon. What we are proposing, Madam Deputy Speaker, is consistent with practice in other parts of the EU, particularly France&#151;

<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51018-32_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. Charles Clarke): </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_228">I begin by giving thanks to a number of colleagues. First, I thank my ministerial colleagues, my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) as well as my colleagues in the Whips&#039; office who have worked so hard to ensure that the Bill is passed. I thank the Bill team&#151;my official colleagues who have worked so hard and have been ready on all occasions to discuss with all interests how we can improve the Bill and take it forward in a variety of ways. I thank the House authorities and the Clerks for the way in which the business has been conducted through a time-consuming process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">The Bill before the House is based closely on that approved by the House on 10&nbsp;February 2005, so this is the second time that I have come to the House to propose that an Identity Cards Bill should receive its Third Reading. The Bill before us has had more scrutiny than most legislation. We had a six-month public consultation exercise starting in 2002, an inquiry by the Home Affairs Select Committee starting in 2003&nbsp;and further consultation on the draft Bill in 2004. The first Bill was introduced in November 2004&nbsp;and ran out of time because of the general election, and we now have reached the point for the current Bill to be approved by the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">I believe that the time has come when we need the benefits and safeguards that an identity cards scheme will provide both to individuals, who will be able to prove their identity securely and reliably, and in the wider public interest. The identity card is an essential step in the process of providing a clear legislative framework for introducing identity cards. I know that the system has been controversial; the issue itself is controversial. But I believe that we all need to understand that we already live in a society in which enormous banks of information are held about all of us, whether by financial institutions, employers, passport and driving licence authorities, health and education authorities or criminal justice agencies. Moreover, we all now face many occasions on which we need to prove our identity, whether to open a bank account, to take out a mortgage, to claim a benefit, to pass through a border control, to get a Criminal Records Bureau clearance or many other basic transactions of our day-to-day lives. I believe that an up-to-date identity cards system will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 798</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>make all those transactions easier for the individual and will also be beneficial for the state. It will provide an effective mechanism to tackle crime, to reduce identity fraud, and to improve legitimate access to services. I believe that it will not remove civil liberties but will give an individual greater control over his identity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">Some have alleged that the Bill will create a Big Brother state. I do not believe that. I believe that it will help to control that state. It is an ambitious programme, I acknowledge, but one that we are setting on the path to achieve.
</p>








<p><a name="st_321"><a name="51018-32_spnew0"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Home Secretary give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_322"><a name="51018-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 No, not at this stage. To meet many concerns that have been raised, changes have been made in the Report stage, which has just concluded, to provide additional safeguards. I will of course continue to listen and to act on constructive comments on the plans for delivering the identity card scheme once this enabling legislation has completed its passage through Parliament. We intend that the first ID cards should be issued by the end of 2008, and there will be further opportunities between now and then for the House to look at the detailed provisions to be set out in secondary legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">The simple fact is that the possession of a clear, unequivocal, unique form of identity in the shape of a card linked to a database holding biometrics will provide benefits to us all. It is why 21&nbsp;out of 25&nbsp;European Union member states already have ID card systems. It is why, in recent surveys, more than 70&nbsp;per cent. of the public say that they support the introduction of ID cards. Moreover, biometrics are being developed around the world to improve the security and reliability of identity documents, including fingerprint biometrics on visas and our own facial image biometric passports, to be introduced in around a year&#039;s time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51018-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Salmond </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_324"><a name="51018-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_325"><a name="51018-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 No, I shall not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">That is why the introduction of identity cards needs to proceed incrementally, building on our plans for biometric passports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_234">Let me reassert the benefits of the scheme. First, ID cards will help to tackle identity fraud, which now costs the UK economy and society more than &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion a year. Secondly, a secure identity system will help to prevent terrorist activity, more than a third of which makes use of false identities. Thirdly, identity cards will make it far easier to control immigration and illegal working, and British citizens will be able to use their identity cards instead of a passport to travel in Europe. Fourthly, ID cards will secure the more efficient and effective provision of public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_235">The scheme will not create threats to privacy or change the way we live our lives, as many have alleged. We have never proposed a scheme under which it would be compulsory to carry a card or which would require the production of an identity card to the police. The Bill also sets limits on the information that can be held on the register. It will not contain information about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 799</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>criminal convictions, financial records or political or religious opinions. Indeed, on Report, we have just amended the Bill so that it will not be possible to add a police national computer number to the register. No one will have access to the national identity register other than those operating it. What the Bill allows is for information to be provided from the register either with the consent of the individual or without that consent in strictly limited circumstances in accordance with the law of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_236">The introduction of ID cards will take place incrementally. The first stage will be to introduce the scheme and to enable everyone to register and obtain a biometric ID card when, for example, they apply for or renew a passport. However, a stand-alone ID card will also be available for British citizens who do not hold a passport. It will make it quicker and easier to obtain Criminal Records Bureau clearance for people who have already had their identity verified by obtaining an ID card. Registration will be enforced through civil, not criminal, penalties, which will offer flexibility to deal sympathetically with the circumstances of any individual case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_237">On costs, we estimate, as the Under-Secretary has already set out, that the total average annual running costs for issuing passports and ID cards to UK nationals will be &#163;584&nbsp;million. The Bill provides for a range of services to be covered by fees, such as approving an organisation before it can make checks against the register and usage fees for identity checks. It is right in my opinion that organisations benefiting from the checks should fund those costs.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I hope hon. Members will acknowledge, I often give way a great deal in such debates, but we have a short Third Reading debate and I intend to set out the argument clearly.

<a name="51018-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_238">As we have said all along, we expect that most people will get their ID card along with their passport. That will give people the full benefits associated with having the most secure travel documentation, which can be used worldwide. Some 80&nbsp;per cent. of the population hold a passport and the increased costs associated with recording biometric information and producing a more secure document would have to be incurred anyway, if the British passport is to keep its reputation among the most secure and trusted in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_239">Our current best estimate of the average unit cost of getting a combined passport and ID card package&#151;as we have said since the outset&#151;is &#163;93. Some 70&nbsp;per cent. of those costs would be incurred anyway, because of the worldwide move to biometric passports.

<a name="51018-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_240">For a variety of reasons, some people may choose to obtain a stand-alone ID card, but, in considering what the cost of this entry-level option should be, I have to take account of the overall finances of the scheme. Since the debate on Second Reading, the project has been through a further Office of Government Commerce review on business justification. The review confirmed that the project is ready to proceed to the next phase. An independent assurance panel is now in place to ensure that the work is subject to rigorous, ongoing challenge by experts, as well as major period reviews by the OGC process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_241">I have commissioned KPMG to undertake an independent review of the costing methodology and the key costs assumptions. KPMG has concluded that the methodology used to cost the ID card proposals is robust and appropriate for this stage of development. KPMG has recommended improvements, such as extending the sensitivity analysis and revisiting the process for estimating contingency and some cost assumptions. KPMG has confirmed that the majority of the cost assumptions are based on appropriate benchmarks and analysis from the public sector and suppliers, and I will be acting on its recommendations as we move towards procurement after Royal Assent. An executive summary of the report will be published in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_242">Of course, our estimates must be finely tested in the marketplace. The final determination of what the scheme will cost individuals and organisations depends not just on how well we have specified the requirements, but on how the marketplace responds to the challenge of delivering an efficient, effective and affordable scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_243">I welcome the recent statement of support from Intellect, which represents the leading companies in the IT industry. John Higgins, the director general, has said that Intellect members and the wider UK technology industry have the ability to meet the technological challenges created by the Government&#039;s ID card proposals. The technology being considered, which will form the basis of the scheme, has already been used in similar programmes across the world and is well established.

<a name="stpa_245">The essence of the scheme is clear; but, of course, there has been a political debate on that, too. The Opposition have changed their position consistently&#151;or inconsistently&#151;throughout their approach. If I may speak as a candid friend when looking at the Conservatives in the leadership election that they now face, I want to remind them that, on 14&nbsp;December 2004, the shadow Cabinet decided to back ID cards, under the leadership of the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), and he wrote in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> setting out that approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_246">On 20&nbsp;December, the Tories voted in favour of ID cards on Second Reading. On Report and Third Reading, the majority of Tories MPs abstained, while some voted against the Bill in principle. That was a victory&#151;perhaps not one repeated this evening&#151;for the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who succeeded in changing the position of the parliamentary Conservative party on these questions. In the wash-up in April 2005, the Conservatives moved to outright opposition and killed the Bill. On 28&nbsp;June 2005, when the Bill was reintroduced on Second Reading, they voted against it. I believe that that is a clear case of identity crisis for the Conservative party.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, it is, and I could go further, but I will not&#151;

: On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. We all enjoy a little bit of banter, but we are debating the Bill on Third Reading and no one should be hiding behind the bluster that we have heard. We have a very short time in which to discuss the Bill. I should be most grateful to the Home Secretary if he returned to the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_336"><a name="51018-33_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_247">I conclude by noting that the public debate on identity cards began more than three years ago. The Government have proceeded in a measured way through consultation on the principles and, most recently, on draft legislation. The Bill sets out a clear legal framework for the scheme. It provides a means for everyone legally resident in the UK to assert their right to be in the country and to help them gain access to the services to which they are entitled. It will help to preserve national security. It will assist the work of the law enforcement agencies and enable them to have the ID system they want.

<p><a name="st_338"><a name="51018-33_spnew5"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> 
: I begin by agreeing with one thing that the Home Secretary said. I, too, offer my thanks to the Clerks of the House and others who made the apolitical aspects of the Bill altogether more manageable.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_249">Where I depart from the Home Secretary is in the analysis of the Bill that he made during the 15&nbsp;minutes that he occupied of this 45-minute debate. Indeed, is not there something rather obscene about a Home Secretary complaining about lack of time to debate his Bill because his Government have curtailed the time for debate? On Report, I pointed out that his Under-Secretary, with whom he is now conversing, was cut off in his prime in Committee. I believe that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality was also cut off during Report this evening. All those things would be welcome in some circumstances, but if the Government say that their own motions prevent them from debating their legislation, who are we to complain?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_250">We need to be clear about the fact that during this debate the Government&#039;s majority was cut to 32&nbsp;and 33, and I encourage all Members who are interested in democracy and civil liberties and who have read the Bill to vote with us this evening against the Third Reading. The Bill is economically illiterate and politically inept, and will prove socially divisive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_251">The Government began the whole sorry process by saying that the Bill would be valuable in the fight against terrorism; yet, to be fair to the Home Secretary&#151;I am occasionally fair to him&#151;on 8&nbsp;July he said that identity cards would not have prevented the tube attacks on 7&nbsp;July. We know that 9/11&nbsp;would not have been prevented by identity cards. The people who committed those crimes had pilots&#039; licences and passports. Those who committed the crimes on 7&nbsp;July were perfectly happy to be filmed by the railway station closed circuit television. The problem was not hiding their identity, but hiding their intention&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad to see that Members on the Treasury Bench find the subject so tremendously funny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_252">When the Government lost their first argument they said, &quot;Oh, perhaps we&#039;ll try benefit fraud&quot;. However, we know that benefit fraud will not be dealt with by the possession of identity cards or by the information in the national identity register. Then they said, &quot;Well, let&#039;s try immigration, that&#039;s bound to help&quot;. The Home Secretary is trying that again this evening, but the problem is that one does not have to register on the national identity register or hold an identity card if one is in the country for less than three months. When a person enters the country as a tourist, how are the Government to know that they have not remained beyond the permitted time?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_253">There is the problem of the free travel area between the UK and the Irish Republic and the free travel area in the European Union. What will that do? Far from preventing immigration illegalities, it will exacerbate ethnic problems and cultural division in the UK. Do the Government want to give a free hand to the British National party? Anybody who thinks that is a good idea should vote for this sordid Government this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_254">The Government then said, and the Home Secretary repeated this evening, that the measure would deal with identity fraud. When the Bill began its passage in the summer, identity fraud cost the economy &#163;50&nbsp;million, but during the summer months the cost rose to &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion. I do not know why, and the Government have produced no evidence to support that fact. Indeed, we are having a Third Reading by assertion with an absence of proof. We cannot have legislation that is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>created in this form or pushed through in such a way, and we cannot tolerate a Government who have absolutely no understanding of the constitution of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_255">The Government moved on to say that the scheme would prevent other forms of serious crime. As the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) pointed out on Second Reading, no serious criminal will be too bothered about whether he is required to register for, or have, an identity card. The money would be far better spent on police officers, gaining intelligence about the activities of criminals and producing a proper border control police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_256">The Government have blustered and demanded that we agree with all their assertions, despite the lack of evidence to prove them. Eventually, they have ended up saying that it would be more convenient for us all if we had identity cards and information was stored away on the national identity register. If the Government want to see the population of this country wandering around with a form of barcode across our foreheads, or with a mark to allow us to come out of our houses, they are not the sort of Government whom this country needs. We should certainly not be promoting such a society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_257">The Bill is obscene and absurd and it will do nothing but damage the country&#039;s interests as a whole. It will do nothing to advance the causes that we all share: defeating terrorism; doing away with benefit fraud; and tightening up our immigration rules, which the Government have randomly let fall apart. Of course we want to deal with identity fraud and serious crime, but the Bill will not do that in its present form and would not have done that in its first form. It is a ridiculous and stupid Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_258">What will the scheme cost the citizen? All of us over the age of 16&nbsp;will have to pay not only the &#163;30&nbsp;cost of buying the wretched card, but the travel costs of getting from the outer isles to the Glasgow centre at which one will be processed, as though one were in some gulag, or from rural parts of the country to other cities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_259">What will the scheme cost the country as a whole? We all know that the cost will be somewhere between &#163;8&nbsp;billion and &#163;19&nbsp;billion, but the Government say that the cost of a card will be only &#163;30. The whole thing is utterly absurd, and the more one examines what the Secretary of State has to say, the more absurd it becomes and the more absurd the Government are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_260">Let us step aside from the practical arguments against the Bill and consider a matter of principle: the relationship between the citizen and state, about which the Government care little and know nothing. They have forgotten about constitutional history&#151;if they knew anything about it&#151;and the proper relationship between the Government, Parliament and the judiciary. All that is swept aside with great windy bluster from the Home Secretary and his junior Ministers. It is time for Parliament to stand up for what it is supposed to and to defend the liberties of the citizen, not to kowtow to this appalling Government and go down on bended knee and grovel as they pass more and more appalling legislation to destroy the rights of the citizen. It is no good for the Government to say that this is all exaggeration&#151;just look at what they have done already and what they intend to do through this Bill and other legislation to eat into the liberties of the citizen.

<a name="stpa_261">This is a bad Bill from a sad Government. It is legislation by statutory instrument. The Government are providing 61&nbsp;separate powers to enable the Home Secretary or his successor to produce secondary legislation. The Bill contains very little detail. It increases the penalty for misbehaviour.

: The Bill will undoubtedly receive its Third Reading, probably with a slightly greater majority than the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) suggested, but it will pass without any enthusiasm whatsoever. It will pass because it is subject to a three-line Whip, understandably, but I do not think that it would get through, or that it would have received its Second Reading, on a free vote.

<p>
<a name="51018-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_263">I have been opposed to ID cards from the very beginning. Although the hon. and learned Gentleman spoke with much passion, I must tell him that the only member of the Home Affairs Committee that studied the matter who voted against the original measure was me. Conservative Committee members voted for the Bill and only one Labour Committee member&#151;myself&#151;voted against it, as the record will show.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_264">Moreover, if I was convinced that the measure would help to prevent terrorism, despite all the difficulties&#151;the practical costs and so on&#151;I would vote for it. If identity cards could prevent casualties such as those on 7&nbsp;July when people died or were seriously injured&#151;one woman, for example, survived but had to have both legs amputated above the knee&#151;how could I say that I would vote on principle against identity cards? I am simply not persuaded, however, that identity cards would prevent terrorism in any way. There have been terrorist incidents in Istanbul and Madrid, but there is no evidence whatsoever that identity cards, albeit without biometrics, prevented terrorism in those countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_265">The Government have given various reasons for introducing the measure, including the need to tackle identity fraud and illegal working. They gave the impression that identity cards would do the trick and those problems would be resolved. Countries that have identity cards, however, have the same problems. Hardly any of the problems that the Government say will be dealt with by identity cards fail to afflict countries that have long had identity cards. It is therefore difficult to understand the determination on the part of the Government and of senior Ministers to push the measure forward. I am convinced that in time the card will become compulsory. Moreover, it will be necessary to carry one at all times. I accept that that will not happen initially, but inevitably suspicions will be aroused among officials when they discover someone is not carrying their identity card.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-34_para3">

They are a Government whom I support and for whose election I fought, like other Members, for 18&nbsp;years in opposition. There is a danger, however, that they will give the impression that they take our traditional liberties lightly. Our opponents will use every opportunity to convey that impression to the country.

<a name="stpa_267">Labour Members must be very careful indeed when dealing with the threat of terrorism&#151;I am the last person to underestimate that threat, even if 7&nbsp;July had not happened&#151;not to give the impression that everything dear and precious to us and for which we fought for so long over the centuries can be taken lightly because of dangers that confront the country.

 When we subject today&#039;s proceedings to mature reflection we will realise that the House missed an opportunity earlier today when it failed to vote for the Bill&#039;s recommittal to a Special Standing Committee, as proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). Despite the fact that this is the second time around for the measure and despite the Home Secretary&#039;s boasts that the Bill has received more scrutiny than has ever been the case with other legislation, an enormous number of questions remain. The House has still not addressed the practical issues surrounding the proposal. That is no accident. It is the result of the way in which the Government chose to present the Bill. The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality has told us times without number that this is an enabling Bill. The Government have thereby allowed the House to postpone the hard questions until a later stage. The Minister may say, as he did today, that there will be 61&nbsp;other occasions on which we will revisit the matter, but that ignores the manner in which secondary legislation is dealt with in the House.

During the summer the Minister of State was reported as saying that the so-called super-affirmative procedure was flawed and unworkable. He is right. He will know that I pointed that out to him in Standing Committee, yet no amendments were made today to clause 7. Will the Minister tell us when we can expect to see the appropriate amendments to make the super-affirmative procedure workable, or are we to be left guessing? Will that change be made in the Lords?

 Order. The House should come to order. I call Martin Salter, on the Third Reading of the Bill.

 I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, for chiding the Liberal Democrats a little.

<a name="stpa_277">We voluntarily hand over a huge amount of information in our ordinary lives&#151;in supermarkets, in chemists, through our mobile phone calls, and through the CCTV cameras that many Members who oppose ID cards are happy to campaign for in their constituencies. An awful lot of people, most of them unelected, know who we are, what we buy, why we buy it and when we buy it. We are targeted with direct mailshots as a result of using our credit and debit cards. It is a fact of life that it is difficult to remain anonymous any more.

<a name="51018-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_278">In addition to the civil liberties objections&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Given the amount of heckling one would question the Opposition&#039;s commitment to civil liberties. In addition to civil liberties objections, hon. Members raised several others, some of which the Government have dealt with. The first of those&#151;it was a serious mistake on the part of the Government to let it run&#151;was that of cost. Some fantasy figures were bandied about, especially from last June&#039;s London School of Economics report. No evidence was provided for the claim that an ID card will eventually cost UK citizens&#151;my constituents&#151;&#163;300. I am pleased that the Home Secretary has put that particular genie back into the lamp. A capped cost of &#163;30&nbsp;is a commitment made in this House that is worth keeping.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_279">We heard that ID cards will not work. The other day I read some material from those opposed to ID cards saying that the biometric technology is not in place and that it will not register people with brown eyes. At the invitation of my hon. Friends at the Home Office, I took the trouble to visit it to see biometric technology in operation. I was surprised at how easy it was to have one&#039;s biometrics registered; the whole process took less than five minutes. It is interesting that the UK, in common with other legislatures in modern, liberal democracies, is now introducing biometric passports&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

 The UK is introducing biometric passports to help fight passport fraud and forgery, to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 808</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>help the public and the UK to fight identity fraud, to ensure that the British passport remains one of the most secure and respected in the world, to facilitate more robust border control, to fulfil international standards that the International Civil Aviation Organisation has set and to ensure that British citizens can continue to benefit from visa-free travel to the United States. No one could have a principled objection to that. We are embracing technology that already exists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_280">I support identity cards. I campaigned for them before they became trendy and fashionable. I firmly believe that ID cards have a role to play in 21st century Britain. That is why most liberal democracies in the European Union have embraced the concept. Identity cards will disrupt the use of false and multiple identities by organised criminals and those involved in terrorist activity. They have a role to play in tackling illegal working and immigration abuse. They will enable easier and more convenient access to public services and ensure that they are used only by those who are entitled to them. They will help to protect the British people from identity fraud and theft.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">We live in a less secure and more dangerous world. The modern, biometric identity card is an idea whose time has come. I urge my colleagues to support Third Reading.

<a name="51018-35_time0"><h5>9.55&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_346"><a name="51018-35_spnew2"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b> 
 On Second Reading, the Government failed miserably to argue for the five stated justifications for the measure. They failed to convince the electorate through the press during the summer and, notwithstanding the truncated nature of today&#039;s debate, they barely touched on the five stated justifications, which are: to tackle terrorism; to fight crime; to cover access to public services; to prohibit unauthorised working, and to enhance immigration control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">The key unanswered question is about terrorists who currently come here with fake, forged or stolen identities that are sufficiently robust for them to be allowed access. If they come here in future, such robust false identities will be turned into genuine ones by the allocation of an identity card or other parts of the documentation in the ID suite.The terrorist networks will be disrupted and smashed by additional funding for intelligence, not identity cards in the pockets, purses and wallets of innocent citizens in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">Let us consider general crime prevention. Not one hon. Member believes that an identity card will stop a single criminal or deter a single crime unless the Government intend the cards to be mandatory and the police can stop, question and ask to see the card of someone who behaves suspiciously. As I said on Second Reading, the police already have the power to stop someone if they have a reasonable ground for believing that that person is about to commit a crime. If the Government were serious about tackling crime, there would not be plastic cards but thousands of extra police on the streets, protecting normal people from normal crimes in normal communities. That has never been rebutted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">On identity theft, the Home Secretary repeated tonight that the cost of identity theft was &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 809</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is the big myth. As <i>The Economist</i> said, the figure includes


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;the cost of dealing with immigrants who arrive in Britain with false documents.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_285">The introduction of identity cards will not stop one person coming in with false papers or save one penny. According to <i>The Economist</i>, the real cost of fraudulent applications and hijacked accounts is only &#163;36.9&nbsp;million. The Bill is a massive and disproportionate response to that problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_286">Time is short and I shall therefore skip many points&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hooray.&quot;]&#151;but not all of them. The Government have failed to argue the case for how they will stop unauthorised working. The gangmasters will flout the rule. Are Ministers expecting every berry field, cockle field and potato farm to have a biometric scanner in the buckie when the casual labour arrives? That is nonsense; it will not happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_287">I said on Second Reading that the Bill was a bad measure, which would make bad law. A Labour Member said that many Labour Members would rue the day they voted for the measure. They will.

: In the one minute remaining, I would like to celebrate the fact that the Bill is finally introducing the provisions of the private Member&#039;s Bill that I introduced five years ago. The Government would have saved a lot of time if they had accepted that Bill.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="51018-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley) (Lab):</b> 
 I believe that this is an important debate about procurement and about its effects if we do not get it right. I shall touch on many issues, but I start with Royal Ordnance, which is based all over the country, though I am particularly concerned with the Chorley site. Royal Ordnance at Chorley still employs 200&nbsp;people, so it is an important employer. It produces initiators. It is the only site within the BAE Systems umbrella that can produce initiators, which means that security of supply would be put at risk if the Chorley site were closed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_297">I am very concerned that BAE Systems and Royal Ordnance seem to think that there will be an alternative. We know that they have shopped around in Singapore and sought to find out who could supply initiators if they were not produced at Chorley. I assure everyone that we should not put at risk our supply to the armed forces. It is a major risk, particularly in times of crisis and when we are committed all over the world. The one thing that the troops require is ammunition that can be trusted. Our ammunition can be trusted because it is produced thoroughly by RO from start to finish. We should not allow BAE or RO to weasel their way out of commitment to the Chorley site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_298">Yes, there has been a problem with production at the Chorley site and, tragically, someone lost their life on that facility. I would not like to think that someone had lost their life in vain. BAE must look at the line again, put in the necessary investment and ensure that it is safe. I do not want it to take the easy option of closing the facility down. We should put the investment in and ensure that the commitment signed with the Government to ensure the supply of ammunition continues. That means using Chorley. We should not let BAE off the hook. BAE would be the first to complain to MPs if the Government were to renege on an order. So when it is the other way round, we should not let BAE renege on its agreement regarding Royal Ordnance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_299">Aerospace is another important subject. Much is said and made of the joint strike fighter, but there is a big worry about it. We know that the Americans are still holding back and the international traffic in arms regulations waiver is still in place. The Americans are still not fully committed to letting the technology come through to us. The other problem is that we need to see final assembly of the jets that we are to order and we need to secure those jobs. Some of the highest skills in the country are based in Lancashire. All that could be put at risk because we cannot get the agreement of the Americans. Well, if there is a special relationship out there, it is time that the Prime Minister used it. We should be securing those jobs in Lancashire by getting what we need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_300">Another company called CSC Computer Sciences employs many people in Chorley, delivering high-tech services for BAE Systems. There is talk about a new company, Alfred McAlpine Business Systems, and I am worried. A long-established link between BAE and CSC has delivered the systems that ensure that nuclear 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 817</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>submarines sail safely. All that could be put at risk and we must think about using untried and untested companies that do not have a background in what we are asking for.
</p>








<p><a name="st_359"><a name="51018-36_spnew6"><b> John Smith  (Vale of Glamorgan) (Lab):</b> 
 I am listening with great interest to the procurement issues that my hon. Friend raises, all of which relate to that excellent company BAE Systems. Does he share my concern that there is a risk that that company may be over-committing itself to work, especially in debt support of fast jets&#151;attack jets in particular&#151;in this country, and that that could impact on some of the other businesses to which he refers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_360"><a name="51018-36_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 Quite rightly my hon. Friend is standing up for the workers at St. Athan, where there is a highly skilled work force and a great background in servicing jets. The MOD must ensure that work goes to that factory as well and that we do not lose this country&#039;s skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_301">There is a worry about Alfred McAlpine Business Systems and about the software, and we must not allow anybody to tender for work without a proven track record. That brings me to the subject of the Army uniforms with which the MOD decided they wanted to be supplied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_302">A company called Cooneen, Watts and Stone tendered for the contract, and a so-called company in Belgium was meant to be supplying. However, behind all the smoke and mirrors was a state-owned and, no doubt, subsidised factory in China. We have ended up sending work from this country to China, which has meant jobs being lost in Lancashire. A factory in the constituency of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), has closed; that is how bad it has got.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_303">The Prime Minister was questioned on this matter. I understand that he is briefed, that he does not know everything and that he answers on the basis of what he is told. He was told, &quot;Do not worry, this will not only protect jobs in Northern Ireland but increase them.&quot; That is not the case; there are fewer jobs now than before the company got the contract. That was another red herring and we were all hoodwinked once more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_304">I am worried about my constituents at the Pincroft factory in Adlington, which has a great reputation for bleaching and dyeing and producing these uniforms, which they have done for many years. The camouflage is good enough to be used around the world, but it is not good enough for here. As usual, we have penny-wise and pound-foolish policies. It is meant to be about saving money, but it is not.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on procuring the debate this evening. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that the Liberal Democrats are laughing, because it is important that our armed forces have the right equipment. If we do not have the necessary supply chains for getting the best possible equipment to our armed forces, jobs will be lost in our constituencies. If

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not make money available to buy the right equipment for our armed forces personnel, they will buy their own equipment. The Minister will know that all too many members of the armed forces buy equipment because they are not given equipment that is good enough. It is not right that&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_362"><a name="51018-37_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. Interventions should be brief.
</p>








<p><a name="st_363"><a name="51018-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. He raises a question that is asked by our armed forces. They are worried about their equipment, and we should not allow that to happen. We should ensure that they have the right equipment for the job that we expect them to do. Instead of trying to shave a few pennies off the cost, we should give them the right gear in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_305">As my right hon. Friend the Minister can see, I am holding up a camouflage jacket made in China. The problem is not that he can see it, although it is meant to be camouflage; it is that this piece of combat uniform has 19&nbsp;faults. That may be hard to believe, but it is what we expect our service personnel to put up with
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_306">I shall list some of the jackets faults. The waist channel, front and neck, is 41&nbsp;cm when it should be 42&nbsp;cm. The front length is 78.5&nbsp;cm, and it should be 80&nbsp;cm. The usable zip length is wrong, and the back length, collar to waist, is not accurate. The distance between the breast pockets and the collar is wrong, and the back measurement is wrong. The front edge and front bottom of the hip pocket are both inaccurately cut. The hip flaps and the front zip pockets are wrong too, and the left storm guard is not fused. Why are our armed forces supposed to put up with that? We all know that the last thing a soldier on active service needs is to get wet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_307">It gets worse. The Pincroft factory in Adlington is now having to make the one-off, special garments, that cannot be made in China. However, it was told that the infra-red capability of its products&#151;vital for camouflage purposes&#151;did not meet Ministry of Defence standards. If the factory in my constituency was to blame for the errors, I would be the first to say that it was not good enough to do the job, but eventually it turned out that the Ministry had not been applying the right test. That means that the infra-red capability produced in Chorley was right&#151;as the factory always insisted that it was, in the face of the Ministry&#039;s claims to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_308">The problem was that the Ministry had used a back plate for the tests that was black instead of white. Given that that was the case, and that the same test was applied to the uniforms produced in China, does that mean that all the Chinese uniforms are wrong, and that they might put our troops at risk? That is the question, and it is a very serious matter.Was the wrong test applied to the Chinese-made uniforms, or were they not tested at all? After all, irrespective of the deficiencies in the uniforms&#039; infra-red capability, the jacket that I have demonstrated to the House still has 19&nbsp;faults of other kinds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_309">What comes next? I can tell the House that soldiers are telephoning the Pincroft factory and asking for special garments to be made for them. They claim that the dye in the uniforms provided has a tendency to get 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 819</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>washed out. That is very serious, but how have we allowed the problem to arise? What real savings have been made? I do not think that there any, but I know that we have got ourselves in a mess.
</p>








<p><a name="st_364"><a name="51018-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Crausby  (Bolton, North-East) (Lab):</b> 
 Is it not ironic that the Americans refused to give us the ITAR waiver in order to protect American jobs at the same time as we were prepared to give away good Lancashire jobs to China?
</p>








<p><a name="st_365"><a name="51018-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 Absolutely. It is daft. We are giving jobs to China yet Peter Mandelson the commissioner is asking why we are allowing all these textiles in from China and saying that we have to put some barriers up and that we are going to reduce the amount coming in from China next year. At the same time, we are putting contracts for the making of uniforms out there. I agree with my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_310">The worry is that we are getting uniforms with faults on them. There are worries about the safety of our soldiers. Why are we doing it? Why are we putting soldiers at risk? Why do we not stop the order now and have a full investigation? Let us put the jobs where they belong&#151;where the taxpayer expects; back in this country supporting the textile workers in Lancashire. Let us have enough of this nonsense. Let us do something about it. Let us have an end to the Chinese market and the Chinese takeaway in this country.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) on securing the debate and providing me with the opportunity to speak on these important issues. My hon. Friend has raised four issues&#151;the future of supply for initiators at BAE systems Chorley, the cut and sewn contract, the joint strikefighter programme and the issue of Alfred McAlpine business systems. I will try to respond to them in the time available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_311">It is critical that our armed forces receive the equipment that they need to do the jobs that we ask of them. Our service personnel are among the best equipped in the world and the measures and programmes that the Government have put in place will ensure that they remain so in future. I do not have time to go into every procurement in which we are currently engaged, but it is exceptional compared with previous years&#151;the largest sustained shipbuilding programme for a generation, massive investment in the Air Force and massive investment in land systems. But getting the procurement process right is of course fundamental, not only to the delivery of enhanced military capability on time but to securing best value for the taxpayer. That is why we are devoting so much effort to ensuring that Smart procurement works. We recognise that there is more to do in this respect, but we are nevertheless confident that we are making good progress. We are confident, too, that the defence industrial strategy, which I will touch on later, will help industry understand our requirements better when it is launched later this year.

It is BAE Systems&#039; responsibility to maintain the supply of initiators to the MOD in the interim, and we are confident in its ability to do so. It is meeting that requirement at present.
</p>








<p><a name="st_367"><a name="51018-37_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 It is fair to say that a mixture of explosives has to be used up because it is too volatile to be moved. So the company will have to run down what is on site. The agreement was that the material would be supplied from this country and from within BAE Systems sites, and that is what the MOD is trying to get out of.
</p>








<p><a name="st_368"><a name="51018-37_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I was coming on to that. Obviously, the MOD&#039;s interest is in securing long-term security of supply. My hon. Friend is absolutely right on that. It may be helpful if I set out our policy in this area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_314">The significance of the munitions strategic supply position was underlined when the framework partnering agreement&#151;the FPA&#151;was signed in December 1999&nbsp;between the MOD and RO Defence, which now trades as BAE Systems Land Systems. The FPA covers the majority of the MOD general munitions range, including initiators, and is due to expire in March 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_315">The FPA provided a significant step toward achieving a sustainable UK source for general munitions supply and is projected to exceed the financial targets envisaged. Obviously, we are looking to build on that success. Because of that success, we have also recently underpinned our partnership with BAE Systems in the munitions field, through the signing of a new set of partnering principles. That provides a demonstration of commitment to a long-term objective for munitions provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_316">At the same time, we are examining the supply of munitions provision beyond 2010&nbsp;through project MASS&#151;or munitions acquisition, the supply solution. The general munitions position will form one element of the wider defence industrial strategy. The DIS is a logical development of the defence industrial policy, which we set out in 2002, and is aimed at ensuring that the capability requirements of the armed forces can be met now and in the future. Conclusions on the DIS will be reached by the end of this calendar year. Industry continues to be involved in that work and, of course, the trade unions are also heavily engaged in the discussions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_317">I have given the background to the situation and I hope that it serves to indicate the seriousness with which the Government view strategic defence industrial issues in general, and munitions supply issues in particular. We are conscious of the need for security of supply in munitions, and we also recognise that we need to get to grips with the range of systems and equipment delivered by British industry. We need to examine what is achievable in terms of the retention of key industries. That will take time. We will need to talk to industry and it will not be an easy process. We will wait and see how that plays out, but the process is consistent with the views expressed by my hon. Friend.

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_318">My hon. Friend referred to the possible closure of the Chorley site, and we are aware that the company is considering options for various parts of its business. My officials have engaged with the company on that, to ensure that its plans are compatible with our needs. It is a matter for the company, but it has to ensure that it meets the agreement laid down in 1999&nbsp;and the new set of partnering principles. My hon. Friend will recognise that I cannot comment on those discussions in this forum, nor speculate on future outcomes, not least because they are fundamentally commercial matters for the company itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_319">My hon. Friend also raised the question of the cut and sewn contract. He knows very well the background to the contract award. Indeed, from what he said tonight, he obviously has a detailed knowledge of it. He correctly pointed out the extensive correspondence and communication between the previous Secretary of State and me, including meetings with the trade unions, hon. Members and representatives of industry to hear their concerns. As a result, we reviewed the cut and sewn garments contract earlier this year. We examined the process used for the procurement, the outcome of tender evaluation and the decision taken. We also revisited the capability of the winning contractor, Cooneen, Watts and Stone. At the end of that exhaustive process, we concluded that there was no reason to alter the original decision. I want to make it clear&#151;as we have done on previous occasions&#151;that the contract was let after a fair and open competition against published criteria. Cooneen, Watts and Stone was the clear winner against those criteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_320">Under the five-year contract, Cooneen, Watts and Stone will supply the MOD with up to 2&nbsp;million individual items of clothing a year. The contract will gradually replace some 60&nbsp;individual contracts for clothing supply and will save the taxpayer &#163;23&nbsp;million over the contract life, by comparison to previous arrangements. Subcontract opportunities exist for previous suppliers to present themselves competitively to the prime contractor over the life of the five-year contract.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_321">Having examined the matter, I genuinely believe that the contract is an excellent example of how the MOD is making procurement smarter and better. We have taken away a complicated supply chain and put in place a straightforward contract under which subcontractors can bid, and have made a significant &#163;23&nbsp;million saving. We are determined that our armed forces should have the best clothing appropriate for the extreme environments in which they may be asked to serve and the demanding nature of the tasks they undertake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_322">Again, having examined the issue, we are confident that Cooneen, Watts and Stone can meet those demands, while providing good value for money to the taxpayer. That confidence has been recently reinforced by the results of the first annual contract review. Savings in excess of &#163;1&nbsp;million have been made to date, and those savings are in addition to the &#163;23&nbsp;million in savings already secured by comparison with previous arrangements. Cost and quality targets are being

<br>&nbsp;<br>achieved and exceeded. The bulk fabric was tested by a UK accredited laboratory ahead of the main production run and conformed to the required specification. Finished garments have also been randomly tested by a UK accredited laboratory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_323">Clearly, I will take on board the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley. If he had cared to write to us before the debate, we could have had answers for the debate this evening. I have no problem about saying that the equipment is the best in the world. I could hardly see the jacket against the green Benches&#151;that shows how good the camouflage is&#151;but I take the point that, if serious imperfections have been brought to his attention, I am duty bound to investigate them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_324">We have received no complaints from units. As I have said before at the Dispatch Box, I am fortunate that I am one of those people who probably meet more serving members of the armed forces than any other hon. Member, given the way I get round our estate and meet our people. The issue has never been raised with me, and the members of the armed forces do not hold back: they tell me what they think, and they have not told me about this. That does not mean that there is no problem, but it has not been brought to my attention until this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_325">I am also aware of my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns about the overseas element of the contract. As I have said before in the House, the idea that there was a sole British manufacturer seeking to place all its output in the UK sector is simply wrong. Countries that appeared on the list of bidding companies included Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Sri Lanka, Dubai, as well as China. UK companies are free to trade with Chinese companies. I do not know whether he is arguing for an embargo on trade with China.

<p><a name="st_369"><a name="51018-38_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 Of course, there is a worry about China&#151;the Chinese are being given intelligence about the design of the camouflage because they are printing it&#151;but the bigger question is that a state factory is being used and subsidies are being applied so that it can win work. My worry is that the competition is not fair.
</p>








<p><a name="st_370"><a name="51018-38_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I mentioned other countries&#151;Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Sri Lanka. We check out the quality of the factories that supply the camouflage, and we ensure that it meets high standards. The idea that China is somehow the sweatshop of the world is not accurate in terms of the quality of the work that it does and the way in which its economy is growing dramatically. My hon. Friend may think that we should simply cease trading with China; I do not think that is realistic. All companies in the UK are free to trade with Chinese companies. Moreover, the UK is not alone in sourcing its military clothing from abroad. Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, to name but four of them, all procure clothing made in other countries. However, as I say, I will take on board the points that have been made about quality and investigate them further.

That represents a significant opportunity for UK defence companies and the UK aerospace industry. Clearly, there are still issues to resolve in respect of the ITAR waiver. Intensive lobbying goes on, and we make the point time and again&#151;we will not cease to do so&#151;that there are huge opportunities for British industry on the back of the contract.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_327">The final point that my hon. Friend made related to Alfred McAlpine Business Systems. He is correct to say that that company does not currently deliver IT systems for submarines. Any decision to change suppliers would be a matter for the prime contractor, BAE Systems submarines. The management of subcontractors is principally the responsibility of the prime contractor, who is selected on the basis of technical competence and ability to manage the supply chain in accordance with the MOD requirements of governance and probity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51018-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_328">I am aware that Alfred McAlpine Business Systems is currently undergoing security accreditation checks to enable it operate as a subcontractor on MOD contracts. It would be inappropriate therefore to comment further on that point, other than to say that the more British-based companies we can encourage into the supply chain, the better. We should be encouraging more start-up companies, growth companies and competition, but the key issue is that they must undertake robust accreditation processes, satisfy the governance aspects of that approach and show probity in going about their business.
</p>








<p><a name="st_371"><a name="51018-38_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 My hon. Friend seems to be saying that the more we can encourage companies to put tenders in and the more we have supplying us, the better. That flies in the face of what we did on uniforms, where we wanted to reduce the number of suppliers.

<p><a name="st_372"><a name="51018-38_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 No, we did not want to reduce the number of suppliers. We wanted to change the way in which the supply chain was managed. The number of
