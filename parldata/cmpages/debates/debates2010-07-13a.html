The Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and for Business, Innovation and Skills jointly wrote to local authorities inviting submissions for the establishment of those new bodies, which will be partnerships between local authorities and local businesses. That is the right way to promote economic growth in localities.</p>

Friend aware that the North of England Inward Investment Agency, which is sponsored by the Northwest RDA and One NorthEast, currently maintains five offices in north America?

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, and there is an awful lot of waste in the regional development agency system more generally. Of course, it will be for the local economic partnerships to look at such issues and work out whether they wish to come together to promote their region in a wider way, but his point serves to reinforce the argument for the structural change that we are making.</p>

 There is no doubt in my mind that the Northwest Regional Development Agency has been a bureaucratic burden on the economy of the north-west since it was started.

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments in support, I think, of the policy that we are pursuing. The local enterprise partnerships will be able to choose for themselves and direct where they think investment is needed in their localities. One major tool that they will have at their disposal is the ability, as a public-private partnership, to apply to the regional growth fund for investment in their areas. Obviously, that will be allocated in ways to be announced, but I hope that it will provide a tool for those new bodies to do precisely the sorts of things that the hon. Gentleman set out.</p>

 A full impact assessment was published on Budget day. Although it focused on the compliance costs for all businesses, it had an emphasis on retailers, as it acknowledged that they were expected to incur higher compliance costs.

 I am sorry but that was a really complacent answer. Much of the retail sector in my constituency is very dependent on the business that comes in through the door from pensioners. There are 13,000 of them in the Rhondda, a growing number, and they are the people who will be very heavily hit by the VAT increase, because they will have less discretionary income to spend on gifts and the things that make life worth living.

 The fact is that we had to raise VAT because there was no money left. I do not know whether the hon.

After all, our predecessors looked very closely at raising VAT and would have done so had the previous Prime Minister not vetoed it.</p>

 The UK faces one of the largest fiscal challenges of any advanced economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, between 2007 and 2015 the UK is forecast to experience the most rapid increase in net debt of any G7 economy, with the exception of Japan. The Office for Budget Responsibility's pre-Budget forecast shows that without further action to tackle the deficit, debt would still be rising in 2014-15. As result of the actions set out by the Government in the June Budget, the OBR projects that debt will have declined to 69.4% of gross domestic product in 2014-15- 5% of GDP lower than under the plans the Government inherited.</p>

 No, that is not true. The plain fact is that, as I said earlier, we have the fastest growing debt and the largest deficit in the European Union apart from Ireland.

 He also made it clear that he did not think that that risk was a likely one. In the Budget-this is the important central judgment that the House needs to understand-we have faced up to the fact that if we had carried on with the plans of the previous Government, the big risk facing the economy would have been higher interest rates, fewer jobs, and a reduction in growth, and we would have faced the big risk that we have seen in other countries, which we need to ensure does not happen in this country.

 With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the review of counter-terrorism and security powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para8"><a name="10071330000209">As I have said to the House before, the first duty of Government is to protect the public, but that duty must never be used as a reason to ride roughshod over our civil liberties-and that is what the previous Government did on far too many occasions. This Government are different. We have already introduced legislation to get rid of identity cards once and for all; we have already declared our intention to bring forward a freedom Bill later this year; and just last week I announced interim restrictions on the use of stop-and-search powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para9"><a name="10071330000210">Today, as promised in the coalition agreement, I am announcing an urgent review of counter-terrorism and security powers. The review will consider six key powers: control orders; section 44 stop-and-search powers and the use of terrorism legislation in relation to photography; the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 by local authorities and access to communications data more generally; extending the use of deportations with assurances in a manner that is consistent with our legal and human rights obligations; measures to deal with organisations that promote hatred or violence; and the detention of terrorist suspects before charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para10"><a name="10071330000211">Those are the most controversial and sensitive powers. In particular, the issue of pre-charge detention has been the subject of considerable debate in the House, and tomorrow we will consider whether to renew the current detention limit for a further six months. That will provide us with sufficient time to look carefully at pre-charge detention in the review and to explore how we can reduce the period of detention below 28 days. The review will also help to inform us on what additional safeguards are needed in the proposed asset freezing Bill, which the Treasury will introduce shortly.</p>

I want the review to be conducted as openly and transparently as possible. I have asked Liberty to contribute to the review, and it has said that it would be delighted to do so.

made by Lord Carlile will be fully considered as part of the review and I know that he welcomes the additional independent perspective that Lord Macdonald will provide on these issues. Any legislative amendments that result from the review will of course be subject to review by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. I have ordered that the review should be completed as quickly as possible, because it is important that the police and the security and intelligence agencies are able to do their vital work with certainty and confidence.

They do their work with bravery, patriotism and a strong sense of duty, and I know the whole House will want to join me in paying tribute to them. The review will enable this Government to put right the failures of the last Government and, in so doing, restore the ancient civil liberties that should be synonymous with the name of our country.

 I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving me early sight of her statement. It is important to recall that when the Terrorism Bill received its Third Reading in November 2005, it had all-party support, so both parties to the coalition Government supported the bulk of the legislation that will now be reviewed. Two things characterised that debate, which came a few months after the horror and carnage of 7/7. The first was the realisation that no change in Government policy would remove the UK from al-Qaeda's firing line and that the only response to the threat was to contest and then defeat it. The second was the extraordinary lengths that were taken to proceed on the basis of consensus, not just with the then shadow Home Secretary, the right hon.

They plan to diminish important weapons in the fight against crime and terrorism such as the DNA database and CCTV.

recognise what much of the counter-terrorism legislation that it introduced and on occasions the misuse of that legislation have done to civil liberties in this country. It has surprised me because I hoped that, in opposition, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) and his colleagues would have taken the opportunity to sit back and look at their records in government and wonder why in the past few years so many people, including the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, have been raising questions about the counter-terrorism legislation that the previous Government introduced. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has not seen fit to use the time in opposition so far to undertake that exercise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para24"><a name="10071330000227">In the counter-terrorism review, we are looking at precisely the balance that the right hon. Gentleman talks about between collective security and individual freedom. We want to ensure that we strike the right balance between collective security and individual freedom and not the wrong balance that we believe the previous Government introduced in a number of areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para25"><a name="10071330000228">The right hon. Gentleman asked for some statistics. I can tell him that 235 people were convicted of terrorism-related offences between 11 September 2001 and 31 December 2009, and a further 22 defendants were awaiting trial as at 31 December 2009. For the 28 terrorism-related trials completed in the 12 months to the end of last year, 93% were convicted, with just over half pleading guilty, and convictions included six life sentences. At the end of December 2009, 131 people were in prison for terrorism, extremist offences or charges relating to terrorism or extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para26"><a name="10071330000229">I am certainly not making light of the threat that exists in this country. As the right hon. Gentleman acknowledged, nor did my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister when he came to the House to make his statement on detainees and the publication of guidance to our security services. We recognise the level of threat in the United Kingdom, but I say to the right hon. Gentleman and members of the Labour party that our fight against those threats is not aided by legislation that is misused or that people feel encroaches on civil liberties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para27"><a name="10071330000230">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether I could suggest legislation in which the Labour Government had ridden roughshod over civil liberties and then said they had not done so in relation to the detention of terror suspects before charging. I have to say to him that trying to introduce 90 days of pre-charge detention was indeed riding roughshod over our civil liberties. The review will look to ensure that our counter-terrorism legislation is appropriate to the level of threat and provides our police and our security and intelligence agencies with the powers that they need to combat that threat, while ensuring that we can enjoy our ancient civil liberties.</p>

 I of course want to ensure that those involved in counter-terrorism, whether in the police or other agencies, are able to undertake the job we ask them to do and which they do diligently for us day in, day out. On spending cuts, however, no specific figure has been set. As the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, a spending review is under way in which Departments are looking at their expenditure and it is right that the Home Office does as other Departments do. I must tell the right hon. Gentleman and others on the Opposition Benches that I did not want to be in the position of looking at spending cuts in the Home Office and other Departments. The reason why we have to do so is that, in the words of the last Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury, there is no money left. And whose fault is that? It is the Labour party's.</p>

 The Home Secretary's statement refers to a review of powers to deal with organisations that promote hatred or violence. Does she recognise that legislation alone is never sufficient to tackle complex issues of this nature? Will she look very closely at the current Department for Communities and Local Government review of the Prevent programme, which is very much designed to make communities part of the solution, not part of the problem? This is a complex, sophisticated and difficult area to tackle, but unless she makes communities part of the solution, we will not make the progress that we need to make.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for focusing on that issue. He asked me to ensure that there were no deportations during the review-a rather wide commitment -but the purpose of his question was to focus on deportations with assurances. Of course, the issue arises because we have had a number of cases here in the UK where individuals have been identified as posing a terrorist threat to the UK, but because of the legal interpretations of our duties and requirements under the European convention on human rights, it has not been felt possible to deport those individuals to certain countries. We wish to continue to work with a number of other countries to ensure that it will be possible to deport people with assurances that they will not be subject to torture.</p>

<a name="100713-0001.htm_brev8"><a name="10071330000397"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the immediate repatriation of foreign nationals awarded a custodial sentence to serve detention in their country of origin; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para40"><a name="10071330000310">In moving the motion, I would like to welcome to his place the Prisons Minister, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt). I am also delighted to see next to him members of the Treasury team-my hon. Friends the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury-who I am sure will be thrilled to know that my Bill, if enacted in full, would save Her Majesty's Exchequer some Â£460 million a year, which I am sure would be a welcome contribution to reducing our nation's record deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para41"><a name="10071330000311">The situation regarding foreign nationals in prison in our country is a national disgrace. There are 11,367 foreign nationals currently serving time in Britain's jails-some 13% of the prison total-and the number has almost trebled in the past 15 years, up from just 4,000 in June 1995. Two of Her Majesty's prisons are devoted entirely to housing foreign national prisoners: HMP Canterbury and HMP Bullwood Hall. Indeed, we have the privilege of having foreign national prisoners from some 160 different countries serving time at Her Majesty's pleasure. We have become, in many respects, the United Nations of crime. My Bill would save a huge amount of money for the British taxpayer and free up valuable space in our prison estate, which is basically full, but it would also enable Her Majesty's Government to rehabilitate better our own prisoners who are serving time in jail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para42"><a name="10071330000312">Typically, foreign national prisoners spend between eight and 10 months in Britain's jails. One third have been convicted of violent or sexual offences, while one fifth have been convicted for drug crimes. Although 160 different countries are represented, 10 countries account for half the total, and five countries account for one third. The top five in the list of shame are as follows: Jamaica, with 963 prisoners; Nigeria with 752; the Republic of Ireland with 647; Vietnam with 620; and Poland with 617. Those five countries alone are contributing 3,600 prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para43"><a name="10071330000313">There has been legislation on this matter in recent years. The Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 enabled Her Majesty's Government to negotiate voluntary transfer agreements with countries around the world, but unsurprisingly, not many prisoners volunteered to be returned to their country of origin. In 2006, the previous Government amended the Act to enable compulsory transfer agreements to be introduced. In 2008 a system was introduced for prisoners serving more than 12 months to be automatically deported to their country of origin at the end of their sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para44"><a name="10071330000314">My Bill would enable Her Majesty's Government to transfer foreign national prisoners back to secure detention in their own countries without their consent. I do not see why the British taxpayer should pay the bill for the housing and lodging of foreign nationals who have abused our trust by committing crimes so heinous that they have been jailed in this country. I believe that their own countries of origin should pick up the bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para45"><a name="10071330000315">Nigeria, which is second on the list, with 752 foreign nationals in our jails, is seeking to conclude a compulsory transfer agreement with the United Kingdom, and I understand that that legislation is now before the Nigerian National Assembly. Indeed, it has been in that position since 2007. I should like politely to suggest that Nigeria be encouraged to get a move on. It has not escaped my notice that, while we British taxpayers are paying Â£30 million for incarcerating Nigeria's foreign nationals in our jails, we are at the same time giving that country Â£132 million annually in development aid. Now, fair's fair-if we are going to contribute to the development of that nation, it ought to be mindful of the extra costs that we are bearing by incarcerating its prisoners in our country. Nigeria, Jamaica and other countries on the list are Commonwealth countries, so there should be no suggestion that returning people to those countries would result in their being badly treated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para46"><a name="10071330000316">An additional protocol to the Council of Europe's convention on the transfer of sentenced persons, which Her Majesty's Government signed in November 2009, allows for the compulsory transfer of sentenced persons back to their country of origin among the 35 signatory countries, including all of the European Union. That would cover some 3,100 foreign national prisoners, or 28% of our foreign national prison population. The list of shame covered by this agreement is headed by the Republic of Ireland with 647 prisoners, Poland with 617, Romania with 357, Lithuania with 330 and France with 163.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para47"><a name="10071330000317">My message to the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate, who has done an excellent job in his first few weeks as prisons Minister, is that we should gently encourage our European partners to abide by the terms of the additional protocol and ensure that facilities are in place to ensure the swift transfer of foreign national prisoners back to those countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="100713-0001.htm_para48"><a name="10071330000318">Times are hard, and we have heard from the Opposition that our country has run out of money. The bill that we face every year for the incarceration of foreign nationals in our jails is simply too high, and the time has come for the British taxpayer to say to our friends and neighbours round the world, "If you're going to send us people who behave so badly that they're found guilty of crimes serious enough for them to be sent to jail, fair's fair, you must take your citizens back to their own country and make sure that they serve time in secure detention there." That would rehabilitate them better, among their friends and family, and it would free up our prison space so that we could rehabilitate better our own nationals who have strayed away from the right path of the law. It would save us a lot of money and do the right thing. I very much hope that the message is being received loud and clear by those in authority both in our country and among our friends and neighbours abroad.</p>

 I shall speak to amendments 13 and 14, tabled by me and my hon. Friends. Amendment 14 is a probing amendment. I have no particular problem with a reduction in the VAT rate relating to the restrictions in the value of imported goods, but I am seeking to probe to ensure that the necessary changes will definitely be in place so that businesses are not charged more than they should be when the provision comes into force. When the Conservatives were in opposition, they quite rightly used to berate the Government for the size and complexity of the tax code. They would pile up Tolley's tax guides as evidence that it was complicated, so I want to make sure that they have dotted the i's and crossed the t's on this particular change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para18"><a name="10071330000345">One might imagine that importing something into this country would be reasonably straightforward, and that a modest change to the VAT rate would be simple to make. If something is imported by air or sea, however, it requires a certificate. It can be done under the single administrative document; it can be manually processed with an SAD authenticated copy 8; it can have a trader input computerised process with a weekly VAT certificate issued by the customs computer under report TW-AH or TW-BH; and it can have a post-entry correction form C18. Removal from a customs warehouse would require a form C259, and an excise or customs warehouse requires a duty payment form W5, W6 or W20-and so on and so forth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para19"><a name="10071330000346">Of course, VAT is far from simple even on imports from the EC. The VAT territory of the European Community in respect of Denmark excludes the Faroes and Greenland-and there is much more of this to come. For Germany, Busingen and the isle of Heligoland are excepted; while for Italy, there are the communes of Livigno and Campione d'Italia, and the Italian waters of Lake Lugano. Portugal includes the Azores and Madeira. Spain includes the Balearic islands, but excludes Ceuta and Melilla. The United Kingdom includes the Isle of Man. Then there are the overseas French dÃ©partements and Mount Athos in Greece.</p>

Amendment 13 seeks to delete that VAT increase-an increase that is wrong precisely because it directly contradicts the stated intention of both the coalition parties, which say that they want to create a fairer society. I think that, on balance, the Liberal Democrats were right when, before the election, they warned of the Conservatives' "VAT bombshell". It is no less threatening and fateful today. Looking at the serried ranks of five Liberal Democrats who are sitting here, I wonder whether this is the time for them to stick with principle, and perhaps forgo the possibility of having a ministerial Mondeo one day.</p>

 My hon. Friend made a good point about the Liberal Democrats' "VAT bombshell" warnings. Those warnings were, of course, issued when the pre-Budget report had forecast a deficit of Â£177 billion. By the time of the Budget, however, the deficit was only Â£149 billion. With a lower deficit, the Liberal Democrats wanted more VAT to plug the gap. Can my hon. Friend explain their thinking?</p>

 I would be here for some time if I were to explain the convoluted thinking of the Liberal Democrats, but my hon. Friend has made an extremely important point. Early forecasts of the deficit were high and later forecasts were lower, almost certainly as a consequence of the fiscal stimulus that took place at the time. I think that the Liberal Democrats are wrong to embark on an increase now. I shall explain some of the other economic consequences later, but just in case anyone thinks that I am being unbalanced and that I am going to let Labour off the hook, I think the very fact that the original plan had worked made it difficult to understand why Labour should allow the United Kingdom to be one of only two countries in the G20 to withdraw a fiscal stimulus package in 2010.</p>

 May I complete the picture presented by the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)? While it is certainly true that the overall deficit has fallen somewhat, the structural deficit-the bit that we really need to worry about-is in fact Â£12 billion higher than was anticipated.

 The hon. Lady is right about the size of the structural deficit. I have never disputed that. She is also right to suggest that the VAT increase will provide some Â£12 billion to Â£13 billion more for the Exchequer. That, too, is a matter of recorded fact.

All that is due to choices made by the Government. They have previously argued, and I am sure will argue again this evening, that the increase was unavoidable. However, there was nothing unavoidable about putting up VAT, nothing unavoidable about an accelerated attack on the structural deficit, nothing unavoidable about a deficit consolidation plan over a fixed term, nothing unavoidable about taking Â£32 billion more in public service cuts on top of the cuts bequeathed by the Labour party, and nothing unavoidable about Â£40 billion a year of extra fiscal tightening in addition to the Â£57 billion or so planned in the final year by the Labour party. So this coalition Government could have avoided raising the VAT bill for the poorest families to over Â£31 a week.</p>

 I would have been absolutely delighted to be in government and to have a progressive tax system that helped ordinary people and stimulated business growth, as we in my party have done in the Scottish Government.

However, we are now faced with the consequences of a coalition agreement that will see the VAT rise hit the poorest the hardest.

At a time when all of us, presumably, want to protect the front line-the prison service and the police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; the teachers; the nurses; the social workers: indeed, every public body and all the people who do the work-this Government, backed by the Liberals, are forcing those public bodies to pay that hard-earned cash to the Treasury instead of ensuring continued investment in and payment to the front line.

 It is actually worse than that. Goods of all sorts tend to be dearer in rural areas to begin with, the VAT is added to that price and so more VAT, in cash terms, is paid on the purchase, or the sale, of the same item in a rural part of the country than in a competitive city centre.</p>

Of course, the Chancellor is relying on that happy coincidence of business investment growth and export growth in every one of the next three or four years. It is fair to say that most people would not quite bet on such an outcome coming to pass, but rather than seeking to stimulate domestic demand and to create better conditions for business investment in the UK domestic economy, the Chancellor has instead chosen to give consumption the biggest whack possible and to introduce a consumption tax. Indeed, the hit to our growth is so severe that buried in the tables at the back of the Red Book we learn that an extra Â£9 billion of tax increases are required simply to make good the loss of growth and the loss of jobs.</p>

If I may, I will start with amendments 41 to 43, the purpose of which is quite straightforward: they seek to make good the fact that there is no mandate for the clause. I do not think that either Government party could truly claim to have solicited from voters any ringing endorsement for clause 3. If anything, in their hearts, they could assume that the public voted against the subject of the clause. Today's debate is important for Parliament and for the public, and I certainly hope that we will not be subjected again to the spectacle of the Government Chief Whip, who is not in his place, seeking to force a closure motion on a Finance Bill debate. Over the centuries, nothing has prevented Parliament from debating the wisdom of the Executive's attempts to tax the people of the country, and it would be unfortunate, particularly for the Conservative party, which prides itself on being a party of tradition, if the Chief Whip were single-handedly to put one of our most cherished traditions in the bin.</p>

 I am greatly reassured by that, Mr Hood, as I was worried that the Chief Whip would again, later this evening, detect a certain exuberance or failing of stamina among some of those in his pastoral care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para49"><a name="10071343000010">The first group of amendments has a very simple purpose. As the clause is a measure with no mandate, it is surely important for hon. and right hon. Members present not just to vote for it in the dark. Surely, we have a responsibility, as legislators, to ensure that we genuinely understand the impact of the VAT increase on the people whom we are here to represent. It is perfectly possible that even when that clarity has been acquired, the Government will say that they want to press ahead with the measure come what may, but we should study how different groups will be hurt by the VAT increase. Amendments 41 to 43 ask the Treasury to prepare a report on the impact of the rise in the standard rate of VAT on pensioners, children and child poverty, inequality, the bottom 20% of households by income, charities, the informal economy and the black market. Under the amendments, if those reports are not completed, the increase in the standard rate of VAT would not occur until 4 January 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para50"><a name="10071343000011">The purpose of the amendments is perfectly straightforward. We know that there are more Finance Bills in the pipeline, some of which might arrive in the House fairly soon after the summer recess, but the House will want to be able to press the Government-from both sides, I hope-on the need to include in future Finance Bills measures to compensate those who have been hit particularly hard by the increase in VAT should it arrive successfully on the statute books this afternoon. The reports are enormously important because the public were denied a debate, during the election, about what protections should be put in place. Indeed, they could be forgiven for believing that no party intended to increase VAT.</p>

Politics aside, I hope that she accepts that the public were not given much incentive to ask us, if a VAT increase did come down the tracks fairly quickly after the election, what protections we would put in place.

impact studies of abolishing the 10p tax rate, for example. I understand that the Labour party has now learned to love Baron Mandelson, whose memoirs are now published for all to see. It is clear from them that the shadow Chancellor had been contemplating increasing VAT to 18 or 19% in advance of the general election. Baron Mandelson acknowledges that this was a hard choice, one that he was impressed by. In those circumstances, does the shadow Chief Secretary accept that sometimes it is better to leave the hard choices until after an election, and perhaps that was in the back of the minds of the now Prime Minister and Chancellor?</p>

 That is a very subtle argument. I think I just about followed the hon. Gentleman step by step and link by link, but cutting to the chase I hope the point we can agree on is that the public were not given much incentive to ask of us, at hustings or elsewhere, "If there were VAT increases, what would you do to protect different groups?" Given the fact that we all know there are future finance Bills to come, possibly in short order, it is important that we try to understand the real impact of the VAT increase, especially on the groups I have listed in my amendment, so that we can ask the Government to bring in protection for them.</p>

They worry about the impact of VAT because they, like Labour Members, came into politics to try to make this country a fairer and more prosperous place to live in.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a VAT rise will have a bigger impact on those with least money. I think it said that the poorest 10% of households would lose twice as much as a percentage of their income as the richest 10%.

 I know the hon. Member is new to the House, but the report to which he refers is called the Budget, and in chapter 6 of the March 2010 Budget the plan that the Chancellor decided on is set out very clearly. He said that the deficit should be halved over the next four years and that that would require Â£57 billion-worth of discretionary action. That would require Â£19 billion of tax increases, of which broadly half came through an increase in the national insurance rate, some of which the Conservative party has kept. About Â£18 billion of savings would come through reducing capital expenditure as a share of our economy, from the 3.5% which it hit in order to fight back against the recession, down to about 1.25% of GDP in a couple of years' time. That is, by the way, still twice the level that we inherited back in 1996-97. And on top of that Â£18 billion in winding down capital spending, we then set out very clearly Â£20 billion of savings to current expenditure. The hon. Member will recall that Â£4.5 billion of savings were to be achieved by holding down public sector pay, of which Â£1 billion would be gained through reform of public sector pensions by 2012, Â£5 billion by cuts to a range of lower-priority programmes across Government, and about Â£11 billion of savings were to be gained by revolutionising the way that Whitehall conducts its business. So there is a very clear plan set out in chapter 6 of that Budget-it is only 20 pages; I recommend it to the hon. Member if he has not read it. But why not have the debate now?</p>

 Happily, the question is hypothetical, because the then Chancellor reached a decision on the right package of measures needed to halve the deficit over the next four years. The hon. Gentleman's problem is that the Conservative party concluded that it needed to bring forward by a year the date at which debt as a proportion of GDP needs to start to fall. Therefore, another Â£40 billion in tax rises and spending cuts are needed. The only way to secure that is to take an enormous risk by whacking domestic consumption with a regressive tax.

 My hon. Friend was making an important point, and she is absolutely right. We also said very clearly that more than half of the Â£19 billion in taxes that we proposed to raise-a measure not completely different from the figure that the Government are seeking to raise-should be paid for by the top 2% of earners.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has exposed my utter lack of originality. This position is not uniquely adopted by Opposition Members. Indeed, part of the inspiration for our amendments is the amendment tabled to the Budget resolutions by the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George). There is a consensus that, over the years to come, we want the institutions that help to govern our macro-economic policy to be as strong and robust as possible. That is why the shadow Chancellor has welcomed the initiative of the Office for Budget Responsibility, but put on the record our ambition to ensure that it is truly as independent as possible. That is why it is important that there is no question about its conduct, the publication of its reports and the synchronisation of its reports with Prime Minister's Question Time and so on. We want Parliament to take the lead role in appointing the OBR's new leadership, and we want also to ensure that financial, tax and economic policy is conducted as transparently as possible. That was the instinct behind the creation of the code for fiscal stability many years ago, and we need to carry on the work of reform so that we truly strengthen the role of this House in holding economic policy to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para70"><a name="10071343000055">The purpose of clause 6 is to seek to protect a group of people who are very important to all Members-our pensioners and retired citizens. Ultimately, the reason why Labour decided to raise national insurance instead of VAT was a concern for fairness, and we knew in particular that those on fixed incomes, such as pensions, would struggle most when faced with sharply rising prices. Today, I am afraid, we hear that pensioners could face an Â£8 billion VAT bill during the course of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para71"><a name="10071343000056">When the Budget was presented, we heard a little about the protections that were already being put in place, but on closer inspection it turns out that pensioners will be hit by different changes each and every year. Amendment 46 would therefore require the Treasury to prepare a report on the impact of the increase in standard rate VAT before any further Finance Bill were brought before the House in the current Session. In that way, right hon. and hon. Members would be able to insist upon proper remedies for pensioners to protect them from VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para72"><a name="10071343000057">It is worth setting out what the Library has published. The overall effect of the Government's proposed VAT hike is that the revenue raised will increase from between Â£2.8 billion to Â£2.9 billion in the current financial year to Â£12.1 billion, Â£12.5 billion, Â£12.9 billion and Â£13.5 billion over the course of this Parliament. Using the Office for National Statistics' study of pensioners' share of spending, the Library estimates that this year-so, before pensions rise in April-Britain's pensioners will pay Â£422 million of extra VAT. That figure will then rise to Â£1.8 billion, Â£1.9 billion, Â£2 billion and Â£2 billion by the end of the Parliament. I think the House will agree that that is a serious hit on pensioners' fixed incomes.</p>

 My hon. Friend, from a sedentary position, is absolutely right. The Library produced exactly the kind of report that I have just set out, and-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> In the spirit of candour with which the question was asked, I note that there were serious mistakes with the way in which the 10p rate was changed, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), the former Prime Minister, has been very open about that. That is precisely why we need to learn lessons about the way in which tax policy and economic policy is conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para73"><a name="10071343000062">Generally the rule is, the more transparency, the better, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support our amendments, because the transparency at which he hints reveals a further problem in 2011. The Library states that in 2008 the typical household in the retired category spent Â£353.70 a week, and that the amount would rise to Â£358 after the VAT increase. That represents a rise in the VAT bill of about Â£4.30 a week. However, the rise per week in the basic state pension-delivered by the triple lock that was so trumpeted-is less than the increased shopping bill that pensioners will pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para74"><a name="10071343000063">I should also like to make a point about the following year, 2012, because the Chancellor did not present matters very clearly when he announced the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para75"><a name="10071343000064">Analysis shows that the Treasury's switch to using the lower-rising consumer prices index instead of the retail prices index to measure price rises means that pensioners' income will fall behind VAT-fuelled price rises in 2012. According to table C2 on page 84 of the Red Book, in 2012 RPI will be 3.2%, average earnings growth will be 2.3%, and CPI will be 1.9%. We can therefore assume that under the triple lock system, the pension increase will be only 2.5%-lower than VAT-fuelled RPI, which will be 3.2%. The increase in pensions will appear to fall behind the increase in prices.</p>

 I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman has paid attention to the report by the Office for National Statistics which says that CPI includes a higher proportion of the VAT increase than RPI because the CPI basket contains more goods on which VAT is paid.</p>

 That may or may not be the case. My point is that the Treasury has decided, without really publicising the fact, to switch the way that it measures price rises. A great fanfare was attached to the notion of the triple lock and raising pensions by prices, by average earnings or by 2.5%, whichever was higher. Somehow missing from that presentation, however, was an acknowledgment that RPI would be higher than any three of those measures in 2012, with the price being paid by Britain's pensioners.</p>

 A moment ago, the right hon. Gentleman described the effect that the increase in VAT would have on the increase in pensions. Does that include the freeze on council tax that this Government are bringing in, following huge rises in previous years, with rises in pensions being relatively small?</p>

The Library assesses that by 2013, pensioners could face cuts to disability living allowance benefits totalling an extraordinary Â£350 million a year. That is alongside cuts to housing benefit and the lower uprating of public service pensions and other benefits, which are now also linked to the lower-rising CPI rather than RPI. I accept that reforms to DLA are not yet clear, but we have to accept that Britain's pensioners face a new risk that has not yet been explained to this House. One million people of pension age are on DLA-they represent 34% of DLA recipients of all ages-so it is a risk that we in this House should demand we understand before changes are made.</p>

 Precisely. That is the point that Age UK made in its response to the Budget. It issued a stark warning saying that thousands of older people's lives would be at risk from even a 25% cut in local authority budgets; now we are warned by the Chief Secretary, with a casual disregard for the seriousness of the situation, that there could be cuts of 40%.</p>

If they are relaxed about the matter and truly believe that they have compensated pensioners fully for the rise in prices for which they are legislating, they should put the matter beyond doubt. They should show the House and the public beyond that the very people to whom we owe so much are protected from a measure that they did not vote for and that threatens the standard of life that they worked so hard and long to secure.</p>

The reason for our concern is that in the past, the Deputy Prime Minister has said that it is more liberal to tax people on their income than on their work.

My amendment 55 would provide for a two-year emergency period. I think it a reasonable assumption that the provision should at least contain a sunset clause, so that the Government can assess the impact of the measure on the economy, and recognise that it is an emergency measure brought forward in an emergency Budget in an emergency situation, and that we should have a knife and a time after which the situation can be reviewed.</p>

Friends in the Treasury and elsewhere are concerned that the impact of my probing inquiries and questions is effectively to unpick and therefore undermine the Budget, I apologise. However, I would like the Exchequer Secretary to address himself to the issue that I have raised and to the argument of those interrelationships, because at the end of the day-I have made this view clear in my contributions to this debate, and I know that many others across the House share it-of all the measures to restore the public finances, a VAT rise, it seems to me, has to be among the least welcome.</p>

 Is not the hon. Gentleman's point an illustration of the Government's approach in the Budget? The purpose of the Budget as a whole is to restore confidence, but it will do so only if harsh measures are implemented right across the board. Therefore, trying to unpick any of those harsh measures will undermine that confidence, as well as the objective that the Government have set themselves, which is to satisfy the financial markets. That is the difficulty with the Government's approach: it is all or nothing, because the measures have to be harsh enough to satisfy the financial markets.</p>

 I am a novice in Finance Bill debates and have not generally spoken in them in the past-I tend to go off and do international development, DEFRA issues and housing. I therefore do not necessarily feel qualified to make judgments about what type of measures-harsh or otherwise-are likely to have the most satisfactory impact on the markets. Others in the House will perhaps have more experience of how to satisfy the markets. My starting point is an assumption that, in its entirety, the bundle of proposed tax rises and public spending cuts in the Budget is at about the right level. The question that we should be debating is: have we got the measures right within that overall figure? That brings us to whether we have addressed the option of a VAT rise as opposed to, for example, an increase in the banking levy, or a further increase in capital gains tax or corporation tax.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the logic of his case. He has pinned the Government down on their branding of the Budget as an emergency Budget. If it is an emergency Budget, there should be room for manoeuvre and time-limiting. Perhaps the mirror image of this proposal is the reduction in VAT that the previous Government put in place to deal with a particular set of circumstances at an early point in the recession. The hon. Gentleman might be a novice in these matters, as he said earlier, but his logic is impeccable.</p>

The fact that all political parties were clearly under a degree of political pressure before the general election has been exposed by Lord Mandelson in his diaries, which were published in the last couple of days. We must acknowledge that any rise in VAT is the result of a really tough choice-a last resort, perhaps. One message to come out of this debate must surely be that when political leaders say they will not rule something out, particularly in the lead-up to a general election, the possibility of the measure being brought in after the election is usually rather higher than many members of the public might imagine. On this issue, Labour Members must be struggling to swallow, with all that butter not melting in their mouths.</p>

 On that point, the hon. Gentleman must surely accept that a pretty comprehensive tax plan was set out in the March Budget. We were seeking to raise an extraordinary amount of money-Â£19 billion is not small potatoes-and we set out specifically how much would come in through national insurance increases, how much through changing the tax treatment of pension contributions, and how much through putting taxes on incomes up and keeping them up, and taxing certain incomes at the 50p rate. Some of those measures have been kept, but those were not easy decisions to make. They were difficult decisions, but they did bring in Â£19 billion of income to the Exchequer.</p>

 I acknowledge that, but of all the tough decisions that we are talking about, a VAT rise is among the toughest. It is tougher than the ones proposed by the Labour Government in their pre-election Budget. It is a truism that Budgets brought forward just before a general election are rather different from those introduced just after an election, because of the political pressures under which Governments find themselves. That is just human nature-or perhaps political nature. The decent thing for Labour Members to do would be to acknowledge that.</p>

Actually, I got some assistants who are rather better than I am with these new-fangled devices called fingers to do those calculations. An increase of half a percentage point would yield Â£2.425 billion in 2011-12, and Â£2.5 billion in 2012-13. That is clearly way below the Government's estimate of the impact of the VAT rise. The ready reckoner gives figures of Â£12.125 billion and Â£12.5 billion, which suggests that it agrees with the Chancellor's estimates.

A more thoroughgoing impact assessment than has been available thus far would be enormously helpful, and I believe that a Government should carry out such an assessment in any case when a measure is going to have a significant impact on the country as a whole. Given that the increase will not be implemented until 4 January next year, perhaps the Exchequer Secretary will agree to do some further work on this. There is a balance of opinion that suggests that the VAT increase will be more regressive than progressive. That has been debated in the Red Book and by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, as well as by other well-informed, independent organisations. I hope that the Minister will address the issue of impact assessments that the shadow Chief Secretary has quite rightly raised.</p>

 I welcome many of the comments made by the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George) in speaking to his amendment 55.

them, I want to deal with amendment 22. The hon. Member for St Ives is right to highlight the fact that the coalition agreement referred to the greater use of sunset clauses in legislation, which would be a healthy thing particularly given the sheer impact such a massive financial change will have on the entire country. We are talking about Â£12 billion of tax taken from all our constituents, so at the very least we should have the opportunity to have the measure reviewed periodically by the Minister. I think that it would be appropriate to do so after a year, but after two years would be perfectly reasonable. For me, ratcheting up to a permanent 20% VAT rate is entirely unacceptable.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is an impact in Northern Ireland and in particular many of the boom towns around the border with the Irish Republic-Strabane, Newry, Enniskillen and so forth-of differential VAT rates? For an economy that is still not coming out of recession, a permanent increase in VAT will have a dramatic effect on retail jobs and investment for those towns especially.</p>

 Indeed; I have seen for myself the impact on those border areas. I am not sure that the Treasury, in applying its very blunt instrument approach to changing taxation, has given any serious consideration to these serious issues which will significantly affect communities, the retail industries and so forth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para97"><a name="10071352000006">It is necessary to reflect on whether raising VAT is the most effective way of reducing the deficit. We know that the Government have an arbitrary strategy, which is partly driven by ideology and a desire to reduce public spending as a proportion of our economy per se -disconnected entirely from the deficit and debt. They have set an arbitrary time scale and are doing it so steeply that it will affect not only public services but the taxpayer in a very harmful way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para98"><a name="10071352000007">We should not have a permanent imbalance between regressive and progressive taxation. I hope that when growth eventually returns to the economy, Treasury Ministers, Opposition spokespeople and others might be able to find better and fairer ways of raising revenue. The hon. Member for St Ives referred to the setting of the banking levy at a puny level and to giving corporation tax away to the banks. There are other sources of fairer revenue generation out there. It is not the case that Labour Members are saying no to all measures; there are alternatives, and it is crucial to bear that in mind.</p>

The Government are taking a big gamble in the choices that they are making. They must be seriously hoping that the economic cycle hits successfully by the time that we move into the next calendar year, because having such a big increase in taxation at that moment could jeopardise our already fragile growth record. More than that, we are already hearing from some members of the Monetary Policy Committee and others their worries and concerns about persistent inflation. VAT changes such as this will certainly do nothing to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para100"><a name="10071352000009">It would be good practice for Ministers generally to accept, or at least suggest, that reviews should be undertaken periodically.

that a re-authorisation request of some level should be part and parcel of the measure. Ministers should from time to time have to ask for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para101"><a name="10071352000010">I would not be surprised if the Government planned to ratchet up taxation early on in the Parliament to such a high degree-more than is necessary to satisfy the markets and so forth-so that in later years they can offer little tax give-aways and sprinkle a little bit of stardust on an unsuspecting electorate who will have forgotten about the VAT change. It is the Opposition's job to remind the general public that they will be paying through the nose for an ideologically oriented change. I therefore hope that hon.

 Does my hon. Friend also agree that the mechanics of raising and reducing value added tax is relatively straightforward, making a sunset clause quite easy to apply. It does not have the complications of other elements of the taxation system. Frankly, the previous Labour Government proved that it was possible to adjust VAT by lowering it and then increasing it at a future date. The mechanics of collection are more straightforward than for other taxes.</p>

 Absolutely. There is a sense that this ratcheting up might be for ever. Once the so-called emergency period is over, most sane and rational people would say, "Okay, the emergency is passing, so we should reduce sales tax down to some level of normalcy", but I would not expect that from the Treasury. This is the Treasury's opportunity to grab more money from the general public and to stay at that high level. I have heard nothing from the Government to suggest that this is a temporary measure. We therefore have no choice but to table suggestions that sunset clauses are necessary and incredibly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para102"><a name="10071352000013">Amendment 23 would retain the 17.5% rate on a certain class of goods and not raise it to 20%. I refer in particular to children's equipment-children's prams, cots, toys, high chairs, babies' bottles, children's sanitary products and teething-related goods. I declare an interest: I have a 10-month-old daughter. I am thus realising that while she is, of course, worth every penny, she is also an exceptionally expensive addition to my family. I am not complaining in any way about that, but it has brought home to me the sheer cost on families of raising youngsters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para103"><a name="10071352000014">Believe it or not, the Family and Parenting Institute has said that over a lifetime-up to the age of 21-each youngster can cost a family Â£200,000 to raise, which is about Â£800 a month. That is the institute's figure, and although I would not necessarily see its methodology I feel very much as if the expenditure is going in that direction. Even if just half that cost were VAT-able expenditure, over a lifetime the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition's change equates to Â£2,500 of extra tax per child. That is not to be sniffed at; it is a significant amount of money. It is not fair that families with young children should have to bear such a disproportionate burden of the deficit solution. As we know, the phrase "We're all in it together" does not apply to the bankers or the highest paid in society. The burden will hit those in the most difficult circumstances.</p>

 I have heard the hon. Gentleman espouse that rather spurious point before-and no doubt he will do so again. Of course, that is not a debt around their necks like a personal loan or a mortgage. It is part of the way in which we run our national accounts. Of course we will always require a level of borrowing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should avoid the need for any borrowing whatever, but at this point in the cycle, if we are to ensure that our economy succeeds, we must have a borrowing facility. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is wrong, that is his own ideological position. However, I think that it would be exceptionally regressive not just to freeze child benefit for three years, withdraw the health in pregnancy grant, restrict the maternity allowance to the first child, remove the baby component of child tax credit, reverse the supplement for children aged one and two and abolish the child trust fund, but to make young people and families with children bear the VAT increase as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para104"><a name="10071352000017">This is an extremely important and serious issue. Some areas of child-related expenditure are, of course, either zero-rated or rated at a low level. There is a drafting error in my amendment: I had originally included nappies, but on learning that they were classed as children's clothing, I withdrew the amendment. For some reason it has remained in the group, but the Minister will understand the point that I am making. There is a set of items that young families cannot do without, and I believe that alternative forms of revenue could compensate for tax on those. I seriously ask the Minister to consider making such an exemption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para105"><a name="10071352000018">The VAT increase will be very damaging in a more general sense. I worry not only about its inflationary impact, but about its recessionary impact. Given that it is equivalent to an income tax increase of about 3p, there is a serious possibility that we will end up with inflationary pressures and the return of higher interest rates. The hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) quoted Simon Newark of UHY Hacker Young as saying that the increase could push high street prices up by 2%, and that too is a serious issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para106"><a name="10071352000019">The impact on those at the other end of the age scale -pensioners-is also incredibly worrying. Whether it amounts to Â£8 billion, less or more, it will be very significant indeed. As well as having to finance the 25% reduction in their grant levels, those in charge of public services will have to fork out for this extra cost. I am particularly worried about the effect on the NHS and local government. Public spending on councils and the police, as well as some elements of spending on education, transport, housing and the construction industry, will not be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para107"><a name="10071352000020">The Government's desire to opt for this most regressive of taxation options led certain City commentators, such as Ian Kernohan of Royal London Asset Management, to observe that the increase would hit all income groups particularly hard in the winter months. Although many of our constituents may at this point be oblivious to the approach of the change because other events have been in the news, there is no doubt that a winter of discontent potentially awaits the Government.</p>

 There could be all sorts of perverse consequences. The ramifications have not been thought through. We know that the change is not necessary. We know that it has been driven by the Government's assumption that they must introduce it. As I have said, I believe that it has been driven first by an ideological desire to be exceptionally hair-shirted and stern with the deficit-unnecessarily, given that the markets would be entirely content with a slightly longer-profile reduction in the deficit, as long as it was being reduced-and secondly by a wish to stack up a bit of revenue for a give-away further down the line.</p>

 Not necessarily. Labour Members are currently having to adjust to being in opposition after 13 years in government. No doubt the parliamentary Labour party will set up Back-Bench committees like the Conservative party's 1922 committee. The Conservatives have a long tradition of establishing Back-Bench committees to examine different aspects of policy so that they can better advise their colleagues in government. We are having to make the same adjustment, and my role is to chair the Back-Bench Liberal Democrat committee that deals with economic matters, including taxation and expenditure.</p>

How they set their prices has as much to do with fraud at the till, marketing and advertising, for instance. Although there was a VAT reduction two years ago, when we did our Christmas shopping at that time many of us did not notice that it had gone down from 17.5% to 15%, because shopkeepers kept their prices the same, as they were already discounting in order to counter the recession and attract sales.

 I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention, but perhaps she misunderstood the point I was making. Altering the VAT rate obviously has an impact on the wider economy and on Government finances, but claims as to which specific groups of people it would hit in particular are hard to prove in advance of the change. Many of the predictions of price increases-in rural shops in Scotland or elsewhere-may not come to pass, simply because retailers will have to take other considerations into account, such as the effect on their trade.

I remember them cheering the cut in capital gains tax-now, of course, they say they are against it-which was being paid for by the poorest in society. This Government-this Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition-are protecting the lowest-paid in society and taking them out of income tax, rather than increasing the rate they pay.</p>

There was also the important issue of the construction industry and whether it was right that VAT be charged in full on the repair and maintenance of housing stock-most of our housing stock is old-yet be zero-rated on the construction of new dwellings.

fall. This Budget, put together by a coalition, by a new mode of politics, has struck that balance fairly. Some of the decisions within the Budget would be unpalatable on their own, but they are not being taken on their own. The VAT increase is not a measure in isolation, but one we must contemplate in the context of the rest of the Budget. That is why my colleagues and I will resist these amendments if they are pressed to a vote.</p>

 I will be brief. This morning, I was in the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff bay and I had discussions with Jane Hutt, the Welsh Assembly Government Finance Minister. I was delighted that this afternoon, a statement was made in which the Welsh Assembly Government addressed the situation in which they find themselves in the light of the Budget. Jane Hutt made it clear that the Welsh Assembly Government intend to protect capital investment in Wales, because money is being brought forward from the Assembly Government's reserve fund. The result is that a number of capital projects that had been earmarked for being cut or delayed will now continue. The Welsh Government's economic rationale for taking that approach is that it allows effective support to be given to the construction sector and to the continuing efforts to lead Wales into economic recovery. I welcome that. Of course Labour is still in power in Wales, albeit in partnership. That approach is in stark contrast to what is happening in England, where the economic rationale is profoundly different-indeed, there is no rationale at all.</p>

Members have made the point that in the run-up to the general election both the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats made a number of commitments about not having plans to introduce VAT increases. They recognised that VAT was regressive and that it hit the poorest the hardest-the words of the now Deputy Prime Minister. The biscuit was really taken by the poster to which a number of hon. Members have referred. We all remember that; indeed we will never forget it, and neither will the people of this country.

 That is a very important point, and it embellishes the one that I have made in general terms. Labour Members are concerned that the fight against child poverty, which needs to continue, will take a backward step. As has been mentioned, we also have concerns about the need to protect our senior citizens. The shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury outlined clearly how our senior citizens are facing real difficulties from the cumulative effect of a number of measures introduced in the Budget, which hit them hard. I am concerned that when the dust settles again and we see the new plans for disability living allowance, a total of Â£350 million a year could, by the end of this Parliament, be taken off the benefits available for senior citizens. That is a cause of concern to us all.</p>

I refer specifically to recent research commissioned by Kelkoo, an internet comparison site, and carried out by the Centre for Retail Research, which indicated that as many as 47,000 jobs could be lost and almost 10,000 stores right across the country could be closed.</p>

 I am conscious that the Government argument is that the VAT rise was an alternative to a national insurance rise, which they characterised as the tax on jobs. Does my hon. Friend share my disappointment that the Chancellor did not take advantage of the reduced rate of VAT that is allowed for labour-intensive industries under existing EU rules? The Government could have reduced the rate for places such as hairdressers and restaurants-low-paid labour-intensive industries-which would have helped these people through a difficult patch. In effect, the Government have done the opposite, and they are going to put these people out of business and cost us the jobs accordingly.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman recognise what happened when the previous Government, to whom he belonged at the time, reduced VAT? Rather than target the reduction, as they were exhorted to do at the time, they applied it across the board. They could have targeted the construction industry, for example, so that extensions to homes and so on could have been encouraged. For some reason, both the Labour Government and this coalition Government seem not to be prepared to target VAT changes.</p>

 With all due respect, I say that it is far simpler and more straightforward for an across-the-board, blanket reduction to be introduced. Objective analysis tends to suggest that the kind of approach that the former Labour Government had in ensuring that that reduction in VAT was part of a coherent fiscal stimulus was certainly effective. I also ask the Committee to bear in mind that we are now talking about a VAT increase that takes us a great deal beyond the rates that we were talking about only a few months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para131"><a name="10071352000089">In conclusion, this is a profoundly regressive Budget. One of its most negative elements is the VAT increase. There is undoubtedly objective evidence to show that it will hit the poorest and most vulnerable members of society hardest, and at the very least the Government should accept that there is a need for a full-scale study into this, as it applies to children, especially, and to elderly people. I respectfully ask the Government to consider their position carefully.</p>

 The debate has been going on for some time and many have argued-the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury can be mentioned here-that there is not a person in the House who wants to see the poorest in society hit. That is true, and I would be amazed if there was an hon. Member in the House who deliberately set out to target people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="100713-0002.htm_para132"><a name="10071352000091">Budgets have to be seen as an overall package, and I have been amazed at how the VAT rise has been picked on as a major catastrophe for the country. The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr David) made some interesting points about whether the increase could be phased in for different areas or for different construction industries. That was not done by the previous Government when they raised the rate back to 17.5%. As he said, there was a blanket reduction to 15% and then it all went back up to 17.5%, and those things were not taken into account. The important point that the Committee has to recognise is that although people say this is a political choice, it comes as part of the overall package of the Budget. The overall package of the Budget must not be forgotten; it aimed to try to reduce the risk of interest rates increasing as things come down. That point has been argued across this Chamber many times. Opposition Members disagree on whether interest rates should go up, but there seems to be a lot of evidence that if the deficit was not tackled-</p>

If the Scottish National party tabled an amendment to cut the grant to Scotland under the Barnett formula by that Â£12 billion to Â£13 billion, that amendment would have support from many Members and would avoid the need for the VAT rise.

This can be checked in <i> Hansard</i>, but from memory I am sure I recall the Chancellor of the Exchequer telling the House quite clearly that a move would take place from the consumer prices index to the retail prices index when he made that announcement. I do not think that it was in the small print-I am sure that the Chancellor stood at the Dispatch Box and made that point quite clear.

So far, in the debates about the cutting of the schools budget we have been told that it is all terrible and that we should have carried on spending more and more money, and today we are hearing that we should not increase taxes.

 A point made clearly in the debate by a great many people is that each time a Budget comes to the House, the taxation system can be looked at and changed. This Budget tackles today's problems: if deficits fall, revenues are there and the balance comes in, we can look to changing that approach. Looking back into the mists of time, people forget that over the 18 years of the last Conservative Government, taxation was reduced overall, but in the early part, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, taxation had to rise to tackle the deficit. As time moved on and circumstances allowed, overall taxation on people was reduced. The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point, but we would need to consider matters as each Budget came forward. This is the first Budget of a five-year Parliament, and it set out to tackle a specific issue.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a very important point that I tried to make earlier. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Caerphilly to ask why the VAT rise is not different for different areas-perhaps less for the construction industry-but when it went from 15% to 17.5%, it was a blanket policy that hit everywhere.

Some of the amendments might have value on their own, but, looking at the bigger picture, I do not believe that they would add value or do anything to reduce the deficit that the country now faces.</p>

Given that those in the bottom 10% of income distribution earn on average Â£190 a week and already struggle to make ends meet, that Â£5 a week reduction in their incomes will inevitably hit families and pensioners, plunging more of them into poverty. In contrast, those who are fortunate enough to be in the top 10% of income distribution will experience a mere 0.7% fall in their weekly incomes. As their average income is about Â£1,600 a week, I suspect that a reduction of Â£11 will be somewhat more manageable to them than the reduction in weekly income will be to those in the poorest decile of income distribution.</p>

In March, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced a Budget that included Â£19 billion-worth of tax increases and Â£38 billion-worth of spending cuts. With those tax increases, those in the bottom 10% of income distribution experienced not the 2.6% reduction in their incomes that will be the effect of this Government's Budget, but a 0% reduction. In contrast, those in the top 10% experienced not a 0.7% reduction in their incomes, as they will under this Budget, but a 6.8% reduction.

 Does my hon. Friend recall that when the Tories doubled VAT in the long distant past some members of the Tory party had the guts to vote against the decision?

 My hon. Friend makes a telling point. I shall come back to the Liberal Democrats and the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. I am sorry that he is not in his place. It would be interesting to hear him defend what he said. It was put to him by Andrew Marr on the BBC, "How is it that your party fought the election opposed to VAT and now you are in a coalition which is increasing VAT?" It is something that the Tories always do because they want to take money from the poor to give to the rich, which is what VAT effectively does, as we will see. He was asked if he was embarrassed by his party's election posters. We have seen the poster this evening in the House. As reported in the <i> Daily Mail</i>, the Secretary of State responded:</p>
<a name="100713-0003.htm_brev5"><a name="10071353000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We were only trying to score a point against the Conservatives, if you like. Okay, well that was in the election. We have now moved past the election."</p>

I do not know whether it is parliamentary language for me to say it, but he himself said that he deceived the public as part of the game. I do not regard politics or elections as a game. I believe you should do as you say, and say as you do. That is how I was brought up in Yorkshire. I thought the Lib Dems aspired to the values of progressive politics. The saintly Vince-as he was then being called-could have said that circumstances had changed, but for him to say that it was perfectly okay to practise a deception on the electorate in the run-up to the election and then to reverse his position afterwards is hardly saintly, to say the least. I am sure that is something that can be said in a parliamentary context.</p>

 Of course, and I shall come to that point. During my long sojourn on the Back Bench this afternoon, I have had several visits from my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie) who is watching me carefully so I shall try to be as brief as I can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para18"><a name="10071353000036">Several Lib Dem coalition partners made the case that it was now possible to reverse their position.

Each of those arguments is incorrect.</p>

 With his characteristic Yorkshire approach, the hon. Gentleman says that politicians should do as they say and say as they do. On that basis, will he be encouraging the shadow Chancellor to be honest with the House, and with him, and say that he made proposals to raise VAT to 18 or 19%, not just once but twice? That was his favoured remedy for the difficulties the country faced over the last year.</p>

<p><a name="st_o389"><a name="10071353000038"><a name="100713-0003.htm_spnew29"><a name="10071353000072"><b>Jon Trickett:</b>
 I shall answer that point specifically because I believe in being honest. For the last two years I worked in No. 10 and I can say that all kinds of options were reviewed, but at the end of the day the Government took the collective view that it would not be right to raise VAT. That was the decision they made. The then Chancellor said in the House, when he was making last year's pre-Budget report, that he had looked at the VAT option and rejected it. I remind the House that no Labour Government have ever increased VAT. We stand on our record. The reason was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton who pointed out how regressive VAT is.</p>

 In answer to the Liberal Democrats, it is not what Governments consider but what they do and what they vote for that counts. The increase in VAT will hurt the poorest in our communities. Furthermore, to return to my hon. Friend's point about the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, when the right hon. Gentleman told Andrew Marr that he was making a political point, the corollary is that he knew he was saying something untrue when he opposed the VAT increase during the election.</p>

 I follow my hon. Friend quite a lot of the way, but we have to be careful about suggesting that the Secretary of State knew something was untrue. However, he appeared to say in that interview that he had misled the electorate and that it was perfectly okay for the Lib Dems to do so because after the election a new world would be entered into.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para19"><a name="10071353000041">As has been mentioned several times, the Library confirms how regressive-that is, unfair-VAT is. How can the Secretary of State argue in this place and elsewhere that he decided to vote for the Budget as a package because it introduced fairness when the House of Commons Library shows that all serious economists accept that VAT is a regressive tax? It falls twice as heavily on the poorest deciles as on the richest. I wanted to speak briefly about the situation for students, but given the time I simply note the fact that students and others on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, will suffer greatly as a result of the VAT increases they will face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para20"><a name="10071353000042">I have three further points. First, every increase in VAT produces an increase in inflation. If there is to be a proper impact assessment, we must look at the effect of VAT on inflation. Most economists agree that inflation will rise by about 2% as a result of the VAT rise. If the Government increase inflation by 2%, even if there was no other inflation in the economy, they will be in breach of Monetary Policy Committee guidelines. However, we know that there is already inflation in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para21"><a name="10071353000043">An increase in VAT, with the corollary that inflation will rise well above 2 %, will lead to interest rate rises, which will begin to squeeze away any recovery in the economy that we all hope is coming. The British Retail Consortium said that there will be job losses, company bankruptcies and unemployment as a direct result of the inflation caused by the VAT rise. Moreover, the fact that demand of up to Â£13.5 billion will be taken out of the economy as a consequence of the VAT rises will produce further unemployment problems. If the level of aggregate demand is reduced there will inevitably be unemployment. Most economists predict that between 180,000 and 220,000 jobs will probably be lost as a consequence of the VAT rise and the reduction of demand in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para22"><a name="10071353000044">Finally, this VAT rise is wholly unnecessary. It does not contribute in any way to the reduction of the deficit. As we know, the VAT hike will take Â£13.45 billion by its final year, 2014-15. If the measure was being used to take money out of the economy to help the deficit, one could understand it, but the same Budget hands out money in tax cuts as follows: there will be reductions in corporation tax and in small business profits tax, an increase in the employers' national insurance contribution threshold, increases in personal allowances for income tax, adjustments for basic rate and upper earnings limits and a council tax freeze. All those tax give-aways add up to Â£12.37 billion-almost the same amount as will be raised through the VAT rise. The truth is that the measure is not in any way about reducing the deficit; it is about tax give-aways to the Tories' friends-the richer people in our society. The VAT rise is exposed for what it is: a regressive tax, taking money from the whole economy to bolster the Tories' friends in business and the 22 millionaires who sit around the Cabinet table. No doubt many people on the wealthier side of the divide in this country are rubbing their hands in glee.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury said at the start of the debate that clause 3 goes right to the heart of the Budget, and I entirely agree. It is also, effectively, a signature measure from this Tory Government, inasmuch as it exemplifies their ability to break the promises they made before the election and is pretty heartless in its targeting, through its regressive measures, of the poorest and the most vulnerable in our society-and all without any sort of mandate, given that they did not put the measure before the people of the country during the election.</p>

hit by the VAT increase. I do not intend to talk about all six areas, partly because my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves) spoke so eloquently about the most important of those sectors-the poorest, the most vulnerable and the people on low incomes in our society. They are the people who will be hardest hit by the increase in VAT, and they are the people who matter most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para24"><a name="10071359000003">I want to address the specific issue in respect of the NHS. Quite often it is thought that the NHS is immune from VAT rises because it can recover VAT on many items, but I think I can show that the NHS-one of those areas that are hugely important to the most vulnerable people in our society and that has a fragile budget-will be hit by the VAT rise. One of the Prime Minister's promises before the election, in addition to promising not to put up VAT-a broken promise-was that he would cut the deficit, not the NHS. In reality, the VAT rise, which will impact on the NHS, is a real-terms, de facto cut in the budgets of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para25"><a name="10071359000004">Crucially, although the NHS can reclaim VAT in some areas of spending such as direct medical services and what are called contracted-out services, which are dealt with under the contracted-out services provision, not all areas are subject to the contracted-out services provision. The King's Fund calculates that the VAT rise will cost the NHS Â£250 million to Â£300 million per annum, and, more specifically, in answer to a parliamentary question tabled at the Scottish Parliament, we heard from Nicola Sturgeon, the Minister responsible for the NHS, that she anticipated the VAT rise costing Â£25 million per annum, which is clearly in line with the Â£250 million to Â£300 million that we can anticipate for the UK as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para26"><a name="10071359000005">That estimate of extra cost is predicated on the fact that the NHS has to pay VAT on purchasing, for example, a new MRI scanner, if it is for clinical purposes-that is, unless it is designed specifically for research purposes. A fully equipped ambulance now costs an NHS trust about Â£225,000, to which the VAT increase will add Â£6,000. A CT body scanner, which costs Â£700,000, will cost Â£17,500 more. Locum doctors, who are widely used in the NHS, are another service on which the NHS cannot reclaim the VAT. So each NHS trust in the UK will have to pay an additional Â£75,000-about Â£3 million across the NHS-for the use of locum services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para27"><a name="10071359000006">Why does that matter? It matters, as I said, because it is a genuine increase in costs for the NHS and it is not accounted for in the current payment to the NHS. Government also often respond to this line of inquiry-</p>

 We have heard this argument a lot today and, yes, VAT, having gone down to 15% as part of the fiscal stimulus, did go back up to the level at which it had sat-17.5%. However, many Labour Members have made it very clear indeed that VAT was not put up-apart from when it returned to a pre-set level having gone down-under any previous Labour Government, where a successive Tory Government, on assuming office, put up VAT. It is the Tories' stock in trade. It is what we expect, and it is what we got.</p>

 I wish to speak to a number of the amendments, and the ground has been fairly well covered on many of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para29"><a name="10071359000013">In an intervention I referred to the Treasury document "Tax Policy Making" that was published on the same day as the Budget.

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para31"><a name="10071359000015">I quoted from three key paragraphs of that paper on tax policy, which suggested that there should be more effective scrutiny of tax legislation, that a tailored tax impact assessment would replace the current regulatory impact assessment and that the Government would consider greater use of sunset clauses, or a trigger for an evaluation in legislation. Quite a number of the amendments propose sunset clauses, triggers for evaluation or impact assessments. On that basis, I would have thought that Ministers could accept amendments 55 and 22, tabled by the hon. Members for St Ives and for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie), which propose different sunset clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para32"><a name="10071359000016">The hon. Member for St Ives chose a two-year period for his sunset clause. I pointed out in an intervention that it just happened that two years was the period that the Government had used for their assessment of the impact of the tax changes on families and households. Two years is also, of course, the period of the public sector pay freeze, so if the public sector pay freeze is part of the emergency period and defines the emergency period of the Budget, surely there is a case to argue that if this is an emergency increase in VAT that has to be undertaken to get revenue in now, to help reduce the deficit, it should similarly be time-limited.</p>

Back-Bench committee. No doubt when this twilight zone rule is worked out, we shall find out more. He was confident enough that because there would be Finance Bills every year, this measure would be subject to change and review, but that is not what the Chancellor told us in the Budget statement. In referring to the increase in VAT to 20%, he said:</p>
<a name="100713-0003.htm_brev7"><a name="10071359000053"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This single tax measure will by the end of this Parliament generate over Â£13 billion a year of extra revenues."-[<i> Official Report</i>, 22 June 2010; Vol. 512, c. 177.]</p>

Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) argued that VAT is more progressive than income tax because only 50% of goods are subject to VAT. That is a completely new argument, even for the Tories. Of course, as other hon. Members have said, if people believe that the increase to 20% will reduce the deficit and be benign in its progressive impact, why stop at 20%? Why not continue much higher? That is the nonsense that we are being treated to.</p>

In an earlier intervention, my colleague, the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), said that all Governments should make much more selective use of the menu of VAT rates, which they could apply to certain services to help to stimulate construction and other sectors. All of us hoped that the Government would continue that in future, rather than just locking on to the relentless pursuit of keeping VAT high for now and for good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para37"><a name="10071359000021">The hon. Member for St Ives also questioned the difficulty caused by the fact that the Treasury and Whips tell Members that we cannot change part of the Budget because the whole thing is a package. After we heard the Budget statement, we debated a number of resolutions. Some Members voted for some of them and against others, and other Members abstained. Those resolutions are all different, and they must all be taken differently. This proposal comes to us in the form of a Finance Bill. Members have the right to seek amendments on specific measures because of their impact. Labour Front Benchers have tabled amendments that would require clear impact assessments before changes can come into effect. That is logically consistent with what the Government said in their paper, "Tax Policy Making: a new approach", so why should it not happen?</p>

During the debate, Members on both sides have traded points about the fact that there is a basic dishonesty and self-delusion and self-deception in some of the positions that are being adopted. It does nothing for the credibility of the political process when we can all point out the inconsistencies in one another's position. That just adds to the credibility deficit in the political process, whatever we say about trying to cope with the national deficit.</p>

asked, when exactly was the moment of conversion. The Liberal Democrats have not undergone the only conversion; we now hear Tory Members seeing many merits in the measures in the Budget that they had previously denounced, rejected and campaigned against. We now have more Government Members on more roads to Damascus than does the Syrian bus fleet.

Gentleman's mind. Of course, that is the same Governor of the Bank of England whom the right hon.

Many people said that that would have an adverse impact on the poor, but the then Chancellor said, "No, bunkum. That's not what the Treasury figures show." Many Labour Members were bamboozled into accepting that, simply because they were told that it was part of a package and that, if they voted against it, the whole thing would fall apart. However, those who said that it was wrong and challenged it were right, and they were vindicated and proved to be right. That was Parliament working properly.</p>

I hope that he will accept the fact that the coalition Government involves two very distinct parties and that we have to have that debate publicly; that is part of the new politics.</p>

 I accept that the hon. Gentleman is wrestling with his conscience, but the bets are that it will be a draw. We remember the explicit terms in which people talked about VAT increases. The leader of the Liberal Democrats specifically campaigned strongly against VAT increases and particularly fingered another party on that basis and spelled out that it was a regressive tax. He was right then; he is wrong now to pretend that it is not a regressive tax that will clearly have an impact on the poor-not just on the existing poor, but on the new poor created in the context of the Budget and the current financial outlook.</p>

People on public sector incomes above Â£21,000 will face a pay freeze-that is a pay cut in real terms-and we know from what has been said in the Budget that many people on benefits will either find them capped or themselves dumped off benefits. In those circumstances, not just the existing poor, but the new, additional poor will suffer. If we consider the Budget as a package, we must think about those sides of the package as well, not just the Lib Dem accessories that they are proud of in the Budget, such as the increase in personal allowances and so on. The total impact needs to be remembered, and that is what most of these amendments are getting at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para43"><a name="10071359000029">Of course, there is a clear, absolute overriding amendment, which has not been tabled as a probing amendment. It is amendment 13, tabled by the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie). Just as many Labour Members have criticised Lib Dem Members and questioned their credibility, given what they campaigned on, and challenged Tory Members as well, I have to tell my Labour friends that, if they want to be credible in the criticisms and attacks that they are making on the Lib Dems, they will vote for amendment 13.</p>

 I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in support of amendment 13, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) on behalf of the Plaid Cymru-Scottish National party group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para44"><a name="10071359000031">Our opposition to the increase in the standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 20% from January stems from two key reasons-one social and one economic. On the social front, there is little doubt that VAT is a regressive tax. As the excellent Library paper on this specific emergency Budget proposal indicated, the poorest in society spend 18% of their disposable income on VAT, while the richest spend about 10%. For the poorest in society, VAT is more likely to hit necessary spending, but as one gets richer VAT costs tend to hit discretionary spending, and that is a very important distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para45"><a name="10071359000032">The increase in VAT will also leave people on fixed incomes terribly exposed. The Budget included real-terms cuts in benefits payments, given the change from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index for the calculation of benefit increases. Only today, we saw the levels of RPI at 5% and of CPI at 3.2%. The people dependent on welfare payments therefore face an unwelcome double whammy on their incomes, affecting their purchasing power-a theme to which I shall return later in my contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para46"><a name="10071359000033">There is always a lag between the human cost of a recession and the end of an economic downturn, so placing further pressure on the very people who are the true victims of the banking crisis by hitting their disposable income seems callous. Indeed, the VAT increase could actually deepen the human cost of the recession as social problems such as personal debt increase. For those of us on the left of the political spectrum, the steep VAT increase in the Bill, and its disproportionate effect on the poorest in society, contrasts with the treatment of the banking and economic elite, who have had a far easier ride in the emergency Budget. Social justice would demand that those responsible for the economic recession-with their irresponsible behaviour-and the subsequent budget deficit, which fixates the  <br>

new UK Government, should pay more than their fair share. Although the VAT increase will raise Â£13.5 billion, the bankers will be subject to a feeble banking levy of Â£2 billion per annum when it reaches its full force-with its effect wiped out by the changes to corporation tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para47"><a name="10071359000034">I deal now with the economic argument against the VAT increase in the Bill. VAT is essentially a tax on consumption. Considering that economic growth over the past decade was largely driven by consumer spending, resulting personal debt levels in the UK rocketing to the equivalent of 100% of gross value added, at Â£1.4 trillion, there is a medium to long-term economic case for addressing that unsustainable situation by reducing the dependence on retail spending in the economy and promoting production and manufacturing. Indeed, debt charities such as Citizens Advice report that the debt problems they deal with continue to increase as the human cost of the recession feeds into the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para48"><a name="10071359000035">My preference would be to change the banking code and make it more difficult for lenders to seduce consumers into debts that they cannot service, rather than directly reducing the purchasing powers of individuals via the use of VAT. However, the major issue faced by the economy is a lack of demand. Growth in consumer spending will be the key if the UK Government are to reach the economic growth forecasts they have set in order to achieve their fiscal consolidation targets. The eminent economist David Blanchflower has argued that the Budget's VAT proposals will stymie the consumer-led growth on which it depends. The increase will also hit small businesses, which are the backbone of the economy in constituencies such as mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para49"><a name="10071359000036">Importantly, the increase in VAT will also hit the public sector at a time when UK Government Departments are being asked to make swingeing cuts to their budgets. I should be very interested to learn whether the Treasury has calculated the effect of the VAT increase on the budgets of the devolved Administrations, and whether any consideration of the VAT increase has been made, given the stringent financial situation that the devolved Governments now face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para50"><a name="10071359000037">Furthermore, <i> T</i><i> he Guardian</i> estimated over the weekend that charities could face additional costs of Â£150 million pounds per annum as a result of the VAT increase. Considering that they are the very bodies that will bear the brunt of dealing with the human cost of the economic downturn, I must note that slapping an extra bill on the activities of those vital life-support organisations is a very worrying indirect consequence of the proposal. For those reasons I urge the Committee to support amendment 13 when we vote later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para51"><a name="10071359000043">This has been a good debate. I know that the amendments have been grouped in a certain way because of how they interrelate, but none the less, having heard the debate and the contributions of right hon. and hon. Members, we will seek to divide the Committee on amendments 41 and 46, as well as on clause 3. I think that we will turn to amendment 35 in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para52"><a name="10071359000044">This has been an important debate, because we have seen with greater clarity where not only Conservative but Liberal Democrat Members stand on the issue before us. However, the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George), looking at tax policy in the round, was right to say that the VAT rise has to be-in his words, I think-among the least welcome alternative proposals. He did not want to be drawn into the Chancellor's wider fiscal judgment, and that was unfortunate; instead, the hon. Gentleman wanted to debate the balance of measures in the Budget, and he sought a different balance. He could have made more of the fact that the Budget hits growth in this country so hard that an extra Â£9 billion of tax has to be raised to make up for lost growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para53"><a name="10071359000045">The hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams), confused us-perplexed us, slightly. I was not sure whether he was elected, appointed or anointed to the position from which he spoke, but he confirmed that he was speaking on economic affairs on behalf of Liberal Democrat Back Benchers, rather than Front Benchers. I was not sure whether that was a device for saying one thing and doing another, but he rapidly disabused us of that with his support for the Government's case. His was a strange argument, because he said he would not support our amendments to protect pensioners and others, as somehow our arguments lacked moral force. So there we have it: the party of Lloyd George is now so empty of moral momentum that it has to look to the Labour party for its source of ethical locomotion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para54"><a name="10071359000046">We heard some powerful speeches from Opposition Back Benchers. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) underlined the point that the Budget does not share out the pain, and that those with children, in particular, will be hit very hard. He was right to highlight the commentary in the City outlining the hit that retailers will take, and he had a very good phrase: VAT will be both regressive and regrettable. That is a good conclusion to our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para55"><a name="10071359000047">My hon. Friend's speech was echoed well by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves), whose constituents, she said, earn just Â£16,000 a year. They will be hit very hard by this Budget, and that particular unfairness was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith), who made an excellent point about the problem of irrecoverable VAT and how it will hit the national health service. My hon. Friends the Members for Caerphilly (Mr David) and for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) also made excellent arguments about the hit on jobs. Of course, there has been some confusion about that from Government sources over the past couple of weeks, but the bottom line is pretty clear: employment will be much lower as a result of this Budget, in contrast with previous Budgets. The IMF, if we needed any help reinforcing the point, backed up that argument earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para56"><a name="10071359000048">We are having this debate ultimately because of the Chancellor's wrong-headed decision on the fiscal judgment. The Budget was so damaging that his own independent  <br>

advisers told him that they had no choice but to downgrade the country's growth forecast, and the IMF rapidly followed suit. Just when Britain needed a Budget to speed up the recovery or, at the very least, maximise its certainty, we were given a Budget that actually slowed the recovery down. The reason we were given was the strange behaviour in the markets, but in fact interest rates and long-term bond yields had been falling for some time before the election. This Budget entirely ignores that point. It hits growth so hard that it has to raise extra taxes, and that is before we address the impact on jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para57"><a name="10071359000049">We are still trying to get to the bottom of the changes to how the OBR forecasts job losses, but the Red Book's judgment was grim enough: 100,000 fewer people will be in work as a result of this Budget. That is because the Conservatives have reverted to type and decided that, just as in the 1990s, 1980s and 1930s, unemployment is a price worth paying. It is only a shame that the Liberal Democrat party-the party of Keynes-has abandoned its intellectual heritage and signed up to the economic doctrine of Lord Lamont, the man who famously sang in his bath as unemployment spiralled, "Je ne regrette rien."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para58"><a name="10071359000050">All this follows from one decision-that of the Chancellor to bring forward by just a year the date at which debt as a proportion of GDP begins to fall. The price of that is a Â£40 billion increase in taxes and spending. It means that the Chancellor is now relying on a growth strategy for the next few years that is quite unlikely to come to pass. He has not hedged his bets; he has decided to hit domestic demand and consumption as hard as he possibly can. He is, I am afraid, going for broke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para59"><a name="10071359000051">That is why we object so strenuously to clause 3.

 In his Budget of 22 June, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced that the standard rate of VAT would increase from 17.5% to 20% on 4 January 2011. Clause 3 and schedule 2 effect this change. In the course of this afternoon, we have had a good and lengthy debate. Several hon. Members have spoken to amendments that would either cancel the rate rise entirely or reduce its effects. Of course, we understand hon. Members' concerns about the impact of this change on low-income households. I therefore propose to reiterate our reasons for taking this path, in the course of which I will deal with the various amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para60"><a name="10071361000002">Before doing so, it is necessary to point out that the VAT rise was one of the central measures in the emergency Budget-a Budget made necessary because the coalition Government have inherited from their predecessors the largest budget deficit of any economy in Europe with the single exception of the Republic of Ireland. The independent OBR's pre-Budget forecast revealed that the structural deficit-the part of the deficit that will not go away with the recovery-was higher than previously thought, at around Â£12 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, higher in 2011-12. That means that Â£1 in every Â£4 we spend is  <br>

being borrowed. The gap stands at Â£149 billion for this financial year alone, yet the previous Government left us with no credible plans to reduce their record deficit. The OBR forecast that, if we had continued with the previous Government's plans, debt repayments would reach more than Â£67 billion by 2014-15-more than is currently spent on defence or on schools in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para61"><a name="10071361000003">Nothing at this time is more urgent for Britain than setting out a tough but realistic plan that demonstrates how we will regain control of the public finances. We have literally no other option. The Government are therefore taking urgent action to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit as a necessary precondition for sustained economic growth. High levels of public debt could lead to a loss of market confidence and higher interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for families and businesses and discouraging investment and consumer spending. To continue with the existing fiscal plans would put the recovery at risk, given the scale of the challenge and the risk posed by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.</p>

It is necessary to look at this VAT measure in the context of the overall Budget measures. It is not possible to remove it, because the central message of the Budget was that we have a Government who are willing to get to grips with the deficit and to bring our borrowing down, and if we are to address that quickly it is necessary to move forward with the VAT increase.</p>

 I understand that hard decisions need to be taken. Last night, when the Financial Secretary spoke to the British Bankers Association, he mentioned a new initiative-a proposed additional levy on banks in respect of their bonuses and profits. Does the Exchequer Secretary know what that might yield? I am sure that many of us in this House would prefer to see those who contributed most to getting us into this difficulty doing most to help us to get out of it, rather than levying rises in VAT.</p>

 I assure my hon. Friend that this Government are determined to raise as much as possible from the banking sector. He makes the very good point that it is right that those who got us into this mess should contribute significantly to getting us out of it. However, we need to move quickly to provide reassurance to international investors that the UK is a safe place in which to do business and that we will not be caught up in a sovereign debt contagion. His point is well made, but we still have no choice in needing to raise substantial sums of revenue in a certain way.</p>

Further spending cuts would have made it impossible for the Government to protect the country's most essential services in the spending review. It is notable that, in the past couple of days, two of the candidates for the leadership of the Labour party have suggested that the previous Government's own plans on cutting spending went too far.

looked more at raising taxes. I see no appetite on the Labour Benches for more spending cuts. The only other option would have been to raise taxes on corporate profits or on personal income, reducing the rewards for work at a time when hard work and endeavour must lead the recovery and ensure that we have a private sector-led recovery. We need to reduce the deficit in a sustainable way that does least damage to growth. While the bulk of the deficit reduction will come from spending, tax also has an important part to play.</p>

One argument made for the temporary VAT cut by the previous Government was that it would shift expenditure into the relevant year, 2009, when the VAT rate was somewhat lower, and therefore accelerate the recovery. If we did the reverse of that and had a sunset clause, essentially setting out plans to increase VAT but with a promise that we would then reduce it, it would have the reverse effect. It would defer expenditure, which would damage the recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para73"><a name="10071361000019">I note the point made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) about the Government's views on sunset clauses. The tax policy document that we produced is very good and has been well received, but the arguments for a sunset clause in the case of a rate change are not very persuasive, particularly given the economic effects that it would have.</p>

 The premise behind my amendments was that, as this is an emergency Budget, the VAT rise must be an emergency measure, which must surely be time-limited. Can the Exchequer Secretary confirm to the House that there is no intention of retaining the 2.5% rise for all the coming years of this Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="st_o412"><a name="10071361000021"><a name="100713-0003.htm_spnew49"><a name="10071361000495"><b>Mr Gauke:</b>
 We have announced the policy and the increase. All taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and that will obviously be the position with VAT. However, for the reasons that I have set out, it would not be sensible to have a sunset clause. It would have a damaging effect on the pattern of expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para74"><a name="10071361000022">Underpinning the Government's approach is a commitment to fairness. Consequently, the VAT increase will apply only to the standard rate, ensuring that the zero rate is maintained on everyday essentials such as food and children's clothing, and that the 5% rate on domestic fuel and power stays in place. It is also part of a wider Budget package in keeping with the Government's commitment to tackle the deficit while protecting the most vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para75"><a name="10071361000023">The VAT charge is part of a fair and progressive Budget, and the wider package contains a number of measures specifically intended to help the most vulnerable, in particular the increase in personal allowances by Â£1,000, the triple lock for increases in the basic state pension and the above-indexation increase in the child care element of the child tax credit. All sections of society will contribute to tackling the deficit, but the richest will pay more than the poorest. That has been supported by the chief executive of Barnardo's, who has said that</p>
<a name="100713-0003.htm_brev13"><a name="10071361000477"><ul><p class="tabletext">"we recognise the Government has done what it can to protect the most vulnerable."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para76"><a name="10071361000024">Amendments 1 to 4 would provide that the rate increase would come into effect only after an impact assessment had been laid before the House. Similarly, amendment 25 would provide that before the rate increase took effect the Chancellor must produce a report on its impact on a number of specific groups. Amendments 41 to 43 are further variants on that theme, as is amendment 46. Together, they would provide that the increase be deferred until the earlier of 4 January 2012 or the date of the production of a report on the impact of the increase on disabled persons, pensioners, children and child poverty, inequality, the bottom quintile, charities and the informal economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para77"><a name="10071361000025">Those amendments are unnecessary. At a time when the Government need to show a willingness to tackle the deficit and a sense of direction to ensure that there is confidence in the running of the British economy, it is vital that we have the credibility of bringing the VAT increase into effect as soon as possible. It is worth noting that the OECD has stated that the Government have demonstrated that they are taking courageous and appropriate action in the Budget. That is what we are doing, which is why it is right that we reject attempts to delay the implementation of the VAT increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para78"><a name="10071361000026">Although we have not necessarily labelled all the material that we have produced on the matter as impact assessments, we have produced a great deal of material about the impact of the VAT increase and the Budget more generally. It would be damaging to businesses if we did not proceed, as they need the certainty that we will do so.</p>

In annex C of the Red Book we set out the OBR's assessment of the economic impact of the Budget measures. The impact of the VAT increase is built into the inflation forecast in paragraph C.19. Paragraph C.23 sets out the impact on household demand and paragraph C.24 the impact on company profits. Paragraph C.5 sets out the OBR's view of the VAT tax gap, and paragraphs C.39 and C.64 explain that VAT is expected to fall as a percentage of GDP, because the OBR assumes rebalanced economic growth with consumption -<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .]</i></p>

 Order. I think it is in the best interests of the Chair and everyone here if we get a chance to hear what the Minister is saying. He is trying to express his point of view in answer to a very long debate, so let us have a bit of patience and let him finish his speech so that we can all hear it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o414"><a name="10071361000029"><a name="100713-0003.htm_spnew50"><a name="10071361000497"><b>Mr Gauke:</b>
 Thank you, Mr Hancock. I could go on setting out the lengthy list of information about VAT that we have provided. The Opposition's case that there has not been any analysis is all the more ironic given that Labour was the party that produced the doubling of the 10p rate of income tax and provided no distributional analysis whatever. We, however, have examined that particular tax change, and it is worth noting that the five bottom deciles lost out and the five top deciles gained. That is what our predecessors did, and it is not the case under the distributional analysis of VAT. As I have said, there is a strong case for looking at the expenditure basis, which shows that VAT is indeed progressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para80"><a name="10071361000030">The impact on pensioners is a legitimate concern, but if the focus is on those with the lowest income, that needs to be considered in the context of the overall distributional analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para81"><a name="10071361000031">Amendment 23 would provide for children's prams, cots, nappies and other items to remain at 17.5%. I am afraid that that amendment is illegal under EU law, so we cannot pursue it. Amendment 40 would provide for the Treasury to produce a report on the standard rate of VAT by 4 January 2011. The Chancellor has made it clear that we have no plans in that regard.</p>

It is not necessary to increase the VAT bill for the poorest families by more than Â£31 a week; it is not necessary to put further pressure on those who will feel the burden of housing and unemployment benefits and tax credits being squeezed; it is not necessary, as the British Retail Consortium said, to introduce a "disappointing" measure that "will hit jobs"; and it is not necessary to introduce a measure that can push up prices on the high street and is inflationary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para84"><a name="10071361000035">It is necessary to tackle the deficit and the debt, but it need not be done over a fixed time scale using this methodology.

In spite of the great speed at which the issues have been considered, we have had the opportunity both to review the evidence brought forward by the Treasury to support the proposed VAT increase and to discuss this with some of those affected in the sectors concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para95"><a name="10071361000400">I do not intend to detain the Committee for too long, but on charities, a certain amount of work has been under way for some time. It is perhaps worth while acknowledging that Governments of both parties over the past couple of decades have looked into the problem that the charitable sector has had with irrecoverable VAT. A number of attempts have been made to address it, and although charities have not been able to secure a special VAT status, the best way in which Governments have felt that they could be compensated-in the past, at least-has been through the gift aid mechanism. It is clear from the Exchequer Secretary's answers to questions that I have asked previously about the impact of the VAT rise on charities that the Treasury does not intend to make any exemptions for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para96"><a name="10071361000401">The Charity Tax Group has published a paper since the Budget suggesting that an increase in VAT to 20% would cost around Â£150 million. Although I have not studied the analysis, I believe that that figure was arrived at on the basis of an extrapolation from 87 charities across the range of sizes. If the Government believe-and I would agree with them-that the charitable and third sector has a significant contribution to make to a number of social and economic measures to improve our society, they need to give it some consideration in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para97"><a name="10071361000402">As for the second of the measures, I know that various attempts have been made to estimate the likely impact of the VAT rise on public authorities. I have questioned local housing associations, for example, including Penwith housing association in my constituency-a relatively small housing association, but one covering the bulk of the stock in the Penwith peninsula, which is the Land's End peninsula, to most people who understand the geography of Cornwall; that is, the bottom left-hand corner of the UK. Penwith housing association has estimated that the VAT rise will add just over Â£150,000 in costs to its modest activities over the year, and that will affect it, as a local housing association performing an important public function.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. He might have missed some of our earlier exchanges on these amendments, but it is fair to say that concerns have been raised about the way in which the Budget gets the balance right, and the way in which we might achieve circumstances in which those who did the most to drop the country into this mess were seen to be doing the most to pull it out again. This has been a theme throughout our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para98"><a name="10071361000405">I reflected earlier on news that was reported today. I was not at the British Bankers Association dinner last night when the Financial Secretary to the Treasury proposed certain new measures that were not in the Budget. They would result in additional taxation of the banks' bonuses and profits. That would be over and above the banking levy, which Liberal Democrat Members were particularly pleased to see incorporated in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para99"><a name="10071361000406">I do not wish to stray beyond the subject matter of the amendments, Mr Hancock, but if we are talking about removing the capacity of the Budget to increase the tax yield in a particular area, it is important to indicate where we might recover that tax from. For example, we should perhaps be looking at a banking levy of 0.04%, going up to 0.07%, possibly with a view to increasing it. I welcome last night's announcement by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, however, and I hope that we shall hear more about that matter, because I think that it is taking the policy in the right direction.</p>

 My hon. Friend is asking me whether I have made that assessment, but I have in fact been seeking such an assessment myself. As I mentioned a moment ago, the Charity Tax Group has made its own assessment based on a survey of 87 charities. That is a modest attempt, but it is also a significant effort on behalf of the charitable sector to undertake its own assessment and to extrapolate information from it. I believe that that assessment took a reasonable random sample across a range of charities, and that is probably the best that the group could manage in the circumstances.</p>

 I dare say the hon.

 I have already acknowledged the benefit of gift aid as having an ameliorating impact on the consequences of irrecoverable VAT for charities; that reasonable point has already been acknowledged. At the end of the day, this issue needs to be addressed, but I do not want to go back to a Second Reading debate on how we get the proper balance of measures. I would have thought that, across the Committee, the balance of Members would agree, as I do, with what the Chancellor announced on Budget day-that those most capable of making a contribution should pay most and the vulnerable should be protected. The VAT rise raises questions about whether the vulnerable are sufficiently protected by the range of measures in the Budget as a whole.</p>

 I welcome much of what the hon. Gentleman says about the importance of looking at a balance that achieves protection for the most vulnerable, but one problem with increasing the burden on charities is that it feeds through to the most vulnerable because they are, of course, their client group. Many charities will be either unable or reluctant to pass on to their service users the consequences of this VAT rise, so they are likely to eat into their own reserves, weaken their own financial standing and, ultimately, get hit with the additional whammy of finding it more difficult to attract funding from other sources, including those in the public sector. That will reduce their impact-their very good impact-on the most vulnerable in society.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes the point about the potential impact on charities rather more articulately than I think I am making it. There are potential knock-on consequences for charities, and for public authorities, in being able to perform their functions, so it is important to address those issues.</p>

I am seeking to probe that subject in order to elicit a response from the Exchequer Secretary. Surely we as a society should be trying to encourage renovation of existing buildings rather than always taking up greenfield sites for development. In particular, we should not discourage improvements to dwellings in the lower council tax bands.</p>

Many groups, including the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, have been arguing for some time that in the competitive provision of services, especially in the public sector, local authorities are often at an advantage compared with charities and third-sector organisations.</p>

 This is a particular problem, and I was about to pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who has done some important work with the Library in helping us to understand what this VAT increase will actually mean for Britain's charities. I also commend the work of the Charity Tax Group, which the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George) prayed in aid. Its assessment is pretty blunt-that this increase will cost Britain's charities Â£140 million to Â£150 million. Because much of that VAT cannot be reclaimed, Britain's charities stand to lose Â£60 million to Â£70 million. That is a lot of money, and certainly a lot for charities that are already struggling with contributions, which are down because of the recession. Many in the sector are worried about how voluntary contributions will rebound as the recovery sets in.</p>

The study makes the point that the rise in irrecoverable VAT for Action for Blind People will total some Â£100,000 a year. Charities in that sector that are about to take such a hit must immediately look at which services they can no longer offer. That gives rise to a question that will concern Members in all parts of the House, and which demands an answer: how are these charities going to be compensated for this hasty increase in VAT?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para109"><a name="10071361000446">The increase appears to hit smaller charities hardest-a point made by both the House of Commons Library and the Charity Tax Group. They say that smaller charities such as those with an income of less than Â£30 million will be hit, as VAT currently accounts for some 3.6% of their income, compared with 2.3% for larger organisations with an income of more than Â£30 million. In other words, this VAT increase will create a greater gulf between bigger charities and smaller charities. That is obviously a concern because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) pointed out, there is a big push on at the moment to ensure not a narrower role but a wider role for smaller charities in delivering public services.</p>

 We will all agree that the whole area of charity taxation needs serious examination in this debate, and perhaps the Government will review it in future. However, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will remind us whether, in the 13 years in which the Labour Government were in office, they exempted the charities from the proposed increase in national insurance. In fact, it cost charities a lot. During consideration in Committee of what became the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005-it was the first Finance Bill Committee I served on-charities complained a lot about the Labour Government restricting the scope of gift aid. They did not help charities out then. When income tax was reduced, they did not allow charities to recover the difference. This enthusiasm for protecting charities from tax changes is therefore somewhat new-found on Labour's part.</p>

So although we had not finished the job of sorting out VAT, what we had delivered was a doubling of income going into the charitable sector in this country. That was the biggest single increase in income going to the third sector in this country almost on record. In the past 10 years that meant that the sector was stronger in taking on public service delivery contracts. Indeed, those contracts with the third sector doubled since 2000 and by the time Labour left office there were about 60,000 social enterprises, worth Â£8.5 billion. We are proud of our record.</p>

 As ever, the hon. Gentleman is on the money.

 My hon. Friend has pretty much made my argument for me. All of us know what an extraordinary service mountain rescue provides. Of course these charities confront a particular problem when using gift aid to provide compensation for the kind of VAT hit that they are about to take, because when someone is collecting money through tins it is sometimes difficult to collect gift aid on the contributions that they receive. So amendment 58 seeks to extend protection to mountain rescue services in England and Wales by, again, asking the Treasury to prepare a report on the impact of the VAT hike on their services. These are common-sense amendments, which draw on a strong cross-party consensus that has developed over the past few years. I hope that the Government are able to support them.</p>

It was therefore with profound distress-but no little surprise-that when the Budget came, I saw the VAT rise that inevitably follows the election of a Conservative Government. Of course, that rise affects the charities in our constituencies. I want to talk about two of them briefly in the context of the amendments.</p>

Those individuals, who receive disability benefits, will be asked to pay more to obtain the same service from the charity. That is causing the charity some distress and I have spoken to its representatives about the issue.</p>

 We are looking at what we can do to simplify the gift aid system so that charities of all sizes can make use of it. Some smaller charities do well out of gift aid. We want to do all that we can to strengthen charities, but the fundamental fact is that VAT is the right tax in these circumstances to raise additional revenue.

The case is well understood on both sides of the House, but as the Committee will no doubt be aware, mountain rescue teams, like other search and rescue charities, benefit from VAT reliefs on some but not all goods and services that they purchase. Such charities are also able to purchase free of VAT medicines, medical equipment including first aid kits, splints and stretchers, ambulances and certain vehicles designed to transport disabled people.</p>

The mountain rescue teams estimate that they still pay something like Â£200,000 in irrecoverable VAT per year. However, it is well understood that there is no scope within the framework of long-standing EU VAT law for relieving more of their purchases from VAT, which is why the previous Government did not do so, despite receiving representations on a number of occasions. It would, therefore, serve no useful purpose to produce a report on the impact of the VAT increase on the service. It is argued that there could be a refund for the VAT costs, which is a public expenditure choice that I am sure the shadow Chief Secretary-formerly the Chief Secretary-was conscious of in his previous post, and we know what happened then.</p>

 Where there's a will, there's way. The Treasury could find a way of offsetting the cost for the mountain rescue services, just as the Labour Government  <br>

 We have had a very good debate. It has certainly been well worth probing issues on charities, public authorities and building renovation. I particularly appreciated the contribution of the shadow Chief Secretary, which was less partisan than in the past and added much to the debate and consideration of the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para130"><a name="10071376000019">I apologise to the right hon. Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Alun Michael). During his two interventions on me I failed to acknowledge his significant contribution to the voluntary sector over many years. I should have taken the opportunity to acknowledge his sterling work for the third sector and the voluntary sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para131"><a name="10071376000020">The hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) added a great deal in terms of some of the material he referred to, particularly from his constituency, but his speech was disappointingly partisan. I am rather surprised by that on the day when Lord Mandelson let the cat out of the bag on Labour's defence that they would not have introduced a VAT increase after the election. It must be rather difficult for Labour Members to swallow this evening, given all the butter that is not melting in their mouths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="100713-0003.htm_para132"><a name="10071376000021">The Exchequer Secretary said that he will keep a number of issues under review, which is encouraging. I shall certainly be pressing him and Treasury Ministers to ensure that they do so for the three issues that have been raised in the debate. As I indicated earlier, I intended the amendments to be probing, as they have been, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para1"><a name="1007142000575">I do not intend to detain the Committee long. Amendment 38 is a simplification measure to probe the Treasury a little on how it has sought to introduce its anti-forestalling legislation. The Budget made great play of the simplification credentials that the Government wanted to present to the House and convince us with. Obviously, the Finance Bill, as presented, does more to complicate than to simplify the tax system. With the change in the VAT rate, there is a need for anti-forestalling legislation controlling supplies made in anticipation of a change in the rate. The amendment would replace the Government's clauses with the same form of clauses used in the Finance Act 2009, and seeks to probe the Government on why they have chosen to introduce a whole new schedule rather than simply to amend a couple of words in a perfectly good schedule that has already passed into legislation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o480"><a name="1007142000576"><a name="100713-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="1007142001165"><b>Mr Gauke:</b>
 As we have heard, amendment 38 seeks to take anti-forestalling legislation introduced in the Finance Act 2009 for the reversion of the standard rate to 17.5% on 1 January this year, and use it to prevent forestalling as a result of next January's rate increase. That appears to be a simple approach, but in fact it would render the earlier anti-forestalling provisions inoperative and leave us wide open to a loss of revenue on transactions spanning 1 January 2010. Schedule 2 was closely modelled on the measure used when the rate reverted to 17.5% on 1 January 2010 and is intended to operate in the same way. There are no changes of substance and no hidden amendments. However, the anti-forestalling provisions in last year's Finance Act were specific to the last rate increase and are still required in relation to that increase. Trying to cover both rate increases in one schedule would lead to unnecessarily complex legislation.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_22"><a name="100713-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="1007142000596"><h5 align="left">10 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para2"><a name="1007142000577">Both last year's anti-forestalling legislation and the draft provisions in the Bill counter forestalling by introducing a supplementary charge to VAT, and so remove the tax advantage. The charge applies where a VAT invoice is issued or prepayment occurs before the rate rise, but where the provision of goods or services is to take place afterwards. Clearly, there could be a large number of transactions where an invoice was issued or a prepayment was made before 1 January 2010, but where the goods or services had not yet been provided. For example, a right to acquire goods at a later date might have been granted in 2009, but not yet taken up. In those circumstances, the amendment would mean that HMRC could not collect a supplementary charge that would otherwise be due under the provisions of the existing Finance Act 2009. This is because that legislation, as amended, would have effect only in relation to the VAT rate change on 4 January 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para3"><a name="1007142000578">Furthermore, I am sure that taxpayers find it much easier to refer simply to a single piece of legislation for the upcoming rate increase, rather than risk getting confused by having to refer backwards and forwards between two provisions. Schedule 2 as drafted is clear, and it will be effective in preventing forestalling as a result of the upcoming rate change. Retaining schedule 3 to the Finance Act 2009 without amendment will continue to prevent forestalling in relation to the latest rate change. I appreciate the manner in which the amendment was moved by the shadow Chief Secretary, but I would urge him to withdraw it.</p>

 In amendments 26 and 27, I seek to draw the Committee's attention to another of what I view as the deeply regressive and painful effects of clause 3-the VAT clause-on some of the most vulnerable in our society, in this instance disabled people. Government Members might be under the impression that disabled people are exempt from the effects of VAT-I have heard that said in other debates-but I hope to demonstrate that this is not the case and that they, like many of the most vulnerable in our society, will be impacted negatively by clause 3 and the Budget overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para6"><a name="1007142000585">Amendment 26 would require the Government to review the way in which current rate reliefs on items needed by disabled people are applied and to address the significant anomalies that exist in the provision of such reliefs. Amendment 27 covers items that are not wholly designed for use by disabled people, but which, although largely used by them, are not exempt from VAT and are therefore chargeable at the standard rate, and it makes the suggestion that they should be exempt from the increase to 20%.</p>

The interpretation of what constitutes an item that is VAT deductible or VAT refundable is certainly much narrower in this country than it is in many other EU countries, and there are also anomalies, which I propose briefly to list.</p>

By way of example, I refer the Committee to the tribunal case of Brailsford <i> v</i>. The Commissioners for Customs and Excise, which related to the change to Mrs Brailsford's house to accommodate a renal dialysis unit. There was rate relief on the unit and the installation of a toilet in her house, but the extension to the house to accommodate the required renal dialysis machine was not subject to any rate relief, so the case was rejected by the Excise and she had to pay full VAT on the unit.</p>

Mrs B Symonds and Customs and Excise. She had multiple sclerosis and needed to use an air purifier to make her life more bearable. It had not been specifically designed for use by disabled people, however, and was therefore not allowable under VAT relief regulations. She was therefore forced to pay the full price.</p>

Under the current legislation, people with physical disabilities obtain VAT relief for many items, but people with mental disabilities have far less access to that relief. A classic example is patients with epilepsy, who are often not designated as handicapped. They therefore do not get rate relief on items such as the alarms and motion sensors that are vital for detecting their sometimes life-threatening epileptic episodes.</p>

They are able to purchase adapted cars and get full VAT relief on them. However, a person who has two prosthetic arms-as does another Mrs Simmons-would find that they did not get any VAT relief whatever. They would be obliged to pay for the full adaptation of their car and would not be subject to VAT relief.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share the concern of many disabled people who are on disability allowance and who are faced with an unspecified threat to the continuation of that benefit? At the same time, they will have to meet the extra cost that will result from the VAT increase.

 I would like to talk to amendment 47, which has not yet been mentioned. Certain issues have been ignored in this debate. The impact of VAT on expenditure deciles is an important matter. I think that the Opposition reject that analysis, but the size of the household budget is a key determinant. Many people with disabilities are on quite a low income, through no fault of their own. A better way to analyse their situation is therefore to look at those poorer households by expenditure decile. The Institute for Fiscal Studies accepts that, in its analysis of the Budget, it ignored the fact that a cost of living increase in benefits is brought in every April, calculated on the basis of either the consumer prices index or the retail prices index.</p>

If we look at households by expenditure decile-that is, taking into account the budget of the household-we see that estimates show that the poorest households face an increase in costs of just under 0.5%. I believe that the expenditure decile is an entirely reasonable mechanism to use in this instance. So in January, we would expect them to see that increase, and in April they will have an increase of 1.5%, because they are on the CPI, rather than 1.1%. The poorer households will find themselves better-off on a cash basis after April.</p>

 I find that argument bizarre, as it runs so strongly against the very argument the Liberal Democrats used in the general election campaign, when there were big billboards describing the Â£389 bombshell.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point, which allows me to emphasise that certain households have their income linked to the cost of living-whether it be calculated by Rossi, RPI, CPI or whatever mechanism. As the cost of living goes up, those families are automatically given an increase in income. If that increase is greater than their increase in costs, they end up marginally better off. I am not saying that it is a massive amount of money, but the key is that the poorer households, as a result of the VAT increase, actually end up slightly better off. <i> [Interruption.] </i>They do. It is very simple. If the hon. Member for Glasgow Central (Anas Sarwar) wants to intervene again, I can explain it in far more detail.</p>

It happens in April and it is calculated according to a cost of living increase, which includes VAT. There are arguments about what should be included in the cost of living calculation and whether it should include mortgages, as the RPI does, or it should not include them, as the CPI does not. The realistic situation is that every April there is an increase based on the cost of living. VAT is part of the cost of living, so the households depending on index-linked benefits end up with an increase in excess of their extra costs-it is a relatively small amount of money, but it does happen.</p>

I accept that some households use DLA to work, but that might be only 7% of the households receiving DLA. Those households could face, for example, substantial increases in energy costs, which would not be factored into the CPI in the same way as other things would.</p>

concerned that we might encounter other changes over time that would not be picked up by RPI or CPI. Because we as a Government are concerned to protect people on lower incomes-we are doing so as part of this process; if we used only the RPI increase, the benefit to claimant households of the VAT increase would be only 0.6% as opposed to about 1%-it is important to assess the effect on them.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Lady for that. One great thing about the Red Book this time is that it does a distributional analysis. It looks at the effect of the Budget on various households by various deciles. It looks at the income figures as well as the expenditure figures. I personally believe that counting my daughter as poor because she has a low income and depends on me is a wrong assessment. Looking at the size of the household budget is a far better mechanism than looking at the income figures for identifying poorer households. Those assessments were all done in the Red Book.</p>

 When someone receives an RPI-linked increase-or a CPI-linked increase, as it will become-it will include an element related to the increase in VAT, but the rest of the calculation for the CPI-linked adjustment will relate to all the other inflationary pressures that make up that figure.

 The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. As the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith) said, there are issues to be considered in relation to major items of equipment, such as which should be zero-rated and which should be standard-rated. What I am considering now, however, are households in the lower expenditure deciles-less well-off households-across the country. I accept that there are circumstances in which people need to buy large items of equipment and that we must do the best we can to protect those people, but we should consider all households. As I explained earlier, I think it is better to consider expenditure deciles rather than merely considering whether a person is disabled, because very wealthy people may be disabled, and we should not design our policies to suit such people.</p>

 That is absolutely true. Only 7% of DLA recipients are in work. Obviously those people would be generally dependent on benefits, and they would therefore receive an uprating in benefits in April, based on the CPI. It is not clear what the amount will be this time, but when VAT rose from 15% to 17.5%, the RPI rose by about 1.1% and the CPI by about 1.5%. As I explained earlier, the Red Book shows that the additional cost to the bottom expenditure decile is under 0.5%.</p>

 Amendment 47 is a probing amendment. It touches on a complicated area of VAT law which was in the process of undergoing a degree of reform. I know that there will be no instant answers, but I think it would be useful for the Committee to know more about the direction that the Government are seeking to take in reforming this area over the next year or two.</p>

It identified a number of cases in which existing zero-rating provisions for people with disabilities are inadequate. The fact is that the increase in VAT to 20%, with no kind of balancing relief, on many supplies that are still needed by people with disabilities will cause some hurt and some cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para21"><a name="1007144000018">I should like to know what the Government think about four issues related to reform. The first is the contrast between European Union and United Kingdom law. The Exchequer Secretary will have already memorised annex III of Council Directive 2006/112/EC. As he knows, it allows reduced rates for</p>
<a name="100713-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="1007144001194"><ul><p class="tabletext">"medical equipment, aids and other appliances normally intended to alleviate or treat disability".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para22"><a name="1007144000019">He will also know that the application of UK VAT law does not mirror that flexibility precisely. A restriction now applies to many items because they must be designated solely for use by a person with disabilities. That appears to be a more stringent test than the one set out in EU legislation, and it would be useful to understand the Minister's attitude to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para23"><a name="1007144000020">The second issue touches on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith). It concerns people with mental health needs. Annex III does not make any distinction between equipment needed for people with mental health needs and that needed for those with physical health needs, yet at present there are discrepancies in UK law that still need to be ironed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para24"><a name="1007144000021">Thirdly, there are issues to do with the accessibility of work places. I think there is agreement across the House that it is important that there is extra support to get people with disabilities back into work. Obviously, that is going to be more important after the Government's reform of disability living allowance with, as they say, a more stringent-or, rather, a different-test for work capability assessment; we do not quite know what that test will look like.

work places, but other businesses do not enjoy those reliefs. It would be useful to understand the Minister's thinking on that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para25"><a name="1007144000022">My final point concerns transport. UK VAT law provides limited reliefs for the purchase and lease of certain cars by disabled people. A good example is the Motability scheme, but it excludes people not in receipt of the higher rate Motability component of DLA. The Government have told us they want to reform DLA. We have not yet heard precisely how, but many people will be concerned that eligibility for such schemes will be curtailed and that some individuals may face a tax problem as a result of the Government introducing VAT increases at the pace they propose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para26"><a name="1007144000023">This is thus a complicated matter. I do not think the full consequences of the VAT hike are properly understood across the House, so the amendment asks the Treasury to produce a report showing what remedies will be provided for people who need to purchase disability equipment and who will be adversely affected by this rapid increase in VAT proposed by the Government in clause 3.</p>

 I suggest that we return to this issue another day. However, I do not feel that the Exchequer Secretary has addressed some of the key points. Although it is true that many items are exempt from VAT, some important ones are not, as I highlighted. The issue has not been dealt with adequately this evening, and I will pursue it on another occasion. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 I am very pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate this evening, three years after the flooding in Hull in 2007 that caused such havoc for my constituents. I remind the House that the flooding in Hull was caused by surface water flooding, that one in five homes were flooded, and that June 2007 was the wettest month recorded in Yorkshire since 1882.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para50"><a name="1007145000597">I first pay tribute to all the local services in Hull that worked so hard for my constituents on the day of the flooding and in the months and years that followed. Many issues pertaining to the flooding are outstanding, but tonight, because of the limited time, I wish to explore just three. The first is the progress that has been made so far on legislation and new policy directions. The second is insurance. Thirdly, I will seek reassurance from the Minister about future funding for flood protection measures in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para51"><a name="1007145000598">I thought it right to start by examining the coalition agreement to see what the Government have to say about their plans for flooding protection. It states clearly:</p>
<a name="100713-0004.htm_brev5"><a name="1007145000645"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We will take forward the findings of the Pitt Review to improve our flood defences, and prevent unnecessary building in areas of high flood risk."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para52"><a name="1007145000599">I was pleased that Hull was quick off the mark after the floods and had a report produced by Professor Tom Coulthard at Hull university. We then had the national Pitt review. It is to the credit of the previous Labour Government that all 92 recommendations in the review were accepted and many implemented in the provisions of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. I seek reassurance from the Minister that those provisions will be implemented as soon as possible. I also seek information about the possibility of the new coalition Government producing a water White Paper in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para53"><a name="1007145000600">One of Pitt's clear recommendations was on surface water management plans, suggesting that local authorities should become responsible for ensuring that arrangements were in place to assess and manage local flood risk from all sources, including surface water, and for developing a surface water management plan.</p>

<p><a name="st_o506"><a name="1007145000601"><a name="100713-0004.htm_spnew26"><a name="1007145001222"><b>Mr David Davis (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing an Adjournment debate on this extremely important issue. Does she agree that the first stage of water management is to ensure that we avoid building not only on flood plains-I think that that is a common view-but anywhere where it will lead to the blocking of a watercourse or an increased risk of houses flooding?</p>

<p><a name="st_o507"><a name="1007145000602"><a name="100713-0004.htm_spnew27"><a name="1007145001223"><b>Diana R. Johnson:</b>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>13 July 2010 : Column 923</b><br>
Government provided Â£250,000 to develop the plan further. This summer there will be consultation, including on an aqua green in my constituency in the Orchard Park and Greenwood area, adjacent to the Cottingham area, which the right hon. Gentleman represents. I understand that the aqua green, alongside the other provisions set out in the consultation, would cost about Â£20 million to implement across the city. I seek reassurance from the Minister tonight about the future of that funding.</p>

<p><a name="st_o508"><a name="1007145000604"><a name="100713-0004.htm_spnew28"><a name="1007145001224"><b>Andrew Percy (Brigg and Goole) (Con):</b>
 I, too, congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate. I know that she has been a strong advocate for Hull during and since the flooding. While we are on the issue of surface water, I know that significant progress has been made, but the one point on which we do not seem to have made a great deal of progress is having a single number for residents to use to report all surface water flooding. That was a huge issue in Hull and the East Riding on the day of the floods, and we need more progress on it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o509"><a name="1007145000605"><a name="100713-0004.htm_spnew29"><a name="1007145001225"><b>Diana R. Johnson:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right, and I hope that the Minister will address that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para55"><a name="1007145000606">I turn to the issue of small grants to households, which was an important issue in Kingston upon Hull North. The previous Labour Government gave Â£5 million as part of a grant scheme to enable local authorities to apply to help their residents to protect their homes through the use of flood boards and air brick covers. My local authority, Hull city council, did not apply for that money. There were several rounds of the grant, but there seemed to be confusion about whether the council could apply. I would like to hear from the Minister whether further grant money will be available and whether the conditions could be clearly laid out, so that, as I hope, my constituents can apply for that money through Hull city council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para56"><a name="1007145000607">It is appropriate to pay tribute to the work that Yorkshire Water has undertaken in my constituency by investing in the Bransholme pumping station, which failed in June 2007. It has put in additional pumping facilities, and extra capacity is currently being developed at the station's lagoon. That is all to be welcomed, but further housing development is planned in the Bransholme area, so we need to keep an eye on whether we actually need a brand new pumping station in the years to come to meet the demand. Also, Yorkshire Water is looking to identify changes that might be necessary to the Humbercare sewerage system in Hull.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para57"><a name="1007145000608">I turn to the issue of insurance, which has been an ongoing issue since 2007. The insurance industry has agreed to provide flood cover for most properties, but this is subject to the Government continuing to invest in flood risk management. I am aware of the statement of principles under which the insurance industry will provide insurance. That will run out in 2013. However, the Pitt report found that some people suffered from a hike in premiums and that excesses were much higher than before 2007. For example, Mr and Mrs Pearson lived in Kingswood and were insured with Norwich Union. In late December 2009, they were told that their premiums were to go up 33% and that their excess was to be Â£6,000. They were also told that if they personally commissioned an independent expert report specific to  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 July 2010">

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2010" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>13 July 2010 : Column 924</b><br>
their property that took into account the flood defences put in place, the insurance company would look again at the insurance premium. They were told by the insurance company that HU7, where Kingswood is, was very likely to flood again, but it did not seem to know anything about the work being undertaken to protect the area. It was only once my office had intervened and provided information from Yorkshire Water that we could get the premium down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para58"><a name="1007145000609">I am concerned that insurance companies do not seem to be aware of what is happening in areas such as Kingston upon Hull North, and are not distinguishing between the risk from surface water flooding and river flooding. At the moment, insurance companies only have to provide insurance for householders who had insurance in 2007, so in Hull the insurance market is essentially closed. Personally, in my home, I have come across this: I cannot shop around in the insurance market, but can only go to the provider I had in 2007. It was found that many people affected by the floods did not have insurance. It is disappointing that although some local authorities have adopted a cheap insurance scheme for council tenants, this has not been taken up by my local authority. I am concerned, therefore, about the future for residents in my constituency and their ability to find affordable insurance in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para59"><a name="1007145000610">That leads me on to the point about the continuation of funding for flood protection. It is estimated that by 2035 we will need about Â£1 billion a year to protect ourselves from flooding. Liberal Democrat Hull city council has constantly asked for more money for Hull, particularly from the previous Government, to invest in flood defences in the city. I was dismayed today, therefore, to read in the media reports that it is likely that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will have its budget cut by 30% in the comprehensive spending review. I also understand that plans are being prepared by the coalition Government to privatise flood defence infrastructure, which means that the private sector will have to make up for the coalition Government's cuts to the Labour Government's plans for flood defences. Those private sector bodies would then be allowed to pass on the costs of flood protection to the people and businesses in the areas at risk of flooding, in the form of extra council tax, water rates and, perhaps, contributions from business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para60"><a name="1007145000611">Even most market economists would accept that there can be no greater example of a public good than flood defences. We surely cannot hand that responsibility over to the private sector to make a profit at the expense of communities at risk of flooding. Of course we want to encourage private investment and partnership to add to our flood protection work. However, handing flood defence to the private sector is not the way forward to protect us from flooding, and would be another burden on people and businesses in my constituency, which has some of the most deprived areas in the country. They have suffered from the recent recession and, I believe, will now suffer from the policies pursued by the coalition Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para61"><a name="1007145000612">It appears that the Lib Dem-Conservative coalition is now preparing a flood tax on the victims of flooding in some of the most deprived parts of the country, which, in Yorkshire and the Humber, include Hull, Sheffield and Doncaster. I know that the Minister is a fair-minded gentleman. I hope that he can reassure me this evening  <br>

that the money put forward by the Labour Government for flood defences will be protected and that DEFRA will stand up to the Treasury by delivering on the commitment made by the previous Government that people would not suffer by having a flood tax imposed on them-a commitment made not only to the people of Hull, but to the people of the rest of east Yorkshire and the other parts of the country that suffered in the flooding of 2007. I hope that he will also be able to answer some of the other questions that I have posed this evening.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana R. Johnson) on securing this debate and on raising a number of points that I shall endeavour to answer as best I can. She and I both contributed to Sir Michael Pitt's review, because we both represent constituencies that suffered from flooding and surface water flooding. I therefore understand entirely, as she will, the experience for those households affected; we probably both spent time in the days after those awful floods wading through houses that had been destroyed and meeting people whose lives had been completely turned upside down by the devastation. We were all impressed at the time by her concern for her constituents-a point echoed again this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para62"><a name="1007145000614">Let me address one point directly before I address any others. We have no plans to privatise flood defences, contrary to what was reported in the press today. That is not to say that we will not be looking, where appropriate, for contributions from beneficiaries to new schemes and other sorts of levy-funded operations, which we have discussed in the House in recent days and weeks, but I am happy to reassure the hon. Lady on her point as best I can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para63"><a name="1007145000615">The events of summer 2007 illustrated just how important the issues of flood management really are. Floods destroy homes and businesses, and pose serious risks to life. I know that the people of Hull understand that better than most, as do my constituents who suffered in the floods of that year. It remains the case that Kingston upon Hull and the surrounding areas have the greatest concentration of people and property at risk from flooding outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para64"><a name="1007145000616">Floods often happen quickly. The damage that they cause can take years to put right and, for those affected, can leave a lasting legacy of concern about it happening again. I am sure that the hon. Lady will have had the same experience as me, in that when there is heavy rain, the level of stress and trauma among our constituents who have been previously affected rises. We are only just starting to understand the implications that that has for people.</p>

the flooding of 600 streets, nearly 9,000 homes, 1,300 businesses and more than 90% of the city's schools. Nor is it surprising that the 2007 floods, which affected many areas, led to the largest recovery effort since the second world war. Specific recovery funding was provided by the previous Administration, and a successful UK application was made to the EU social fund. However, recovery on such a scale takes time. The previous Government took their last count in June 2009, at which time 48 households in Hull were still wholly or partly displaced from their homes.</p>

We will publish it in the summer of next year, and I very much hope that she will give us her thoughts on how it can be taken forward. It will look at a number of related issues, including, principally, the Walker and Cave reports, but if she feels that it should cover issues such as surface water flooding, I am certainly open to suggestions. I cannot answer her question on small grants now, but I can assure her that I will write to her and that I will see what can be done. I completely agree that very small grants-for air bricks, for example-can make a big difference when dealing with the technology of flood prevention. We want to encourage people to take responsibility for their own homes.</p>

Flood management makes up a big proportion of the Department's budget, but immunity from the new financial disciplines is simply not possible. Despite those financial pressures, however, we have decided that we should maintain an increase in the money that taxpayers spend on flood defences this year. Thoughtful planning will mean that that will not impact on the number of households that we protect. We will continue with that thoughtful planning in our work on what is, as everyone knows, a necessarily challenging strategic expenditure review process. Indeed, that is already happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="100713-0004.htm_para70"><a name="1007145000624">On insurance, it is a matter of great regret that many of the people who are offered access to the cheap schemes often provided through local authorities or housing associations choose not to access them. I have raised this matter with the ABI and with housing associations, and I will continue to raise it across government if I have to. When such schemes can be included as part of people's rent, I believe that there is a case for offering them as an opt-out, rather than an opt-in scheme. I know of a housing association that offers Â£5,000-worth of household insurance for 50p a week. It is perfectly possible for people to make a rational choice on this if they are given the necessary information. I think that an opt-out would be better than an opt-in, but that is a personal view. I shall, however, take the matter up with the ABI.</p>

The Environment Agency is the guardian of the data on surface water management plans, and it is important that that information should be passed on to insurers. I have had exactly the same experience as the hon. Lady, where insurers just say that a house has been flooded, and as far as the insurance company or broker is concerned, no distinction is made between surface or fluvial water, or between whether any or a lot of remedial action has taken place. My local authority is the guardian of that information at the moment. I want the Environment Agency to be absolutely up front-there are no secrets. In fact, we want to make public the work that government in all its forms is doing, so let us make sure that the Environment Agency makes that data available as soon as possible, so that insurance can access it. I am completely with the hon. Lady on that.</p>

Such consultation is important. I would urge all groups and individuals with an interest in flood management in the area to contribute. That certainly includes farmers and others who naturally have concerns about the impact of possible changes on farm land. Their concerns are matters that will be fully considered as part of the assessment of options.</p>

The Environment Agency has almost completed a Â£10 million refurbishment of the Hull tidal barrier, which protects around 17,000 properties from tidal surges. Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency have undertaken to refurbish the equipment in the East Hull pumping station. The work to the agency's pumps will cost around Â£900,000 and is due to be completed by the autumn.</p>

Maintenance work and the removal of debris has happened on a number of watercourses, including the western drain, Setting dyke and Cryke beck. There have been improvements to pumping stations at East Hull and Bransholme, and the installation of new infrastructure at Burstwick, New Clough and Westlands drain. There has been a variety of small, local levy-funded projects-work funded by the local levy raised by the regional flood defence committee, plus supplementary funding from the Environment Agency, including projects in or close to the hon.

Part of that is the work that we are now doing on the review of the regulations provided in the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 in the context of the better regulation action plan announced by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. We are working hard on establishing a time scale for implementing the Act, but it is especially pleasing that many of the authorities that will have new duties and powers under the Act are already getting on with managing flood risk. For our part, DEFRA is also working with key players, including local authorities, the Environment Agency and professional bodies, to ensure that they have the capacity to implement the Act.</p>

However, one of Sir Michael's interim recommendations was that we should have a national flood emergency framework to provide a common point of reference. Like Sir Michael, I want to ensure that there is clarity about roles and responsibilities, and a proper multi-agency approach to both flood planning and the emergency response.

 I entirely agree. We discussed that at length during a recent meeting of the chairs of the forums. There is an enormous amount of work that we can do to encourage such activity. We need a bottom-up, community-led approach. Some might even describe it as a "big society" approach, while others might call it a co-operative movement. I do not care what it is called; what is important is to understand that a lot of emotion is involved in protecting people's homes. I have seen wonderful examples of communities pulling together and not only enjoying the process, but creating a flood watch scheme rather like a neighbourhood watch scheme. People keep an eye on the excellent data that the Environment Agency now publishes, which enables them to provide information, make plans and take action whenever that is required.</p>
