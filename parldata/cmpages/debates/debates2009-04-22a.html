Whether this activity is done on social networking sites or in any other way, these organisations are criminal organisations and we need to ensure that young people realise that they are just that.</p>

That is absolutely not in any way to diminish the extraordinary work that was done by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, but it is to recognise that, in the face of the Patten report and the changes that came about, and by building confidence across the entire community in Northern Ireland, he has led that change and been a great leader.

On policing areas that may be especially affected, I reassure the hon.

 I am always happy to review legislation, with a mind to improving it and making it more effective. However, let us be clear: between the signing of the Good Friday agreement and today, there has not been a significant increase in the numbers of people joining so-called dissident organisations, which we know to be criminal. That does not mean to say that&#151;as with any regrettable gang culture&#151;young, impressionable, alienated, albeit completely wrong-headed, people may feel disposed to be recruited to those gangs. We will take any measures that we can to discourage them&#151;whether legislation, working with the Executive or other steps. However, I point out to the hon. Gentleman that one of those arrested for the murder of one person in the attacks in early March will be charged with being a member of a proscribed organisation.</p>

 Let me look at the issue from a slightly different angle. Following the Omagh bombings, the former Prime Minister passed legislation changing the rules on admissible evidence.

However, for the benefit of the House, I would just say to him that, in relation to the attacks that happened at the beginning of March, the PSNI has made some spectacular progress, which has led to the arrest of individuals and charges of murder in the case of both attacks. I am confident that the police service has what it needs, but I am always prepared to enter into more negotiations.</p>

I hope that the Secretary of State and the Treasury will not see his moving on as an opportunity to diminish the resources given to policing and, in particular, to community safety partnerships in tackling the recruitment of young people to dissident republican groups.

 Every crisis that has happened since the second world war has been the result of high inflation pushing interest rates up, causing businesses to go bust and forcing people to get unemployed. That has been the traditional economic crisis we have faced, but this current crisis is happening even when inflation is low and interest rates are low. <i> [Interruption.] </i>If the Conservatives do not want to understand the solution, they will not even understand the problem. This is a global banking crisis, which we are dealing with through measures that in every case the Conservatives have opposed.

First, there is protection for people who have become unemployed and it is at a far higher level than ever before. Secondly, we have agreed with the building societies and banks a moratorium on mortgage repossessions. Thirdly, we have changed the rules that govern court action so that it is a last resort.

I spoke to the President of Sri Lanka earlier this week and I have followed up meetings that we have had previously. I asked him to extend the pause in respect of the ceasefire. I also asked him for humanitarian access to those refugees who have come out, are in difficulty and need help&#151;I have said that the UN should have full access. I also asked whether he would receive a delegation from the United Kingdom, so that we could assess what humanitarian help was available and should be made available. We have had further discussions over the past few days, and I believe that the President will now be prepared to accept a humanitarian delegation, on a cross-party basis, from the United Kingdom. To prepare the way, a Department for International Development Minister will go to Sri Lanka later this week.

When the world economy was plunged into a deep crisis in the 1930s, the response, both nationally and internationally, was too little and too late. That failure to act turned a serious downturn into a prolonged depression. We will not repeat those mistakes again. This time, we and other countries have worked to avoid them. Across the globe, we have seen decisive action by national Governments, and internationally, too. This action, taken promptly and decisively, gives us good grounds for confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90422-0003.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000151">Today&#146;s Budget builds on the substantial help for people and businesses that I announced in the pre-Budget report last November. It builds on the steps that we have taken to recapitalise and restore confidence in our financial institutions, and it builds on the outcome of the G20 summit in London this month, when the world&#146;s leading economies came together to agree an unprecedented co-ordinated action to speed global recovery. The action already taken here and internationally, and the measures that I will announce today, mean that I expect the economy to start growing again towards the end of this year. I am also confident that as the global economy recovers to double in size over the next 20 years, Britain can and will be a world leader. This Budget will help make sure that we seize this opportunity.</p>

At the end of 2007, problems in the international mortgage markets began to put a damaging squeeze on credit. In early 2008, we also saw dramatic volatility in many commodities prices, adding to uncertainty and putting pressure on growth. Last autumn, the dramatic failure of one of the  <br>

top investment banks in America&#151; Lehman Brothers&#151;shattered already fragile confidence and brought the international financial system to its knees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000153">Since then, an extraordinary international financial crisis has fed into the wider economy, causing a steep and widespread world recession. A crisis that started in the developed economies has spread to emerging and developing countries too. Industrial production has fallen and unemployment is rising, by 5 million in the United States alone. In the past few months, world trade fell, and while our exports are down 14 per cent., exports in Germany are down 21 per cent., in China 26 per cent., and in Japan 45 per cent. So for the first time since the second world war, the world economy is expected to contract this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000154">In the past few months we have seen considerable economic uncertainty, and that has fully justified the action we, and other countries, have taken to support businesses and people. Since the autumn, we have put the banks on a stronger footing, cleaning up their balance sheets and helping to boost bank lending. As a result, banks will be able to lend billions of pounds more this year and next to homebuyers and businesses. Getting credit flowing again is the essential precondition for economic recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000155">In the pre-Budget report, I announced a range of measures to help the country through the recession, putting &#163;20 billion back into the economy. That help is coming through now, from an income tax cut, and a VAT reduction that will continue until December. There is increased support for pensioners, as well as investment in vital public services and accelerated capital projects, which is protecting thousands of jobs in this country. Because of the reforms we have made to the welfare system since 1997, that comes on top of extra help when families need it most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000156">I fully understand the anxiety behind calls to support those whose wages have fallen. This is exactly the support that our flexible system can offer, and is already offering. As shorter working weeks or irregular patterns reduce wages, those receiving tax credits can see an automatic increase to compensate for the loss of income. In March alone, for example, 355,000 families were receiving on average &#163;35 a week more to support them, through tax credits&#151;all the more reason why we need to keep tax credits and not scrap them. This demonstrates how our welfare system automatically helps people when they need it most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000157">Fiscal support has been complemented, too, with sharp reductions in interest rates by central banks right across the world. The Bank of England interest rate is now down to half a per cent., the lowest it has ever been. That has reduced the cost of mortgages and loans. The average saving, since October, for the 41/2 million families with tracker mortgages, is over &#163;230 a month. And we have now given the Bank of England new means to support the flow of credit and put money into the economy. Inflation has come down, which means that people&#146;s income will go further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000158">Taken together, the total support that we have provided to the UK economy is expected to protect up to half a million jobs. Other Governments across the world have been doing the same. The total amount of fiscal support across the G20 will amount to over $5 trillion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000159">There has also been unprecedented co-ordinated action at an international level. The G20 group of economies came together, first in November and then in London earlier this month, to fight this global recession. We agreed to take whatever action was necessary to deliver the International Monetary Fund forecast of global growth of over 2 per cent. by the end of next year. In total, we agreed over $1 trillion of additional support for the world economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000160">There are no quick fixes; there is no overnight solution&#151;but because of the progress we have made, here and internationally, we can begin to restore confidence, save jobs, and bring the world economy more quickly out of recession. Of course, we must make sure we deliver on these agreements, starting at the meeting of Finance Ministers in Washington this week. I want the next meeting of European Union Finance Ministers to be focused on rebuilding growth in Europe, based on the foundations laid by the G20 in London. But we also need a clear path to recovery here&#151;both fiscally and by investing to build Britain&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000161">The UK went into this global recession with employment at an all-time high, and inflation, public debt and interest rates at low levels. But no country can insulate itself from this worldwide downturn. The position here, as in every country, deteriorated in the autumn. In the last few months, world trade fell at the sharpest rate since 1945, and, as an open economy, we are the world&#146;s sixth biggest exporter of goods and the second largest exporter of services, and we are affected by the collapse in demand in other countries. The unexpected severity of the recession has led the IMF to downgrade its own forecasts for the world economy three times since October. We, as well as other countries as diverse as Japan and France, India and the US, have reduced our growth estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000162">The United Kingdom economy contracted by 1.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2008. For the first quarter of this year, I expect the economy will again contract by a similar amount. And my forecast for GDP growth for the year as a whole will be minus 31/2 per cent.&#151;in line with other independent forecasts. But because of our underlying strength, and the measures we are taking domestically and internationally, I expect to see growth resume towards the end of the year. The IMF forecasts published today confirm the problems that all countries will face this year. But they also show that the British economy will suffer less than Germany, less than Japan, less than Italy and less than the euro area as a whole this year. The British economy is diverse, it is flexible and it is resilient, which is why I believe we can be confident in recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000163">Next year, because of the pick-up in world demand, the continuing benefit of lower prices and the substantial recovery measures being put in place, I am forecasting growth of 11/4 per cent. in 2010. In future, the sources of our growth will be more varied&#151;and we need to ensure that we play to our country&#146;s strengths. It will increasingly come from an expansion in investment by businesses in the industries of the future, such as low-carbon, advanced manufacturing and communications. These industries, together, are as important to the British economy as the financial services sector. That is why it has been so important that, for example, we have increased investment in Britain&#146;s science base by 88 per cent. in real terms   <br>

over the last 10 years. Growth will also be driven by the opportunities to export as the global economy doubles in size in the next two decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000164">From 2011, I am forecasting that the economy will continue to recover, with growth of 31/2 per cent. from then on. To account for the impact of the global shock, I have further adjusted trend output&#151;the productive potential of the economy. But in future years, the economy will recover towards a trend rate of growth of 23/4 per cent. Inflation is expected to continue coming down sharply, reaching 1 per cent by the end of this year. I am writing to the Governor of the Bank of England, in the usual way, to confirm that the inflation target remains unchanged at 2 per cent. Retail prices index inflation is forecast to remain negative, falling to minus 3 per cent. by September, before moving back to zero next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000165">The deepening global recession has had an impact on the public finances here and in every country across the world, and in this Budget, I will set out steps to ensure that they are on a sustainable path. And owing to the measures that I will announce today, the current deficit is expected to halve within four years. But before I turn to that, I want to set out the additional help we will give to people and businesses to get through the recession&#151;and build towards recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000166">We know from previous recessions that people&#146;s greatest fears are the loss of their job and their family home. All over the world, as the economy slows, unemployment is rising. In the UK, the claimant count increased in February by 137,000. Today&#146;s figures show that in March it went up by 74,000&#151;making the total claimant unemployment rate 4.5 per cent. It is not in any Government&#146;s power to prevent all job losses, and, even when the recovery is under way, it will take time for unemployment to start falling. But Governments must give people targeted help to find new jobs as quickly as possible and, where necessary, to gain the new skills which will allow them to do this. This is not just morally the right thing to do, but economically essential. All the evidence shows that the longer people are out of work, the more difficult it becomes for them to re-enter the labour market. So today I will announce steps to ensure that short-term job loss does not turn into a lifetime on benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09042264000167">The core of the Government&#146;s approach is the Jobcentre Plus network; its help has almost halved the average time that people spend out of work compared with previous recessions. Even in the tough economic conditions since November, it has helped over a million people move back into new employment. I am determined that this support can continue to be given to people who lose their jobs. In November, I increased resources for the Jobcentre Plus network and the new deal by &#163;1.3 billion. I can announce today an additional &#163;1.7 billion worth of funding, so that everyone can receive the high-level and high-quality support to which they are entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000168">Most people, even now, continue to find work within a matter of weeks, but we need to step up help to those who have greater difficulty in getting back into the labour market. So there will be additional support, through the flexible new deal, for people who have been out of work for 12 months. I am also determined that we do even more to protect young people from the damaging impact of long-term unemployment. The   <br>

alternative is a return to the days when a whole generation of young people found themselves abandoned to a future on the scrap heap. We will not repeat that mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000169">So I want to offer a guarantee. From January, everyone under the age of 25 who has been out of work for 12 months will be offered a job or a place in training. Those in work will receive a wage; those in training will receive additional money on top of their benefits. To provide these extra opportunities, we are working with employers to create or support as many as 250,000 jobs. That will include delivering local services and traineeships in social care and other high-demand sectors, as well as jobs for people of all ages in particularly badly hit communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000170">I also want to do more to help people gain the crucial skills that will be needed in the future. So, as part of my guarantee to young people, I will spend over &#163;260 million of new money for training and subsidies, to help them get the skills or experience that they need in sectors with strong future demand. We will also provide extra investment to ensure that we deliver on our guarantee for every 16 and 17-year-old who wants to stay in education or training, to make sure that they can do so. To deliver that, for the next two years I am providing a further &#163;250 million this year and &#163;400 million in 2010-11. That will allow an additional 54,000 places in sixth forms and further education colleges for students in the next academic year. For this and other measures, there will be consequential provisions, where appropriate, for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000171">I will shortly set out long-term measures for housing and for businesses to help build the recovery, but first I want to set out how we can offer more support now in these areas. One of the biggest fears when people lose their jobs is that they and their families will lose their homes, and I want to do more to reduce the number of repossessions. Last year, I increased and extended the support for mortgage interest scheme, which covers mortgage interest payments when people lose their jobs. Today I can announce that I will maintain the higher level of support for a further six months to help home owners as long as they look for a new job. That is in addition to the scheme to help people stay in their homes if their income falls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000172">The housing market is also being held back by a lack of mortgage credit, and the Government have already taken action to encourage an increase in mortgage lending; this year the major UK banks will increase the availability of mortgages by around &#163;20 billion. To build on this, today I can announce the introduction, following state aid approval, of the scheme to guarantee securities backed by mortgages. That will help ease the flow of mortgage finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000173">The recession and the credit crunch have made it much harder for people to take their first step on the housing ladder. This is not just difficult for those involved, but also undermines the entire housing market. So to help, I have decided to extend the stamp duty holiday on properties sold for less than &#163;175,000 until the end of the year. Sixty per cent. of residential properties will continue to be exempt, which will encourage modest and middle-income home buyers. I can also announce a further &#163;80 million extension to HomeBuy Direct, the Government shared equity mortgage scheme, which has  <br>

already received interest from over 32,000 people since last September. Altogether, this is additional support for those who lose their jobs and new help for people to get on to the housing ladder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09042264000174">In November I announced a series of measures to help businesses now. Over 100,000 businesses, which employ well over half a million people, have taken up the option to defer their tax bills, and I intend to continue this help. Some 800,000 smaller companies will benefit from the delay in the increase in corporation tax. Last month I announced that we would allow companies to spread out the payments of this year&#146;s uprating of business rates, but today I want to do more to help firms with cash-flow problems. Many viable companies face temporary difficulties because of the shortage of credit, so today I am extending the help which allows loss-making companies to reclaim taxes on profits made in the last three years. This help, which will lead on average to repayments worth &#163;4,000 each year, will now be available for two years until November 2010, and well over 100,000 businesses will have their full current losses entirely wiped out. Today I can also announce additional targeted support for companies&#146; cash flow, with a top-up trade credit insurance scheme, which will match private sector trade credit insurance provision if insurers reduce their cover to businesses operating in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000175">I also want to help the UK&#146;s automotive industry, which has been one of Britain&#146;s success stories over the last decade. But the loss of consumer confidence and credit crunch has led to a sharp fall in vehicle sales around the world. In order to help the car industry and retail trade, I can announce that we will implement a scrappage scheme next month. It will provide motorists with a &#163;2,000 discount on new cars bought when they trade in cars over 10 years old. It will be a time-limited scheme until March 2010. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will announce further details shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000176">We have made our choice to help those who have lost their jobs to find work quickly and, if needed, to learn skills. We are acting decisively to prevent a new generation of young people from becoming a lost generation. We are offering real support to home owners, and to businesses, through this unprecedented economic crisis. We could have decided to do nothing&#151;but we chose to act, because that is the right thing to do. By doing so, we have not just protected people but will also reduce the length and the severity of this recession, lessening the impact on our public finances in the medium term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000177">I now turn to the public finances and the action that I will take to put them on a sustainable footing in the medium and long term. As I told the House in November, tax revenues were falling. The financial sector, which provided 27 per cent. of corporate tax revenues, was already badly hit then. But since then, with the recession spreading across almost every sector, the wider tax take has also come down sharply. Corporation tax and income tax revenues have fallen. The problems in the housing market have meant a dramatic reduction in stamp duty. In the UK, tax as a share of GDP is 1.2 percentage points lower now than it was a year ago. Here and across the world, tax revenues are down, and it will take some years before they come back up. At the same time, our reformed welfare state is rightly providing support to families, but of course it does come at an added cost  <br>

to the Exchequer. Many countries have also intervened to strengthen their banking system, as we have. My public finances forecasts today include a provisional estimate for the potential cost of this, which totals 31/2 per cent. of our GDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000178">Around the world, fiscal deficits and Government debt have been rising sharply to levels not seen since the second world war. This is a response to an unprecedented financial crisis and a deep and widespread global recession. Allowing borrowing to rise&#151;protecting services, helping people and businesses&#151;is the right thing to do. The alternative&#151;to take money out of the economy now, as some have suggested&#151;would damage key public services, create more unemployment, lengthen the downturn and lead, in the end, to higher, not lower, debt. This Government, as well as others, have learned from the historic economic mistakes of the inter-war period that countries cannot deflate their way out of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para27"><a name="09042264000179">Taken together, my Budget measures today represent a fiscal easing of half a per cent. of GDP this year, followed by a tightening of 0.8 per cent. of GDP each year until 2013-14. I believe this is a sensible pathway to sustainable public finances. It will mean, as I have said, that the budget deficit will be halved in the next four years. At this stage, when there is so much uncertainty, to do so more quickly would prevent us from helping people now, choke off recovery, and stop us investing in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para28"><a name="09042264000180">Many countries, as a result of their action to support the economy, have seen higher deficits. In the United States, for example, the Congressional Budget Office expects the deficit to be 13 per cent. of GDP in 2009, 10 per cent. in 2010, and even in 2019, to be above 5 per cent. Our own figures for public sector net borrowing will be &#163;175 billion this year, or some 12 per cent. of GDP. From 2010, as the economy starts to recover, and the measures announced in November and today take effect, borrowing will fall to &#163;173 billion, then &#163;140 billion, &#163;118 billion, and then &#163;97 billion. As a share of GDP, our borrowing will be 11.9 per cent. of GDP next year, and then, as we move towards balance, 9.1 per cent. in 2011-12, then 7.2 per cent., and then 5.5 per cent. in 2013-14.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para29"><a name="09042264000181">This downturn will inevitably mean sharp increases in national debt relative to GDP. UK net debt, which includes the cost of stabilising the banking system, will, as a share of GDP, increase from 59 per cent. this year, to 68 per cent. next, then 74 per cent. in 2011-12, 78 per cent., and then 79 per cent. in 2013-14. It will stabilise and then begin to fall from 2015-16. In countries across the world, because of this economic crisis, it will take far longer for deficits to come back into balance. But because of the steps we are taking, I expect the underlying current budget to come back into balance two years later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para30"><a name="09042264000182">We need to help people now. We need to maintain key public services now. We need to invest in the future, but we also need to make sure that we maintain public finances on a sustainable footing. Indeed, this is the best way to drive up economic growth, which, in turn, is the best way to bring down borrowing and rebalance the public finances. We must to this within a time scale that does not damage the recovery. This will require tough decisions, but I am determined that they will be fair decisions.</p>

Over the last decade, we have taken a number of measures that have reduced tax evasion and avoidance&#151;on average, reducing avoidance by over &#163;1 billion a year. I intend to build on this today. We have identified loopholes and schemes which, when closed, will result in &#163;1 billion of extra revenue over the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para32"><a name="09042264000184">In this Budget, there will be new measures to help pensioners and savers on middle and modest incomes. It is important that everyone is encouraged to save for their retirement, and we will continue to support them to do so. But I intend to address an anomaly which sees a tiny proportion at the top taking a large slice of the help we give people to help to save. It is difficult to justify how a quarter of all the money the country spends on pensions tax relief goes, as now, to the top 11/2 per cent of earners. So from April 2011, I will restrict pension tax relief for those with incomes over &#163;150,000 so that it is gradually tapered to the same 20 per cent. that the majority of people receive. We will consult on its implementation. I am introducing measures from today to prevent forestalling, but again only those with incomes over &#163;150,000 will be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para33"><a name="09042264000186">I am not proposing to increase taxes on income for this year. However, as the economy recovers and wages start to grow again, it is right that we take additional steps. I believe that it is fair that those who have gained the most should contribute more. Only those with incomes over &#163;100,000 a year&#151;or 2 per cent. of the population&#151;will be affected. In November, I announced a new rate of income tax of 45 per cent. on incomes above &#163;150,000&#151;the top 1 per cent. of taxpayers. In order to help pay for additional support for people now and to invest in the future, I have decided that the new rate will be 50 per cent., and will come in from April next year&#151;a year earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90422-0004.htm_para34"><a name="09042264000187">In November, I also announced that I was reducing personal allowances for the very highest earners with incomes over &#163;100,000. These allowances are worth twice as much as those of basic rate taxpayers. I have now decided to withdraw fully the benefit of that allowance for those with incomes over &#163;100,000 from next April. These measures are necessary to build our recovery and secure our country&#146;s economic future.</p>

I will continue to monitor oil prices, but I expect that fuel duty will increase by 2p per litre in September, and then by 1p a litre above indexation each April for the next four years. Alcohol duties will go up by 2 per cent. from midnight tonight, and there will be an increase in tobacco duty of 2 per cent. from 6 o&#146;clock this evening. Taken together, these measures will raise over &#163;6 billion by 2012, to secure our economic future and to provide help for people now when they need it most.</p>

We have made our choice to continue investing in our public services, which underpin the health and strength of our nation now and in the future. In the past 10 years, that investment has seen an extra 40,000 doctors, 41,000 teachers and over 70,000 nurses. But just as every family   <br>

are looking closely at their own budget to ensure that they get the best value for money, so too should the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000190">Since 2004, the Government have identified and made &#163;26.5 billion in efficiency savings while continuing to invest to improve schools, hospitals and other public services. In November, I announced plans to find an extra &#163;5 billion of efficiency savings in 2010-11, on top of the &#163;30 billion in this spending review period. Some have argued that we should cut public services immediately, rather than invest and grow our way out of the recession. I believe that would be the wrong thing to do. I can confirm that we are able to secure these savings that year while increasing investment, as planned, for local health services by over 5 per cent. and for schools by over 4 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000191">Yesterday, we published the reports of the five independent reviews I set up last year. They have identified extra efficiencies from 2011 that rise to a further &#163;9 billion of additional savings a year by 2013-14. They include efficiencies in public sector back-office functions and IT, improved procurement and better collaboration, and innovation at a local level. This will allow us to protect front-line services, while keeping current spending growth, in real terms, at an average of 0.7 per cent a year from 2011-12 onwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000192">Capital spending is equally important to the future of our country. Over the past five years, this investment has transformed services. There are 61 major hospital schemes, 140 new schools and improved transport links including the modernisation of the west coast main line. It is essential to help create jobs, boost the recovery and deliver economic success in the long term. I intend that capital investment will continue at historically high levels to 2012, as we prepare for the Olympic games in Britain. After that, public sector net investment will be at 11/4 per cent. of GDP by 2013-14, twice as high as it was in 1997. Indeed, the efficiency savings we are making will help us direct more money to continue to support investment that everyone in this country depends on. We have set ourselves a central goal of realising up to &#163;16 billion of property and other asset sales in the three years from 2011-12, with the proceeds raised being used for new capital investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000193">As a result of the measures I have announced today, I can afford to make further investment in the future of this country. These funds will be invested now, to help ensure we seize the opportunities that will come from a world economy that is expected to double in size. I have already announced today &#163;3 billion-worth of extra support to help people find work quickly, with a new guarantee for young people. There will also be &#163;1 billion to help us combat climate change, by supporting low-carbon industries and green collar jobs. There is close to &#163;1 billion to help home owners, meet future housing supply and allow the construction industry to recover quickly, and there is &#163;2.5 billion for business, to encourage investment in the industries and high-paid, high-skilled jobs of the future&#151;sectors such as advanced manufacturing, the creative industries and the low-carbon technologies: all essential if we are to prepare for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000194">A successful economy needs a strong financial sector. We do not want to throw away the many advantages that come from our position as a world centre for  <br>

finance. I intend that we retain that position. Hundreds of thousands of jobs across the United Kingdom depend on it. We need to build trust in the banking system and harness the strengths of the financial services sector for the benefit of society. Crucial to that is financial regulation. I will publish shortly a Treasury paper with my recommendations for wide-ranging reform. It will propose action to reform corporate governance and remuneration at banks to avoid undue risk taking; to improve the regulation of capital and liquidity, so banks do not over-extend themselves; to increase transparency to achieve a single set of accounting rules so that we can see the risks that banks are taking; as well as to regulate all important institutions including hedge funds. It will also propose action to reduce the impact of the failure of financial firms. It will protect and support consumers and improve efficiency and competition in the financial markets as well as strengthening regulators&#146; powers. All these steps will, in turn, complement the agreement that we reached in London earlier this month to restore trust in the global financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000195">Strengthening the banking system is crucial to the recovery and to the economy, but the strength of our economy and the health of our society also depend on meeting the long-term demand for housing in this country. I have two measures that will help achieve that. First, we want to work with the industry to help tackle the restraints that house builders say could prevent them from acting now to increase housing supply. This will give construction firms more certainty and help them meet housing demand more effectively. Secondly, lack of finance now is affecting house builders and preventing the long-term investment that we need. So today I can announce &#163;500 million of extra financial support. This will kick-start building on housing projects that have been stalled because of the credit crunch, and will deliver thousands of new homes. As part of that support, we are providing &#163;100 million for local authorities to build new energy-efficient housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000196">I have one further announcement to make about housing for one particular group. The whole country and the House are united in admiration for the courage and professionalism of our armed forces, but I want to ensure that that admiration is reflected in the quality of their accommodation, so I am bringing forward &#163;50 million to accelerate the modernisation programme for that housing to ensure that this happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000197">Let me turn next to the targeted help for business, which will help build on the strengths of our economy. A sustained and strong recovery depends on companies of all sizes making the most of the new global opportunities that await them. A more competitive exchange rate will help exporters, but it is also vital to our recovery that Britain and other countries remain open to free trade. It is essential that the Export Credits Guarantee Department gives businesses the support that they need, and I intend to report back shortly on how the support can be improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000198">I have a number of proposals to encourage investment. There is, at the moment, less incentive to explore and extract oil from the North sea because of prevailing prices. So I am bringing forward incentives to encourage smaller fields to be brought into production, which could lead to an extra 2 billion barrels of oil and gas that would otherwise remain under the North sea. The incentives will also remove fiscal barriers, so that the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000199">I want other industries to invest, too. Businesses already benefit significantly from the annual &#163;50,000 investment allowance, which was announced two years ago. I want to go further to promote investment now. So for this year, I will double the main capital allowance rate to 40 per cent. That will encourage firms to bring forward investment, in particular those companies in the growth sectors that will deliver the rewarding jobs of the future. It will mean enhanced tax relief to support investment of up to &#163;50 billion this year. That includes &#163;10 billion of investment in the vital communications sector.</p>

So I am allocating extra funding for digital investment to help extend the broadband network to almost every community. That will allow us to deliver the vision set out in the &#147;Digital Britain&#148; report&#151;making sure that everyone can benefit from this communications revolution and creating thousands of skilled jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000201">Next, Government can and should do more to buttress the strength and capability that we need for our economic future. On Monday, the Government published a new industrial framework, the aim of which was to remove the barriers holding back innovative and fast-growing companies and to help markets work better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000202">To support that industrial activity and strategy, I can announce the setting up of a &#163;750 million investment fund to help the country seize the opportunities ahead. The new fund will provide financial support, focusing on emerging technologies and regionally important sectors in, for example, advanced manufacturing, digital and biotechnology. It will encourage exports, support inward investment, promote research and development and harness commercially our world-class science base. It will complement the two new city region pilots in Manchester and Leeds, which will also have a major role in promoting economic investment.</p>

In preparing for the future, Britain&#146;s economic recovery must be sustainable and protect the environment. These efforts also have the potential to create thousands of high-tech businesses and hundreds of thousands of high-skilled jobs.</p>

We are ahead of every other major developed country in progress against our Kyoto targets. Today, I am presenting the world&#146;s first ever carbon budget, which commits this country to cutting its carbon emissions by 34 per cent. by 2020. Those budgets will give industry the certainty needed to develop and use low-carbon technology&#151;cutting emissions and creating new businesses and jobs. They are a landmark step, which point the way to the vital decisions that must be made at the Copenhagen climate change summit later this year.</p>

Today, I can announce &#163;435 million of extra support to develop energy efficiency measures for homes, businesses and public buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000206">As well as saving energy, we need cleaner energy. We must build on Britain&#146;s status as a world leader in offshore power generation. However, I am aware that the credit squeeze is holding back major offshore wind projects. I want to lift the barriers&#151;through &#163;525 million of new financial support over the next two years for offshore wind, funded through the renewables obligation. The potential is enormous and I am confident that this will lead to major projects getting the go-ahead quickly, providing enough electricity to meet the needs of up to 3 million households. We need to support all forms of renewable energy. I can also announce that renewable and other energy projects in the UK stand to benefit from up to &#163;4 billion of new capital from the European Investment Bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000207">Coal, oil and gas will continue to be major sources of energy for the foreseeable future. Clean technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, are vital to ensure that we can produce power from those sources without damaging the environment. I am determined that this country&#146;s research and technological expertise is used to make us world leaders in this area as well. So I can announce that a new funding mechanism will be used to finance at least two, and up to four demonstration projects. The new generation of power plants could be even more efficient by using the heat produced in the generation of power. To encourage the use of combined heat and power technology, I will exempt those projects from the climate change levy from 2013, which will bring forward over &#163;2.5 billion in investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000208">I can also announce that, through &#163;405 million of new funding, we will encourage low-carbon energy and advanced green manufacturing in Britain to drive up the application of new technology as well as to invest in small-scale projects. In particular, that will help us strengthen the supply chain right across these sectors and build on the expertise that we have in this country.</p>

I am determined that we will replicate this success across the renewable energy and low carbon sectors. The steps that we are taking today will help make sure that we meet this ambition. They will also protect our planet and ensure the country&#146;s economic future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000210">The measures that I have announced today underline our vision of a confident and successful Britain. They offer support for people when they need it, but also hope for the future. They put in place the vital building blocks for recovery and the economic long-term success that we need. Everything that we have done&#151;whether supporting families now, maintaining investment in our public services and putting the nation&#146;s finances on a stable path&#151;is based on our values of fairness and opportunity. Even at this time of global difficulty, we are determined to continue building a fairer society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000212">The Government are determined to eradicate child poverty, so, first, I can announce that, from April next year, the child element of the child tax credit will increase by &#163;20. Secondly, children with disabilities need extra help to make the most of their potential, so we will add an extra &#163;100 a year to their child trust fund. For those with severe disabilities, it will be an extra &#163;200 each year. Thirdly, I can announce an increase in statutory redundancy pay from &#163;350 to &#163;380 a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000213">I have one further measure, which will help a small number of valued people in this country. Increasingly, grandparents play a big role in family life in looking after grandchildren. To reflect that, we will, for the first time, ensure that those caring responsibilities of grandparents of working age will count towards their entitlement to the basic state pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000214">I want also to announce further help for pensioners and savers. Earlier this month, pensioners on modest incomes got the biggest ever increase in pension credit while the basic state pension increased by &#163;4.55 a week. I want to reaffirm today our commitment to increasing the basic state pension by at least 2.5 per cent. So if retail prices index inflation this September is below zero, as we expect, pensioners can be confident that their pensions will rise in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000215">Last year, because of the steep increase in energy prices, I brought in a one-off increase in the winter fuel allowance. Energy prices are now expected to come down, but to help pensioners even more, I intend to maintain the allowance at the higher level for another year. That is worth &#163;250 for the over-60s and &#163;400 for the over-80s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para27"><a name="09042264000216">The fall in interest rates has been a welcome benefit to the economy and to millions of home owners whose mortgage costs have come down, but this has also reduced the amount of interest paid out on savings, and has particularly hit pensioners who rely on this extra money. There are more than 51/2 million pensioner households in this country who have modest savings of less than &#163;10,000, and I want to help them. For over a decade, the capital disregard on pension credit has been at &#163;6,000 or below. It means that savings above that level reduce the amount of help that households get through the pension credit. I believe that it is now time to increase those limits, which will help compensate modest-income pensioners with limited savings. So from  <br>

November of this year, the limit will be raised to &#163;10,000. That will benefit more than 500,000 pensioners on modest incomes, who will gain by an average of &#163;4 a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90422-0005.htm_para28"><a name="09042264000217">I have one other announcement that I want to make on savings. Tax-free individual savings accounts have been a great success. Eighteen million people have taken them out and have saved in them almost &#163;290 billion. Since they were introduced 10 years ago, the annual limit has been increased only once and it now stands at &#163;7,200. I want to go further, so to help savers on the 10th anniversary of ISAs, I intend to increase the total annual limits to &#163;10,200, of which &#163;5,100 can be saved in cash. The new limit will be introduced this year for all those aged 50 or over and will come in next year for everyone else.</p>

 Today everyone can see what an utter mess this Labour Government and this Labour Prime Minister have made of the British economy: the fastest rise in unemployment in our history, the worst recession since world war two and the worst peacetime public finances ever known. As of today, any claim that they have ever made to economic competence is dead, over, finished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09042264000224">This Chancellor has just told us that he will be doubling the national debt. He is planning to borrow &#163;348 billion over the next two years. That is more, over just two years, than every previous Government put together&#151;not just every Government since world war two and not even every Government since world war one, but every Government since the Bank of England was first founded more than 300 years ago. This Prime Minister has certainly got himself in the history books. He has written a whole chapter in red ink: Labour&#146;s decade of debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000225">The Chancellor rattled through those figures for borrowing, so let me read them slowly. The Government are set to borrow &#163;175 billion this year, followed by &#163;173 billion, and then &#163;140 billion&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> ]</i>&#151;he says he said that; he swallowed it&#151;and then &#163;118 billion. That means that over a four-year period, Britain will now be borrowing &#163;606 billion. They talk about child poverty, but with debt like that, our children will be in poverty for decades. It is a staggering amount and the price will be paid not by the incompetent Ministers who put us into this mess, but by families and businesses up and down our country. They will never forgive the people who have done this. Britain simply cannot afford another five years of Labour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000226">Even those figures are massaged. On page 204 of the Red Book, the Government are assuming that consumer demand will bounce back to pre-boom levels by 2011. That is what they are forecasting, and that is why they forecast the debt coming down so quickly. That would not be a U-shaped recovery; it would be a trampoline recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000227">What is the Chancellor&#146;s excuse for those dreadful borrowing figures? He just told us that this is a world recession. Of course other countries are suffering, but  <br>

there is not one single other major country in the world in a position as bad as the United Kingdom. [Hon. Members: &#147;Rubbish!&#148;] They say, &#147;Rubbish!&#148;, but there is not one country with a bigger budget deficit in any major economy. Why is that the case? Because the Government did not fix the roof when the sun was shining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000228">It is no good the Chancellor&#146;s pretending that the international factors were some sort of surprise. He knew that there was a world recession when he made those utterly useless forecasts in the November pre-Budget report last year. We now know that what he told us was a complete work of fiction. Let us take just one figure, the growth forecast. He told us that it would be minus 1 per cent., but he has had to downgrade it to minus 3.5 per cent. That is one of the biggest downgrades in the history of forecasting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000229">The figures are so bad that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have had to do a spectacular U-turn. For years they have lectured us about how departing from the Government spending programmes means swingeing cuts. Minister after Minister has stood at that Dispatch Box and said that any attempt to depart from the Government&#146;s rate of growth of spending means being savage or inhuman, and now they are doing it themselves. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> That is right&#151;that is what Labour Members were all cheering in that rather pathetic cheer at the end of the Budget speech. The Government have just announced more than &#163;10 billion of cuts over two years. For years, that was the Prime Minister&#146;s great dividing line, but he is suddenly on the wrong side of it. After today, no one will ever believe a word that they say about spending cuts ever again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000230">But the Budget still does not do enough to get the public finances under control. In two words, it is completely inadequate. Instead of putting up taxes in 2011, why does the Chancellor not get to grips with spending now and next year? Look at the consequences of failing to deal with spending. Look at the tax rises that he has announced today. Of course, the Government claim that it is just the rich who will pay&#151;and by the way, he has just broken a manifesto promise not to put up the top rate of tax, but people expect that from this lot anyway&#151;but look at the other taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000231">Look at the tax on beer. That is going to hit every drinker in every pub. Look at the tax on petrol. The Government are reintroducing the fuel duty exercise&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> ]</i>&#151;escalator. That is going to hit everyone who has to drive to work. Those people are not rich; they have to work hard, and they are going to pay the price for Labour&#146;s failure. Those are not taxes for the few; they are taxes for the many, introduced by this Labour Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000232">But what stands out most about today&#146;s Budget is how every single argument and every prediction that the Government have told us about has turned out to be wrong. They told us that the recession would be less severe than in the 1990s. I have lost count of the times that the Prime Minister has told me that over that Dispatch Box, but perhaps he would like to look at page 200 of the Red Book, which states:</p>
<a name="90422-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="09042264000649"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the current downturn is forecast to be much deeper than that of the early 1990s&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000233">He is condemned by his own Red Book. This is worse than the &#146;70s and it is worse than the &#146;80s or the &#146;90s. This is not just boom and bust; it is the worst boom and bust ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000234">Then the Government told us, in that November Budget report, that the recession would be over by the end of June. I know that the Chancellor does not want to remember what he said in November, but he said that growth would start early as a direct result of the cut in VAT. So by the Government&#146;s own criteria, the VAT cut has failed. The money was wasted and our debt is higher as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000235">What about the last big argument&#151;the one that the Prime Minister tried to get off the ground before the G20? Britain, we were told, was heading for another great fiscal stimulus. Well, where is it? Are we missing something? There is no fiscal stimulus here; there is a couple of extra billion added to what has already been announced. That is less than the cut in next year&#146;s capital budget. This is not a stimulus; it is a delayed tax rise and a delayed spending cut. The Chancellor could not provide a proper stimulus because he had run out of money. The Prime Minister sits there shaking his head, but he is the only person in Britain who does not realise how ridiculous he looked wandering around the world telling Governments everywhere else to open their cheque books and start spending, when the Governor of the Bank of England had taken the Prime Minister&#146;s cheque book and torn it up in public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000236">Of course we need schemes that will really help the unemployed and that will help British businesses, large and small. We have been calling for a proper credit guarantee scheme for six months. Before we get carried away with the schemes that have been announced today, I think we are entitled to ask what happened to the ones announced last year. The internship scheme: not working. The asset-backed security scheme: not working, but, incidentally, reannounced today. And what about HomeBuy Direct? The Chancellor told us today that it was to be given another &#163;80 million. What a treat for HomeBuy Direct! There is only one problem: we asked some parliamentary questions and found out that, by 25 March, not a single sale had been made through the existing scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000237">What about the home owners&#146; mortgage support scheme? Peter Mandelson was meant to be in charge of that one, and he knows a thing or two about getting a good mortgage, so you would think that he might have succeeded. It was the centrepiece of the Queen&#146;s Speech last year but now, four months later, the Government have just announced it all over again. And still not a single home owner has received a single penny under the scheme. What a disgrace! What a callow farce from this Government! The Chancellor also told us about his scrappage scheme. Let me see if I can get this right. We take something that is 10 years old; it is completely clapped out, it pumps out hot air, pollutes its surroundings and is absolutely ripe for the knacker&#146;s yard. What a brilliant idea!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000238">Where does all this leave the Prime Minister&#146;s big argument&#151;the one he based his whole premiership on&#151;that he would always be prudent with the nation&#146;s finances? Barely a year ago, he described a deficit of 8 per cent. as being completely out of control. So how  <br>

would he describe a deficit today of 11.9 per cent.? That is more than Denis Healey borrowed when he was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09042264000239">Let me turn to the IMF, as the Chancellor might well have to. I would love to read out a list of countries that the IMF says are heading for a larger deficit than Britain&#146;s next year. I can&#146;t; there aren&#146;t any. Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Argentina are all heading for deficits half the size of ours. Is it any wonder that, in a not-very-noticed announcement, Ministers chose this time to announce&#151;some of you might have missed this&#151;that they wanted to remove the stigma on countries going to the IMF. One Minister actually said that the IMF should be seen as something to celebrate&#151;I am not making this up, I promise&#151;and a bit like</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000241">This Budget was a missed opportunity. We need to move from an economy of borrow and spend to an economy of save and invest. The Government talked about the disregard, but why not give proper help in the tax system for people who save? Where was the plan to regulate the banks and to regulate credit properly? Is it not time to end the tripartite system and to restore the Bank of England to its proper role of regulating debt in the economy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000242">On the fiscal side, the Chancellor has scrapped his fiscal rules and his spending plans, but he has put absolutely nothing in their place. That is why we need spending restraint now and an office for budget responsibility for the future. I have to say to the Chancellor and the Prime Minister that no one will believe that the Government are going to sort out the public finances when the Prime Minister says that they are going to make a serious start only in 2011. We all saw what they are doing today: introducing a few clever, political taxes on the rich before the election while saving up any real tax increases until 2011. But look what we have got between now and then: another Queen&#146;s Speech, another pre-Budget report and another Budget. The Prime Minister sits there in his bunker talking about all the brave things that he is going to do in 2011. Is there no one left to tell him that he has to hold an election between now and then? They just do not get it; they cannot see what is actually wrong. He will never bring in the changes required because he does not accept that the economic model that he has run for 12 years, based on Government debt, consumer debt and housing debt, is fundamentally bust. This Prime Minister can never be the future because he does not understand what went wrong in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000243">The fundamental truth is that all Labour Governments run out of money. The last Labour Government gave us the winter of discontent; this Labour Government have given us the decade of debt. The last Labour Government left the dead unburied; this one leaves the debts unpaid. They sit there, running out of money, running out of moral authority and running out of time. We have to ask ourselves: what on earth is the point of another 14 months of this Government of the living dead? If they do not have the courage to deal with the debt and take the difficult decisions, why not make way for the team that can?</p>

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="09042264000244"><a name="90422-0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="09042264000799"><b>Mr. Nick Clegg (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b>
 The economic crisis is unprecedented in many ways&#151;its scale, its speed, its reach&#151;so people are looking for something bold and distinctive from this Government. Let us think back to the great Budgets of our history. The people&#146;s Budget of 1909 introduced the first pension and the first social insurance. Labour&#146;s post-war Budgets built a new nation from the rubble of war. What made those Budgets great was their ambition, and their coherent vision for a different future. That is what we needed today, in the aftermath of this generation&#146;s disaster. The worst of times demand the best of Budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000245">So what did we get today? We got a mishmash of recycled announcements from a Government skilled in raising false hopes but incompetent in delivering practical help. The Chancellor had a choice: he could have used this Budget to get practical help to the millions of people struggling in this recession. He could have given a people&#146;s Budget for the 21st century. Instead, we got just another politician&#146;s Budget, desperately rushing around for half-baked ideas to save the skin of this failing Government. This Budget is a political supermarket sweep, a trolley full of random promises, but without even a hint of a plan or of any real likelihood that the promises will be put into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000246">The growth predictions in this Budget stoke up false hopes. The Chancellor says that the economy will grow by 1.25 per cent. next year, and by 3.5 per cent. by 2011. He says that &#163;15 billion can be shaved from public spending without cancelling a single Whitehall project. Given the lamentable failure of this Government to get their own predictions right, people will be asking what kind of fantasy world they are living in these days. If they get things wrong again&#151;particularly the growth predictions&#151;even greater pain will be necessary to get the Government accounts in order in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para22"><a name="09042264000247">The economic crash is not the result of a few minor mistakes, and patchwork repairs will not fix it. We need to do things fundamentally differently, and that will need to start with a different kind of banking system, although that barely warranted a mention in today&#146;s Budget. Just because the subject is off the front pages today, that does not mean that the problems in our banks have been solved. Businesses are still not getting loans. Banks are still in a mess. The problems have to be sorted: we need a banking system in which no bank is too big to fail, in which high street banks take no unnecessary risks with other people&#146;s money, and in which risky casino-type investment banking is cut loose to fail when things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000248">The biggest disappointment in this Budget is its failure to sort out Britain&#146;s unfair tax system, and its failure to put money into people&#146;s pockets to help them to make it through this recession. Britain&#146;s taxes are still too heavy on those who can least afford them, and too easy to avoid for those who know how to do so. That is how this Government&#151;and, I think, the Conservatives&#151;seem to want it. We are now the only party that will do things differently, and get practical help, through lower taxes, to people who are really struggling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000249">This week, we explained that, if we took aggressive action to clamp down on all the loopholes and exemptions that benefit the richest people and the biggest businesses,   <br>

it would be possible&#151;even in a recession&#151;to cut most earners&#146; income tax bills by &#163;700 by raising the income tax threshold to &#163;10,000 for everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000250">The Government have finally accepted today, having spent years telling us it was not possible, that one of the most unfair loopholes&#151;the doubling of the tax relief on pension contributions from the highest earners, compared to people on ordinary incomes&#151;should be changed, but they have only tinkered with the loophole today by removing the benefit only from the tiny minority of people earning more than &#163;150,000. Like the Chancellor&#146;s other tokenistic measures applying to the highest earners, it will raise very little money&#151;only &#163;200 million, according to his own Red Book&#151;while leaving in place the really big loopholes such as the lower 18 per cent. tax on capital gains. That, in effect, serves as a massive subsidy for the very rich when we should be doing everything we can to cut taxes for people who really need help. Our proposals would ensure that 4 million of the lowest paid would no longer have to pay any income tax at all. Our proposals would put fairness and transparency back into this Government&#146;s woefully unfair and complex tax system, and I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to take up our ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000251">It is not too late to sort out Labour&#146;s failed fiscal stimulus either. There should have been proposals in this Budget to end the pointless VAT cut and replace it with a stimulus package that actually works. Billions have already been poured down the drain, but if the Chancellor stopped the VAT cut now, he would still have &#163;8.5 billion to spend better elsewhere. Just imagine what could be done with that money. We could create thousands of real jobs, as well as lay the foundations for a different, greener economy. We could insulate 2 million homes and every school and hospital in the country, which cannot be done with the piffling amount announced today. We could build new council houses, upgrade public transport with new train carriages and re-open railway lines and railway stations. For every minute that goes by, &#163;22,000 is wasted on the VAT cut, and every minute that goes by, someone else in Britain loses their job. It is not too late to turn things around. We could cancel the VAT cut, put the money into green jobs, and have a quicker recovery and a stronger country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para27"><a name="09042264000252">This mishmash Budget includes a litany of missed opportunities. I welcome the Chancellor&#146;s announcements on pensions, but will he confirm that he has still not addressed the fact that many pensioners receive pension credits on the absurd assumption that they are making a 10 per cent. return on their savings?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para28"><a name="09042264000253">I have lost count of the number of Government announcements on housing&#151;we have had another one today&#151;yet fewer new affordable homes are being built than ever, young people still cannot get a foot on the housing ladder and the Government persist with their deeply misguided policy of subsidising people to take on new debt in a falling housing market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para29"><a name="09042264000254">Then there is the huge dilemma of how balance and discipline can be restored to the Government&#146;s finances in future. Today&#146;s figures of projected national debt will cast a dark shadow over future generations, but one thing is more important than anything else when it comes to the public finances&#151;growth. Without growth, there will be no money anywhere to pay off the nation&#146;s debt. That means that we must not pull the rug out from under the British economy just as it is struggling to get  <br>

up off the floor. So the Conservatives are, I believe, just plain wrong to propose slashing budgets immediately, which would be an act of monumental economic masochism. But the Government are wrong, too, to commit right now to the biggest fiscal contraction in the OECD&#151; according to the Government&#146;s own figures published this morning, they have committed to a massive 16.75 per cent. cut in capital investment by 2011 when they have no idea what the economy will look like by then and no idea of whether cuts would kill off growth just as it gets going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para30"><a name="09042264000255">We should remember that this time last year, the Chancellor said that the economy would be growing by 2.5 per cent. today, and yet it is now registering 3.5 per cent. negative growth. Six months ago, he said that the recession would be over by 1 July. The Chancellor may fancy himself as the new Mystic Meg, but he should get out of the predictions game. We do not know where the economy is going, so we simply must keep our options open until growth is restored, when we will need to face difficult choices. That is the only honest approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para31"><a name="09042264000256">The Chancellor should adopt an honest approach on spending, too. He is trying to pretend that &#163;15 billion can be stripped from public spending without anyone noticing, but talk of pain-free efficiency savings is a joke. We all remember Gershon. All it proved is that money can be moved from one column to another and called a saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90422-0006.htm_para32"><a name="09042264000257">The Liberal Democrats would do things differently. We would take big choices about what the Government should and should not do in the medium term, once growth has kicked in again. We would ask difficult questions: is the 50 per cent. target for university students either necessary or affordable; what is our international military role and how much should we spend on it; are exceedingly generous pension entitlements for well paid public servants fair or affordable? We need a national debate about what the state can and cannot afford in the future, not Whitehall salami slicing today. That is the responsible way&#151;the honest way&#151;to reduce spending in the years ahead and avoid painful higher taxes.</p>

Today was an opportunity to deliver practical help, but Labour is out of ideas and out of steam. Today the Labour Government have condemned us to years of unemployment and decades of debt.

Mention has been made of help for young people, particularly students and school leavers, about 600,000 of whom will be leaving education this summer for an uncertain job market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90422-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000261">In the past, there existed a social contract where individuals as well as companies were free to prosper or fail on their own merits, but with the collapse of the banking sector and the necessity to rescue the banks, which took devastating risks with ordinary people&#146;s money, that social contract has been damaged. Trust and confidence in the banking sector need to be re-established. That will not be an easy task; it will be a long and painful task. In the midst of that, people are looking for a fairer society, which is why I welcome a number of the measures announced by the Chancellor today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90422-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000262">The Treasury Committee will be scrutinising the Budget over the next week; indeed, we will have three evidence-taking sessions and will hopefully be able to report to the House in time for Second Reading of the Finance Bill a week on Tuesday. When we scrutinised the 2008 pre-Budget report, the Committee recognised the uncertainty of the economic outlook, but was concerned that the Treasury&#146;s forecasts were on the optimistic side, as has been proved. In the next week or two, we will cast a scrutinising eye over these growth forecasts and the plans over the next six or 10 years to balance the budget to achieve an even fiscal landscape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90422-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000263">I have already mentioned the Treasury Committee visits around the country. We found that access to lending was an important issue then, as it still is now. The banks claim that they are increasing access to credit, but we heard in our visits that small businesses were still unable to access the lending that they need to keep going. The work of the Lending Panel, which the Government have established, is hugely important. I would like to see the results of that panel published at least every quarter, so that we can keep a handle on exactly what the banks are doing and on how much lending is actually taking place.</p>

 On those visits, was the right hon. Gentleman aware of, or did he come across, the fact that quite a few businesses, far from getting more lending, are experiencing a squeeze on their overdraft facilities, which are being reduced by the very banks that are promising to be more generous? Will his and his Committee&#146;s investigations perhaps consider whether anything in the Budget might force the banks to be more generous with their overdraft facilities, and certainly not reduce them, when those companies are desperate to invest?</p>

 What we did hear from businesses was that they would rather be paying higher interest rates than, say, some of the arrangement fees that the banks were imposing on them&#151;in a number of cases, four or five times the value of what they were paying the previous year. Those are hidden charges from the banks, so they go on the profit and loss account. There is a need for transparency here and for a lot of work to be done, but I welcome the measures that the Chancellor announced today with regard to business support.</p>

There is legitimate concern about the sustainability of Government borrowing and it is vital that in our plans for economic recovery the path back to a balanced budget is clearly outlined. Next week, the Committee will be looking at that, as well as at the efficiency programme that the Chancellor announced. In an inquiry over the next month or so, the Treasury Committee Sub-Committee will consider where those efficiency cuts are taking place. Mention has been made of the fact that it will not be front-line jobs that are involved and we hope, for sure, that that will be the case. We will certainly be subjecting the Department to that scrutiny to ensure that front-line jobs are maintained.</p>

 As I said, the Budget has been presented against an uncertain background, but the right hon. Gentleman should look to some of the economic gurus whom he respects, such as Sam Brittan of the <i> Financial Times</i>. Sam Brittan will say that we should be quite relaxed about public borrowing at the end of the day. Indeed, I refer the right hon. Gentleman to Sam Brittan&#146;s article of 27 March, in which he says that in the second world war we borrowed against a bank rate of 0.5 per cent. What for? To ensure that we went to war producing guns that killed people. So why, in the words of Sam Brittan, should we not borrow to ensure that we get people back to work and off the dole&#151;a lifetime penalty?</p>

 Is not there a real difference between now and the age that Sam Brittan writes about? When we were trying to balance our wartime budget, there were other major allies who were in surplus and only too willing to lend to us. They are also now in deficit and wishing to borrow.</p>

 There is a major difference. We have a global crisis&#151;it is being experienced across the whole world. I was in the United States last week and people are talking about the budget deficit being 12 per cent., the sustainability of US accounts and the stress testing of US banks, so certainly we are in a different world. If people do not grasp the fact that we are in a global downturn and that we are avoiding a depression in the world rather than a recession, they have not got it.</p>

I have been seeking a Budget that protects the most vulnerable people in our society and that prepares the economy for the future&#151;an economy that is changing enormously. I welcome the comments and commitments made by the Chancellor regarding climate change and green technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90422-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000274">The Chancellor&#146;s announcements regarding the steps that he will be taking to support the labour market are welcome, but I feel that we have to be alert and that perhaps more has to be done. We had the news this morning that unemployment is 2.1 million. That is still rising, despite the fact that some are saying that the economy will turn at the end of the year. We will still face rising unemployment, so this is a crisis with a human face. Unemployment can cause massive psychological and emotional strain. As we know, it affects not only the unemployed, but their families and friends and their wider communities. It has a particularly lasting impact on young people, so it is important that the Government help young people. The measures announced today are welcome in that regard.</p>

 In the north-east of Scotland specifically and across the UK, 500,000 jobs depend on investment in the North sea. The Chancellor has gone some way to recognise that with his scheme for the field allowance, but that scheme was dreamed up in a time of much higher oil prices, when the challenge was how to get incremental developments. Will the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Select Committee consider whether the needs of the wider industry could be addressed by taking it further into current developments and by bringing forward tax relief for new entrants, so that they can deal with the missing cash flow caused by the banking crisis?</p>

 I welcome the commitments made by the Chancellor today to provide funding to open fields that were previously unprofitable.

A couple of weeks ago, I hosted a meeting in Parliament with Professor David Blanchflower, the departing member of the Monetary Policy Committee. He predicted that unemployment could be 4 million by 2011 or 2012. That is a dismal background, but it illustrates why we need to keep helping people if there is such a background. If that is the case, we will find that the Government are spending money to assist people.</p>

The Government&#146;s commitments on child poverty, while admirable, still have a long way to go to ensure that we eliminate child poverty by 2020.

The Government&#146;s moves to create jobs are important in the light of the fight against child poverty, because long-term parental unemployment is one of the biggest causes of child poverty.

Some years ago the Government commissioned a report from Kate Barker, who was a member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the time. According to her, between 120,000 and 140,000 houses needed to be built each year. That is an ambitious target, but we are moving along the path towards it.

banking crisis and which we are no longer prepared to accept. In the future, our economic growth should not be driven by risky banking practices. At this stage, it is important for us to take a long-term view and to invest in areas that will be drivers for growth, including high-value manufacturing. Our infrastructure will also need investment to support a post-recession economy which, as I pointed out earlier, will be less centred on the City of London. The Treasury Committee is conducting an inquiry into the banking crisis, and we hope to publish our first report in the next week or so.

Some people in the City have their heads down, thinking that the storm will pass and that in a couple of years they will be able to renew the old practices and the old ways of doing things. The old practices and the old ways of doing things should be consigned to the dustbin of history, and new ways, involving putting customers at the forefront of banks and financial services&#146; interests, should be promoted.</p>

As the Chancellor knows, it was a shocking lack of corporate governance that led to the demise of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. In the case of Royal Bank of Scotland, the problem was the acquisition of ABN AMRO. The then chairman of RBS, Tom McKillop, told the Committee that the bank had bought ABN AMRO at three times the market value price. It bought the company on 15 October 2007, a month after the crash. That was a mistake that brought the bank down. The chairman of HBOS, Lord Stevenson, acknowledged that there had been mad, risky lending and no oversight of the risk assessment, and that that had brought the bank to its knees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90422-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000289">On the boards of those banks were people whom we would term the great and the good&#151;very influential people with a track record in the financial services industry&#151;but they did not make a squeak, because profits were coming through the door. They turned their faces in the other direction. We must have a corporate governance system which ensures that risk is assessed. At the end of the day, the long-term interest of the company rather than the short-term interests of the executives should prevail. Sadly, it is the latter that we have seen in the banking crisis to date.</p>

Opposition parties will argue that we need to cut public spending dramatically, but cutting public spending dramatically is the wrong way to go about things at present. It would appear from the comments of the Leader of the Opposition that if the Conservatives were in power the cost would be even higher, because they would fail to take action to protect jobs and homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para0"><a name="09042264000299">Let us look first at the economic forecasts. I am grateful that at last, after it had become obvious to everyone else in the country, the Government have accepted that there will be a very serious downturn this year. After all the lying, weaving and ducking outside this House and the funny figures given inside it, we now discover that even the Government admit that there is going to be the most severe recession since the war&#151;not only the deepest, but also the longest. We now have a Government who admit that there is not about to be an upturn any time soon. According to the new forecast, the magic Ides of July will come and go without us seeing the green shoots, let alone the recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000300">As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition memorably said, the Government are forecasting a trampoline recovery some time later, with most of the benefits of this improbable gymnastics delayed until after the general election, because they do not want the electorate to be able to compare what actually happens with the ridiculous forecasts they are now coming up with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000301">Why is it that after 12 years of this Labour Government, who said they were married to Prudence and had learned the lessons of their trip to the International Monetary Fund and of previous economic crashes, we now see this Government in complete disarray, presiding over not just a big increase in debt, not just a whopping increase in debt, not just a colossal increase in debt, but a bigger increase in debt than all previous Governments from time immemorial over a millennium in this country had managed to borrow together? If someone had made that up for a BBC drama, I think that I would have been one of the first people moaning again that the BBC had overdone it and that the plot was preposterous. Yet that is what today&#146;s figures tell us; they tell us that the Government are seriously suggesting that they should, and they can, and they will, borrow more money in a couple of years than all previous Governments added together over many centuries, including all the war debt that we still have, inherited from those earlier tragic and difficult times when different rules and priorities clearly applied on a cross-party basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000302">How did the Government get into such a dreadful quagmire? There are three main reasons. First, they foolishly, rashly and needlessly committed this country&#146;s public accounts to two extremely large banks&#151;banks which, as my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench have again memorably said, were too big to fail and too big to bail. The Government were quite wrong to force those banks, at the fateful weekend in question, into trying to find capital that quickly, and they were quite wrong to say that the taxpayer would stand behind those banks and buy all those new shares at too high a share price, which they forced upon the poor reluctant taxpayer. There were many ways of sorting out and standing behind those banks without putting all that taxpayer cash on the line, and the last thing we needed to do in the parlous financial condition we already found ourselves in was put the taxpayer fully, squarely and completely behind the &#163;3 trillion of liabilities on those two massive bank balance sheets, with all the consequences that followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000303">I have not had a chance to read the detailed figures, which were not released to Members of Parliament until immediately after the Chancellor sat down, and of course, the Chancellor did not give us the actual cash figures for his current view of how much those banks  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Apr 2009">

<notus-date day="22" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>22 Apr 2009 : Column 265</b><br>
are going to lose us. However, he did say in his statement that he now recognises that there will be material losses for the taxpayer. We have heard the figures in the press; as always, we could have learned most of the Budget in advance by listening to the media over the weekend preceding it, and in the days before we in this House are graced with some kind of statement&#151;and then if we really want to know what is going on, we have to go away and read the documents, because they contain at least some of the bad figures that the Government wish to conceal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000304">We have gathered, however, that the debate is between the Chancellor and the IMF. We learn that the Chancellor thinks that the Government are going to lose &#163;60 billion on the banks. I will be delighted if they only lose &#163;60 billion on the banks, as I have always forecast that they will lose a lot more than that&#151;but let us just think about this: that is &#163;60 billion of needless losses subsidising rich bankers and foolish banks. Why do a Labour Government want to do that? Do they not realise that that is &#163;1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country? What could my constituents do with &#163;1,000 per head extra this year? Would it not have been better to have given them the money so they could have sorted their own lives out and bought a few more things to create some demand, rather than to tip that &#163;60 billion down the drain by making the taxpayer stand behind the banks and pay for those losses?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000305">The IMF, however, says it thinks the losses will be &#163;200 billion, and I fear that it is nearer the mark. We understand that some of the very expensive spin doctors and Treasury officials employed at our expense have thought it a productive use of their time to try to get the IMF to calculate its figures again&#151;in other words, &#147;If there&#146;s a problem, let&#146;s try to spin our way out of it.&#148; I urge the IMF not to be too lenient with these Ministers and this Treasury, because I fear the losses are, as the IMF has said, going to be all too large. It shows the Government&#146;s priorities that when they nationalise the banks they will not accept that there is any possibility of loss at all, when they have the autumn statement they leave all the figures on the banks out of the borrowing because the borrowing looks too awful with the banking figures included, and when they finally get to the Budget they realise that none of the commentators and City experts are going to buy the idea that there will be no losses on those banks, so they come up with a figure rather smaller than those of the serious commentators and hope to get away with it, and when no less a body than the IMF rumbles them, they send the spin doctors out to deal with it and try to get the figures massaged in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000306">That is the first reason why we are so colossally in debt and so hugely at risk. Never before have a British Government been stupid enough to nationalise banks that in aggregate are bigger than the national income. Never before has a group of Ministers blundered into such a colossal and risky financial commitment as this group of Ministers has. Given the questions I have asked over the months about this, I feel that when they took the decision they had no idea how big the thing they were taking on was, and they certainly had no idea that only &#163;1 in every &#163;7 on the RBS &#163;2 trillion balance sheet was a loan to a British person or British company. Like them, I want to make sure that British companies  <br>

and British people do not suffer because of the awful credit crunch. Of course I wish to see the creditors protected, and of course I wish to see lending resume at sensible levels in this country, but only &#163;1 in every &#163;7 on the RBS balance sheet was doing any of those things, yet this Government had to blunder into backing the whole balance sheet, and who knows how much they will lose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000307">How much do the Government reckon they will lose on the &#163;500 billion casino bank within RBS that they have bought? What action have they taken to protect the taxpayer interest? Have they instructed those bankers to close down the dangerous positions? Have they asked them to calculate the losses and take the ones that could get bigger? Have they agreed with them that they will net out a lot of the positions so we can begin to see what we have got and start to reduce the total risk for the taxpayer? I do not think they have done any of these things. I do not think they have got a clue; I do not think that they care. They thought it was a great idea to nationalise a bank. They thought that would give them control over the economy. They will learn the hard way that they do not control the banks&#151;the banks now control them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000308">The second reason why we are so deeply in debt&#151;and, even worse, a reason why we will get increasingly into debt under this Government&#151;is the very violent boom-bust cycle that they have unleashed upon our poor economy. This is a boom-bust cycle that was made particularly violent in Britain by wrong policy here in Britain. This is the Government that, when it was becoming obvious to many outside critics that a huge credit explosion was under way, instead of calming the flames by taking some of the material off the bonfire, decided to stoke it some more. This is the Government who, instead of saying to the private sector, &#147;You&#146;re overdoing the off-balance-sheet borrowing, boys and girls,&#148; went out and said, &#147;Do more off-balance-sheet borrowing. We&#146;ll show you how to do it. We&#146;re going to finance most of our public projects on the never-never on an off-balance-sheet basis so that people don&#146;t realise that we&#146;re building up extra public debt, don&#146;t know that we have broken all our own rules, and don&#146;t know that we are doing this on the never-never in the hope that some future Conservative Government are better at running the public books and are able to pay the interest and the debts off.&#148;</p>

 I agree with everything my right hon. Friend says about the appalling state of private finance initiatives, but unfortunately, I disagree with him in one small area: this debt is not on the never-never, as it will have to be repaid. Indeed, it will have to be repaid during the second half of the next decade and beyond, and will be a drag on any recovery that this economy could possibly hope for in that period.</p>

 I was using &#147;never-never&#148; in the common sense&#151;I meant as a way of financing oneself&#151;but we all know that, as my hon. Friend rightly says in correcting me, the never-never is the ever-ever; it is ever-ever with us, and we will have to repay it. These Ministers thought that they could get the glory for the spending and leave the bills with the British taxpayers. These Ministers thought that they could do the borrowing round the corner and leave it off the balance sheet, and that would stimulate the economy. These Ministers thought that if they are having a drink and drugs party on Prudence&#146;s  <br>

grave, why not let the public sector lead the way and buy more of the drinks, while the private sector is encouraged to do exactly the same thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000311">Far from being the surprised moral Government who did not quite understand how things were out of control, and who can now condemn bankers for getting it wrong, this was the Government who were leading the never-never society, were leading the charge and were leading the off-balance-sheet movement, and who were urging the financial markets of Britain to come up with ever cleverer and, unfortunately, dearer ways of feeding the public monster that they were creating&#151;this huge debt machine in which they were revelling&#151;so that they could have more press releases and more initiatives, and try to give people the impression that they were investing. If only they had been investing, it might have been a good idea&#151;but they were not investing. They were squandering and wasting, and they were not getting the efficiencies, improvements and extra services that we would have liked. There needed to be some extra spending&#151;Governments always have to spend extra on services to improve them&#151;but they were blowing the money in all sorts of ways, not just on nationalising banks, but in ways that I shall examine briefly in the third part of my comments, which will deal with public spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000312">The Government made the cycle worse by the lack of spending discipline and by the over-borrowing in the public sector, and by rigging the inflation target at the end of 2003&#151;a little before the 2005 election. They saw that the Bank of England&#146;s Monetary Policy Committee was likely to have to put interest rates up, because it could see that inflation was perhaps going to get out of control and credit was a bit too lively. So what did the then Chancellor do? He changed the target to one that was performing much more modestly than the retail prices index, and I am sure that he knew, because he is a clever man who studies these things, that by changing that target, interest rates would have to be kept lower for longer. That fateful decision&#151;that decision to encourage the borrowing binge in the private sector by keeping rates too low for too long&#151;stoked up the private sector half of the violent cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000313">By 2007, when it was becoming clear even to the Government that they had overdone it, they allowed or encouraged the monetary authorities to put the brakes on. We lurched from careering up the motorway at 140 miles an hour to trying to do a complete stop&#151;an emergency brake&#151;by putting interest rates up and withdrawing funds from the market. They overdid it, so we lurched from excessive boom to excessive bust, and we, the passengers in the car, were hurled towards the windscreen by the effort to bring the vehicle to a grinding halt. It was a disgraceful piece of bad driving for which the Government will not be forgiven for a very long time by the electorate, who can see that British actions&#151;actions by the authorities here in the United Kingdom&#151;made the cycle more violent and worse. China, India and Germany did not have this sort of cycle, but we had it here, because our authorities were uniquely incompetent and uniquely unable to see how they were overdoing it in both directions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000314">The third reason why we are so massively in debt is that Labour has blown it with its public sector spending programmes.

teachers, nurses or doctors; Labour Members should accept that all of us, from all parties, come into politics because we want better schools, better hospitals, better public services and better standards. If they were to examine the record of past Governments, they would see that every Government, be it Labour, Liberal or Conservative, have every year, or nearly every year, increased expenditure on those vital front-line services and the people who deliver them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o114"><a name="09042264000315"><a name="90422-0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="09042264000814"><b>Anne Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b>
 The Chancellor should be thanking the good people of St. Albans, who pay the most into his coffers but get the least back in terms of being able to deliver front-line services. My area rattles around at the bottom of the league table in what we get back, so we struggle. I am sure that the good people of St. Albans will wonder how on earth they are going to manage with the new cuts that the Government will be putting in place, given that they have been struggling in the good times. All the things that I heard in the Budget to do with the stamp duty holiday for homes worth up to &#163;175,000 do not help St. Albans. I heard nothing about small business rate relief for my local small businesses; in St. Albans that relief does not even kick in. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will agree that the Chancellor seems to have abandoned places such as St. Albans, merely seeing them as cash cows: he just spends the money.</p>

 For St. Albans read Wokingham; my hon. Friend has spoken powerfully for me, for herself and for many of our right hon. and hon. Friends. Our constituents, by and large, pay the bills, go to work, work hard, are prudent and save&#151;they do all the things that, we hope, Governments of all persuasions wish them to do&#151;but we are the ones who get socked with the tax bills, and we do not get any of the extra money if the Government are thinking of money for better schools or hospitals. It is very noticeable how unfair the system has been. The Conservative Government to whom I belonged always gave more to areas with greater needs&#151;and of course that is fair, and a common-sense approach&#151;but the situation has now become extreme. Our areas have needs too, and, as my hon. Friend rightly says, the distribution system is very unfair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000317">I wish to draw attention to the two economies out there: the huge divide in modern Britain is between those of us who work in the public sector and those who work in the private sector. The big divide is between those who are trying to run small and medium-sized entrepreneurial businesses and their staff, and those who are in the large bureaucracies of the public sector&#151;those in the quangos, the councils and the Whitehall Departments. There is a monumental sense of injustice, because when we talk here about tough choices we are talking about whether we increase public spending at 2 per cent. or 1 per cent. in real terms&#151;above the inflation level&#151;or about whether we are going to have three nice extra things or one nice extra thing in our budgets, but what people in private sector companies are talking about during this awful recession is whether they close one factory or two factories out of their three or four, and whether they get rid of 20 per cent. of the work force today or whether they may have to fire 25 per cent. of the work force in two months&#146; time because demand is so low. They also talk about how they can halve their stock levels because they cannot  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09042264000318">I do not think that these Ministers have a clue how tough it is out there for private sector businesses. I do not think that they have any idea what it is like for businesses of just four or five people, where those running the business are personal friends with the individuals whom they are employing, but at some point one they are going to have to say to one or two of their employees, &#147;Either you go, or we all go.&#148; That is the tough choice that such people are facing; that is the reality. They are the people who are facing this huge rash of extra bureaucracy, extra regulation and changed tax rules that makes their lives even more difficult at a time when they need to concentrate on sorting out their business, when they need a break from their banks and when they need a break in terms of improved demand and improved economic prospects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000319">It is this huge divide in Britain that is so unfair and that is causing so much anger, and it is one of the main reasons why the governing party is so low in the opinion polls&#151;about which it must be extremely worried. When listening to the Chancellor and hearing about his many schemes for people who, sadly, lose their jobs, one wondered whether there was at last some forethought about the colleagues of his whose jobs are going to be destroyed by his very bad economic management, and who may well be feeling that pain in a year. They will then discover that it is very brutal out there and things are very different when one loses the protection of the indexed pension, the decent salary, the expenses and all the rest of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000320">The public expect us to do everything we can to try to reduce the length, depth and severity of the recession, and to make the tax changes or produce the schemes that might make a difference to those who are struggling to keep going potentially good businesses that have been very badly damaged by the current climate. But they also expect us, above all now, to treat their money seriously and to spend it wisely. They do not believe for one minute that all this extra money that has been tipped in, so much of it borrowed, is buying them a better school, a better hospital, safer streets or stronger border controls. They think that a lot of it is wasted.</p>

I know that I will upset my right hon. and hon. Friends by saying so, but I think that the Government did a very good thing in sacking Mr. McBride. I think that the Labour party would agree. However, I have some advice for the Government. They still have dozens of McBrides left in their organisation&#151;spin doctors spinning in favour of their bosses and the Government&#151;although I hope that none is doing all the things that Mr. McBride was doing, at least not any more.</p>

race. If the Government got rid of more of their spin doctors, I could say nicer things about them. It would be a good saving, because many are supernumerary. They are letting the Labour party and the Government down, so some savings could be made there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90422-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000324">A much bigger saving in cash terms could be made by cancelling the ID card scheme and the national computer database. It is hugely expensive and will be deeply intrusive, without making our country any safer. Burglars will not take their ID cards to the scene of the crime and leave them on the mat when they leave. We already have identity documents that people have to show when they arrive at our borders; they are called passports. Instead of ID cards, we should have a border authority that wants to inspect passports properly and make sensible decisions about those visiting our shores. These people do not come across in rowboats; they are not sneaking into the country. They come in through the front door&#151;through Gatwick, Heathrow and Dover. Let us do the job at the port of entry with the proper documents. We do not need to make everyone else live in fear that they will be caught without their ID card when digging at the bottom of the garden. If the Government do not scrap the ID computer scheme, they are not serious about civil liberties, and they are certainly not serious about saving money. It is a no-brainer, because it would be a popular public spending cut.</p>

The Government can no longer say that it is hated only in parts of England with Conservative local government administrations, because they decided to test the popularity of regional government in what they thought was the Labour heartland of the north-east. At the time, it had mainly Labour MPs and mainly Labour councils&#151;more recently elected than some of the MPs&#151;but the Government lost that vote not by 55 to 45 or 60 to 40 but by four to one against. If they want to repeat the experiment in my part of the world, we can make it five to one or six to one against.</p>

If something needs spending on or regulating, it should be done nationally by the Departments or locally by the county or unitary authority. We do not need the middle men and women&#151;let us sweep them away. Again, I fear that that would make the Government popular, but I can recommend it because I know that there is no chance of their listening to the people of Britain. The Government will go back to the north-east, where they still hope to win some seats in the general election, and they will have to explain why they rode roughshod over the freely expressed and sensible views of the people there.</p>

We cannot afford to borrow extra billions of pounds&#151;and it will need to be borrowed&#151;to give to other countries, some of which are in a stronger financial position than we are. It is a little challenge for the Prime Minister after the triumph of saving the world: to go back to Brussels, say that his predecessor wrongly and stupidly gave away the good deal that Baroness Thatcher had negotiated with great skill, and tell them that the British people now need that money, because it will all be on our overdraft as the public accounts are out of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000330">I come to the public sector rich list. I pay tribute to the Taxpayers Alliance for the work that it has done in getting to the truth about some of the waste and grotesque excess that has substituted for proper public spending under this Government. Up and down the country, there are hundreds and thousands of senior officials in posts in quangos, in Whitehall and in local councils who are earning mega salaries. Those salaries do not respond to market pressures. In the cold and hard private sector world of which I have reminded the Government, people on high salaries in companies under pressure are not only losing their bonus, but will have to take a pay cut&#151;if they are lucky, because otherwise they will lose their job. When they get another job, if they manage to do so, it is at a much lower rate of pay than prevailed a year or two ago.</p>

Good luck to them; I want more and more of my constituents to have well paid jobs. But we cannot afford to replicate the high pay of the successful in the competitive sector&#151;freely, out of the money that customers make available&#151;in the public sector, where most of our staff are motivated by a sense of public duty and think that, say, &#163;63,000 a year is a decent rate of pay. They should not need &#163;160,000, &#163;260,000 or &#163;400,000 a year, which now seems to be the going rate for some of these quango jobs.</p>

We all know that most of those jobs in the public sector have been a joke so far and performance pay has been granted too readily.</p>

 My hon. Friend is tougher than I am, but he makes a good suggestion. I hope that Ministers have got the point that the situation is out of control. There are too many of these jobs&#151;many of them are non-jobs&#151;and too many are too highly paid. At this time when we need some restraint, we should try to reduce them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000335">We in this place also have to make a contribution. My worry about the Prime Minister&#146;s YouTube discovery yesterday&#151;I do not know why we could not have been told first, because it is after all a House of Commons matter&#151;is that we are being offered a scheme that on the face of it, although no numbers have been given, will lead to an increase in the total cost of MPs&#146; expenses. That is completely wrong in this climate. The idea that people should be able to get more money just by turning up than they did by handing in proper invoices for things on which they were spending money is for the birds, and I hope that Ministers back off from it as quickly as possible. If they do not, they will find that the public, far from being impressed by the Prime Minister&#146;s action, will feel extremely let down that he has discovered another way to pump more money to Labour Back Benchers without any proper accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000336">I guess that the proposal would get more hon. Members turning up at the House of Commons, and that could be a good thing&#151;although, given that we are locked out for much of the time because the Government do not want us to meet, they may decide to lock us out for even more days in the year to try to keep the costs down. That would not be a very welcome development either, so I hope that we can look again at the proposal.

Many are worthless and, if I needed it, I could get most of the information from a simpler source or from a website. All the glossy brochures that Members of Parliament throughout the Commons get day after day are paid for by the public sector. Could we not have a glossy brochure sabbatical, or amnesty? That would be a modest saving, but it would show willing. For example, we could have no more glossy brochures until Christmas, which would mean that the Government could save them up and then issue only the ones that really mattered. If they really do have a wish to tell us what they are doing, websites are so much cheaper, and it would be rather good if they were kept updated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000340">I have many more ideas, but many colleagues wish to speak in this debate so I will not go on at any greater length. My conclusion is that there are three major reasons why this country has been landed in such massive debt. The first is the huge mistake that has been made over the banks. My advice to the Government is to get out from under the bank assets and liabilities as quickly as possible. We cannot afford them, and they will only lose us a bigger fortune.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000341">The Government still do not seem to know what risks they are running, so will they please take action today to start limiting the risks and selling off the assets that they have acquired? Will they also please tell people in the publicly owned banks that they will not be earning &#163;300,000, &#163;400,000 or &#163;500,000 a year or getting mega-pensions as long as those banks are making losses? They are public sector bodies and we are responsible for the money. It is a waste of money to spend those sorts of sums on such banks unless they are going to go back to the private sector immediately and earn their living sensibly. If they do that, and the sort of salaries that I have mentioned can be paid for from private means, I have no problem with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000342">The second reason is the violent cycle. We desperately need proper welfare reform from this Government. We went into the downturn with more than 5 million people of working age out of work. That was a disgrace, and it shows what a dear mistake it was to sack the man who was Minister for Welfare Reform at the beginning of this Government, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). I think that he would probably have done a rather good job in improving incentives for work and limiting the welfare bills. Instead, we have gone on for years with no proper welfare reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000343">The Government have allowed many people to be out of work, for good reasons or bad, and they have not ensured that they were brought into the work force in the good times. We need proper welfare reform so that we can get people back into work more quickly. If the Government do not reform welfare, they will not solve the problem of unemployment and they certainly will not control the budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000344">The third big reason why we are too heavily in debt is wasteful, needless and unnecessary public spending. There are many examples of that, and I have listed some items to show Ministers that we would know what we were doing. They must understand that pretending that there are a few more efficiency savings to be made without naming them is not a good enough answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000345">I therefore have one last proposal that would make a big impact on Government budgets over the next couple of years: a complete freeze should be placed today on all staff, throughout the public sector, who do not work on the front line, and that replacements should be allowed only where they are absolutely necessary. If that were done, the Government would soon start to make an impact on the huge increases in spending that they have presided over. There are 300,000 extra civil servants compared with the number under the previous Conservative Government. Why does it take so many more to do a worse job? Of course, that is exactly what happens: the more people who are employed, the more difficult it is to control them, the more things they do that do not need doing and the more money is wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000346">The message is simple: the Government cannot solve a crisis of over-borrowing by borrowing more, or get out of a credit explosion by going on a public sector credit binge. If they take too many chances with the public accounts, there will be a buyers&#146; strike on Government debt. There is already a dangerous bubble in Government bonds which has been brought on by quantitative easing and their monetary antics. That is very insecure for savers and our economy.</p>

 Economic predictions are notoriously unreliable, but few of us at the time of last year&#146;s Budget would have imagined that we would be where we are now, with a major share of our banking industry in public ownership and the world in the throes of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000349">The economic crisis began in the financial sector, and I would imagine that most people would agree that we would be suffering a far worse situation had the Government not stepped in to rescue the banks. The scale of the measures taken to save the banks and get them lending again is enormous but, had there not been Government action on this scale, we would have faced the real prospect of a collapse of our banks. Allowing our banking system to collapse following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the US would have been catastrophic for the entire country. It is important to remind people that these measures were not taken for the sake of the banks but for the sake of everybody in the UK. Had the banks been allowed to fail, the entire economy would have suffered from the impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000350">The financial sector is of vast importance to the broader economy, and the current economic problems have shown the degree of interaction between the two. The ill-health of the financial sector caused an acute reluctance on the part of the banks to lend to each other, and to people and businesses. This credit crunch soon put the so-called &#147;real&#148; economy into difficulties, leading to an increasing number of individuals and businesses whose finances look precarious. In addition, lenders stop providing credit to people who they perceive as at risk of being about to go bust. As well as preventing the collapse of the banks, the measures taken by the Government have been designed to get the financial institutions lending again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000351">There is real hardship&#151;and fear of hardship&#151;as the recession takes its course. My constituents are particularly exposed, owing to the high proportion of jobs in Edinburgh that are in the financial sector. Edinburgh is Europe&#146;s fourth largest finance centre. In 2007, 32 per cent. of employees in our city worked in the job category of finance, IT and other business activities, compared with 22 per cent. in Britain as a whole. That is quite a big difference.</p>

the year from February 2008, and the number of unfilled jobcentre vacancies more than halved. There are now nearly six jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants for every jobcentre vacancy, up from just under two last February. While there are signs that the worsening of the economic situation may be slowing down, the economic downturn is far from over and unemployment in particular, as a lagging indicator, is likely to increase for months to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000353">We must make a massive effort to identify the lessons to be learned from this crisis, and all involved should accept their share of the responsibility. It is undeniable that events abroad played a major role in igniting the global and domestic recession. In his report published last month, Adair Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, identified the US housing market as the source of the origins of the crash. However, it is also clear that all was not as it should have been here in the UK. Practices of the banking and finance industries have been roundly condemned and the Government have moved to identify the weaknesses that must be addressed. In addition to the Turner review, David Walker will report later in the year on the banks&#146; corporate governance, and the Chancellor said today that the Treasury will bring forward its own proposals for reform in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000354">The culture of excessive borrowing has also been criticised. We still have huge levels of personal indebtedness. Total net outstanding lending to individuals is just under &#163;1.5 trillion. Consumer spending that was funded by borrowing on the basis of inflated property prices drove our economy to an unsatisfactory extent. In time, as more information becomes available, it will be possible to determine the extent to which the Government and their agencies could have better mitigated the impact of the crisis, especially in the regulation and oversight of the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para22"><a name="09042264000355">It is clear that we must help the UK&#146;s productive economy&#151;sectors such as manufacturing, food and agriculture, which require support. I would like to take this opportunity to raise again&#151;I have done so in the past two Budget debates&#151;the question of our international trade in goods and services. In the past decade our balance of payments has deteriorated substantially. At current prices, the deficit stood at &#163;7 billion in 1998. That rose to &#163;25 billion in 2003, and the figure stood at &#163;44 billion last year. Of course, the global economic crisis will have an impact on the trade balance. In fact, last year, the balance improved slightly on the previous year. Economic difficulties at home may dampen demand for imports, while the effect on exports of the global slump in demand may be softened to some extent by the recent devaluation of sterling. However, the long-term trend has been one of continued and substantial deterioration, and I encourage my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to address the importance of the trade balance to our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000356">It is understandable that there has been focus in this debate, particularly on the part of the Opposition, on the scale of the borrowing that the Government are having to undertake to fund their programmes, but it is inevitable that Government debt will rise if the Government take action, through tax cuts and increasing public spending, to stimulate our economic activity. The Government were right to take action in recent months to increase demand in our economies. The Chancellor has announced a range of positive measures today that  <br>

 May I first remind the House of my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests? I am a non-executive director of a plc.

This Budget got what I might describe as muted applause towards the end. Both the Chinese meal test and the applause test reflect that there was an awful lot of very difficult information to digest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000358">I was thinking about the Budget and, remembering the time when I was in the Treasury, reflecting on the kind of decision-making process that has to be gone through when a Budget is framed. I was almost stunned mentally by the enormous size of the numbers, and the changes that have occurred in the state of the public finances even since Budget 2008; that is without even commenting on the pre-Budget report. Last year, I wrote an article for my local newspaper, in which I said that between planting my potatoes on my allotment in May and harvesting them in September the world had fundamentally changed, economically speaking. I do not think that any of us have seen such an enormous turnaround&#151;not just in the United Kingdom economy but in the global economy&#151;involving such very large numbers in so short a space of time. It takes a long time for the public to come to terms with the enormity of what has occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90422-0009.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000359">The Chancellor was almost emotionless in his delivery; he read out the Budget a bit as though it were the annual statement at the annual general meeting of some great corporation. The attitude was, &#147;We&#146;ve got everything under control. Fingertips are on the pulse. We have understood the numbers, and we have got the model working. Everything is all right. In about 2015, all these problems will be over.&#148; It was just surreal. It was too serene and did not, in my humble judgment, reflect the reality and the pain to which the real economy is having to adjust in a very short space of time.</p>

Friend the Leader of the Opposition that boom and bust was the busted flush. That was not looking reality in the eye. Let us spend a moment analysing what the former Chancellor of the Exchequer used to say. When he said, &#147;I&#146;m bringing an end to boom and bust,&#148; fundamentally he was trying to say, &#147;I&#146;m going to restructure the economy. We&#146;re not going to do what previous Administrations did. We&#146;re not going to put the economy at risk.&#148; However, if we look in the Red Book, we see a rising trend in the percentage of gross domestic product that was used for public expenditure before the recession. That brings to mind that much-used but now rapidly discarded word, &#147;prudence&#148;. It indicates that what perhaps was a responsible start to the former Chancellor&#146;s regime rapidly went off the boil when public expenditure and borrowing got out of control.</p>

Chancellor said that the year after next, there would be 3.25 per cent. growth in the economy. They thought that that was absolutely for the birds. In fairness, if we look at the National Audit Office report issued with the Budget, which talks about the assumptions, we see that there are some reassuring words in there, suggesting that the Treasury may have got it right. I have to say that I find that very difficult indeed to accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000362">I note with interest that the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), who has responsibility for defence procurement, is on the Front Bench. Newly ensconced in his role, he will understand the amount of money that is being spent on military intelligence-gathering. He will also understand the absolute importance of that intelligence-gathering if we are to configure our military forces&#146; activity properly. When I was in the Treasury, the Bank of England had its agents who went around the country getting a feel for what was happening in the economy, so that they could advise the Governor on what was going on, and what advice he ought to give&#151;this was before the Monetary Policy Committee&#151;on the setting of interest rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000363">Those agents still exist, but I question the intelligence that they and the Treasury are getting, and indeed the foreign economic intelligence. A great deal was going on in the world of banking, and new financial instruments were being created. Last year, in my Budget remarks and the Budget remarks of colleagues, we talked about the beginnings of the credit crunch and toxic loans. We looked at some of the first estimates of how much that was costing American banks. One wonders what went wrong in spotting what was going on, spotting what the decision-making process was, and spotting what the effects of the new financial instruments, and the new things that were happening, would be on the overall economy. I say to the Treasury Bench that in light of what has occurred, the speed with which it has occurred, and the impact that it has had, there needs to be a fundamental reappraisal of the collection of economic intelligence if we are not to be caught out again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000364">In his Budget speech, the Chancellor put a lot of emphasis on improving the busted flush of tripartite regulation in our banking system. However, it was not so much regulatory failure that caused the problem in the first instance; it was the decision-making process in so many high-powered financial institutions on both sides of the Atlantic that fundamentally led us into the mess that we are in. If they had had better decision making or a less risk-averse approach, we might not be in this mess. I am all for making certain that regulation plays its part in protecting the public interest, but ultimately it is the decision-making process that got us to where we are. We need to understand what went wrong, and banks and financial institutions will have learned a bitter lesson and will now understand the need to improve their decision-making process.</p>

about the fact that foreign and secondary banking in the United Kingdom is effectively over. Those banks have pulled out of our banking system, and the burden of dealing with the economic consequences rests fairly and squarely on the major clearing and investment banks that are UK based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000366">The difficulty for those banks is that although their balance sheets have improved, and some of them have been stress tested and some of the news has been reasonably positive, there is still an innate nervousness in the banking sector about what may yet happen in terms of the toxic assets that are still out there, which are impossible to value and which may still have the potential to have a serious adverse effect on the world of banking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000367">As risks increase in the world of banking, so the capital provisioning to cover those risks on bank balance sheets must increase. As a result, the cost to industry of financing its future needs and the ability to provide the liquidity for those future needs becomes ever more testing. Although the Government have done something towards the emergency shoring-up of bank balance sheets, there is still considerably more work to do if we are to get the liquidity flowing at a price that business can afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000368">In fairness, the banks are finding that their own lending one to another, though improved, is still costing them a lot of money. There are still difficulties out there if the economy is to recover. I say to the Treasury, and through the Treasury to the Bank of England, that there is still much work to be done if the banking system is to get back into operation properly.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. Although there have been some beneficial changes in that situation from the point of view of American banks, is it a matter that affects not only banks, but companies with various financial instruments. Those companies are also having to make balance sheet provisions, which may upset, so to speak, the way that they present their trading circumstances to the wider world when they have to make such accounting provision. What we see is the unwinding of those very difficult positions. Unless banking gets back into good order, we will not see the rate of recovery that the Chancellor hoped for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000373">May I raise one issue which I think is interesting? There have been calls already in the debate for greater information about what is happening. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition listed many Government scheme that he believes are not working and not delivering results. On the other hand, the Chancellor enunciated and re-announced a further set of schemes. It is extremely difficult to know what is going on. Interestingly, a FTSE 100 company has to report to the City on a quarterly basis. It has to tell people what is going on. It makes a statement to the City because it is of material interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000374">We in the House of Commons have, in effect, two bites at the cherry in debating and dealing with the economy. We have the pre-Budget report, and sometimes it is difficult to get a debate on the economy after that report. Apart from that, we can ask the Chancellor a few questions. Then there is this debates, which lasts for four parliamentary days. After that, apart from Treasury Question Time, we cannot have a discussion on the topic most central to all of us, except in an Opposition day debate on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000375">Ministers on the Treasury Bench ask companies to pay their corporation tax on a quarterly basis. They are happy with major companies making statements to the City on a quarterly basis, so why cannot we have a quarterly statement to the House of Commons of what is happening, particularly at the current time? The Government owe it to the financial community to report with greater regularity on what is happening in the economy. Why we are sceptical about some of the numbers in the Red Book is that enormous sea changes occur between one set of forecasts and another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000376">I had a look at table C3 in the latest Red Book. When I see the difference even between the pre-Budget report in terms of the borrowing figures and the figures that are now projected, I discover that in the financial year 2010-11 there has been a change of nearly 65 per cent. in the amount of money projected to be borrowed. For the next financial year, 2011-12, the projected degree of change is nearly 71 per cent. All I can say to the Treasury is that I am jolly glad they do not run a real business. If they were the finance director of a real business, or the sales director, and they came along and said, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, boss, I&#146;ve got the sales figures over 60 or 70 per cent. out,&#148; they would be going out of the door rather rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000377">It is no wonder people are sceptical about some of forecasting that goes on when that degree of difference is presented on a year-on-year basis. That is why quarterly reporting is needed, so that we do not have to deal&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The Minister says, &#147;Rubbish.&#148; He is right&#151;economic rubbish. From the mouths of babes and sucklings on the Treasury Bench, we have the magic word &#147;rubbish&#148;. That is the problem. Unless the Treasury updates and reports on a regular basis, people will think the figures are rubbish, because the degree of difference between the previous and current projections is so enormous.</p>

made his statement on the motor industry, he announced that the Government were working on a trade credit insurance scheme. I know that it has proved particularly difficult to find a mechanism for doing that, but I am delighted that a scheme now exists. I look forward to learning more about the details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000379">I hope the focus of the scheme will be on the small and medium-sized industry, which is finding trading without that facility extremely difficult. There is a real urgency to get the scheme off the ground. I hope that at some stage in the course of the debates we might hear a little more about the timing. If the Minister wants to intervene and tell me a little more about how it will work and when it will happen, I shall be happy to give way. I see that so far he has not taken that opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09042264000380">I shall move on to the Budget&#146;s contents for savers. I welcome the fact that people will have an opportunity to save a little more with their ISAs, but, for many hundreds of pensioners in my constituency, if not thousands, low interest rates in the real market have had a devastating impact on their standard of living. It is difficult for them to find an outlet where their money has security of tenure and can earn more than 3 per cent. It is interesting to note that one sector of the financial world where such returns can be achieved, however, is in corporate finance. The ratings agencies&#146; opinion of some corporate bonds is still very high, and the coupon that they pay is attractive. However, it is a sophisticated area of investment, and not one that is easily accessible by the citizen who wants security for their savings while craving a better rate of return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000381">I put it to the Economic Secretary that, between now and the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, he might like to think about carving out a special ISA that would be underpinned by the Government and enable people to put some money into corporate bonds. That would have certain advantages: first, people would receive returns tax free; secondly, if the Government could underpin the measure initially, it would have a degree of security; and thirdly, pensioners could access a higher rate of return. The latest corporate bond rate for Tesco, for example, is about 6 per cent. and, for BMW, it is about 5 per cent. There are other really good, gold-plated private companies offering to pay above the market rate, but it is difficult for the citizen to access that asset class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000382">Perhaps the Treasury will consider a meaningful way to improve returns for savers by carving out a special additional ISA category for that type of investment&#151;particularly for the older pensioner. I notice that the Chancellor, in making the changes to ISAs, distinguished between people above and below the age of 50. The people about whom I am talking are the recently retired whose pensions have suffered because of what has occurred. They desperately need a higher and better source of income, and I believe that that is something to be sorted out.</p>

The Chancellor seemed to assure us that, if the retail prices index was recorded as a minus figure in September, pensioners would not lose out, but I was not sure whether he said that there would still be, for example, a 2 per cent. increase in their pensions in real terms or in percentage terms. We need some clarification of what is going on, because, as I understand it, technically speaking, pensions could decrease  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000385">On Monday 20 April, the <i> Financial Times </i>made a simple but none the less profound statement in one of its leading articles. Addressing the question of public expenditure, it said that</p>
<a name="90422-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09042264000652"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the UK must start a national debate on fiscal priorities.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000386">Although it is easy from the Opposition Benches to pick schemes such as ID cards, or anything else on which we do not think we should spend money, it must be noted that this country has not discussed what the state should spend taxpayers&#146; money on. What are the fundamentals? I think that the public are open to a candid discussion, but I am worried that, given the electoral cycle, with a year to go until an election, both Front-Bench teams will be very nervous about discussing the unthinkable&#151;about cutting back on public expenditure. However, I do not think that the public, who want to know the situation as it is, are so fearful that they could not express an opinion about what should occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09042264000387">The reason why I mention the issue is that about one third of public expenditure is on social benefit payments, and, understandably in the current circumstances, that is difficult to change. In fact, we are increasing support through the tax credit system. Therefore, when we look at what is left, the two thirds, we realise that we do not have a lot left to reduce. We need a discussion about what reduction the public would stand either in absolute terms or at the current rate of increase in planned expenditure. I ask the Government to do that, because I notice that, for example, in table A1 of the Red Book, they already seem to have made a decision to reduce to the monetary sum of zero the reserve support for military operations. I am intrigued to know why our forces will seemingly have no reserves to call on from financial year 2010-11 and thereafter. The Government have rather cunningly hidden away in that table what appears to be a large cut in potential public expenditure. They have done that without any discussion, however, and I think that the public would like to know what that decision means for our armed forces. Against that background, let us also have some candour about the standard of forecasting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000388">I shall conclude by considering some growth projections, however.

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000389">Notwithstanding what the National Audit Office said, I see the hand of a particular kind of Treasury discussion around such forecasts. Officials turn up, saying, &#147;Here you are, Chancellor: here&#146;s the macro-economic model; we&#146;ve done our sums; this is what&#146;s going to happen.&#148; Then, we get the political horse-trading, when the Chancellor of the day says, &#147;Hmm, well what does perhaps another quarter point on growth mean in terms of either increasing tax revenues or reducing the borrowings? How much can I tweak these numbers so that the figures don&#146;t look in the real world quite so bad as the economic model suggests?&#148;</p>

There is a basic need to consider very carefully how such numbers are put together, because they fundamentally determine the outward projections of the state of the British economy. If the Treasury gets them wrong in the next 12 months to the degree that it got them wrong in the last 12 months, I am afraid that, while President Obama may talk about glimmers of hope, we may be talking&#151;if we are still here in 12 months&#146; time&#151;about glimmers of true disaster.</p>

 I say with all sincerity that it is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), who made pertinent and sensible points. He talked a lot about forecasts. As a Member who is a bit of a sad case, I spent some of yesterday evening reading the noble Lord Healey&#146;s autobiography &#147;The Time of My Life&#148;, in which he was critical of the forecasts that he got as Chancellor in 1974, 1975 or whenever it was. He said that all the errors that he was making&#151;he writes about them quite freely&#151;were due to the fact that the forecasting was all wrong, or at least very far wrong. The right hon. Gentleman discussed coming back from working in his garden and finding that the forecasts had changed, and he was absolutely right about that. I call it &#147;the complexity of Budget ratiocination&#148;. Budgets are extraordinarily complicated&#151;how they are put together is something of a miracle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90422-0010.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000392">At the beginning of his speech, the right hon.

That reminds me of Rab Butler&#146;s comment as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He said that it takes about six months to figure out the Budget. By the time we get round to figuring it out, it is time for the next pre-Budget report.</p>

One of the points that I make&#151;it links in with what the right hon. Member for Fylde said&#151;is that we need a debate on our economy and country, on where we are and where we stand.

I am willing to accept that the boom period began under the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). We had a period of stability that we could call a &#147;boom&#148;. Now, however, there is a global recession, and that is a fact no matter how we debate it. It affects Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United States. Some 20 million workers in China are losing their jobs. As I mentioned, I am a sad case&#151;I have also looked at the Brazilian economy and what steps the Brazilians are taking to face the recession. However we look at the issue, we cannot get away from the fact that this is the first global recession that we have seen.</p>

 I studied economics for a time at university, and it seems to me that we have to accept that forecasts are, to a large extent, guesswork, except in periods of extraordinary stability; the variables far exceed our understanding of them. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, if there are large swings between periods of contraction and expansion in the economy, one of the biggest dangers is that demand and supply will get out of kilter and there will be increased oscillation? In simple terms, if the forecast is correct, we could go from a period of dramatic contraction to one of dramatic growth. That might create future instability and perhaps an even bigger crash.</p>

It would have been a fine example of Republican sentiment. He said that we should not have saved the banks; in the 1930s, the United States refused to save the banks and 12,000 of them went to the wall.

 This is not just a yes-no issue. The Government&#146;s whole approach in dealing with the banks has been similar to that of the Japanese Government nearly 20 years ago.

The question is not about whether to defend the banks but about how we can most economically rescue the system and then return to a system of financial confidence.</p>

 I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman, but the luxury of that kind of reflection was not available to the British Government&#151;and was certainly not available to the United States Government when they allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse. The Chancellor referred to that event in his statement. The markets were in difficulty as a result of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. However, allowing a bank of the stature of Lehman Brothers, which was the landlord of a building in Canary Wharf, to collapse sent the economy of the United States and the rest of us into recession. That was the one significant event, and, to get back to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, the US Government did not have the time to think it all through, just as we probably did not.</p>

 On the question of no investor losing money, shareholders have lost an enormous amount of money in the banks. I accept that bondholders have not; that is an issue that my right hon.

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I was talking about investors who had savings&#151;deposits&#151;in banks. If you are a shareholder, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you pays your money and you see the show. Twice in my life I have sat in a hotel room looking at <i> The New York Times</i> and discovering that my shares had lost half their value&#151;not once but twice. I know all about it. I put my money on the stock exchange and lost it, and I then decided to wash my hands of the whole thing and never invest again. I am therefore sympathetic to those who lose their money on the stock exchange, but I do not put them in the same category as those who have investments&#151;money deposits&#151;in the banks, and those have been saved.</p>

He had huge criticisms of off-balance sheet financing and the private finance initiatives that we launched as a Government in 1997. I am proud of the fact that the very first public-private initiative that we launched was to build James Cook university hospital in Middlesbrough, which is now the finest regional hospital in the area. When I first became an MP, people had to go to Newcastle for a heart operation; now, they come from Newcastle to us. The Duke of York came to open it, and I was very proud to be there. That was an example of the off-balance sheet financing and public-private initiatives which we as a nation can afford and which render a significant service to our economy.</p>

He did not mention the 20 million people in south China who have lost their jobs or the 500,000 people a month losing their jobs in the United States. People refer to our unemployment rate rising to 2.1 million, but in 1983 I fought a general election, which the Conservatives won, with unemployment at 3 million. Unemployment was never a political issue. Even in the &#146;30s, when we had the Jarrow march, the Conservatives still won the election of 1935.</p>

 I will make reference to the forthcoming general election later in my speech. Clearly, this is a great day for the Opposition. They have never had to speak in the House on Budget day under a Labour Government when there has been a global recession. I can well imagine that they will make as much hay as they can while the sun shines. I would not say that that is wrong.

He made a huge distinction between public sector and private sector workers. I am not sure that those who work in the public sector would be very happy about that. In Middlesbrough, we have public sector workers in health, education, social services and local government. They are there not only to serve the community but to help the disadvantaged people in that community and to try to get them into work. One cannot balance public and private sector workers like some kind of see-saw. They are all a significant part of our community and society.</p>

That is not a possibility, as there has to be a balance in society between the public and the private. The right hon. Member for Wokingham missed that.</p>

debt that is on the market and coming through in bonds. I have to say that all the studies show that the market is holding up well. The ratings agencies are still giving us triple A ratings, and the essence of the Budget is to balance out what we are doing in the short term, how we will deal with the situation in the long term and what the markets foresee. By the markets, I mean business, private and international investors in our community. I was with a major state investor last night, who told me that they were very confident in the British economy and were keeping their investment going.</p>

There is a fiscal stimulus in it, but it is small compared with the major ones. However, it is there&#151;there is &#163;2 billion for one particular project, but I did not quite catch which one from where I sat. In my view the fiscal stimulus has gone as far as it can go, and I would not wish to see any further fiscal stimulus at this time.

A Budget has many facets, and we will have to assess the full significance, impact and importance of this one in the current climate of economic downturn. That is the essence of it all&#151;we must have a strategy, and the Chancellor put his strategy forward. The essence of it is the core values of fairness and opportunity.</p>

How is it received nationally and internationally, and can it have the confidence of investors? At a time when public debt has risen to accommodate the recession and to lessen its impact, how does the Budget reassure the markets in the medium and long term? My assessment is that the markets will be reassured by the Budget. They will see that the Government are taking responsibility at this difficult time. In my view, the Budget lays the framework, not for now until the next pre-Budget report&#151;it is a Budget that defines the economy&#146;s direction not for a year, but for several years.</p>

The new vehicle, which is putatively an industrial and finance corporation, will be ideal for balancing the demands of industry with those of the banking sector, thus creating equilibrium. I agree with Richard Lambert, director general of the CBI, that the fund should have a financial base of at least &#163;1.5 billion. I am sure that he will welcome the scheme on behalf of the CBI, as should the Institute of Directors, which pressed for it in the first place, and has done since Lord Mandelson was appointed to his high office.</p>

We cannot go back to the proposals of the right hon. Member for Wokingham&#151;I have a mild obsession with him and his speech. He had the wonderful view that everything should be left to the market&#151;which reminded me that when we set up the Financial Services Authority some years ago, he opposed it because he believed that the market should be unregulated. We have moved away from that. The view of the G20 is that a free and unfettered market is not the way forward for an economy.

We want markets to evolve, with flexibility, in a global environment. The right hon. Member for Wokingham mentioned the European Union, even in the Budget debate. He criticised the Government for allowing a portion of the rebate, which Lady Thatcher negotiated some years ago, to be returned. We must admit that we did that. We paid some of that rebate back&#151;we own up to that&#151;and we did it to help eastern European countries that are much poorer than we are. The right hon. Gentleman said that we gave the money to countries that were richer than us. That is not the case. We gave it to countries that were less rich than us, as part of the European Union concept.

Anything that helps such businesses to continue, including the scrappage deal, is welcome. I predict that while it is available, it will have the same impact as the similar schemes in France and Germany, and that the 30 per cent. loss of sales by car dealers will be rectified.

She brought public spending down from 48.1 per cent. of national income in 1982-83 to 41.6 per cent. in 1987-88. As I said earlier, I fought that election with 3 million people unemployed.</p>

Member for Esher and Walton, the idea of an election seems to haunt this Chamber. Every Opposition Member seems to be obsessed with a general election, but whenever it comes and whatever the outcome, it is not relevant to this debate. What is important is that the Government of the day take the measures that they must, to see the country through the recession.</p>

We are not choosing one particular industry or firm against another. We are not in the &#146;70s; we are not in Tony Benn&#146;s industrial regeneration programme of 1975-76.

It is not a matter of one section against another or St. Albans against Wokingham. It is not a question of what the Budget is going to do for me; rather, it is about how the people of Middlesbrough may relate to the people of St. Albans as we all work together and all plough this particular furrow together.</p>

We will say that we saw it turn a corner, moving from negative to positive growth. We will say that we handled the banks so that people did not lose their money. That is the way forward. At that time, the people will have to decide between a Labour party that believes in growth to get us out of a recession and a Conservative party that believes in cuts. We will then have to ask the Opposition what cuts they want and what cuts they propose. ID cards may be one area for cuts and Trident missiles might be another.</p>

I will be asking those questions, but I have no doubt that when the economy turns and people see the alternatives, we will have a proper vote, the reality will meet the perception and we will have a proper result.

Gentleman, who made an excellent job of trying to defend, in the best possible way&#151;he is an expert at it&#151;a Budget with which I think he is slightly uncomfortable. Despite his partial praise and partial criticism of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), I detected a deep unease in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views on the amount of borrowing that this country will undertake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90422-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000449">The hon.

Those countries will be freeing up their private enterprise and their economies, not adding to paternity pay or health and safety regulations. They will use private enterprise to get them out of the hole. I will return to that subject later in my speech.</p>

However, it is not an opportunity to borrow &#163;175 billion next year, then &#163;173 billion, then &#163;140 billion, and it is not an opportunity to put us deeper into debt than at any time in our history, and it is not an opportunity to have more debts than every other Government since this country&#146;s history began. It is a time of opportunity to cut regulation and red tape&#151;something my hon. Friends and I have wanted to do over the past 10 years.</p>

When we are in a hole, it is time to stop digging and to stop strangling ourselves with red tape and regulation.</p>

In some ways, it reminded me of the Prime Minister&#146;s Budgets in 1998 and 1999, when he could carry on the expenditure levels that are now no longer sustainable because of the golden economic legacy that he had been left by the outgoing Conservative Government.</p>

I am not talking about front-line staff. Five-a-day managers are being recruited. These people will not be managing anything; they will be paid about &#163;23,000 a year to go around exhorting the rest of us to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables each day. No doubt eating five portions of fruit and vegetables is jolly good for us, and I try to do it myself occasionally, but the idea that it is essential to recruit people to carry out these exhortations is bananas. <i> [Laughter.] </i>Yes&#151;and apples, broccoli and leeks as well.

I was about to say &#147;pie in the sky&#148;, but that would have been the second portion. We cannot afford to do that in the current circumstances. We could not afford to do it in the past, but Government and local government could get away with it because we seemed to be earning, we seemed to be paying our way, and we were in a boom period. Now the bust is here with a vengeance&#151;and when the bust is here with a vengeance, we all have to pull in our horns. We invest in what will actually help us to escape from our problems, which is growth. That means that we must cut the red tape and all the things that slow down our industry.</p>

Would it come from Government expenditure, Government investment in infrastructure, or Government investment in so-called front-line services? Of course not. Government are not going to create that growth. If we end up with 3.25 per cent. growth in two years&#146; time, it will be because private industry has created it. The investment that private industry will put into its business is infinitely greater than anything that Government can spend by borrowing hundreds of billions of pounds. If those hundreds of billions were to go into capital investment and increasing productivity it could be justified, but much of it is going into shoring up the current account and continuing the profligate expenditure policies that got us into this hole.</p>

The huge tax increases will come in two years&#146; time.&#148; The Government might have gained more political mileage today by giving us some of the pain now: by being absolutely honest, and saying, &#147;We must rein back on excessive Government expenditure, and we must rein back on it now.&#148; Delaying the pain for a couple of years fools none of the electorate.

We are going to waste &#163;12 billion on identity cards, which are absolutely unnecessary. We have wasted &#163;36 billion, I am told, on NHS computer systems which do not work. Thank God they do not work, because I do not trust this Government with my medical records&#151;particularly if they introduce a euthanasia Bill shortly, given my current state of health. We do not need that particular investment. In fact, it is not investment. Buying &#163;36 billion-worth of computers for the NHS so that, theoretically, all the medical records can be in a central system and, theoretically, everyone in Whitehall can access them is not investment, but an absolute nosey parker&#146;s charter and a waste of money.</p>

Let us put the money and investment into more Security Service foot soldiers on the ground infiltrating these communities, and into hearts and minds operations in those communities and gathering intelligence on the half a dozen guys who may be going to Pakistan to learn to be terrorists, rather than into monitoring the other 56 million of us and intercepting every e-mail we produce.</p>

What is needed to help them is not some of the gimmicks we have had today on new training, but a cut in national insurance.

If we have British regulations duplicating those from Europe, we cannot get rid of the European ones; therefore, we should scrap all those duplicating regulations that we in this country pass in gold-plating the European standard regulations. We have such a problem with the working at height regulations, and in this place we are doing it with the fire regulations: we as a House and a British Government are gold-plating them, and nowhere else in the European Community is that being done.</p>

If we look at the statistics, however, we will see that we are putting a lot of effort into targeting some areas where there are very few accidents or deaths, while ignoring other areas, such as the construction industry, which are still high up the accident league. Whatever we do, we must take the burdens off private industry, where one finds the only ones who will create the magical 3.25 per cent. growth that we seek.</p>

Every business man and woman in my constituency to whom I have spoken, including someone who I bumped into in London last night, has made the point that they have had letters from their bank saying that because of the change in interest rates their terms are being revised and charges on companies are being increased.

The banks are increasing the rates not just to get more money out of these customers; some of the banks, including the Ulster bank in Northern Ireland, are doing it deliberately to price customers off their books.

The threat is there, because the banks say, &#147;If you do not agree to our new terms and conditions, you realise that your overdraft is up for renewal next year or in two years&#146; time.&#148; In some cases, the threat is overt; in others, the banks are pulling the rug from under customers who have quite good liquidity and who are not a risk. The banks are deciding to recapitalise by pulling the money out of the very businesses that will regenerate this country.</p>

If the Government do not urgently introduce codes of practice or regulations to stop the banks, which have a monopoly and are all doing the same thing, albeit by using slightly different words, to all our constituents&#151;to all their customers&#151;and to control the way in which the banks are shafting our constituents and our businesses at the moment, we will be stuck in negative growth for far too long and there will be no prospect of 1 per cent. let alone 3.25 per cent. growth.</p>

If the &#163;30 million is going to clean up some of the service housing and to give the wives and families better homes in which to live while our guys are in Afghanistan, I hope it comes through in the next few months and is not scheduled for April next year. These people desperately need that clean-up in their housing now and they need more than that.

suddenly fashionable interest in macro-prudential regulation and imposing counter-cyclical reserve and capital requirements throughout the economic cycle has been beset by disagreements about who should determine where we are in the cycle and who should determine the level of reserves. The real question is not who, but how. We need to focus on the most appropriate way of modelling market transactions and their velocity to indicate what part of the cycle we are in. That is much more important than the party political spats that we have seen about whether the Bank of England or the FSA should be the implementing body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000479">If we can generate such models, they will provide the regulatory prudential controls for the economy if two double tensions are resolved. The first is the conflicting messages that have been sent to the banks. On the one hand they are told to stimulate the economy and increase lending. On the other, they are told to reduce their liabilities, increase their reserves and minimise risk. I am no apologist for the banking industry, but it is unfair to demand that they do both at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000480">It is understandable that the Government should tackle social and financial exclusion. We sometimes forget that the expansion of credit that is now so universally derided enabled 1 million people to avoid financial exclusion by acquiring property through mortgages. That credit expansion was to achieve clear social policy goals. In and of itself, it was good and laudable, but it came at the price of financial instability through under-capitalisation and inadequate reserves. That institutional tension was compounded by the fact that householders then sucked equity out of their properties for personal consumption. They also spent a larger share of their disposable income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000481">Now that household net worth has dropped so dramatically, what used to be the engines of demand-led growth are now too feeble to lift the economy off the ground. The management consultancy firm McKinsey has calculated that, for each 5 per cent. fall in the debt-to-income ratio, the US economy experiences $500 billion less available consumption going into the market. Britain is no different.</p>

Those who accept the growth model of the economy believe that there are no limits to growth and positively welcome the fact that the global population is projected to rise between now and 2050 from 6.7 billion to approximately 10 billion. They believe that that 50 per cent. increase in the number of global consumers will be able to fuel the demand-led growth that will lead us to recovery. However, even as we see consumption rise and living standards around the globe rise with it, we are forced to acknowledge that the world is already consuming each year the resources that it takes the planet one year and four months to replace.</p>

We cannot afford a fiscal stimulus to be simply a way to get back to the status quo ante. Recovery must be a stimulus to transformation&#151;a new model of sustainable development, and not just a way to regain the old growth path.</p>

If we need a fiscal stimulus to keep people in jobs and to stimulate the market now, we should, in justice, be using the money to invest in making tomorrow&#146;s world better and more sustainable for those future generations.

The flood protection provided by forests is an externality, and the value of the pollination services provided by insects has not even been calculated. The world is prepared to spend millions of dollars on providing naval escorts and increased insurance for cargo vessels off the horn of Africa, but nothing is done to resolve the ecosystem collapse brought about by desertification that spawned the social and economic chaos that gave rise to the pirates in the first place. That is economic madness.</p>

Nature no longer has an infinite capacity to absorb waste, and Governments around the world need to engage in a new paradigm, where natural capital is valued and budgeted for. The valuation of ecosystem services such as watershed protection, climate regulation, and soil stabilisation may seem recherch&#233; ideas, but I remind the House that 20 years ago, when officials at the World Bank first proposed that there might be a value attached to carbon, and even that carbon markets might be developed, Treasuries around the world dismissed the idea as peripheral and not worth pursuing.</p>

I welcome the commitment to cutting our CO2 emissions by 34 per cent. against 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 per cent. by 2050, but I am concerned that the overall investment in green growth is not substantial enough to meet even those laudable objectives. Over the next few days, I will carefully examine the figures that he sketched out.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner). Listening to him reminded me how much I used to enjoy his philosophical excursions when he served on the Public Accounts Committee under my chairmanship. They may have been philosophical excursions, but they were always useful and reminded us of what was important. He did that again today with his reference to world ecology as well at the world economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000491">That being said, I suspect that this Budget will be judged on a rather simpler basis. When the economic historians look back on it&#151;it will be to them that we will have to look, because I am sure that the economic journalists will give it hell&#151;they will consider a principal, objective aim: whether it gets us out of this recession. It will be as simple as that, and all the complexity of the numbers should not obscure that. Those economic historians will probably look back on what preceded the Budget as a decade of delusion; that is probably the simplest way of putting it. There was self-delusion on the part of the Government in many ways, ranging from the way in which they introduced creative accounting into our national accounts and fell for their own propaganda in so doing, right through to the hubris of believing that they had put an end to boom and bust. All of that was self-delusion, and it has lasted a decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000492">There is also the self-delusion of the bankers, who created instruments that they told us would minimise risk, but in fact simply concealed it. That led to the maximisation of that risk, which, of course, is what broke the system in the final analysis. There is also the self-delusion of the professions&#151;the accountants and the credit-rating agencies&#151;that failed. It was a criminal failure in my judgment, and I say that not in hyperbolic terms. I mean a literal criminal failure to protect the public from the misrepresentations that were visited on them, both by the public sector&#151;the Government&#151;and the private sector.</p>

They wanted the public not to recognise the size of the problem early on. Look at the delays that they undertook in responding to Northern Rock and to all the other problems that they had to face. Why did they do that? Because to recognise those problems was to shoulder the burden of responsibility for them.</p>

problem. Contrast that with what the Swedish Government did, also in the 1990s. The Swedish Government forced into the public domain the size of the problem, forced the banks to recognise the liabilities that they faced, forced the shareholders of the banks to face those liabilities, and then stepped in, cleaned up the mess, sorted out the banking system, and underwrote the depositors. Within three years they had their economy back on track. By contrast, Japan 20 years later still does not have its economy back on track.</p>

Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), who spoke briefly, made it clear that there has been a major regulatory failure. In responding to his comments about the behaviour of the banks, I would say that we have seen a distinction between large quantity of regulation and a high quality of regulation. The failure has been a quality failure in regulation. We used to have a very good Governor of the Bank of England control system that was subtle and able to respond to delicate signals and unforeseen problems when they came up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90422-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000499">That is the nature of the problem. The most obvious short-run effect is the problem that my right hon.

The way the Government have approached the banking crisis leaves a massive gap in commercial confidence, which in turn has an impact on the Government&#146;s own neo-Keynesian strategy. The House will not be surprised to know that I am not entirely comfortably with neo-Keynesian strategies. I think they are over-rated and pose a major series of problems, but let us for a moment accept the Keynesian analysis. Let us accept what it sets out to do, and see what the banking crisis has done to it.</p>

He was not the first person to talk about it, but he was the first person to popularise the idea. He and a man called Professor Hicks characterised it and demonstrated how it worked. It is very simple. If I spend &#163;1 with you, buying something from you, you will spend a portion of that &#163;1 with somebody else, who will spend a portion of that money with somebody else, and so on, so &#163;1 spent has a ripple throughout the economy. Hicks demonstrated that the algebra was pretty simple. If you spend 90p of the &#163;1 that I spent  <br>

with you and that works down, every &#163;1 that I spend has a &#163;10 effect in the economy. If you spend 80p of the &#163;1 on average, every &#163;1 that I spend has a &#163;5 effect in the economy. If you spend half, every &#163;1 that I spend has a &#163;2 effect. That is what the algebra demonstrates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000502">What happens if one destroys confidence in the economy? If one makes people feel that commercial activity is dangerous, which it was not last year, one destroys the multiplier. We understand from the Chancellor today that the Government have injected some &#163;20 billion, but I guess it must now be &#163;22 billion given the further &#163;2 billion spent, into the economy trying to reflate demand. That is about 1.5 per cent. of GDP, but with no multiplier effect, it is completely irrelevant. The economic demand management policy has been crippled by the Government&#146;s failure to solve the banking crisis, but the issue of confidence and its effect on the multiplier was why Keynes rested so much on that policy. The point is that even if Keynesian policy had had a chance, the Government have destroyed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000503">There are other reasons for concerns with neo-Keynesian policies, however, and the primary reason is that spending all that money has a series of effects on the long-term competitiveness of the economy. The most obvious has been discussed today: the long-term impact on tax and borrowing in the United Kingdom&#151;and &#163;600 billion is a spectacular burden on our future competitive ability. Before I address that issue, however, I shall deal with one that the Treasury Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), raised earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000504">The right hon. Gentleman attempted to argue&#151;I think he was repeating Sam Brittan&#151;that there was no limit to the amount that the Government could borrow and no issue about raising the money. He said that such money has been borrowed before&#151;in the second world war. Well, what a devil of a comparison to make&#151;that we borrowed that amount of money during the second world war. He missed the point, however, which was made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), when he simply said that many people wanted us to win that war and, as a result, were willing to lend us a lot of money so that we could continue spending money to win it. We have had high borrowings at other times in our history, but, at those times, sterling was a reserve currency and it is not now. There are other reasons why we cannot compare our current situation to our history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000505">Today, we have a real problem: we might well be on a cliff edge in respect of our ability to raise money before we reach the &#163;600 billion limit. One way in which that cliff edge will come nearer is if there is a further decline in our currency, because that would attack the source of much of our borrowing, which comes from abroad. A combination of poor credit worthiness on the part of the Government, an inability to raise taxes to pay the returns and a decline in the currency could have a serious impact on our continued ability to raise money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000506">That brings us to the issue of overall public expenditure levels, because what do the Government do when they cannot raise money? Then, they do not choose to cut; they have to cut.

him that he had to. No Government willingly cut public expenditure, but it is entirely possible that the strategy that we are in the middle of will lead a future Government, of whatever party, to have no choice but to cut public expenditure, because they will not be able to raise money either by taxes or by borrowing. That is the potential horror story at the end of this situation. I began by talking about how economic historians will see this Budget, and that is the worst scenario&#151;the tragic, potential outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000507">Although I am not a Keynesian, I am not innately against public expenditure in a downturn. If one goes to America, one will see that much of its infrastructure, from roads to dams, was built cheaply in the 1930s and created an underpinning for that great country&#146;s economic success thereafter. If one is going to spend money, a downturn is a good time to do so, whether one is a private or a public citizen. However, we must be very careful about how we spend it, and we must understand what we can and cannot do, and what Governments are good and bad at. Let us be plain: Governments, as we all know, are bad at picking winners; it is not what they do. Throughout history, all Governments who have tried it have failed. At one point in the Chancellor&#146;s peroration, I heard him proudly lay out the fact that he was going to invest &#163;750 million in high-tech industry. All I can say is that I will make sure that I do not invest where he puts that money; it is a fair bet that those industries will not succeed.</p>

 One worry for those of us who represent rural areas is that it seems that the Minister is already conceding that that broadband development will not reach the highlands and islands and other rural areas of the country. Those areas, of course, would take maximum benefit from such development, because it would get around the need to commute and bring the economy to those areas.</p>

 That is a good point. I do not want to go off on a big excursion on the issue, but I shall say this to the hon. Gentleman. The Government have been unimaginative on broadband development. The BBC is spending &#163;5 billion on digitising the broadcast network&#151;another issue that affects rural areas. If that money went into providing an optical-fibre link to all the rural areas, we would not need to digitise the broadcast network because there would effectively be a physical broadcast network.</p>

It would save money, encourage high levels of localised industry and cut back on the unnecessary use of cars and other vehicles.</p>

The truth is that four of five Government investments will fail. We are also up against another delusion. In the past decade or so, the new Labour Government have insisted on calling every item of public expenditure an &#147;investment&#148;. They are not all investments&#151;there are some items of expenditure and some of investment. It is perfectly proper for there to be welfare expenditure, for example, to save people from misery; that is part of the purpose of the Government.

We should be building for the future. If the money is not being spent on investment, we should think twice about spending it, bearing in mind that in any event the largest changes in the public expenditure accounts are in respect of the so-called automatic stabilisers&#151;namely, the cut in taxes raised and the increase in welfare paid.</p>

 Surely expenditure on pensions and benefits can be an investment in the classic sense of the word. It provides a decent level of income that enables people to be properly fed and housed and to engage in social activity. The payback from that investment will be that those people will live longer lives. So there is a payback from such expenditure, which can properly be classified as an investment.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman demonstrates only too clearly why I think that he and his Government are wrong. I approve of expenditure for such purposes, but we do not have to call it an &#147;investment&#148; for it to be something of which one approves. He was discussing proper, social expenditure; I talk to him as a social Tory, if he likes. We could go back to Lord Shaftesbury. He called such spending not &#147;investment&#148;, but &#147;social expenditure&#148;. It is social welfare, and it is what a civilised society should have. However, we should not kid ourselves that it gives an economic return. It does not&#151;it improves our civilisation and the nature of our country, and it enables us to live with ourselves, but it is not an economic investment. That is my point.</p>

Incidentally, it also worried Keynes. If one goes back and reads Keynes, there are some interesting parts where he discusses reparations after the first world war. He was critical of the reparations that we imposed on Germany for a number of reasons. Some of those were moral and ethical, but he also said, to paraphrase, &#147;If we put this burden on Germany, Germany will grow strong in having to pay this burden; we will grow soft in living off this burden.&#148; He was talking about the work ethic in our respective societies. In the famous Keynesian example of the state paying a worker to dig a hole and then paying another worker to fill it back in, he was talking about not only effective demand but the need to maintain the work ethic in British society to ensure that when idleness is forced on people, that does not enter into their soul and institutionalise the unemployment that arises from major recessions.</p>

inactive citizens in the United Kingdom. That figure is not quite as shocking as it sounds, because about 2 million are students, a couple of million are people raising families, and so on. What is interesting is that over the course of the past decade the number of people who have determined that they do not want to work has gone up&#151; these are round figures; it has bounced around a bit&#151;by between 500,000 and 600,000. Half a million people in our adult working-age population have decided that they do not want to work. We often see anecdotal evidence of people refusing work. A lot of the arguments about immigration have focused on the fact that people who come into this country are doing jobs that British citizens will not do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000519">That is worrying in terms of the nature of our society, which we were debating earlier, and our long-term competitiveness. We have to think very hard about the whole welfare structure of our society. I am pleased that the Financial Secretary is on the Front Bench, because I know that he takes an interest in this. I have been backwards and forwards on this argument, but I am beginning to think again that we have to reconsider workfare. If the forecast is wrong and we end up having a long recession, we must ensure, first and foremost, that that does not visit habits of idleness on our population. I am happy to hear the Chancellor speak about action to help the young, but it is not just about the young: we are talking about a much bigger sector of the population, particularly in some of the old industrial areas near where I live and where I come from. We do not want to allow such habits to take hold in those areas. The economic historians will answer these questions on the basis of whether we come out of recession, which is all about growth.</p>

I am not going to pick a fight with the Government over having a 50 per cent. top rate for those earning &#163;150,000 a year or more&#151;frankly, in terms of the argument, I do not care too much one way or the other. However, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has said in terms that a 45 per cent. rate would not deliver any more money&#151;not a penny&#151;to the Exchequer. Therefore, if that is the purpose, it will fail. What is more, it carries the risk&#151;we do not yet know how big it is, because it depends on what other countries do&#151;that people of talent will not come here. It is fashionable now to decry Ireland, but for 25 or 30 years Ireland has had a fantastic success story. One of the key parts of that was ensuring that talented people came to Ireland and had good tax arrangements in doing so. I suspect that if the Scottish Parliament had control of its own destiny it would do the same. That is why I am in favour of tax competition. There is a real risk that in doing something that is designed simply as a trap for the Tories, which is what it is, the Government may harm our long-term economic prospects.</p>

with employment regulation and to maximise the amount of money that we got out of the Government in grants here, there and everywhere. We had departments and specialists for all those things, and the regulation was no impediment to us. In fact, it was an advantage because it got other people out of the business. Others did not have those departments, so it was a competitive advantage to us. That is exactly what regulation should not do, but it is what it does.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman, who made a good point earlier and missed my compliment to him, says that he uses them. The man who runs Pimlico Plumbers is exactly my age. He went to school and got nowhere. He was useless at school&#151;I hope that he will not mind my saying that&#151;and left and became a plumber. I should not be giving him an advert, but he was a skilled, good plumber and turned that into a business in which he guaranteed the quality, speed and so on of the plumbing, which is a wonderful thing in its own right. He turned it into a pretty sizeable, effective and successful business. I remember him telling his story in one of the newspapers. He was asked whether he would do it today, and he said no, because he did not like reading and writing, he did not like filling in forms and all that. The very thing that in some ways distinguishes the skilled working class in Britain from the rest of us is that they do not like the literary aspect of small business, although &#147;literary&#148; is hardly the word. They do not like filling in all the forms. I am afraid that that is a major impediment to the growth of small business.</p>

There is a deal to be struck across the whole EU, all of which faces this problem. Every company with fewer than 50 people could have certain levels of reduced regulation, or perhaps every company with fewer than 10, so that small businesses can start up. If we really want a solution to the problem of growth in the new era, that will be one big step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000528">There is also something to consider in the nature of the business that small businesses go in for. They tend not to be in the great international areas of business that have to compete with China and India. They tend to be localised and service-oriented, so they create the sort of business that is viable in the long term in our western economies. There is a serious deal to be struck among all the EU countries. For me to talk about doing deals in the EU is interesting in its own right, but that is something that we could usefully do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000529">I want to make a rather more esoteric point. The western capitalist market system has been allowed to slip, often by people who do not understand it well. The financial markets in the past few years have resembled a Marxist parody of a free market. They have had huge burdens of silly check-box regulations, but no serious, sensible regulations. Silly decisions have been made, such as the abolition of Glass-Steagall under the Clinton Administration. I cannot make up my mind about whether they did not understand it or whether they were simply bought out by the lobbyists, because $200 million passed into the electoral system from Wall street in those years. The system has come under much pressure, and failed for the reasons that I have discussed, including self-delusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000530">The massive flow of money from east to west accelerated the failure. India and China saved large quantities of money&#151;much more than they spent&#151;exported the money to us and we spent it. I believe that a Governor of the Bank of England, doing what the FSA was supposed to do, would have spotted, for example, building societies and banks giving 125 per cent. mortgages. A mortgage is part of an investment process, up to spending 100 per cent. of the value of the investment. However, a mortgage of 125 per cent. is a way of transmitting capital into consumption. Somebody who exercised a little common sense would have realised that. He would not have needed a rule, regulation or something laid down by Parliament&#151;he would have seen it coming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09042264000531">We must consider two things. First, we should try to ensure that the structure of our banking and financial systems is such that the important bits can be tackled with some simplicity, not complex check-box regulations. That is one component, and why Glass-Steagall is worth revisiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90422-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09042264000532">The second component relates to the aggregate macro-economic strategy. We must think hard about striking an east-west deal so that the money that has been flowing in a tide from east to west is recycled and goes back, too. The breakdown could happen again in another decade. We should bear it in mind that, in the century before last, such breakdowns happened approximately once every 10 years in America. It could happen again in another decade because the same pressures apply. At the moment, the Chinese are in a mood to talk because their economy is suffering quite seriously.</p>

 I am listening to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech with great interest. He mentioned Glass-Steagall. Will he reflect on the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which was not a deposit taker on the Glass-Steagall model? It would not necessarily have been protected, yet its failure has had catastrophic implications around the world. I wonder whether the distinction is perhaps harder to make today than it was in 1933.</p>

 I take the point. Glass-Steagall is not a solution by itself, but it simplifies one critical element of the system. It is critical no matter how big the banks are. I did a Harvard advanced management programme and, one day, our senior finance professor said something that shocked the entire class&#151;that tax complexity was in our interest. We all asked what he was talking about. He replied that, every year, Wall street employs 300 people with master of business administration degrees from the top business schools&#151;Wharton, Harvard, Stanford and so on&#151;while the Internal Revenue Service employs one middle-ranking MBA from Penn Central. He asked whom we thought out of that group would win the arms race. He was talking about tax, but the same argument applies to regulation. We will always lose the battle over complex regulation, so one of the strategies that the Government should consider is simplifying regulation in those sectors that it is vital to control, whatever the size of the individual companies in it. After all, as somebody said earlier, 12,000 banks went down in America in the &#146;30s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09042264000535">The other sector, however, has historically best been dealt with in America by anti-trust law&#151;it is the &#147;too big to fail, too big to bail&#148; problem. There is a need for at least another international discussion, if not an agreement, about how big we let some of those financial institutions get. There is an argument for an anti-trust approach. The original anti-trust laws in America were a mixture of political and economic decisions to do with minimising the risk of having too big an individual player in the corporate sector, after the great robber barons who built the American railways and so on. If we understand our history properly, we have to think about what size of corporation we allow to have certain key plays within the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000536">The other problem that we have here is one of transparency. The point about Lehmans is that I do not think that the American Government understood the linkages to Lehmans, through the credit default swap and collateralised debt obligation structures, and so on. My throwaway line earlier about instruments that were supposed to reduce risk ending up concealing it is quite relevant in this context, because that is what happened. There were individual risk reductions that did not apply to the whole system. I apologise to the House for going into terrible complexity in answering the Minister&#146;s point, but that seems to me to be one component of dealing with the overall system. Another component is ensuring that the risk transmission mechanisms are transparent and also that no organisation is too big to bail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09042264000537">I will draw my remarks to a conclusion on that point. Even given my political interests, I hope that the Budget is a success, because there are too many millions of people out there whose lives depend on it. I am pessimistic, because it seems that we are not addressing the fundamentals at the core of our problem. I say &#147;we&#148; because the political class in total has deluded itself about the vitality of the City and so on. We have allowed the problem to happen. It is the Government&#146;s responsibility: it happened on their watch and they have to sort it. However, because of those collective delusions, they have not addressed the right issue. It is a sad day for Britain and I am afraid that the Government will fail.</p>

 There is no doubt that this year&#146;s Budget has proved to be the most difficult Budget for this Government since we came to power, primarily because of the global economic crisis that this country finds itself in, along with a lot of the other westernised developed countries. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09042264000539">I for one welcome a lot of the measures in this year&#146;s Budget. Indeed, I would like to emphasise one or two of them that I particularly support. They include the extension of the stamp duty holiday on properties sold for less than &#163;175,000 until the end of the year. In contrast to what was said by the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main), who is no longer in her place, that will affect the vast majority of property sales in my constituency and will have a good knock-on effect on future property sales. Likewise, I certainly support the increase of the higher rate of income tax to 50 per cent. for people with salaries of more than &#163;150,000, which comes in next year. I also support the increase in funding for the digital industries, which has the potential to create many jobs, both directly and indirectly, particularly, I hope, in south Yorkshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09042264000540">Let me look at the social side of some of the policies contained in the Budget. I also welcome the increase in statutory redundancy pay from &#163;350 a week to &#163;385 a week, and the retention of the increase of the winter fuel allowance, which is worth &#163;250 for pensioners over 60 and &#163;400 for pensioners over 80, for another year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09042264000541">That leads me to the first omission of something that I would have liked to see included in this year&#146;s Budget&#151;something that I have been pushing for with both the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury&#151;which is the abolition of the so-called 25p age addition for pensioners over 80. It is nonsense that pensioners get an increase to their state pension of 25p, which has remained at the same level since 1971, when the Heath Government introduced it. In 1971, someone could buy a dozen eggs or a pound of cheddar cheese with 25p; now they could not even buy a second-class stamp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000542">The Government have introduced some good initiatives for older pensioners, such as the winter fuel allowance. I would like the 25p age addition scrapped, and &#163;25 or &#163;50 to be put on the winter fuel allowance. This is primarily because a third of all pensioners over the age of 80 in this country now pay income tax, so they are effectively paying income tax on that 25p increase. If the increase were added to their winter fuel allowance, however, it would be a capital allowance and they would receive the full benefit of the increase. The net cost to the Treasury of making that change would be &#163;15 million a year, which is peanuts. It costs &#163;35 million to pay the 25p a week. To add &#163;25 a year to the winter fuel allowance for people over 80 would cost &#163;50 million, and that would be &#163;50 million well spent. It would be well received by the pensioners of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000544">The reason I say that that hits a number of buttons is that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)&#151;who, unfortunately, is no longer in his place&#151;said that the private sector was bearing the brunt of the redundancies and job losses. That is not the case, and the sooner Conservative Members can get away from the notion of &#147;private sector, good; public sector, bad&#148;, the more it will be to their benefit. As far as I am concerned, the people who work in the private sector, the public sector and the third sector&#151;the charitable sector&#151;are all serving UK plc to the best of their ability. That is what we should be more concerned about. We need to continue to invest in jobs in the public sector in order to maintain that sector, because a lot of the small and medium-sized enterprises that are struggling to survive are dependent on their contracts with local councils, with the NHS and with quangos to sustain them. This idea of &#147;private sector, good; public sector, bad&#148; is a false notion that we need to get away from.</p>

That proves the success of what the Government are doing through Jobcentre Plus, through the regional Government offices&#151;we have a very good chief officer in the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber, Felicity Everiss&#151;and through the regional development agency, Yorkshire Forward, whose chief executive is Tom Riordan. They are doing a fantastic job of finding alternative employment or job opportunities for people who are being made redundant, particularly in industries such as the financial sector in West Yorkshire.</p>

They argue that while current cold weather payments are applicable only to pensioners in receipt of tax credits, former miners with a small work pension get cold just as quickly as the others do, so I believe that we should have given further consideration to that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000549">I have major problems with one proposal in the Budget&#151;the 2p increase in alcohol duty&#151;which I would like to draw to Ministers&#146; attention. It is not because I am a drunkard or anything like that, but we all get correspondence from constituents involved in the &#147;Axe the Beer Tax&#148; campaign, pointing out that many pubs and clubs are closing down because of losses resulting from the competition from supermarket chains selling drink. I am very concerned about that, and in my constituency I am just as concerned about clubs closing as I am about pubs closing. In my home village of Grimethorpe, for example, we have lost the miners welfare club; it provided extensive sports fields and other sports provision for the local community, but it closed just before Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09042264000550">Changing social patterns are also relevant, with people entertaining a lot more at home. I fully support consumer choice in that respect, but I think pubs and clubs provide a great deal of social cohesion, particularly in working-class communities. I would have supported an increase in alcohol taxation for supermarkets, if only we could have differentiated between those and licensed premises, and kept the tax off the licensed premises. I understand that this is a complicated issue, but I believe that in the circumstances, it would have been better to leave the 2p increase for another time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000551">I shall shortly draw my remarks to a close. Some Members have elaborated on their contributions, but I want to ensure that every Member who wants to speak in the debate can do so. I would, however, like to reiterate my main point, which some Conservative Members seem to ignore&#151;that the Government&#146;s current problems are not of their own making. They have been made by the global crisis created primarily by the sub-prime lending market in America, which has gradually snowballed and spread throughout the world. It has been recognised on all sides that there has been irresponsible lending by the banking sector. We must regulate not just in our own country but across the globe, so that confidence and trust in the banking sector can be rebuilt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000552">I recently spoke to a senior executive banking official in Yorkshire about how the banks could rebuild trust and confidence among their customers. In a sense, that is what the current crisis is all about: the banking customer has lost trust and confidence in the banking sector. I certainly agree with the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), who is no longer in his place, that some banks are actually milking their consumer and customer base, attempting to get more fees out of it than can fairly be tolerated, given current banking rates. I believe that it will take the banks a long time to rebuild customer trust. The successful banks of the future will be those that manage to achieve that in the shortest time. The banks are presently competing to try to regain trust from their customer base so that they can be successful again.</p>

the mess we are in. If we heard a variation of it once, we heard it a hundred times: this is a global problem. It is a pity that the Chancellor could not say those four special words, &#147;It started in America.&#148; Perhaps the Government do not say that any more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000555">However, the Government&#146;s prescription to cure the problem is interesting: more money for the jobcentre network to help get people who have lost their jobs back into the jobs that still exist is welcome, but they were forecasting the recovery based on quite extraordinary&#151;almost unbelievable&#151;growth figures in a few years&#146; time. The same applies to the actions that they are proposing for the businesses that will create the jobs we need and craft the recovery from the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000556">I suspect that the extension of tax relief for investments will be welcome, although the reaffirmation of a fuel duty escalator will not be welcome at all. I would have thought that with the barrel price sitting pretty stable at about $50 and the litre price at the pump sitting stable at about 95p, this was the time&#151;the stable time&#151;to put in the fuel duty regulator to deal with the spike when it happens next year, the year after that or the year after that. Instead, there seems to be simply another attempt to bring in more cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000557">In the middle of it all, however, are the proposals for &#163;15 billion of cuts. I think the Chancellor described that as fiscal tightening. Others have described it as efficiency. It is most certainly cuts, and we have had it confirmed today that next year alone, that means a &#163;500 million cut in the Scottish budget. I want to make it clear that that means the loss of 9,000 jobs, as a consequence of the &#163;500 million lost to the Scottish budget next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000558">The Government are missing an opportunity.

 The hon. Gentleman is always extremely interesting to listen to on financial matters.

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000564">The Budget also tells us how out of touch the Government were. They were frantically running around pretending that they were not complacent last year, when they said that we would come out of recession only a few weeks from now. Yet the Chancellor managed to say that he believed the economy would begin to recover this year. Given that the OECD and Ernst and Young are still forecasting negative growth for 2010, it seems almost unbelievable that the Government can forecast that we will come out of recession in 2009. I fear that when the pre-Budget report is delivered at the end of the year, the Government will give us another three or four-month target, and that may not be met either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000565">The full implications of the recession are clear&#151;not least the fact that, at 2 million, unemployment is already hitting the target forecast for the end of 2009. The Government appear to have been dragged here kicking and screaming to come clean about the true size of the national debt, which they have left as a mortgage debt for our children. It is &#163;1.6 trillion-ish. I am not sure whether that includes everything, but it is bound to include an awful lot. I am not sure what the figure per household is in the United Kingdom: &#163;70,000, perhaps. There are people in the real world who cannot afford a mortgage for their houses, but they may well be left to pay for one in the form of their share of the debt that the Government have built up.</p>

 We shall have to do the sums later. I am trying to do the mental arithmetic: &#163;1.6 trillion divided by 26 million households. May I ask the hon. Gentleman to intervene again in a few minutes once he has worked it out? That would be great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000568">The &#163;1.6 trillion figure makes the time before the recession, when there was a national debt of nearly half a trillion, seem almost like a golden age of prudence. The problem is, however, that it was not. It was a housing boom built on a credit bubble. There was too much money in the system early in the cycle, and too much debt at the end of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000569">We are responding today to a Budget statement from a Government who saw a million manufacturing jobs lost on their watch before the recession started, and 30,000 factory jobs lost every month since then. That makes it worse that the &#163;500 million that they are trying to cut from the Scottish budget may undermine the vital efforts to save jobs and stimulate the economy in Scotland. Although unemployment there is lower than it is in the United Kingdom, and although employment is higher and economic inactivity rates lower, there has been a rise in unemployment as part of the rise to 2.1 million in the United Kingdom. There was a record rise of 138,000 in February, and 177,000 people became unemployed in the last quarter. That means that 2,000 people a day became unemployed under Labour in the last three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90422-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09042264000570">Those are frightening figures. We must not allow anything to happen that would undermine the ability to invest in a recovery, and in particular, to create jobs.  <br>

the next three years; we learn today that they were out by &#163;138 billion. Governments used to be accused of being at sixes and sevens; I think this one are at billions and trillions, because that is how far out they are in their forecasts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09042264000580">The Government&#146;s other dirty little secret is the private finance initiative. We assessed last year that the taxpayer&#146;s PFI liability had increased by &#163;30 billion merely in the six months between the Budget and the pre-Budget statement. Today&#146;s Budget shows that up to 2033 the taxpayer liability remains over &#163;200 billion, at &#163;204 billion, much of it off balance sheet.</p>

However, given that the Budget forecast is based on a price of $46.7 a barrel, whereas Merrill Lynch has forecast $62 a barrel for 2010, and delivery prices for 2015 are already sitting at $80 a barrel, the real price and revenue yield is likely to be far higher. Those future prices confirm that the Treasury will continue to take a great deal of money from the North sea, but they also indicate underlying inflationary pressures, which risk worsening an already appalling trade deficit as the costs of essential imports rise. Even with a 15 per cent. fall for the pound against the euro since last summer and a 25 per cent. fall against the dollar, today&#146;s Budget forecasts, and the forecasts published in the last week or so, show a staggering &#163;44 billion balance of trade deficit and an extraordinary &#163;93 billion deficit in the trade in goods&#151;all the more reason to have a proper manufacturing strategy as soon as possible.</p>

Many are not yet up and running; some, like the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, have been the subject of complaints around the country; others, like the VAT cut, have saved less than half the number of jobs that direct capital investment could have saved. However, having put those schemes in place, and having lauded President Obama for his stimulus package, we now find that the Government are intent on doing the opposite of what they were trying to persuade the rest of the world to do, by making a &#163;15 billion cut next year, including a &#163;500 million cut in Scotland.</p>

Indeed, the &#163;15 billion cut will take more out of the economy than the VAT stimulus put into it. Therefore, the Chancellor is risking delaying the start of the recovery and making that recovery more painful than it might be. I do not want anyone to misunderstand me: I think that belt tightening is essential. The year-on-year efficiency savings of the Scottish Government represent the right approach. We must squeeze every ounce of value out of every public pound spent, but in the teeth of a recession, with unemployment rising and output and productive capacity down, we cannot risk undermining efforts to restart the economy anywhere in the UK.</p>

It is not too late to protect jobs and the economy, but I am sure that if the Government are not prepared to take the right steps to continue reflationary tactics and the recovery stimulus now, the electorate will speak volubly in the June elections, and in the next general election, about how the recession should be fought and about how recovery should be progressed.</p>

Those will primarily be ecological and resource crises; we will find ourselves facing peak oil, peak phosphates and peak water.

They were not the bulk of constituents in any of our constituencies; they were the people in the glittering towers of the global finance industry who demanded global deregulation of financial movements on a colossal scale and whose collapse is now requiring everyone else to pay for their profligacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09042264000591">My disagreement with the right hon. Gentleman came when he described today&#146;s capitalist system as a parody of Marxist market regulation. In a sense, I would have welcomed anything in the past 20 or 30 years that was a parody of Marxism, but we have not seen any such thing. What we have seen is, in a sense, a squandering of conventional and ecological resources to the point where we face a need to mobilise the remaining resources that we have in a quite different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000592">The Budget that we required today needed to be based around three components: honesty, a degree of equity, and something approaching the visionary. I give the Chancellor credit for the attempt at honesty about the circumstances in which the Budget was constructed, but in truth the Budget only tiptoed towards equity or to anything that might be construed as visionary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000593">One of the starting points for the equity agenda is the need to recognise&#151;difficult as it may be for colleagues on the Labour Benches&#151;that the tax gap between the richest and the poorest has actually widened in the 10 years or so that we have been in government. The poorest 20 per cent. of the population pay some 39 per cent. of their incomes in taxation in one form or another. The tax contribution by the richest 20 per cent. has fallen to an average of 35 per cent., and the very rich pay a considerably lower percentage. I had hoped that the Chancellor would use the Budget as an opportunity to remove dramatically some of the tax cushion constructed over the past 20 years that featherbeds the extremely rich. The opportunities were there to be bolder than he was today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09042264000594">In my opinion, the Budget should have removed the ceiling on national insurance contributions, which would have given the Chancellor an extra &#163;11 billion of retained revenues in the Exchequer. If the basic rate tax allowance had been applied to all pension savings, rather than the higher rate, the Exchequer would have an extra &#163;6 billion. If we were to attempt to end the profligacy of self-reward in the bonus culture, share-option offers and short trading, we could have introduced a 75 per cent. tax on all such activities. That would not stop those activities, but people would be taxed for the damage done by that short-termist and speculative approach to the UK&#146;s economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09042264000595">I read an article last week that powerfully made the case for the presumption of a minimum tax obligation. For those earning more than &#163;100,000 a year, the presumption would be that a minimum of 35 per cent. of those earnings would be paid in tax. For those earning more than &#163;200,000, the presumption would be that 45 per cent. tax would be paid. The collection from those shifts in taxation presumptions would give the Exchequer an extra &#163;25 billion with which to mobilise a shift in how we spend, or invest, our way out of recession.</p>

 One of the things that has annoyed and confused me over the years is the nonsensical view of incentives. Whenever we talk about what is required to provide incentives to work for the poor, it is compulsion and punishment. But apparently the rich have to be courted, wooed and induced to work. We need a consistent view of what mobilises people. This may be an appropriate time to reverse the presumptions that I have described and, for experimental purposes, woo the poor but punish the rich, but I do not want to go down that path. I want to go beyond presumptions about whom to punish and reward, because the real challenge as we make our way through this recession is to find a different and visionary description of how society can work. For me, the answer is unquestionably to be found in the greening of all future Budgets.</p>

However, it is important to put the UK&#146;s performance in the context of the performance of other countries that are not necessarily making the same strategic claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09042264000600">The most recent appraisal of the green proportion in governmental intervention measures and stimulus packages introduced around the world puts it at an average of around 15 per cent. In the UK, the proportion is just less than 7 per cent. That makes it hard to describe us as a world leader in that context. Moreover, the most recent analysis of that 7 per cent. suggests that the carbon savings in the green measures are outweighed by the carbon impact of the 520 carriage miles of new road construction that are also part of the package. Our attempts at carbon balancing must achieve carbon-negative Budgets. We cannot disregard the carbon damage caused by one part of the stimulus package that outweighs the carbon gain in another.</p>

 My hon. Friend is perhaps the most prominent ecological economist of his parliamentary generation, and he will be greatly missed. Does he agree that we should treat the proposal for a scrappage allowance of &#163;2,000 for cars over 10 years old with some caution? It gives the Budget a coat of green paint, but about 20 per cent. of all carbon emissions in a car&#146;s life are caused at the point of manufacture, and any savings that may be obtained by cleaner cars that use less fuel should be read in that light. Moreover, only one in seven of the cars purchased in this country is assembled here, so any economic benefit will be restricted.</p>

a carbon impact&#151;that would be like making an omelette without using eggs. That is the difficulty, and the question that we must resolve is how we make sure that the carbon gain of what we do outweighs the carbon cost. That is a terribly important consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09042264000603">My worry about the scrappage scheme is that it is very short term; it expires in 2010. It is cash-limited as well as time-limited, and it attaches no conditions to the nature of the replacement vehicle. We had a decade of voluntary agreements with the UK car manufacturing industry between 1997 and 2007, during which time the industry was supposed to reduce emissions from new cars manufactured to less than 140 g of carbon per kilometre. We got nowhere near delivery of that target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09042264000604">The successful schemes elsewhere on the continent contain conditionalities that require the replacement vehicle to emit less than, say, 100 g of carbon per kilometre. There are at least eight vehicles on sale in the UK that meet that standard. As I understand it, at least another six will become available this year. It is right to say that green measures will shift us to the consumption of things that tread more lightly on the planet, and away from the consumption of goods that tread heavily on the planet. However, there are no conditionalities built into the UK scrappage scheme proposals that would structurally move us to where we need to be within the next two to three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09042264000605">With green measures, I always think that the most important thing to do is to translate the notion of green or ecology into practical, tangible jobs. Without a doubt, the leader in that field internationally is South Korea. Its stimulus package is around &#163;30 billion, 81 per cent. of which&#151;&#163;23 billion&#151;is to go on green measures. It has set itself some very specific targets. Not all of them will be earth-changing, but they mobilise huge numbers of people. For instance, it is a commitment of the South Korean Government that the lighting in every single public building in South Korea will be changed to light-emitting diode valves this year. More than 1 million light bulbs and light fittings will have to be changed. Every one of those fittings will have to be changed by people who are capable of carrying out the electrical installation. People will also have to manufacture the bulbs. That shift will deliver both jobs and a dramatic reduction in the carbon consumption of all public buildings, and the commitment is that it will take place this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09042264000606">South Korea has also made a commitment to build within the next four years 1 million eco-homes, and a further 1 million existing houses will be refurbished to low-carbon standards. The number of jobs involved in that process is massive. South Korea is using directed public investment, channelled through private providers in the construction and contracting sector, to deliver both economic and ecological transformation. It has a quantitative target for delivering change. My experience of trying to do similar work in countries in other parts of the EU shows that wherever a country runs those practical, targeted programmes, today&#146;s unemployed, and particularly today&#146;s young unemployed, are desperate to be part of it. They want to be part of the solution to today&#146;s problem, rather than be defined as today&#146;s problem. We have to address their aspirations in the context of the practical jobs that such a green transformation would bring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09042264000607">I was pleased to see in the Government&#146;s proposals an extension of the low-carbon buildings programme. It is a small measure&#151;a commitment of &#163;45 million to extend the programme beyond its expiry date of June this year. The reason why I focus on that is that, although our Government are committed to introducing feed-in tariffs for renewable energy into the UK energy market hopefully by the end of this year or by the beginning of next, almost all the renewable energy sector was saying to us that unless there was a bridge between the end of the low-carbon buildings programme in June and the start of the feed-in tariff regime at the beginning of next year, the bulk of the industry would die. The reality would then have been that, by the time our Government got round to introducing the feed-in tariff regime, the only suppliers catering for and responding to the regime would have been outside the UK. It is a therefore a huge &#147;small&#148; relief. The industry that we have, which has survived despite rather than because of Government policy, will at least still be in existence when we produce the real stimulus to shift us to renewable and sustainable energy systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90422-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09042264000608">To do that, however, we needed bigger measures in the Budget. At least &#163;100 billion ought to have been allocated to the creation of a green infrastructure bank. Some of the moneys raised from the tax changes that I mentioned earlier could have been used. More importantly, we need to understand that we are currently putting about &#163;50 billion a year into UK pension funds. The difficulty is that those funds are still circulating in pursuit of short-term returns within a speculative and almost paranoic global financial market. We need to give people the capacity to invest in their own ecological future and their own pension security. A green infrastructure bank, underpinned by that sort of funding, would be an essential part of the transformational shift that we must make.</p>

I welcome the ritual denunciation, but I ask them to hold fire because there is a gap between that appointment and the fact of not having a single meeting with officials at the Treasury or the Department of Energy and Climate Change to drive that through. All my experience suggests that there is an intellectual inertia at the core of our civil service that blocks the introduction of radical and dramatic changes, because civil servants have been caught up in a 20-year culture of non-interventionism. They would just like someone else in the market to do it for them, rather than taking hold of the responsibility for driving the change.</p>

introduction of feed-in tariffs on photovoltaics, biodigesters, solar thermal&#151;the whole range of renewable technologies that we could and should be supporting. It will require someone to drive that through, and that, for me, is what is missing from the Budget: the willingness to drive aspirations into deliverable and measurable policy changes within a defined timetable. If we are to do that, it would be a great advantage to recognise the points that were recently made about where our current business-as-usual case would take us in UK energy accounts. The business-as-usual case will take us into a huge deficit in the balance of payments for the consumption of energy by 2020. That is on the conventional plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09042264000614">However, a fascinating report came out this week from Delta Energy and Environment which points out that a dramatic shift into UK renewables would not only see us delivering more than 15 per cent. of our energy requirements from renewables by 2020, but more importantly would see us with a &#163;12.5 billion surplus on our energy account&#151;primarily because the jobs and services would be delivered for ourselves, rather than our being dependent on external suppliers for our energy security.

I say that not to scare people but simply to point out that the situation requires us to step up to the plate&#151;to be big enough to govern our way through that transformation and those crises.

If we could harness the desire for work to structured plans for transformation, we would have a Budget that was the saving, not so much of this Government but of this society for future generations. We require Budgets that live more lightly and sustainably on the planet. Sadly, today&#146;s Budget is several steps away from that. I urge Ministers to think again and find the courage to step in and act in transformational terms to save the ecological future of our society and our country. It is infinitely more important and urgent than the situation in which they found the courage to intervene to save a banking system that, some would argue, would have been better left to collapse.</p>

In his new role, he suffers from the problem that we spent too easily money that we did not have. It is not just the banks that got us into trouble, but the Government&#146;s expenditure, which was not related to the true state of even a successful economy. It means that, now, we probably have the fastest rising Government debt as a proportion of GDP of any advanced nation in the G20.

What I mean by that is that the globalised impact that has affected all the advanced countries of the world&#151;and caused collateral damage, of course, in the less developed world&#151;has shown that we cannot adjust an economy only by taking measures internally. We learned that during the banking crisis. I do not think that the American Government entirely understood what they were doing in allowing Lehman Brothers to collapse. They did not understand that the certificates securitised on the back of the mortgage industry not only involved Lehman Brothers in New York, but were spread&#151;we still do not know how widely&#151;around the world. Everybody in the world was therefore suddenly affected by the American Government&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09042264000623">In a different context, we have understood that it is no good having a currency that falls in value if there is nobody to buy our exports, which would normally have benefited from the situation. In a different context again, the German Government suddenly understood that although they had felt that their domestic economy was doing well, they forgot that their whole economy depended on their tremendous historic success in the export markets; other countries needed to reflate if the German economy was to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09042264000624">The Government got it right in another way. In a recession, there is a temptation&#151;an obligation, almost&#151;on the private sector to save, or reduce its borrowing. If that is the case, it is essential that the Government do the opposite; otherwise, the recession will be deeper and longer. The Government stimulus was the right move. The criticism might be that they did not handle their  <br>

VAT reduction well. The timing was not good because all the Christmas sales were on at the same time, and it was difficult to get a 2.5 per cent. reduction on VAT of 17.5 per cent. across to the public at that stage. However, I suspect that the cut has now begun to stimulate the economy, as certain independent bodies have begun to say. That is a belated bonus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09042264000625">The overall stimulus package was right, however. I disagree with what I think the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) was saying. Of course it was essential to protect the banking sector, because without it there would not have been ecological activities at any level&#151;let alone the levels that he would like. How we protect the banking sector is a detailed matter, which Select Committees can investigate for weeks on end, but what I am saying is that the Government were right to introduce the stimulus package. That stimulus has been allied to the stimuli that have taken place in other countries. In the end, the stimulus in Germany turned out to represent a bigger percentage of GDP than our own. The American stimulus is an extremely important event. There are criticisms that it has gone too far, and Congress has ample ability to add in a few pork barrel opportunities, which will probably distort the package. Nevertheless, the overall thrust is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09042264000626">The collective effort of the world has been such that I think that we can now see the beginnings of the end of the worst of the recession&#151;although sadly, as always, the bad news is still to come out. Unemployment in this country will rise towards 3 million because of the economy today, even though the country may see a turn in its overall economic prospects. Those prospects have changed because there has been collective action around the world, although it has been difficult. As long as the measures agreed are applied in practice, the G20, which is actually the &#147;G28&#148; in this sense, was rather effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09042264000627">There is a lesson to which we should pay attention in this country. It is that we are one member of the &#147;G28&#148;, but things are beginning to change in the world. Washington and Beijing regard the real determinants of how the global economy rebuilds as being down to the &#147;G2&#148;&#151;China and America regard themselves as being the two that determine how it goes. Why is there not a G3? Because the European Union has not been as effective as it needs to be. It will not surprise some of my hon. Friends if I say that it is in the British national interest that the European Union is more effective, because by ourselves, however much we try, we will not make our voice heard within the G28 at the level at which we have traditionally thought that it would be heard. Our influence therefore has to be exerted through a collective role for the European Union in what would then genuinely become a G3 rather than just a G2.</p>

I would like to share some of the thoughts expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) in what was an extremely good and quasi-philosophical speech. We have to accept that just hoping for recovery will not be sufficient, and that it is about time that we started to think about what sort of economy we really want. It must be open and global, yes&#151;for the reasons I have stated, it is almost impossible for it not to be so. Certainly, the old capitalism based on   <br>

the individual and&#151;to employ a word used by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South&#151;avarice will not do. The public will not buy it: they want something more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09042264000629">We have to be slightly humble in this country and try to work out what others have tried to formulate in different ways&#151;a concept of social democracy and Christian democracy rolled together, where the reason for prosperity is that it means we can help each other and help people who are vulnerable. If that is the purpose of growth, profit and expansion, they are worth having and worth striving for. We want to rebuild the financial community, we want London to regain its status as a financial global centre, we want to build up business again to be profitable, and we want the banking community to start lending. That is not because we want to give people back their bonuses or give them the opportunity to make money and have bigger cars, but because it is the only way that we can have enough wealth to share with other people. That vision makes it absolutely crucial that we start to rebuild now. If we can provide that moral leadership, we can begin to influence not only people in this country but those in a wider sphere. That has been lacking in the debate so far. We have been agonising about this or that isolated issue, such as whether the automobile industry is going to recover. All those things are important, but they provide no context as to what we are trying to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09042264000630">I hope that the Government and my own party will try to put our current circumstances in context. There is a desperate hope that the Government have got their growth forecast figures right. For goodness&#146; sake, if they had made those forecasts as a public company, they would have been de-listed from the stock exchange and banned from ever being a director again. Somehow, we can get away with such forecasts in politics, but people cannot get away with it in business. We have to hope that growth returns, but if the public are to go through the pain of the almost inevitable increases in taxation as well as the impact of restraint in public expenditure over the next few years, they have to know what it is all for&#151;why we are trying to rebuild this society and this economy, what we are trying to do as part of a structure, and why we are trying to help people who are most vulnerable. It is because without doing that, we will have instability in society.</p>

Member for Nottingham, South, but more general. It is about the importance of creating a society that is capable of solving some of the problems that we as individuals face, which means meeting the need to spend more money on science, research and innovation. That is partly because there is a competitive world economy, and if we do not do it in this country, other countries are doing it. President Obama has put an enormous amount of money into science and research in the US. His stimulus budget is about $22 billion. But what is required is not just sums of money but a vision. In the great depression, Roosevelt had that vision and launched a crusade to try to change the infrastructure, science and ecological environment of the south of the United States, with tremendously positive results, and galvanised people in the process. We have lost that in this country.</p>

There was not the drive for ecological change for which the hon. Gentleman and I share a desire, with different emphases. There was no understanding that this is an opportunity to consider unleashing medical science to solve some of the big medical problems. The Cooksey report gives us guidelines as to how we might go about that. We could try to unlock some of the scientific problems that will determine the quality of life in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09042264000633">In my own report to my party&#146;s Front Benchers, I have proposed an innovative projects agency, which would start with &#163;1 billion. It has some similarity with what the Government have started today, but it would be intended to take ideas beyond the point of discovery. We have huge admiration for our scientists who come up with brilliant ideas from basic research, but we are less good at pulling those ideas through into practical application. We cannot expect the private sector to do that by itself. There has to be collaboration in that grey area between discovery and proper application. The Government should be doing those things, and they should engage the public more in why they are being done. It is not about picking winners, it is about stimulating opportunities for the economy, which can then provide benefits for other people. I could go through a list of areas in which I would like that to take place. Last night I became the chairman of the all-party parliamentary and scientific committee, and I hope to make many more speeches in the House on these matters, so I shall not get down to specifics now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09042264000634">At a time of real depression, when there has been a Budget that contained extremely depressing figures, we need an uplift. The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is smiling, and that by itself is an uplift for me, but I think that the public will probably be a bit more demanding. They want not just some context to the pain that they are going through now&#151;believe you me, even in my constituency in Surrey there are plenty of people in pain&#151;but to know why they will have to bear the pain in the future. What are we really trying to do? What can we do to make society cohere so that it comes out of this stronger? Then they will understand why they might have to pay a top rate of tax of 50p in the pound. People are more generous-spirited if they know why something is being done. I did not get that from today&#146;s Budget, and I wish that I had, because it is in the national interest that we should.</p>

 I shall speak very briefly, because others wish to get in. I shall focus on two aspects of the Budget. On the first part of the speech, Members on the Labour Benches were thrilled when the Chancellor said that even in times of extreme difficulties, we had different priorities from others and would ensure that the Budget was shaped in such a way as to protect the poorest. We are never happier than when the Government are ensuring that there is a wide, red sea between us and the other side. There was slight disappointment among many of us, if I put it gently, when the Chancellor did not go on to say what he was going to do about the 10p losers. I am sure that the Treasury Front-Bench team will not be too dispirited to know that some of us will return to that issue, to ensure  <br>

that that red sea is even wider than the Government envisaged in the Budget statement. However, all credit to the Government for saying that the worse the crisis, the more focused we must be on the poorest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09042277000011">My second point is on a similar theme: no crisis, however horrible, should make us waste radical purposes. I have listened to Budget debates in the House for 30 years, yet I have never before felt the excitement, if that is the right word, that I experienced just before 1 o&#146;clock, when the Chancellor announced the public borrowing for this year and next year&#151;&#163;175 billion this year and &#163;173 billion next year. At that very moment, the country&#146;s economic future, and much more besides, was cast on the waters of the money markets. If the Government are not successful in raising the record sums of money, we will clearly be in great difficulties. Hon. Members know&#151;thank goodness, the figures have become common currency&#151;that we are attempting proportionately to borrow more than any of our fellow G8 members. The times are therefore difficult for the Government and the country. Even in the early stages of trying to raise the debt, there has been some stickiness&#151;I put it no more strongly&#151;in the gilts market, where the Government have not always got their way in raising the money on the weekly basis that is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09042277000012">The Budget contains a table&#151;C7&#151;which gives urgency to my comments. The Chancellor was, thank goodness, as optimistic as ever about recovery, despite the fact that, compared with the time of the pre-Budget report, when we thought that unemployment would be about 1.4 million at the end of next year, he now believes that there will be 1 million more unemployed&#151;approximately 2.5 million. According to the International Labour Organisation&#146;s definition, the figure could be above 3 million. Not only constituents in Surrey feel the pain, but Members of Parliament will feel the pain of going into an election, if it is held in April or May next year, with unemployment at that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09042277000013">The Chancellor suggests in table C7 that, even after a considerable period of recovery, we will not get revenue to support expenditure&#151;we will not get revenue to reach 38 per cent. of GDP&#151;by 2013-14. Yet all of us are on the drug of wanting Governments to spend 45 or 50 per cent. of GDP. I am worried about how the Government will raise the funds, given that a Government who wished to squeeze the rich &#147;until the pips squeak&#148;, as Mr. Healey once said, did not get revenue above 37 per cent. of GDP. Much more than what the Budget outlined today is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09042277000014">We must not only think of effective ways in which to raise revenue, but think in a way in which we have never previously thought about how we cut&#151;I use the word &#147;cut&#148;&#151; public expenditure. It is not that I am not radical, but in those circumstances we might find ourselves being even more radical than we have been in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09042277000015">I offer an illustration of that. I have lobbied the Government to adopt a pension reform that, in a sense, leads to a loss of interest in the huge ramifications with which we concern ourselves, and goes for a single objective of trying to guarantee a pension that, over time, lifts everybody out of poverty. It will obviously take time. It is about building an investment fund around the pay-as-you-go state scheme. At the moment, the Government are rejecting that reform and are committing us to a   <br>

programme that will add 5.5p to the standard rate of tax, spending more on their pensions reform, yet that will leave 40 per cent. of pensioners poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09042277000016">In this situation, radicals will say, &#147;Surely we can begin to spend that money much more effectively,&#148; which would mean something like the proposals that a number of us have put forward. That would not only secure the huge gain of committing the Government for the first time ever to ending pensioner poverty in times when we are cutting public expenditure, but for the first time ever open the debate in a civilised way about how we disengage from public sector pensions, including our own pension. We could safely say that we were closing all schemes to new members, because we would have in place a guarantee that nobody who is a citizen and does their bit will end up poor. We would then begin not only to save public expenditure on the Government&#146;s pension proposals, but build big savings into our national accounts over time from the closure of all public sector schemes, including our own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09042277000017">That would also begin to give us the vision that was talked about by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor), whom I am pleased to follow. We need some sort of vision to engage, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) said, in a way that galvanises the population. As we try to get our expenditure down to what taxpayers are prepared to pay, we clearly need some vision of what the new state is going to be like, because it will have to do things differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09042277000018">I thank the Government for suggesting that our side is going to have as our priority protecting the poorest. We are going to put even more wind in their sails. I hope that we will do justice to the 10p losers before the Finance Bill is through, as we said we would. There are 3.8 million of them out there still waiting for us to deliver on that pledge, and that is quite a lot of constituents and voters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90422-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09042277000019">In a sense, one&#146;s whole empathy is with the Government, as they now try to grapple with what will be, for the rest of my lifetime, the central domestic political issue: how we begin to get the revenue that we can raise in taxes towards the level of what we can afford to spend. That will bring about a change in politics, which will not be just old-fashioned cuts politics and all the rest, but will open enormous opportunities for radical politics. I hope to be around for a few years yet to participate in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09042277000022">The right hon. Gentleman also spoke about the spectre of the vast and rapidly increasing levels of unemployment, as did a number of hon. Members in all parts of the House. That is an increasing concern for us all, in all our constituencies. I know that I am not alone in having seen unemployment in my constituency more than double in the past year, which is an alarming increase, albeit from a relatively low base. The announcement of &#163;1.7 billion more to help deal with that problem is welcome, as long as it is used effectively. I have a real concern, however, that that might just go into the machinery of the new deal, and much of it could be wasted, just as so much has been wasted by using the revolving door method of taking people off unemployment benefit, thus reducing the apparent period of unemployment, then dumping them back on to it. I hope that the Government will make every effort to ensure that those resources are directed to the more effective schemes. Those are often the smaller, more local schemes run by voluntary organisations, of the kind that are all too often run much more effectively in other countries than they are here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09042277000023">There are, of course, measures in the Budget that we all welcome. I was pleased to hear the reference to the trade credit insurance measures, for example. I am sure that Members across the House will hear repeatedly from those in their constituencies and elsewhere about the very real problems that they are encountering because of the withdrawal of trade credit insurance, so I hope that the scheme will be effective. All too often over the past few months we have seen schemes brought forward with commendable motives, but which do not seem to have come into effect as quickly or as substantially as is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09042277000024">I want to say a few words about some of the details that should have been addressed in the Budget but have not been, before I make a wider point afterwards. I know that Ministers are engaged in live debates on these matters, but I want to highlight some of the things that are missing. Last year I spoke against the adoption of aviation duty, which I thought would be a bad tax that would have all sorts of negative effects. I was therefore delighted when, in November, the Government accepted that it would be a bad tax and would not work. However, they then responded by introducing some ad hoc measures relating to air passenger duty, which have problems of their own, especially in connection with the banding, and the fact that an unfair burden is being imposed on premium economy seats. I know that Ministers are dealing with those problems&#151;or at least having discussions about them&#151;and I know that they are difficult to resolve. However, given that the Budget papers today tell us that the projected revenues from air passenger duty are reducing rather than rising, we have to wonder whether the Government themselves think that they have got that tax right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09042277000025">I raised the issue of fuel duty in the Budget debate last year. We have now seen a further increase. That will be painful for drivers, but massively painful for British hauliers, who face intense competition from continental Europe, where their competitors often pay much lower rates of duty. There was some recognition in the pre-Budget report of the problems relating to fuel duty, and it was said that the VAT cut would give a degree of compensation,  <br>

although of course that will only be temporary. The Chancellor said earlier that he would keep an eye on oil prices, but we have heard from the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) that the future price of oil is looking worrying. To follow up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor), we still see no coherence in what the Government are trying to achieve through the fuel duty. Do they want to set a competitive level or are they concerned only with maximising revenue? Do they really recognise the necessity to ensure that our industry remains competitive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09042277000026">This illustrates the central contradiction in the Chancellor&#146;s approach. That contradiction was there before today&#146;s Budget, but it was also clearly displayed within it. It can be summed up by looking at the temporary VAT cut, which was introduced with the intention of reducing the severity of the downturn by about 0.5 per cent. of gross domestic product. There are questions about whether it was the most effective way of reducing tax in order to achieve that goal, but its introduction provided a wonderful moment of hope that perhaps, after years of the Government thinking that taxes on businesses and consumers could be increased without limit, without having any negative effect or inflicting pain on the economy, the Chancellor was going to cut taxes to benefit economic growth in the United Kingdom. However, the reduction is, of course, temporary, and due to be reversed at the end of the calendar year&#151;and if we look at the wider set of proposals in the Budget, we see fiscal tightening over the years ahead: &#163;1,000 of tax rises per family over the next two years.</p>

We will all be fighting those battles for many years to come. I hope to be here, along with the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, to listen to future Budgets, which I hope will make the real progress that this one has failed to make.</p>

 It is always good to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)&#151;which is what my hon. Friend, in turn, said about the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). They both made forceful and thoughtful speeches, showing great restraint in their timing; I shall do the same, as I know that at least one other Member wishes to contribute to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09042277000029">First, I declare an interest as the proprietor of Evans News, a convenience store in Swansea that sells alcohol and cigarettes, for both of which this Budget has implications. Much has been said about the public debt that has been built up, and the enormous public debt that will be built up this year and next&#151;the greatest public debt that this country has ever seen.</p>

super-bug infection in a Swansea hospital, my mother died on 27 March. Almost 10,000 people died of super-bug infections in 2007, and no Member wants to see avoidable deaths continue at the present level in our hospitals. To put the number of hospital deaths from super-bugs into context, fewer than 3,000 people died from accidents on the roads. Money should be directed towards ensuring that hospital infections are completely eradicated; they seemed not to occur at all 20 years ago, yet all of a sudden there are massive numbers of deaths. I wanted to raise that issue on behalf of my mother and others, but I shall not concentrate on it any further today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09042277000031">I wished to raise a number of points, but given the time constraints, I shall deal with only a few of them. Some hon. Members have already spoken about the support needed by small and medium-sized enterprises. Business rates clearly affect them, and although the Government have announced that the misery to be inflicted on SMEs will be spread out over more years, the fact remains that they will still have to suffer the pain of paying higher business rates. Some SMEs are marginal businesses, and some make hardly any money, so we must ensure that we support them properly, and find ways of limiting the business rates that they have to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para10"><a name="09042277000032">I also want to say something about credit insurance, and also something about the short-time working subsidy, which the Government need to consider further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09042277000033">One campaign that I have been running, which has clearly been a complete flop, is the &#147;Axe the Beer Tax&#148; campaign. We saw further increases in taxation on beer today, yet 40 pubs close every week, and thousands of people are losing their jobs every year. Pubs are small and medium-sized enterprises, and we all know the great work that those iconic British institutions play in our communities, not just in rural areas, where they are particularly important, but throughout the country. Pubs have dual uses, and the rate at which they are closing has not been helped by the continuation of the taxation that the Chancellor has announced today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09042277000034">I have received a letter from the Government. We asked about a differential tax rate for beer pulled at the pump as opposed to beer sold in bottles and cans from supermarkets, but I am told that we cannot have that, because the EU will not allow it. I implore Ministers to go to Brussels, sit with the Commission and work out what it takes to change that directive, or law, so that we can start to support the great British pub again. I will leave that suggestion with the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury; I know she is aware of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09042277000035">The next issue is fuel, which my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West mentioned. Fuel is almost reaching &#163;1 a litre again&#151;another increase was announced in the Budget today&#151;and 70p of that &#163;1 goes in taxation. It is not as if we operate in splendid isolation from other countries. We do not. My hon. Friend also mentioned hauliers, who are put at a competitive disadvantage. For my constituents in rural areas, cars are not luxuries. In many cases, no rural public transport whatever is available to them, so they need their cars. I ask the Government to look at the impact that that increase is having on rural drivers and people who need a car to go to work. Government must not simply take motorists for granted and impose ever-increasing rates of taxation on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09042277000036">One area that the Government might reconsider, where we might be able to make substantial savings, is that of some public sector salaries&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) touched on this subject. MPs are pilloried in the papers for the amount that we earn, but my goodness, we are mere amateurs compared to some local authority chief executives and officers, and others who operate within the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09042277000037">It has been recorded that more than 1,000 people who work in local authorities earn more than &#163;100,000. At least 16 of them earn more than the Prime Minister, at more than &#163;194,000. One earns more than &#163;500,000. For goodness&#146; sake, where is the pay restraint in local authorities? Pensioners and people living on limited and poor incomes are having to scrape together the money to pay their council tax, yet it is being siphoned off by an elite group who work for our local authorities. That must be looked at again. Such salaries must be capped. There has to be restraint in our local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09042277000038">The other issue also involves the public sector, and there must be capping here, too. I serve on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and I always enjoy having Mark Thompson, the director-general of the BBC, give evidence before us&#151;but he earns more than &#163;800,000. I cannot believe that sort of money&#151;and of course he also has expenses on top of that. Again, that makes MPs look like complete amateurs, as such people are trousering lots of money in expenses and showing no restraint whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09042277000039">The head of Network Rail earns &#163;1.25 million a year. Adam Crozier of Royal Mail earns almost &#163;1.25 million. Andy Duncan at Channel 4 earns &#163;1,211,000. Where is the pay restraint in the public sector? One lady has just taken over as chairman of Ofcom; she works less than five days a week, and earns more than &#163;200,000 a year. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I am informed that she works a three-day week. We know that there are quango heads who earn substantial sums for part-time work. Quite frankly, that shames us all, because we have lost the plot, and lost our grip.</p>

We have had a bankrupt Budget from a bankrupt Government who now administer a bankrupt country. Each time the Chancellor said that he wanted to do something to help the country, I thought that he was going to announce his resignation, but sadly, he did not. The best thing that he and the rest of this Government could do would be to go to the country, and ask for the public&#146;s verdict on how they have conducted the country&#146;s affairs.</p>

It tends to hurt my head if I think about things that are beyond my comprehension, and I think that that was the Chancellor&#146;s general approach today. He preferred to talk about the minutiae. He spurted out figures, one after another. In one section of his speech, when he was talking about banks and percentages, we heard about percentages of 59, 68, 74, 78 and 79, and sums of &#163;175 billion and &#163;173 billion. He then mumbled some generalisations about the future, but he avoided talking about the big picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09042277000044">I think that it was the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) who asked what was the vision for the Budget, and he was spot on. If people are to buy into the pain that we will experience, they need to know what is the promise&#151;the pledge&#151;for the future, but there was nothing for them to grab other than a series of individual announcements. I welcomed some of them: the announcement on carbon capture, about which I shall say more shortly, was excellent. However, there was no big vision. There was nothing for people to grab hold of and consider to be worth going through pain for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09042277000045">One of the biggest financial stimuli&#151;although I am not sure whether the Chancellor classed it as a financial stimulus&#151;was for Jobcentre Plus. While I think it worthy to invest more money to retrain and support people, I do not recall the Chancellor tramping around the world trying to secure the support of other countries for that sort of financial stimulus. I am not sure whether we have been given the Budget that we have been promised over the past few weeks. I believe that this is a Budget of missed opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09042277000046">The big debate on which the Prime Minister likes to try to make us focus deals with whether we are to have the do-nothing approach of the Tories or the all-action approach of the Labour party. It would be nice if it were as simple as that, but in the case of a financial stimulus it is what you do that counts. I want to try to create something new out of this crisis. I do not want to patch up the old; I want to create something of which we can be proud. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) made some good points when he described, very knowledgeably, the experiences of South Korea. I think that we should try to build something of that kind.</p>

Minister should consider giving evidence. He should do so because when he was Chancellor he did not impose the appropriate financial regulatory machinery that would have prevented these catastrophic mistakes from being made within the society. Although it is quite a small society in UK terms, it is a symbolic institution and it is right on his doorstep. He will feel pressure locally, therefore, and he might want to seek the opportunity to explain what his role was in the demise of the society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09042277000049">There are some related issues. I was hoping that we might get some more radical reform of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, because the balance between risk and value in how the levy is allocated is currently completely out of kilter. There is not the appropriate recognition of institutions that are relatively safe in their outlook, and they are therefore penalised in the same way as the reckless. I was hoping a reform would be announced today, but, alas, that did not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para27"><a name="09042277000050">The second issue is the capital requirement. Lord Turner has advocated a flexible capital requirement for institutions, which should lend from 7 per cent. in the good times to 4 per cent. in the more difficult times. Unfortunately, the Financial Services Authority currently imposes a requirement of 8 per cent. across the board, which penalises a lot of organisations and institutions that are doing a very good job in very trying circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para28"><a name="09042277000051">Since the beginning of the year, I have visited about 100 businesses in my constituency. Going around them is a very interesting experience, because we often think they are one big homogenous mass and that everybody is suffering right across the board, but that is not true. Some businesses are actually doing quite well. They are smart businesses that are adapting to the circumstances. They might be operating in the &#147;make do&#148; area&#151;fixing fridges or cars, perhaps. They are doing quite well; they are recruiting people and they are quite optimistic. I must add, however, that there were a lot of empty units as I travelled around the industrial estates, so there were others who were not able to speak for themselves. Nevertheless, we should acknowledge that despite the trying circumstances some businesses are doing quite well, and we should not kid ourselves that they are one big homogenous mass. We should reflect on that when devising policy, because we need to have appropriate mechanisms in place to support the businesses that are doing well&#151;despite the best efforts of the Government, I would add.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90422-0018.htm_para29"><a name="09042277000052">Bank lending is an issue. The Red Book contains some figures about how much the banks are committed to lending over the next year: &#163;25 billion for RBS, &#163;14 billion for Lloyds, and &#163;5 billion for Northern Rock&#151;and I am sure there are others. The trouble is, however, that it is all very well committing, but the conditions and the commercial requirements that are in place are crucial. We need to have arrangements that recognise valuable businesses.</p>

He was a smart guy with a great business opportunity, but he is not managing to go ahead with it simply because the banks were not prepared to lend him the money he needed. This is partly to do with the skills of the people who work in the banks. In the past they were salesmen grabbing every opportunity they possibly could, but now they are being told to hold back, and they think, &#147;I&#146;m not going to be the first person to say to my manager that I want to make a slightly more risky loan than others might recommend even though I think it&#146;s a great opportunity.&#148; We need to ensure that we have quality people within these institutions who can assess whether a business is a good opportunity.</p>

 I have talked to people involved in banking in my own area of Northern Ireland and they have confessed that in the past 10 to 15 years banks were lending junkies. Yet now, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledges, we are relying on the very pushers to manage their way through this problem. We have recapitalised the banks&#151;we have put the money in and helped to stabilise them&#151;and are simply relying on them to conduct things, yet, as he says, we hear from businesses that they are not getting the credit. Does he agree that this House perhaps needs to have more oversight of banking performance and practices in such circumstances? We cannot leave it to the Treasury Committee to try to pursue and examine these things, in addition to the huge amount of other things that it is having to deal with in this situation. Given the scale of intervention and support that there has been from the taxpayer, perhaps we need to see how the House can provide a bit more oversight and put better manners on some of the banks.</p>

 That is absolutely right, although I am not sure that we are the best people to run the banks and I fear that in the current circumstances we may go from one extreme to the other. I think that the banks have gone from being lending junkies to not lending anything at all because they have clamped down on everything out of fear that they will be the first to get it wrong. We should have more oversight, but the banks should look at the quality of the people working for them&#151;I am sure that they are doing that. We do not need the pushers any more; we need the assessors, who can spot value and spot the winners. If we do not get that area right, we will end up suffering even more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09042277000072"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That this House do now adjourn.<i> &#151;(Mr. Ian Austin.)</i></p>

 The purpose of this debate is to draw the House&#146;s attention to the abysmal state of debt collection methodology and the spirit governing it in the UK and the wholly inadequate safeguards for good and innocent people who are endeavouring to pay debt or who dispute it. It is a matter of fact that the debt collection industry relies on a combination of fear and ignorance to make a profit, and that is despicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09042277000074">In 2006, the Office of Fair Trading and related agencies received some 5,700 complaints. In 2007, that figure had reached 8,000 and more than 11,000 complaints had been received by August 2008. That is a total of 25,000 complaints in three years, but the Office of Fair Trading took formal action&#151;such as licence revocation or suspension, or the imposition of other requirements on debt collection agencies&#151;in only four cases. I shall illustrate tonight that that is a wholly inadequate response and that Parliament has failed to stiffen the sinews of the OFT and give it legislative powers and duties to protect and promote the interests of innocent people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09042277000075">By coincidence, in the past 24 hours, the OFT has taken action against an outfit called Mackenzie Hall. Some of its procedures were found to breach the OFT&#146;s guidelines. Ray Watson, the OFT director of consumer credit, said:</p>
<a name="90422-0019.htm_brev10"><a name="09042277000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Persisting with debt collection activity when debts are in dispute can give rise to significant consumer detriment, particularly where vulnerable consumers are involved.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09042277000076">But that is a pathetic response, because similar abuse happens every day in countless agencies. All we see is limp and late action by the OFT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09042277000077">How did I come to seek this debate? There were several reasons and I shall share them with the House. First, a constituent wrote to me in March because he had received a menacing letter from the communications company 3, which claimed that he owed it more than &#163;800. The letter requested that he</p>
<a name="90422-0019.htm_brev11"><a name="09042277000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;treat this matter with the utmost urgency. Failure to respond within 20 days of the date of this notice will result in our chosen specialist debt purchasing partner Lowell Portfolio 1 Ltd directly contacting you to arrange repayment of the outstanding balance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09042277000078">This menacing letter totally bewildered my constituent, who had never had knowledge of 3, or dealings with it. As his Member of Parliament, I wrote to the company on 26 March. I asked what all that was about and said that my constituent was bewildered and anxious, but I have not received a reply&#151;except for the fact that, by another amazing coincidence, there was a phone call to my office just two hours before I commenced this Adjournment debate, asking for more information. That gives an idea of the sort of cavaliers and cowboys that we are dealing with, among both the companies themselves and their agents. Such behaviour has got to stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09042277000079">Secondly, in February I happened to listen to the very fine BBC programme. &#147;You and Yours&#148;, on which I think that the Minister subsequently appeared. The whole programme was devoted to the menacing attempts by debt collection and communications companies, as well as banking and financial institutions and others, to  <br>

extract money from people. Some of the people involved are wholly innocent and do not have any debt, while others either dispute the debt or are willing to come to an arrangement about its repayment. The programme found that the companies had responded with bureaucratic inertia or an inability to communicate, or with the malevolent and menacing actions that I have described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09042277000080">Last Sunday week, <i> The Sunday Times</i> carried a very forensic and skilful article by its &#147;Insight&#148; team, in which they described the conduct of the Lloyds banking group&#146;s debt collection department. Workers in the so-called &#147;recovery&#148; department were secretly tape recorded, and the tapes revealed that it was suggested that they should put &#147;the frighteners&#148; on and &#147;f...&#148; customers who owed the bank money. Bank staff were incentivised by bonuses and, contrary to the code of practice of the Office of Fair Trading, claimed to represent firms of solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09042277000081">The bank&#146;s staff are poorly paid, and have every incentive to maximise the extraction of money from the people whom they telephone. Inevitably, that leads to breaking the OFT code and often to a menacing attitude. One lady, a nurse, told <i> The Sunday Times</i> that she had been called six times a day at work, something that again breaches the OFT guidelines. Moreover, it was reported that the people who train new staff and induct them into the recovery unit persuaded them to remind home owners about repossession, and to tell them that they could be credit blacklisted.</p>

<p><a name="st_o184"><a name="09042277000082"><a name="90422-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="09042277000161"><b>Mr. John Leech (Manchester, Withington) (LD):</b>

 No. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but there is not enough time. Perhaps he will be able to intervene in a minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09042277000084">Although recovery department staff were Lloyds&#146;s employees, they tried to imply that they were part of a firm of solicitors by the name of Sechiari Clark and Mitchell. That, of course, was quite false. I hope that the Minister will confirm that he has read the article in <i> The Sunday Times</i><i> , </i>as I have been able to give only a summary of it in the few minutes available this evening. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90422-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09042277000085">The programme &#147;You and Yours&#148; showed the extent, scale and gravity of the callous and dilatory nature of debt collection in this country. I know that the Minister listened to the programme, and I hope that he has been able to consider the follow-up programmes. For instance, one lady described how the Bank of Scotland had constantly bombarded her and her terminally ill husband with insensitive automated phone calls. Another person, Marian Parks, described how the same bank&#146;s actions had impacted on her father, John Leather, and set out all the problems that arose as a result. To their credit, her family was so incensed that they entered into litigation before Mr. Recorder Grice at the Truro county court, where the matter was determined on 23, 24 and 25 February. It is interesting that Mr. Recorder Grice described the so-called Triad system, which involves constant automated telephone calls to alleged debtors, as</p>

He had purchased, some time ago, phones for his daughters, but they did not work in his area. He cancelled his direct debit. It would appear that that alleged debt was sold to a company called HFO Services, which persisted, menacingly, in trying to get him to cough up some money, to the extent that his daughter was fearful that its representatives would seize property in the home. I heard on the radio&#151;I think that the Minister will have done so, too&#151;a recording of a telephone conversation in which a representative from HFO Services, speaking from a call centre in Asia, said:</p>

They are self-explanatory and common sense, but they are wholly inadequate. They need to be beefed-up. They were last reviewed in 2003. They do not take into account the automated dialling menacing system, through which the menacing goes on and on. Both the guidelines and the judgment of the recorder to whom I referred need the attention of the House. The brave people who took the matter to court suffered constant harassment by means of automated telephone calls and so on, but found that that did not constitute harassment in law.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. When I tried to intervene, he was speaking about solicitors&#146; letters.

 Absolutely. The industry is rotten to the core, whether it is in-house recovery and collection, or where agents are used, or where the debt has been sold. I want the Minister to introduce legislation to prevent the sale of debt. Although that practice has gone on since biblical times, it seems wholly wrong that alleged debt can be sold when there is a dispute as to whether there is a debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09042277000102">Anybody who is being pressed for a debt should have a statutory right to speak to somebody in authority in the company or organisation which believes that it is owed money. There should be no automated dialling, and people should have a named person to contact. Every effort should be made to achieve reconciliation where there are disputes, and to minimise the trauma for people who have a debt, but cannot pay. Unless the House and the Minister arrest the practice and kick the backside of the Office of Fair Trading, the problem will grow, and more and more Members will be distressed on behalf of their constituents.</p>

may remember that Mrs. Brazier took her life after being hounded for the debt of a man with whom she was not connected. Since the events leading up to the death of Beryl Brazier were first raised in the House by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), I have pursued the need for action to ensure that we tighten the system of regulation in such cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09042277000105">The Beryl Brazier case indicated that appalling errors were made in transferring the background facts of the case between the businesses concerned with pursuing the debt. Such failures in transferring data between lenders, debt collectors, tracing agents and debt purchasers are not only a breach of the law, but are unforgivable, especially when they result in such tragic consequences. New powers introduced as a result of the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and implemented in April 2008 have helped the Office of Fair Trading to begin to tackle poor practices within the industry still further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09042277000106">The OFT established in April 2008&#151;just 12 months ago&#151;a dedicated unit to monitor debt collection agencies, which it rightly identified as a sector of the business world needing particular monitoring. I shall come to how those powers have been used by the OFT, but first I should say that the OFT has long given clear guidance that debt collection agencies should make reasonable efforts to obtain from a creditor or other agency sufficient information about the debt. For example, the OFT would expect the debt collection agency concerned to have checked the accuracy of the client data details that it received from the creditor or agency, and, where possible, to have obtained a copy of the original consumer credit agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09042277000107">Equally, creditors are responsible for ensuring that debt history data are clear, accurate and capable of use by debt collectors, and, of course, for being clear to consumers who may dispute the debt. Debt collectors who hold a consumer credit licence also need to comply with specific fitness guidance that the OFT has issued, covering the debt collecting sector. The guidance was reviewed just three years ago. The new powers implemented under the 2006 Act in April last year have helped the OFT by allowing it to place requirements on licensees to modify conduct. Those powers have also allowed the OFT to impose financial penalties of up to &#163;50,000 a time for failure to comply with a single requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09042277000108">Since April last year, the OFT has also had new information-gathering powers, enabling it better to monitor compliance by seeking information from licensed businesses about their activities, including their debt collection practices. In addition, the OFT now has powers to take into account a company&#146;s competence lawfully to carry on credit activities when assessing its fitness to be given or to retain a licence. The OFT must also, when determining whether a licensee is fit to hold a licence, consider any evidence of the licensee being engaged in business practices that appear to be deceitful, oppressive or otherwise unfair or improper.</p>

 I am very pleased with what the Minister is telling us, but my anxiety is that, if the OFT starts using those sanctions, as I want it to, some companies will simply dissolve themselves and the same bad directors will constitute new companies and go back to their old customers. Will there be some protection to ensure that such abuse&#151;such getting around the situation&#151;does not prevail?</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="09042277000110"><a name="90422-0020.htm_spnew3"><a name="09042277000167"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b>
 Let me turn to the scale of the action that the OFT has already taken, because I suspect that my hon. Friend is not aware of just how much activity has taken place. I should add that the OFT&#146;s debt collection guidance covers such practices. In particular, it says that putting undue pressure on debtors is considered to be oppressive, while ignoring claims that a debt is disputed would constitute unfair practice by the debt collector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09042277000111">Debts are often disputed by those being pursued for them, and, in such cases, the industry&#146;s immediate response should be to suspend debt collection, and the case should be thoroughly looked into. Indeed, if that had only happened in the case of Mrs. Brazier, she might still be with her family today. Let me again be clear to the House and to such companies: if a licensed debt collection agency or a creditor persistently fails to comply with the OFT&#146;s debt collection guidance, or if there is evidence to substantiate claims that the licence holder has engaged in unfair business practices, the OFT can ultimately revoke its licence, effectively putting the trader out of business. Any persistent failure by a creditor to provide accurate information could also reflect on that business&#146;s fitness to continue to hold a licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09042277000112">As I have mentioned, since April 2008, the OFT has had a strengthened role, requiring the provision of more information from businesses engaged in high-risk credit activities, such as debt collection, when they apply for a licence or to renew an existing licence. That is to ensure that business will be carried out to a reasonable standard. In some cases, the OFT will commission on-site visits and reports from trading standards officers to help in its judgment about whether at the heart of a business&#146;s processes and procedures&#151;what it actually does&#151;there are genuinely good standards: for example, whether adequate staff training procedures are in place to ensure that a firm&#146;s legal responsibilities are properly understood at every level of the organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09042277000113">I should tell the House the scale of the action that the OFT has already taken. It has already initiated a total of 186 so-called warning and advisory letters, which have been sent to businesses in the sector. In addition, a further 22 formal actions have been taken, resulting in, for example, seven licences being surrendered, four licences being refused or removed, four businesses being given significant undertakings and four cases in which requirements have been imposed. I recognise the statistic cited by my hon. Friend about OFT action, but I hope that he will recognise that far broader enforcement activity has taken place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09042277000114">Let me give specific examples of recent informal and formal action. In April 2008, in response to an increase in complaints about debt collection practices, the OFT wrote to 13 companies&#151;including debt collection and trace agencies, debt purchase businesses and financial institutions&#151;warning them to take steps to improve their debt collection practices. Among the more serious practices identified from the complaints were the chasing of consumers for payment of debts that they did not owe, partly because of over-reliance on the poor data provided by creditors and poor or inappropriate tracing activities; failing to properly investigate disputed debts; and employing an over-aggressive or oppressive approach to recovering debts, including, on occasion, refusing to deal with or bypassing third-party representatives such as citizens advice bureaux.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09042277000115">The 13 companies were required to review their policies and procedures for tracing debtors; that included keeping client information up to date and maintaining its accuracy. The OFT was satisfied with the responses of four of the companies and the steps that they had taken to ensure compliance, but it will continue to monitor complaint levels. It is still in the process of assessing or seeking information from the remaining nine companies. That could include carrying out on-site competence visits or seeking further information using its powers under the Consumer Credit Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09042277000116">At least one major debt collection company has updated its automated systems to reduce the likelihood of collection activity continuing when the consumer has disputed the debt. The OFT will be writing to creditor trade bodies reminding them of their responsibility to ensure that data used for debt collection are accurate and asking them to take action to improve the data that they pass on to debt collectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09042277000117">My next example involves the requirements imposed on 1st Credit Ltd. After an investigation, it was found that some of its business processes and procedures failed to meet satisfactory standards. As a result, that company and its associated companies must refrain from issuing statutory demands warning of bankruptcy when it is unlikely that proceedings will be initiated; not discuss legal action with consumers, unless it is likely that such action will genuinely be taken; ensure that sensitive cases involving vulnerable individuals&#151;for example, those with mental health problems&#151;are dealt with appropriately; and ensure that all matters of concern raised with them by the free advice sector and other third parties are dealt with appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09042277000118">A considerable amount of activity to raise standards in the industry has been initiated. However, I recognise my hon. Friend&#146;s central point: more action is needed. I have been working with the Credit Services Association, the main trade association in the sector, to get it to remind its members of their obligations to have the highest standards. The association has responded in a positive way. In particular, it has agreed to my request that it should offer debtors who contact a debt advice agency for help in sorting their finances a 30-day breathing space to get their affairs in order. That follows our success in getting the credit card sector to agree a breathing space for its customers who approach a debt advice agency for first-time help. I am also calling in representatives of the utility sector for similar discussions about how they can best help customers having problems with their debts. My hon. Friend will have seen the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, confirmed again today by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that a White Paper on consumer matters is being prepared, and that will touch on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90422-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09042277000119">This sector and industry are under the spotlight. Ministers, the OFT, Members of this House, the media and our constituents are all watching closely the activity of businesses in the sector. Considerable work has already been done to challenge poor standards and there has been progress, but I recognise that there is more work to do.</p>
