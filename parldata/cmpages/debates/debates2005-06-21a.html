</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50621-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 With the European Union presidency, I visited Iraq on 9&nbsp;June and discussed security and constitutional matters, as well as other topics, with President Talabani, Prime Minister Jaafari and other leaders. Security and stability are plainly key to progress in Iraq. Iraqi forces are increasingly taking a lead in this effort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">I stressed to all whom I saw the need for an inclusive constitutional drafting process that included fair representation from the Sunni community and kept to the timeline. I therefore welcome the agreement reached on 17&nbsp;June to add 15&nbsp;Sunni members to the constitutional committee and to appoint 10&nbsp;Sunni advisory experts. Tomorrow, I shall attend an international conference on Iraq that is being held in Brussels.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50621-01_spnew0"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for that detailed reply. The whole House is concerned about the reported continuing high levels of violence in Iraq. What reassurance can he give me that the situation is navigable? Is real progress being made and what role are British troops playing in that progress?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 638</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50621-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 Violence is at an unacceptable level and is higher than was anticipated. Tragically, most of the casualties of the violence today are other Iraqis, who have become the principal targets of the violence. That said, I was impressed when I visited Baghdad two weeks ago by the progress that had been made on the readiness and numbers of the Iraqi security forces. The Iraqis have a clear choice about whether they bring together the components of a properly functioning democratic and secure state. I believe that they are doing that, although there will be many difficulties on the way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50621-01_spnew2"><b> Ms Barlow: </b> 
 When my right hon. Friend met representatives of the committee that is drawing up the new constitution, did he believe that it was a fair and accurate representation of the demographics of the country? Does he believe that it is on course to complete the constitution before 15&nbsp;August?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50621-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The original composition of the body to draw up the constitution plainly did not represent accurately all the three communities in Iraq, above all because most of the Sunni community decided not to take part in the elections. However, following the decision reached just four days ago to add 15&nbsp;Sunni members to the constitutional committee, it is now as broadly representative of the Sunni as it is of the Kurds and the Shi&#039;a. There are three deadlines: 15&nbsp;August, 15&nbsp;October and 15&nbsp;December. I am fairly convinced that those timelines will be met, although it will be a close-run thing in each case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50621-01_spnew4"><b> Patrick Mercer  (Newark)</b> 
 (Con): The whole House will be aware that the level of violence in Iraq has climbed hideously over the past few weeks and months. At the same time, the Ministry of Defence is preparing plans to withdraw large numbers of troops from Iraq, which seems to sit uneasily with the comment made by the Minister for Europe during the debate on the Queen&#039;s Speech that we would leave only when the job was done. Will the Foreign Secretary define how he sees the situation arising when the job will indeed be done?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50621-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 What my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe said sits very well with what the hon. Gentleman and the House also took from his remarks. Under Security Council resolution 1546, a review is taking place of the mandate, which will expire on 31&nbsp;December unless it is renewed. Meanwhile, Iraqi security forces are significantly improving their capability and increasing in number&#151;that just happens to be true&#151;and they are involved in serious security operations to a far greater extent than they were this time last year. They have suffered many more casualties than the coalition, proportionately, but none the less I was assured by our British senior commanders when I was in Baghdad that the morale and capability of many of the Iraqi forces, although not all, was high. There are already 168,000&nbsp;people involved in the Iraqi security forces, so as that number rises, it is rational and sensible for the numbers involved in the coalition to reduce provided, first, that we are sure that it is safe for those numbers to reduce and, secondly, that that is the wish of the Iraqi people and Government.

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50621-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate)</b> 
 (Con): What is the Foreign Secretary&#039;s assessment of whether the constitutional arrangements are likely to be acceptable to the Kurdish minority come 15&nbsp;December, and what is his assessment of the effect on the security situation if they are not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50621-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman may know, within the transitional administrative law there is a complicated lock mechanism that provides that the results of a referendum are not valid if, I think, two thirds of the voters in three of the provinces have voted against the referendum proposition. That provision was designed as a safeguard for the Kurds. As it has turned out, it is a safeguard also for the Sunni community. All sections of the community&#151;the majority Shi&#039;a, the Kurds and the Sunni&#151;understand that if they are to maintain their aim of keeping Iraq together, albeit within some sort of federal structure, the constitutional arrangements have to be acceptable to all three communities. Although it will be difficult getting there, I believe that that will be achieved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50621-01_spnew8"><b> Ann Clwyd  (Cynon Valley)</b> 
 (Lab): Yesterday, I met representatives of the Iraqi Islamic party and also Sunni Muslims who have returned from this country to Iraq, who are anxious to play a part in the political process. One matter that they raised concerns us all, and that is the lack of a Human Rights Minister in the Cabinet of the new Government of Iraq. Five months have passed and still a Human Rights Minister has not been appointed. I believe that such an appointment is essential. I ask my right hon. Friend to lend his voice to this plea.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50621-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right on that point. I raised the matter with Prime Minister Jaafari when I saw him and he explained that it was a nomination due to come from one particular section of the community and that he was waiting for it. I will continue to make representations on the matter on behalf of the House, including my right hon. Friend.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50621-01_spnew10"><b> Richard Younger-Ross  (Teignbridge)</b> 
 (LD): The Foreign Secretary stated in his opening answer that security was obviously important to the future of Iraq. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that prosperity is also important if we are to go forward? What contacts and what interchange has he had with European colleagues on the release of European funds for essential works such as water supply and electricity?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50621-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I have had many discussions with my European colleagues, and ensuring a satisfactory flow of funds will be one of the issues before the EU-US international conference on Iraq, which I shall be attending tomorrow. The thing that is holding Iraq back is not an inadequacy of external funds or of investment projects, or the inadequacy of the innate abilities of the population, but terrorism. That is why improving security is fundamental to the achievement of the other goals that we and, above all, the Iraqi people have&#151;prosperity and good governance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50621-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Is it not important that those, particularly outside this place, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 640</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who refer to the high number of casualties should bear in mind that casualties are being caused in large numbers, as already pointed out, by the terrorist suicide bombers, the enemies of Iraq? Does my right hon.&nbsp;Friend agree that the impression should not be given that somehow British or American continued intervention in Iraq is open-ended&#151;I have listened to what he has said&#151;and that there is a strong case for looking at the situation whereby British and American troops leave the country, obviously in the best circumstances?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50621-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 On my hon. Friend&#039;s first point, it is true that there would be no casualties if there were no terrorism. There are virtually no casualties and no incidents in 10&nbsp;of the 18&nbsp;provinces of Iraq because the situation there is broadly under control. There is a high level of consent for the presence of the security forces, whether they are coalition or indigenous. On the second part of my hon. Friend&#039;s question, I confirm that the coalition&#039;s commitment is not open-ended. That is not desired by this Parliament or by the US Congress, for example, nor, above all, is it desired by the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people want to reach the position where they can run their own affairs as quickly as possible. The only issue is ensuring that they can do that in a safe and sensible way.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50621-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Trade  (Ian Pearson): </b> 
 The Government are committed to promoting peace and security in Africa. We work closely with our international partners to tackle conflict and its causes. At the heart of our approach is a commitment to help Africans strengthen their own ability to prevent war and keep the peace. We hope that this will be part of the broader package of support for Africa to be discussed at the forthcoming Gleneagles summit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50621-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jack: </b> 
 Anybody who saw the reports on ITN by Neil Connery of the brutal use of conflict by Robert Mugabe to make 500,000&nbsp;of his own people homeless will understand just what conflict in Africa means. The Minister mentioned the G8&nbsp;at Gleneagles. So far, efforts by the British Government, European Governments and world Governments have failed stop Mugabe&#039;s brutality. May I seek an absolute assurance that the G8&nbsp;will use all its power and influence to stop the brutal, inhuman conflict in that African country once and for all?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50621-02_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I would hope that the whole House shares the Government&#039;s disgust at the despicable Mugabe regime and what it is doing to its people. We have protested directly to the Zimbabwean Government, and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the issue at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13&nbsp;June. As a Government, we are committed to doing all that we can to assess the situation. The hon. Gentleman may be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 641</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>aware that the United Nations Secretary-General announced only yesterday the appointment of a special envoy for human settlement issues in Zimbabwe to study the scope of the recent evictions of illegal dwellers, informal traders and squatters and to assess its humanitarian impact on the affected population. We understand that Mugabe has agreed to that visit, and that it will take place at an early opportunity.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="50621-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend will be aware that about half of the African countries that emerge from civil war fall back into conflict in a short period, because there is no stabilisation force or any mediation forces. He talked about the likelihood of support coming from Gleneagles, but can he say a little more about that? Will it consist of aid to assemble an African Union force along with mediators from the United Nations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50621-02_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. The Commission for Africa report showed graphically that countries that become democratic can slip back into conflict. However, more than two thirds of countries in sub-Saharan Africa have held democratic elections in the past five years, so progress is being made. The way in which the African Union deploys its peacekeeping force is a matter for it to decide, but the Government hope to agree a comprehensive support package at Gleneagles.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50621-02_spnew4"><b> Dr. Liam Fox  (Woodspring)</b> 
 (Con): It is widely reported that China or Chinese companies have provided Robert Mugabe&#039;s regime with radio-jamming equipment, which was used to block independent radio stations during the election. They have begun to deliver 12&nbsp;fighter aircraft and 100&nbsp;trucks to Zimbabwe&#039;s army at a time when there is a western arms embargo. Can the Minister confirm those facts, and what representations have the Government made?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50621-02_spnew5"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I am not in a position to confirm the hon. Gentleman&#039;s claims, but we will certainly investigate any such allegations. Clearly, we do not want the Zimbabwean regime to be supplied with arms from any source, and we would want to take steps and use the influence that we have to make sure that Zimbabwe does not receive weapons to use in the internal repression of its people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50621-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Chris Mullin  (Sunderland, South)</b> 
 (Lab): As my hon. Friend knows, one of the conflicts in Africa that we played a part in trying to resolve is that in northern Uganda, involving the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army. Can he bring the House up to date on what progress has been made in bringing that conflict to an end?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50621-02_spnew7"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I am sure my hon. Friend could bring the&nbsp;House up to date. I will draw his comments to the attention of my noble Friend Lord Triesman, who is the Minister with responsibility for Africa, and who I am sure will want to write to my hon. Friend on the issue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50621-02_spnew8"><b> Dr. Fox: </b> 
 First, I am astonished that with the stories about Chinese supplies to the Mugabe regime so widespread, the Foreign Office does not seem to have a line on that or to have investigated. Does not that show 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 642</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the wider problem with many African states? In Zimbabwe, a brutal and callous dictator wrecks his economy, destroys his agriculture, deliberately makes his own people homeless, and yet is still getting help from outside. Is it not tragic that irrespective of how much debt relief and aid we make available, it will not help many of the people of Africa if we cannot overcome bad governance, especially if those regimes are helped from outside?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50621-02_spnew9"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that good governance is a core part of the Government&#039;s programme, and it is exactly what we want to see achieved in Zimbabwe and other countries in Africa. He raises the issue of humanitarian assistance. It is important that we do what we can to assist those who were affected by the crackdown that has taken place in Zimbabwe. Funds so far have reached over 8,000&nbsp;families in the form of food, blankets and other essentials, and that is worthwhile. We will continue to express our disgust at the antics of the Mugabe regime directly to that regime. Our posts across Africa are also raising our concerns about Zimbabwe with host Governments who may have some influence on the regime.

I will write to my hon. Friend about that particular group, but will he look at small local charitable groups that desperately want to help in rebuilding war-torn African countries, and offer those groups advice and help so that they, too, can take part in rebuilding?
</p>

 I am very keen that we do all we can to help Sierra Leone, and great progress has been made. My hon. Friend mentions a number of difficulties. I am happy to meet the charity concerned and to raise the matter with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development.

 (LD): While accepting that the circumstances of no two countries are ever exactly the same, does the Minister see some parallels between what is happening in Sudan and what is happening in Zimbabwe&#151;oppressive Governments abusing the human rights of their citizens, rendering thousands homeless and exposing millions to the possibility of starvation? At Gleneagles we shall talk of lifting people out of poverty. Should we not be considering how we can protect the people of Africa, particularly in Sudan and Zimbabwe, or must we stand by, impotent and frustrated, while their very lives and dignity are taken from them by their own Governments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="50621-02_spnew13"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 There are parallels, of course, and the right hon. and learned Gentleman is right to point to the need for protection. Security and protection is a core part of what we want to see achieved. We hope that at Gleneagles we can draw up a comprehensive package that will see more support provided to the African Union. Where the African Union has deployed its forces in Sudan, it has been successful in bringing about a far more peaceful situation. We need to see more of that.

 My French and German colleagues, together with the European Union&#039;s high representative, and I met an Iranian team in Geneva on 25&nbsp;May, when discussion took place under the framework of the November 2004&nbsp;Paris agreement. The European side undertook to present proposals to Iran by the end of July or the beginning of August. Officials are currently working on those proposals, which will include objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes. They will also include economic and technological co-operation, assurances of fuel supply and a political and security framework.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="50621-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Illsley: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his reply. He knows that it is essential that he and his European Union counterparts continue the dialogue with Iran. At the G8&nbsp;summit, will he take the opportunity to raise the issue of the deal struck between Russia and Iran in February this year on the supply of nuclear fuel rods? Russia has insisted that those rods are returned to Iran to safeguard against enriched uranium being used for anything other than peaceful purposes. Will he seek an opportunity to discuss that matter either directly with Russia or within the general framework of the G8?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50621-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I shall see my colleague Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, tomorrow, and I hope to have a bilateral discussion with him, as well as seeing him at the G8&nbsp;Foreign Ministers meeting. Russia is under contract to provide the design of a nuclear power plant at Bushehr in Iran and also to supply it with fuel, which is consistent with Russia and Iran&#039;s obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. Enrichment, reprocessing and conversion facilities within Iran are our concern, and the international community remains perplexed about the scale of the fuel cycle programme in Iran, given that the Iranians have only one nuclear power station coming on stream, and all the fuel for it is due to come from Russia.

Does he feel that there is sufficient confidence between us to negotiate sensibly and rationally about Iran&#039;s nuclear programme? Iran is a very important country in that part of the world; our ongoing negotiations are critical; and I believe that we carry a great deal of influence.

 I visited Israel and the occupied territories two weeks ago on 7&nbsp;and 8&nbsp;June.

 I appreciate my right hon. Friend&#039;s reply and, indeed, his visit to Israel and Palestine. However, my concern is over the E1&nbsp;plan, which involves the building of about 3,500&nbsp;new properties to the east of the old city of Jerusalem. That will effectively divide the west bank into north and south, but worse than that, it will make the final status talks about Jerusalem almost impossible. Did my right hon.

 My hon. Friend is entirely right to be deeply concerned, because if that building goes on it will indeed divide the north and south of the west bank. I raised the matter with President Mahmoud Abbas and, perhaps more importantly in this context, with the Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, and made clear our opposition to the continual building of these settlements as well as to the siting of the security barrier other than on Israeli territory.

 In his initial response to the question, the Foreign Secretary indicated that this is indeed a unique opportunity to move forwards in the middle east and to move towards a two-state solution that protects the interests of the Israeli Government while securing justice for the Palestinians, but in his response to the supplementary he dealt with one of the issues that threatens that progress. I hope that he can assure us that he will press the Israeli Government to cease the construction of their separation barrier and to cease the mass arrests, because both those things threaten the continuation of the process and also give succour to the militants, who could so easily undermine the success of that process. Will he press the Israeli Government to desist on both fronts?

 As I have explained, we have already made, and will continue to make, strong representations to the Government of Israel about the building of settlements other than on Israeli land and the siting of the route of the separation barrier, again other than on Israeli land.

<a name="50621-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_o1">On arrests, I simply say to my hon. Friend that in recent weeks some hundreds of prisoners have been released by the Israeli Government as part of the steps that they have taken, in co-operation with the Palestinian Authority, to rebuild better confidence between the two sides and, not least, to improve collaboration when Israel starts to withdraw from Gaza on 16&nbsp;August.

<a name="50621-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_o2">I also say to my hon.

<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="50621-03_spnew4"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 Following the Foreign Secretary&#039;s last reply, does he agree that it is entirely welcome that Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been able to reach agreement on working together to make the withdrawal from Gaza successful? Does he further agree that it is likely that extremists will attempt to disrupt this so as to make the continuation of the peace process difficult and that moderates on both sides need our strong support to help them to carry it through?

<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="50621-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 First, there is co-operation. It goes in fits and starts on each side because there is a long history of suspicion by Palestinians of Israelis and by Israelis of Palestinians. However, yesterday&#039;s announcement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that both sides had agreed on the importance of demolishing the settlers&#039; homes in Gaza because they are not suitable is an indication of the amount of co-operation.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o74"><a name="50621-04_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 Yesterday, the Prime Minister set out to the House the UK position during the European Council discussion on future financing last week. The UK has long argued that the negotiation to set the EU budget from 2007&#150;13&nbsp;is an opportunity to reform EU expenditure to provide an appropriate future financial framework. The proposal on the table last week manifestly failed to do that. The failure last week to reach agreement provides an opportunity to look again at the structure of EU spending in the light of the contemporary challenges facing the Union.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="50621-04_spnew10"><b> Stephen Hammond: </b> 
 Reading through the Prime Minister&#039;s statement yesterday, the House will have noticed that, in the decade to 2003, the UK paid a net contribution of &#8364;23.6&nbsp;billion more than France, and without our rebate it would have been &#8364;30&nbsp;billion more than that. In the House last week, the Prime Minister said that he was prepared to negotiate the rebate but not to negotiate it away. Can the Minister give some clarity about how much that rebate would have fallen by in the past decade had we been negotiating it away?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="50621-04_spnew11"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I assure the House that those discussions took place in the context of the statements that we made prior to the Council, when we said first, that we believe the rebate to be fully justified, and secondly, that we were willing to use the veto if necessary and as appropriate to defend Britain&#039;s national interest. As it transpired, it was not necessary to exercise the veto as we were joined by a number of other countries in rejecting the proposal that was tabled by the EU presidency. However, we were clear in the negotiations on Thursday and Friday in Brussels about the need for there to be a clear and categorical link between the British rebate and the fundamental reform of expenditure across the European Union, which would, of course, include the issue of the common agricultural policy, which largely accounts for the very significant receipts received by France, to which the hon.

If we can succeed in replacing the common agricultural policy, that will be beneficial not only to Europe but, more important, to poorer countries, particularly those that export agricultural products. Would they not also benefit if we replaced the European aid regime and repatriated aid? For a long time, the Department for International Development has felt that if aid were distributed through its own budget, it would be more efficient and well directed than it is through the EU budget.

<br>&nbsp;<br>there were any positions for Parliamentary Private Secretaries in the Foreign Affairs team, but in light of his specific question I fear that I will have to disappoint him. The Council of International Development Ministers that took place just a couple of weeks ago in Brussels makes a powerful case for how the European Union can act as a catalyst and as a force for good in the world. We saw an increase in commitments from the EU from $40&nbsp;billion to $80&nbsp;billion by 2010. That shows the scale of commitment not just of the British Government&#151;we have an honourable record in increasing the money spent on international aid&#151;but of member states throughout the European Union. It also sets a very challenging and a rich opportunity that the G8&nbsp;can develop at the meeting in Gleneagles on 6&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;July, and it shows powerfully that if we work together at EU level we can increase our influence and do good in the world.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o80"><a name="50621-04_spnew15"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The question rather anticipates further conversations that are needed at an EU level. In Brussels on Thursday and Friday, we were looking for a clear commitment to reform, not least given the fact that 40&nbsp;per cent. of the EU budget&#151;as many in the House are now aware&#151;is spent on agriculture, which accounts for only 5&nbsp;per cent. of the EU&#039;s population and about 2&nbsp;per cent. of its output. We believe that there is a case for fundamental reform, but in the first instance we need to take forward discussions with our EU partners on how to achieve that, rather than offering particular solutions at this stage to particular member states&#039; problems.

<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="50621-04_spnew17"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I am certainly aware that on this issue, as on so many others, neither the people of France nor people across the EU have a unified view or speak with a single voice.

I am also aware of the comments of the Parti Socialiste in France, following the European Council meeting.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50621-05_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement dealing with the Government&#039;s intention to implement section 43&nbsp;of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This statement is also being made in the other place by the Attorney-General.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In order to ensure that people accused of serious frauds do not escape justice, we propose to implement this provision for trial without jury in serious and complex fraud cases. It would be subject to judicial safeguards. The Government have decided that in the autumn they will seek affirmative resolutions from both Houses of Parliament in order to implement section 43. Section 43&nbsp;will enable serious and complex fraud trials to be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury. The provision can operate only where the judge is satisfied that the length or complexity of the trial is likely to make it so burdensome on the jury that the interests of justice require it&#151;subject to the Lord Chief Justice&#039;s approval in each case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Government gave a commitment to consult further on these issues when the 2003&nbsp;Act was passed. That commitment was made good at a seminar held in January of this year, at which Opposition spokesmen, the judiciary, prosecuting authorities and the legal profession were among those represented. I am placing a record of the seminar proceedings in the Library of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">A protocol for dealing with lengthy trials, which was issued by the Lord Chief Justice on 22&nbsp;March 2005, emphasises the need for robust and well informed case management to enable the court to focus on the real issues, and it is hoped that that approach will contribute towards reducing the length of trials. The Government consider, however, that better case management will not of itself be sufficient to confine the duration of the most complex serious fraud trials within reasonable bounds, or prevent such trials from imposing an intolerable burden on the jury. Complex and serious fraud cases can last six months or in some cases a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">This provision is not part of a general assault on jury trial. The Government are in favour of trial by jury in the vast majority of cases where it will remain appropriate. To put it into perspective, there are around 40,000&nbsp;jury trials in England and Wales annually, and this provision will affect perhaps 10&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;of them. The Government therefore propose in the autumn to take the action necessary to obtain parliamentary approval for the implementation of section 43, with a view to bringing it into force in January 2006.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50621-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 I am very sorry to hear the Solicitor-General&#039;s statement, which is flagrantly in breach of the assurances that the Government gave to the House as to how they would proceed on this matter. I note that a policy that I would usually expect to be run by the Home Office has been transferred to the Law Officers for implementation.

<a name="stpa_8">We are now told that consultation has taken place and that the Government are set on implementing section 43&nbsp;as it stands. However, there has been no proper consultation. The Solicitor-General mentioned that a seminar was held in late January. I could not attend it, but at no time was it suggested that that seminar was a formal consultation. My noble Friend Lord Kingsland was able to attend, but he was given no impression at the time of his attendance that the seminar was a formal consultation. If indeed it was a formal consultation, it departed from all established Government practice in the way that it was carried out.

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">I saw the minutes from that seminar for the first time this morning. If the Government thought that the seminar had discharged their undertaking in full, why were all interested parties not provided with copies of the minutes, or invited to submit further comments? Furthermore, the Home Secretary gave the assurance that the matter would be dealt with, if at all, by primary legislation, as that offered this House the opportunity to improve and amend any proposals put forward. Why has that been abandoned?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The Fraud Bill introduced in the other place would provide a perfect vehicle for this matter. Why has it not been used? The proposed changes to the fraud law, and the changes in respect of multiple offences introduced since the Criminal Justice Act 2003&nbsp;came into being, have a direct bearing on the ability to shorten fraud trials. What is the basis for ignoring those changes and for trying to prevent the detailed debate that they require?

<a name="50621-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The SFO&#039;s record of conviction was extremely high until last year, with an overall average of just under 80&nbsp;per cent. Will the Solicitor-General confirm that many recent acquittals have had nothing to do with juries but have been on the direction of judges? Earlier this year, the Government expressed concern at the collapse of the Jubilee line fraud trial. An inquiry was ordered to ascertain the causes of that collapse. I understand that that inquiry is still continuing. Indeed, it is suggested that the basic cause of the collapse was prosecution mismanagement of the trial process. Why have the Government elected to proceed when we do not have the benefit of that inquiry report into the trial&#039;s collapse?

As the Government&#039;s approach is currently without any justification whatever and in breach of their undertakings to the House, I can tell the Solicitor-General that we will oppose these measures both here and in another place.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50621-06_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 I note that, during the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions, he spent a lot of time talking about the process and did not really address the substance of what we propose to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">On the process, it is complete nonsense to suggest that there is a breach of any undertaking. It is the case that my right hon. Friend the then Home Secretary made a commitment, and if the hon. Gentleman looks at the wording of that commitment, he will see that he said that we would look at these issues. It is the case that a letter sent to the hon. Gentleman and others about the seminar held on 24&nbsp;January 2005&nbsp;clearly stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;The seminar pursues that undertaking&quot;&#151;</p>

<a name="50621-06_para1">

<a name="stpa_15">It is the case that the shadow Lord Chancellor, the noble Lord Kingsland, the noble Lord Thomas of Gresford on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, and representatives of the Bar, the Law Society, Justice, the Serious Fraud Office and Customs, as well as Lord Justice Thomas, Lord Justice Judge and Mr. Justice Field all attended the seminar. The hon. Gentleman indicated that he was unable to attend. He accepted initially, but tendered his apologises later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">It is also the case that that seminar included a full and robust discussion of the issues and that everyone at that seminar accepted that there were issues with serious fraud trials and that a way had to be found to resolve them. Those issues are, indeed, quite serious. They apply to a very small number of cases&#151;10&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;a year, out of 40,000&#151;so it is simply hyperbole for anyone to suggest that this proposal is somehow an attack on juries. It is the outcome of two decades of debate since Roskill suggested in 1986&nbsp;that we should move to such a position.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_17">The key problems are very clear. Serious and complex trials can last six months or a year. They are an intrusion into the private and working lives of jurors. They can cause great hardship and economic loss&#151;many jurors seek, and are granted, excusal&#151;and they lead to concerns about the representative nature of juries in some cases. Juries are faced with the quite extraordinary physical and mental tasks of listening to often complex and obtuse evidence. Some fraud trials involve the explanation of interlinking transactions, involving complex financial instruments and often occurring over a number of years, and detailed cross-examination, requiring constant cross-references to documents and records. That is tough on any juror.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_18">Judges can read much of the background material and agreed evidence much more quickly, so some of those trials can be properly shortened without compromising justice&#151;indeed, possibly leading to a higher level of justice because the complexity of some of those cases can be considered. Prosecutors sometimes have to split trials into two or more separate trials to make them manageable and comprehensible to juries. Thus the full criminality of such fraud is not always exposed. There is also the risk that, to reduce complexity, prosecutors are sometimes tempted to reduce the number of charges to make it easier for jury trials to take place. That itself is unsatisfactory because it does not enable the full complexity of the criminality to be exposed. Judges can deal with such cases more quickly. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s objections are not accepted by the Government. He said that the House has not had the opportunity to debate the issues, but resolutions will be put before both Houses and there will be full opportunity for debate at that stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_19">The hon. Gentleman asked me to confirm that acquittals were often at the direction of the judge. Yes, that certainly is the case. However, I disagree with his figure for the past five years; the Serious Fraud Office&#039;s conviction record was about 70&nbsp;per cent. Stephen Wooler is indeed looking into the background of the Jubilee line trial and will no doubt make his report in due course, but the House needs to know when the Government have made a clear decision. The Government have made a decision, and I remind the House that this is a power for the courts, not a requirement. As I made clear throughout my statement, the Government want jury trials to continue in the vast majority of cases. The provision will apply only to a very small number of serious and complex fraud trials.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50621-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robert Marshall-Andrews  (Medway) (Lab):</b> 
 The Minister implies by his opening remarks that as a result of jury trial people are being acquitted who would otherwise be convicted, which runs wholly contrary to the statistics, as he knows.

 I have set out the reasoning behind the decision. Contrary to my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s suggestion, I did not base my argument on the rate of acquittal. I was careful not to do that; I actually based it on the length, complexity, costs, dangers and risks&#151;for example, that a juror or jurors can become ill during a trial and proceedings can be frustrated. There is a series of reasons why trials last longer because they are conducted before jurors. All the background information must be carefully set out&#151;issues that could be dealt with and resolved much more quickly by judges at a substantial saving to the taxpayer but, more than that, with an increase in the justice that is done because the complexity of the crime can be revealed.

 I understand my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s frustration at the length of trials, but is it right that a fundamental principle of justice should be removed because of the proceedings at a seminar? Is it right that the process should have proceeded in such a way without even more detailed consultation? My hon. and learned Friend mentioned the Lord Chief Justice&#039;s protocol of 22&nbsp;March; is he telling the House that the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent to these proposals? If he has not done so, what consultation has taken place outside the confines of the seminar with the senior judiciary about this important change?

Does my hon. and learned Friend accept that it is not necessary to be a lawyer or a white-collar criminal, or even both, to be concerned about taking away the right to jury trial, even in a fraction of cases? While my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s argument about the length of cases may have some merit, his further argument that cases are too complex and that juries are too stupid is a dangerous precedent to state. It is the poorest in our society and black ethnic communities who place most value on the right to trial by jury. Even though it is a handful of cases, a dubious precedent may well be set.

<a name="stpa_37">As for the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), I am not suggesting&#151;at no stage would I suggest&#151;that juries are unable to deal with very complex cases. They often deal with complex cases, and will continue to do so. It will be in the case of only very lengthy and extremely complex cases&#151;the most complex cases, a small handful or just more than that; we estimate up to 20&nbsp;a year, and it probably will be well under that number&#151;where there will be some difficulties. The types of problems that arise are not those that my hon. Friend suggests. Sometimes, to enable jury trials to take place and to put the issues properly to the jury, prosecutors have had to split cases and have two trials instead of one. There is also a temptation for prosecutors to undercharge to ensure that the case does not become too complex. To avoid such problems, to ensure that the full criminality of the issue is examined, and to ensure that justice is done we have introduced the proposals.

 Many of us who have been involved in long fraud cases believe that it is possible to address the question of length and complexity by even better case management and by ensuring that the counts on the indictment are limited in number, that the evidence is confined to the central issues, and that a general charge of conspiracy is avoided.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman identified the problem in his question. He said that we should limit the counts on the indictment, which would prevent the full criminality of the issue from being exposed before a jury. The seeds of the problem are evident in his question, as he is asking prosecutors to limit the extent of criminality so that it can be put before a jury. We want the full criminality to be exposed and justice to be properly done.

 Adhering to jury trials is an extremely lofty principle for the Minister, but does he agree that the vast majority of City fraud is perpetrated by the very rich robbing the filthy rich, then pursuing justice at the taxpayer&#039;s expense? Does he share my experience of many council estates where robberies, I am afraid, are commonplace? When people lose their tellies and their cars the police come along and give them a crime number, which they are supposed to take to their insurance company. Most of my constituents on those estates, however, do not even have an insurance company. I suggest to the Minister that the way to get rid of these cases is to give people a crime number and let them get on with it.

 My hon. Friend has identified a problem, as all too often blue collar crime is prosecuted because it is straightforward. The full criminality of white collar crime, however, may not be exposed because of its sheer complexity and the use of complex financial instruments. Split trials and a particular charging technique may be required, with the result that the whole issue is not properly exposed. It is a matter of justice, and of ensuring that white collar crime is dealt with as well as blue collar crime.

To ensure complete examination of all the issues, we must ensure that the full raft of criminality and its complexity is subject to a single trial so that justice can be done. The criminality must be considered in all its complexity, and should not be simplified with split trials so that it can be more easily managed by juries.

 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for the statement today and the promise of a debate in the near future. I shall not speak on behalf of lawyers.

With regard to juries and the people whom I represent, does my hon. and learned Friend understand that&#151;and when we have the debate, will he take cognisance of the effect that it would have on a small company&#151;if one person were taken out of the company for 12&nbsp;months, or if the person ran the company himself, that would have a bad effect over those 12&nbsp;months? Would all jurors have the right to decline jury service if it would have an effect on their living?

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50621-08_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 My hon. Friend identifies a key problem with some serious and complex fraud trials. If they are likely to last six months or a year, many people will suffer enormous economic and personal injury if they have to serve on a jury throughout that period. Most juries are in panel for a two-week period. In serious fraud trials the period can be much, much longer and the economic damage that that can cause to companies and individuals is serious.

The Minister implied in his response that it was a quantity issue, rather than a quality issue. He said that if we got rid of juries, prosecutors would no longer under-charge. Presumably he means they will over-charge&#151;they will put more and more into the indictment, making the case even more complex and leading to a longer trial with less likelihood of prosecution leading to a fruitful result. Why, when the Minister has a problem with complexity, does he focus on the jury, not on those who brought the case in the first place?

Jurors take the issues seriously and, as a lawyer, I have seen jurors take a serious interest in cases and manage complex issues. With respect, however, that is not the point. No one is suggesting that juries are a bad way of making decisions. Indeed, we want the vast majority of cases, including many complex cases, to continue to be dealt with by jurors, but for the past two decades judges and others have said in report after report that we have a serious problem with a tiny percentage of cases&#151;0.05&nbsp;per cent.

It is clear from the coverage in the media and elsewhere that misconceptions about the purpose and effect of the Bill remain and are still widespread in some areas. I therefore begin by emphasising that the Bill deals with hatred and incitement to hatred. It is about the nasty and extreme behaviour that drives people to hate others and sometimes, as the recent desecration of Jewish cemeteries shows, to turn that hatred against people and property. It is about behaviour that destroys individuals&#039; lives and sets one community against another.

 First, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clear statement about her approach and the change of view that she described.

<a name="stpa_49">Not only is the legal system in Victoria not the same as ours, but there are huge differences between section 8&nbsp;of Victoria&#039;s Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001&nbsp;and our proposals.

Additionally, the Victorian law prohibits incitement to serious contempt, severe ridicule and so on, of a religion itself, whereas the offence that I am proposing in this speech prohibits incitement to hatred of those who belong to the religion. So the threshold for the incitement to religious hatred that we propose is substantially higher than the one in Victoria; a comparison simply cannot be made between the two.

 I shall again refer to something that I was going to say later in my speech, in order to address my hon. Friend&#039;s point. How will cases be prosecuted under the Bill? First, the House must be aware of the European convention on human rights, and of the protection of freedom of expression that it contains. Secondly, for a case successfully to be prosecuted, it would have to go through certain stages. I shall list them, as they pertain directly to the point raised by my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_51">First, a complaint must be made to and accepted by a police officer. Secondly, the police must investigate and acquire evidence. Thirdly, the case must be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will assess it by applying evidential and public-interest tests. Fourthly, the case must be considered by the Attorney-General, who must consent to its continuation. Fifthly, in most cases it will also be considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Sixthly, prosecuting counsel must decide whether or not to proceed with the case. That is independent of the other stages. Seventhly, the judge must consider the case on the basis of all the elements that I have just listed. Everyone, including the Attorney-General, must have agreed that there is a case to answer, and the judge can then decide to throw the case out if it does not meet the standards set for it to proceed. Then a jury must consider the case put before it in court. If after all those steps the defendant is convicted, he or she can appeal.
</p>

<a name="stpa_52">I gave that list because I do not agree with the &quot;case creep&quot; argument advanced&#151;with integrity&#151;by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). This is a narrowly defined law including a great many protections to cover people&#039;s anxieties.

Time and again we were warned that it would undermine democracy, free speech and so forth, yet today not a single Member of Parliament, to my knowledge, would want a change in the law on incitement to racial hatred. It is quite likely that in years to come, this law will be no more controversial than that law.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I draw strength from that. We have drafted this Bill tightly, as the earlier legislation was drafted tightly, in an attempt to outlaw incitement to hatred. That is precisely what we should do, because the hatred that some have sought to incite, on the basis of either race or religion, is deeply destructive of every value that society possesses. I believe that it is not just our right but our duty as a Parliament to do whatever we can to outlaw such incitement to hatred.

 I do not follow the Home Secretary&#039;s argument that it is possible to dissociate criticism or intense dislike of a religion from intense dislike of the person who practices it. The word &quot;hatred&quot; simply means intense dislike. Where in the statute is the difference made clear? It seems to me that once someone intensely dislikes the religion itself and criticises it for that reason, it follows inevitably that that person intensely dislikes whoever is practising it. The only mechanism for which there will be no prosecution is the Attorney-General&#039;s discretion. We are passing very wide-ranging law, and then leaving it to the Attorney-General to restrict its scope.


</p>








<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50621-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The Attorney-General, in whatever Government, is an important protection. Secondly, and more seriously, there is a qualitative difference between intense dislike, in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s words, and incitement to hatred. That is an important distinction.

 There are two answers. First, the Bill will, if agreed by the House, be enacted into law and it will then be open to Parliament to amend it in future if it so wishes.

It is a system of beliefs, fundamentally and quite properly held.

 I do not believe that religion and politics slide together in the way that my hon. and learned Friend suggests. Secondly, there are many people for whom an easy distinction between religion and race is not accurate. Thirdly, I return to the previous point: we are talking about incitement to hatred, and I think that such incitement on the basis of race or religious belief should be driven out. I accept that, as my hon. and learned Friend said, there are genuine concerns that there is a risk of the legislation somehow tripping into other areas of freedom of expression. I am arguing, and I believe that my case is substantial and should be supported, that the Bill does not go over that line.

: What is the distinction between a political view and a religious view? Intense dislike of the British National party and its adherents is often expressed in this House, and that is considered proper enough. Why then is it considered improper to express intense dislike of a person because of his or her religious views&#151;if, for instance, that person were a satanist? The Home Secretary will agree that we should all speak with moderation, but will he explain why that distinction should be made in that fashion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50621-12_spnew12"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I think that the answer is self-evident, and I am sorry that it does not appear so to the hon. Gentleman. I believe that there is a clear difference between the set of political beliefs and values that a person holds and the religion to which he or she belongs. They are different things, and it is our duty to try and drive out incitement to hatred in those areas.

 My right hon. Friend is right to say that many people have grave concerns about the Bill. I am a Christian, and I know that many people in the Christian lobby are very concerned about how far we are able to describe hatred. I support the Bill, and I am disappointed that many Christian organisations have stirred up so much misunderstanding. Will my right hon. Friend make sure that the element of hatred is clearly defined when the Bill is considered in Committee? That will reassure people with genuine concerns, as the Bill must be tightly drawn to ensure that people retain total freedom of speech in respect of these matters. In addition, I assure him that I do not want to have anything to do with people who are trying to defend the right to incite hatred.

 I am happy to give the commitment that my hon. Friend seeks. In Committee, we will look at any proposal aimed at providing a tighter definition of hatred in the Bill, so that we can avoid the concern that some may have.

 I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way yet again on this very important matter. Does he consider that the Bill makes sufficiently clear the difference between an individual and a group? For example, the members of a religious group may take offence when a member of a different religious group begins to proselytise fiercely in an area. They may react by attacking the second group&#039;s religious beliefs and its members. That will be an attempt to defend their boundaries, but how can we ensure that that is not interpreted as an attempt to stir up hatred against the second religious group? Is not it the problem that intent becomes impossible to define?

However, proselytising can turn into incitement to hatred, and that is a different thing, which we are entitled to try and prevent.

<a name="stpa_62">The Bill seeks to fill a gap in the law that means that people can stir up hatred against others because of their religious beliefs. Such people may be extremists using religion as a proxy for race or nationality, but they may also be people of faith stirring up hatred of people who do not share their beliefs. That behaviour is not caught by the current set of religiously aggravated offences or by existing incitement offences.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">In amending the 1986&nbsp;Act, the schedule deliberately does not define what amounts to a religious belief. It will be for the courts to decide what constitutes a religious belief for the purposes of the legislation. However, for the purposes of article 9&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights, any religion must have a clear structure and belief system, and case law suggests that any religious belief will need to attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance. The beliefs must also be worthy of respect in a democratic society and not incompatible with human dignity.
</p>

We will carefully consider any suggestion for how the wording of the Bill might be improved&#151;in particular, to address concerns about freedom of speech.

<a name="stpa_71">We may be able to do other things in relation to the legislation that might ease people&#039;s concerns. Such proposals might involve not the wording of the legislation itself, but practical ways in which we can ensure that it operates in the way intended. For example, that might include guidance, drawn up in consultation with all interested parties, to the police, faith groups and community leaders. It might involve looking at how the effectiveness of the offence can be monitored. I am sure that we can return to those issues in subsequent debates.

Nevertheless, if we were to take any action on this issue, we would need to consult interested parties, particularly the established Church, and examine the issues in some detail.

 I hope that we will have a chance later in the debate to return to blasphemy.

If a group of fundamentalist Christians are spreading vilification and humiliation against gay people&#151;I notice that they do not have the protection that the Home Secretary is extending to those who follow a religion&#151;and I were to say outside the House that those Christian bigots should be despised and, indeed, hated for their views, can he guarantee that I would not be visited by the police and questioned, let alone reach the stage where the Attorney-General decides, for the convenience of the Government, to let me off?

I specifically do not propose either a change to the blasphemy law or a new blasphemy law. The issues relating to &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; were about blasphemy, not incitement to hatred. There are substantial protections in the Bill and in the conduct of any future Government which mean that the kind of change about which my hon. Friend is concerned could not happen.

 Can the Home Secretary clear up a fundamental point and give the House an unambiguous assurance that a simple statement of religious exclusivity&#151;that one religion has the key to salvation and that another or others do not&#151;will not in any circumstances be regarded as incitement to racial hatred and thus a criminal offence?

 May I take the Home Secretary back to the point about who defines what a religion is? When Lafayette Ron Hubbard set up scientology, he found it convenient to call it the Church of Scientology, but it is actually a dangerous organisation that preys on people with mental illness, and most of us would want to make that clear. However, it would be difficult to do so without indicating that one was very unhappy about those who promulgate scientology and make money from it. Self-certification of religion could be a means for outrageous and sometimes criminal organisations to protect themselves, which must be of considerable concern.

 The right hon. Gentleman and I have never discussed scientology, but on the basis of what he has just said I suspect we hold a similar view of the nature of that organisation.

 As I have already said, I am prepared to consider amendments and other proposals to do just that, but I emphasise yet again that robust argument about such issues is an essential part of our society and should be promoted. Indeed, when I was Secretary of State for Education and Skills I was involved in the development of the non-statutory framework for religious education in schools, which is predicated precisely on children at school being able to discuss frankly the strengths and weaknesses of particular religions. By the way, all the main religions in the country signed up to that as the right approach. We want more debate about those things, not less, and the Bill will make that more rather than less likely.

 Not only is intent not required for this offence, but the Home Secretary is widening the scope of the offence where intent is not required. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that many people in this country are, unfortunately, likely to be stirred up to religious hatred on a nothing. The way in which subsection (3)(b) is worded means that somebody making a comment from a biblical text or from a text in the Koran to an audience of learned people, which is then repeated to an audience of extremists, would be responsible for inciting hatred. The same comments, quoted from the same holy book, might well be taken by those extremists in a completely different sense, and their hatred would therefore be incited.

<a name="stpa_73">We have had a full and lively debate, and I am confident that the Bill will undergo detailed scrutiny in Committee. That is right because of the interest that the Bill has generated inside and outside Parliament. I understand the genuine concern that some hon. Members on both sides of the House have about the impact that the Bill may have on freedom of expression, although I say again that the Joint Committee on Human Rights of this Parliament came to the view that the measures contained in it are unlikely to give rise to any violation of the right to freedom of expression. Nevertheless, I accept that the issue needs to be fully and properly debated. I note that there is near universal agreement that stirring up hatred against people because of their religious beliefs, or lack of belief, is wrong and that it is right that we should seek to deal with the problem. The disagreement is not about why or if we should deal with that behaviour, but how. Given that, I hope that the debate will be positive and constructive. I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="stpa_74">I pick up immediately on the Home Secretary&#039;s final words. He pointed out that, effectively, this is the third time that this proposed legislation has been presented to the House. Therefore, it is important that we get it right and that we deal with it coolly and clinically. In view of the comments of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) and the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), I shall read an extract that was put into the record by Lord Alli in supporting the Government. He read out a verse from one of Hitler&#039;s most ardent opponents, Pastor Martin Neimoeller, which everyone will recognise. It reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;First, they came for the communists, and I did not speak out&#151;because I was not a communist.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_75">That is a famous verse and I suspect that everyone in the Chamber understands and agrees entirely with the sentiments that are expressed within it. I hope that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home Secretary and the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton, when they read <i>Hansard</i>, will accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_76">We all abhor discrimination and attempts to stir up hatred on whatever grounds. I am glad that the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety is in the Chamber, as I should like to respond to a striking contribution that she made to a previous debate. She claimed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;There is a difference between us and the Opposition. We feel that it is wrong to stir up hatred against people on the grounds of their religion. Clearly Opposition Members do not feel that that is wrong&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7&nbsp;February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 1224.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_77">That argument is clearly absurd. Before Ministers throw around any more silly accusations, they should remember that the Bill&#039;s opponents include Liberty, the writers&#039; organisation PEN, and many seasoned campaigners against discrimination&#151;not least Lord Lester, who has 40&nbsp;years experience of campaigning on race relations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_78">As the Home Secretary suggested at the end of his speech, we are not debating whether discrimination is right or wrong, but how we balance a belief in freedom and tolerance with the rights and interests of minorities. That balance is important and we do not believe that the Bill achieves it. The Bill is wrong in principle, it would be barely workable in practice and, arguably, it is unnecessary in any event. It has also raised expectations among minority communities, who are likely to be seriously disappointed if the law were brought into effect. Above all, a basic principle is at stake. We believe that the best way to target someone who hates others because of what they believe is through the force of argument, rather than the law. Criminal law should be used to punish people who do injury to the person, the property or the liberty of the individual, not simply offend their beliefs or feelings. That is the crucial difference between the proposals in the Bill and the original piece of legislation that it seeks to amend.

<a name="stpa_79">In 1986, the Conservative Government rightly sought to criminalise people who attempted to stir up hatred on the ground of race, because race is not something that someone chooses, as the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) pointed out. It is who they are&#151;it is their very person. An attack on race is an attack on the individual. Religious belief is quite different&#151;it is something that someone chooses or, indeed, chooses to opt out of. There are many different religions with competing claims and competing ways of life. It is entirely appropriate to debate the merits of each, to question the basis on which a religion is founded and, by implication, to challenge the way in which someone lives his life.

It is not clear why anyone should face that prospect, or why anyone should continue to pursue activities, whether writing, comedy or science, that put them at such risk.

Many believe the new law would be a substitute blasphemy law that would protect their religion from criticism. However, the Government have confirmed that that is not the intention, so the situation is confused.

<a name="stpa_86">Not only will many sections of the community be disappointed by the Bill, but they may also find that things are made considerably worse. We risk creating a tit-for-tat situation which encourages suspicion and mistrust between religions, rather than the harmony that we seek. That has been the experience in Australia. The Home Secretary says the law is different there. I shall be interested to see how the courts judge between vilification and incitement to hatred. It is an interesting distinction. Amir Butler, the executive director of the Australian Muslim Public Affairs Committee and a former supporter of religious hatred laws, has explained how the practice of those laws made him change his mind.

 The difference is substantial.

The difference in definition is massive; it is not a minor difference of interpretation.

A man called Norwood was recently successfully prosecuted by the police for putting a notice in the window of his house suggesting that Islam should be banished from the UK and associating Islam with the outrage of 9/11. In another recent case, a street preacher who held up a banner attacking homosexuality while proclaiming, &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; was prosecuted under existing public order legislation.

<a name="stpa_91">My hon. Friend is also right on the question of other legislation. Aside from the Public Order Act 1986, the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;incorporated the concept of religious freedom into British law, incitement is already a recognised criminal offence, judges already have the power to increase sentences if they find that religion is an aggravating factor in a crime, and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997&nbsp;gave people extra protection against hate crimes, whatever their motivation.

<p>
<a name="50621-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_92">We do not need to pass a Bill dealing specifically and narrowly with religious hatred. Indeed, if the Government really want to act on this issue&#151;if it is not just a posture, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) suggests&#151;it would be simpler and preferable to introduce the notion of religious hatred being a pretext for racial hatred. That course of action was supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties in both Houses and by important groups such as Liberty. It would be simpler, more precise and more effective; it would do the job that is needed if this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem exists; and it would achieve what the Government want without the need for a political clash and the elaborate gesture of a new law on the statute book.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">I want to turn briefly to some of the specific drafting issues that concern us. As we have heard, there is no definition of the word &quot;religion&quot; in the Bill; instead, it will be for the courts to decide what is or is not a religion. In short, we are being asked to pass a contentious and illiberal piece of legislation without really knowing what we are voting for. Equally, by failing to define clearly what is meant by the word &quot;religion&quot;, we are leaving the way clear for anybody&#151;be they racists, far-right groups or whatever&#151;to set themselves up as a religion and thereby give themselves protection, which is the very opposite of what we are trying to do. Would that stop mainstream politicians or anyone else from attacking their views, which most right-thinking people would find distasteful at least? Are we not also in danger of causing harm while seeking to do good? Members will be familiar, I am sure, with organisations such as Catalyst, a group that exists to help people escape from cults that have entrapped or enslaved them. If cults are to be accepted as religions, the good work that groups such as Catalyst do may become impossible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">The second problem is that of intent. The Bill states that the offence will be caused when &quot;words, behaviour or material&quot; are


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;likely to be heard or seen by any person in whom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they are likely to stir up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hatred.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">That is a completely subjective judgment. How on earth can one see into the mind of someone else to judge how they will react to something that one might say? Once again, this holds important implications for the standards of debate and tolerance in our society.

As the House of Lords report on religious offences made clear, many people in this country live in communities where they have little choice about the faith to which they adhere and are always believed by other people, because of the clothes that they wear, to belong to a particular faith. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to soften the edges of his argument about choice and faith.

<br>&nbsp;<br>I&nbsp;hope, as a result of representations by me and by other Labour Members. Lawyers have said&#151;as have some Conservative Members&#151;that there may be problems with the interpretation of &quot;incitement&quot;. The courts have always had problems with interpreting &quot;incitement&quot;: there are all sorts of laws involving it. Then there is the question of how to define &quot;religion&quot;. We deliberately did not define &quot;race&quot;, which is quite difficult to define. We left the definition to the courts in the case of incitement to racial hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_108">Some objections to the proposals may be valid. No law is perfect. As has already been said, there is a danger of tit-for-tat activity on the part of one religious group against another; but, as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has pointed out, there is a fair degree of protection from that, culminating in the requirement for the Attorney-General&#039;s consent. I think that we can expect the Attorney-General to try and keep the lid on tit-for-tat activity. There is the possibility of the Attorney-General&#039;s being accused of religious bias, but that did not happen much in the case of race, and I see no reason why it is likely to happen in the case of religion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_109">Another argument is that while it is appropriate to cover race in legislation because people cannot change their race, it is inappropriate to provide similar protection in regard to religion because people can change their religion. Let us think about it. The logic of the argument is that if people do not like being subject to assault and hatred because of their religion, they can always change their religion. That is a sickening invitation to intimidation. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), most people are born into their religion just as much as they are born into their race.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_110">I believe that the laws against incitement to racial hatred have worked&#151;imperfectly, like all laws. Not many cases have been brought, but the test is not the number of cases that have been brought, or at least that is not the only test. The law that the Tories introduced&#151;they deserve credit for that&#151;backed up the moral and ethical position that incitement to racial hatred was wrong. As a result of that declaratory effect, the stirring up of hatred on grounds of race has declined. Some people have been a bit more careful about what they say.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_111">That brings me to the objections expressed by comedians and clerics. The comedians apparently think that they would be breaking the law if they made jokes about religion; but they would be breaking the law only if they used threats, abuse and insults with the intention of stirring up hatred, or if in all the circumstances they were likely to do so. If a comedian needs the right to do that, we have the right to stop him or her, and I believe that that is what we should do. I do not believe that any comedians, or clerics, need the right to set out to stir up hatred against any of their fellow citizens. They would be in a sad state if they did.

I think that we need to enact the law in advance, and try to ensure that if there is a terrible incident we do not see the irrational but, again, almost inevitable attacks on, say, a particular religious group if members of that group are accused of being the cause of it. We need to be leading the way, not dragging along behind.

As regards the analysis of the problem, I share a great deal of common ground with the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), as do all Liberal Democrats. We think it is right that the Government have recognised a major issue, that there should be no complacency about the growth in Islamophobia and that there should be no equivocation in any quarter in the criticism of groups such as the British National party, and others that seek to promote Islamophobia and prosper on the back of it. The difficulty I have with the position outlined by the Home Secretary and the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras relates to the Government&#039;s apparent insistence that their way of proceeding is the only way.&nbsp;They seek to present the choice as being between doing nothing&#151;continuing to tolerate the growth of Islamophobia, hatred attacks and the rest of it&#151;and doing what they wish to do.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_115">I can see why the Bill is attractive to many groups, especially to many Muslim groups, but this is not a debate about who is supporting and who is opposing Muslim groups in ethnically diverse communities. I bring to the House&#039;s attention the comments of Dr.&nbsp;Ghayasuddin Siddiqui of the Muslim Parliament of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain on 13&nbsp;June, which were reasserted in <i>The&nbsp;Guardian</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The moslem concern for protection, equality and social inclusion is real and genuine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This law will be cosmetic and fail to prevent the abuses hurled at Muslims.&quot;</p>

 It will come as no great surprise to anyone in the House to hear me say that I agree with my hon. Friend on this occasion, as I do on most. I listened with great care to the litany that the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras produced. I could not identify anything within that list that would not in theory at least be caught by the current law&#151;particularly incitement to violence, incitement to harassment and the multiplicity of common law offences that are at the prosecuting authorities&#039; disposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">The benefit of the Lester amendment is that it takes a belt and braces approach. In the event of a scenario arising that we&#151;and even the right hon. Gentleman&#151;have not yet envisaged, the Lester amendment would cover it. That is the sensible approach. That is why I say that the choice is not between following the Government and supporting the Bill, and doing nothing. The mischief at which the Government seek to strike is the pernicious use of religion as a proxy for race. The BNP and others know what will happen to them if they incite hatred on the basis of ethnicity. It is less clear what will happen to them if they do so on the basis of religion, so that is the basis on which they proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">It is worth remembering that Lord Lester&#039;s amendment came in two parts. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) has referred to the first part, so I will not read it into the record. The second part related to freedom of expression:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;Nothing in Part 3&nbsp;of the Public Order Act 1986&nbsp;shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy or dislike of particular religions or their adherents, or of any other belief system or its adherents, or proselytizing one&#039;s own religion or belief system or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising theirs.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">Whatever view one takes of the first part of the amendment, I cannot for the life of me see what the Government&#039;s objection would be to that express protection for freedom of religious expression being included in the Bill. I do not understand why the Government shy away from giving some comfort to evangelical Christians and others who see the Bill as a threat to their freedom of expression. Lord Lester&#039;s amendment leaves no hiding place for the BNP, but it still provides some protection for the rights of freedom of expression, especially the rights of artistic and religious freedom, which could otherwise be threatened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">It is worth considering how those threats may arise. My primary concern is about the misuse of the powers by the prosecuting authorities. Others have given examples of the &quot;chilling of expression&quot; that could arise as a result of interview, arrest or detention by the police. That is worth considering.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">We also have to look at the manner in which the 1986&nbsp;Act is being amended. The Home Secretary is right to say that hatred is set at a high threshold. The Government have set the bar fairly high, but I come back to the point about likelihood, which arises in relation to subsection (1)(b). The amendment to section 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>19&nbsp;entitled &quot;Publishing or distributing written material&quot; covers fairly clearly those who intend to stir up racial or religious hatred. But then substituted for subsection (1)(b) are the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;having regard to all the circumstances the words, behaviour or material are (or is) likely to be heard or seen by any person in whom they are (or it is) likely to stir up racial or religious hatred.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">That is a significant lowering of the bar that has been set by the provision dealing with hatred. In addition, it makes it very difficult for a person to regulate their conduct according to the offence. It is surely one of the principles of natural justice that law has to be clear to allow the citizen to regulate their conduct. In this case, one can be guilty of an offence not just on the basis of what one has said, done or published but on the basis of what someone else has done, because the provision relates to the likelihood of a person having access to it. That is profoundly worrying.
</p>








<p><a name="st_184"><a name="50621-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham </b> 
: As I said earlier, the wording of the provision on incitement, concerning the effect that particular words or actions have on a person, is precisely the same as the wording used in the Public Order Act 1986.

The terms of the 1986&nbsp;Act and of the Bill are not exactly the same&#151;the latter substantially amend the former. The 1986&nbsp;Act uses the phrase,

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-19_para7">

 The hon. Gentleman is right on this issue; indeed, the right hon.

One consequence of this provision is that it will be possible for somebody to address, using terms that may be insulting to a religion, an audience whom he knows will not feel insulted, have those words reproduced to another audience, who are insulted, and be guilty of the offence. That is what the Government are setting out to do in their proposed new paragraph (b).

<br>&nbsp;<br>might well not feel that it constituted incitement. But were it used in certain circles that we know of, it would be very difficult to claim, in the light of its wording, that it did not constitute incitement to hatred. The situation is exactly as the hon. Gentleman describes. This is a dangerous broadening of the meaning of the words, and as a result, the courts will be able to act in a manner that is unacceptable to this House.

I do not underestimate that protection, and I am pleased that at the very least it will be retained. But that is not the end of the story. There are three distinct problems, the first of which is the changing nature of the functions performed by the Law Officers themselves. We saw that in the run-up to the war in Iraq, when the Attorney-General&#039;s advice was sought. Speaking as someone who worked as a civil servant with Law Officers in Scotland early in my career, it is clear to me that their job is changing dramatically.

Is that not an additional problem, which cannot be dealt with by expert legal advice?

: Can the hon. Gentleman picture himself in the shoes of the Attorney-General?

The political pressure on him to do the right thing would be substantial. Would he like to be in the Attorney-General&#039;s shoes in that situation? Actually, he probably would.

 If an offer has been made. We already have the precedent in Scotland of the Solicitor-General being a solicitor, rather than a member of the Faculty of Advocates.

<a name="50621-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_128">To return to the serious point, the hon. Gentleman highlights the very political pressure that can be brought to bear on someone who is supposed to be a Law Officer. As I said earlier, we have already seen that political considerations are weighing much more heavily on Law Officers. As the Hutton and Butler reports have shown, the Attorney-General and other Law Officers are being asked for their advice in a manner that is much more political and much less objective. In fact, they are being asked to answer questions that lead in a particular direction, rather than being asked to give a definitive statement on the law, which was the traditional way in which such matters were proceeded with.

<a name="stpa_129">The cutting out of the Attorney-General in relation to racial hatred has been effective, but the House would be wrong to conclude that the same would necessarily be true if the principle were applied to religious hatred on the same basis. If we are not to deal with this issue before we consider the Bill in Committee, and given that we are likely to deal with the Report stage after the recess, we need to see the terms of the draft guidance that will be given by the Attorney-General on the operation of this provision. It seems to me that since the Government&#039;s case rests on saying that we should not worry about the theoretical position because they will make it work in practice, the ultimate judgment can be made only when we see the guidance that they intend to produce. I accept that it will not be available in Committee, which is regrettable. It makes me wonder why we are dealing with the Bill so early stage in the Session when it would have been possible to leave it for a few months to facilitate a more mature consultation with those affected and revisit the issues again in the autumn if necessary.

Nevertheless, I remain concerned about the degree of self-censorship, and fear that the Bill will have some impact.

 As my hon. Friend says, under the Bill, we would not be able to call them bigots.

 Sometimes, the person who follows a maiden speech has to search hard to find something to be polite about, but on this occasion the House heard a staggeringly good first speech. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik) will be listened to with pleasure and interest whenever he speaks. I have heard that said before, when it was not true, but I am certain that it is true this time. He recounted his personal experiences and the history of his constituency before making a profound and important contribution to the debate in a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way that will make all of us believe that we have a worthy new MP for Dewsbury.

<a name="stpa_155">My concern about the Bill relates to unintended effect. I agree with all that the hon.

We should all learn much more about one another and from one another, and we should be prepared to understand more about the world through other people&#039;s experiences and deep understandings. I do not think that anyone could accuse me of having anything other than a belief in and a concern for religion, but I do not like Bills that, first, can define neither hatred nor religion satisfactorily.

<a name="50621-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_156">I am very worried particularly about the fact that religion itself is not defined. I used in an intervention the example of Scientology, which is not a religion in my view. It is a means of making money for a group of people. It was invented for that purpose, and Lafayette Ron Hubbard called it the Church of Scientology to get away with things that he could not have got away with if his organisation had been open in the way that other such organisations were. Under the Bill, it seems almost impossible, by such definitions as exist, for one to be able to say publicly what one needs to say about Scientology, without being in severe danger of being found to have stirred up hatred and contempt.

None of us would like to be accused of either hating or stirring others to hate, but I find it very difficult not to feel very strongly about Jehovah&#039;s Witnesses who&#151;believing the words of a crook, Charles Taze Russell&#151;kill babies by not giving them blood transfusions. If I were to say that outside the House, it would be considered as stirring hatred. I am not doing that, but it is not me who decides whether I am stirring hatred; someone else decides that I might be stirring hatred in someone else by using those words.

I am not suggesting that many people adhere to those beliefs, but I am suggesting that pretty tough words may need to be used about them, and the result of those words could well be that some of the people to whom they were addressed would consider that their use stirred up hatred against them. I merely say that that is a strong possibility.

<p>
<a name="50621-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_159">Those are examples of what might happen, whereas the Home Secretary has provided not a single example of what the Bill would stop. Labour Members must accept the fact that this is the first Bill of such seriousness on which the Home Secretary has come to the House without explaining the examples that led him to make this decision. I therefore go on to why people should be worried about the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_160">It is all right for some of the hon. Gentlemen who have now left the Chamber to say that they want reassurance from various groups of Christians. During the past few months, in the town neighbouring my constituency&#151;Ipswich&#151;a group of Christians who have proclaimed their views in the streets for many years were ordered to go to the police station to explain why they should not be arrested for stirring up hatred. They had a very difficult time. They happen not to be a Christian group with whom I have much in common. They are a narrow group of rather old-fashioned believers of a Brethren type, but I will defend them for ever; they should have the right to proclaim their faith in Britain and not to be stopped and taken to the police station by the police. If that can be done under the present law, how much more likely that it could be done under the Bill? After all, if the Home Secretary is saying nothing else, he is saying that the Bill will make the law tougher. If it will not make the law tougher, why is he introducing it at all?

 I can confirm that, in my constituency, street preachers have been told that they may preach, but that they may not say that those who do not share their views are destined for hell, because that is insulting, apparently. I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend that that happens under the present law under which the Bill is proposed by the Government, and the consequence is that such things must fall foul of the more draconian penalties that would be visited under the law, as amended.

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="50621-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Of course, one of the problems is that we are dealing with an atmosphere in which quite a lot of people do not really believe that there is much to choose between various religions, that one should not therefore get too hot under the collar and that the only thing that really matters is that people should be extremely nice and tolerant to other people. That is their problem, and it is why, when I stated the truth about the history of the

In a sense, I prefer those things to matter to him enough for him to insult my faith, my belief and what is most important to me to stopping him; because in stopping him, I would dehumanise him and reduce his ability to be himself in our society. That is a crucial part of freedom. Freedom allows him and his friends to shout at me when I march through Walsingham, and to shout at me the things that hurt most. When we choose a religion, we choose something that may well be more important to us than anything else on earth. Therefore, I have to put up with him, but I do so because that is what freedom is about; it is not putting up with people who argue with us about things that do not really matter to us or anyone else.

<a name="stpa_163">So I come to that verse from the Koran. If we read that verse or many others from the Koran in a secular circumstance, with people who are not at all particularly supportive of religion, we find that it is very difficult to interpret in any way whatsoever but as one that stirs up hatred. It is perfectly possible to find another interpretation in the circle of Koranic experts or among those for whom such things are revealed, but once we move outside those categories, it is very difficult to argue that its use anywhere else would not stir up religious hatred against the people who believe those things. In that case, those people are being encouraged to behave in a way that we would find entirely intolerant. Therefore, if I want the Koran to have the respect that it should have, even though I have the doubts about its origin and the nature of its founder that have been expressed elsewhere, I believe in the integrity of those individuals. If I want to protect them, I beg them not to give the protection to themselves that could so easily rebound against them. That is the question that gives us most concern.

<br>&nbsp;<br>two key words on which it is based. It does not give us a single example of an occasion on which it would provide a protection that does not already exist, nor is there an obvious example of someone or some group who, because the Bill has not been the law, were severely disadvantaged. What the Bill does, however, is to stir up great fear among people as different as the Brethren, the Catholics, some Muslims and some Hindus&#151;among people who are secularist or deeply religious.

He and I first met in the months following the disturbances in Burnley when, as a Home Office Minister, I was responsible for co-ordinating part of the Government&#039;s response. Burnley is my hon. Friend&#039;s home town, and he shared some of his experiences. What he said tonight reminds us that the debate we should be having is not an abstract one about this or that possible consequence of a piece of legislation in some other world. We need legislation for the society in which we exist&#151;one of conflicts and division, where, as members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs heard in our most recent inquiry, the daily experience of the Muslim community in particular is of systematic abuse and discrimination.

<a name="stpa_166">I differ from the right hon.

In the past, that argument has been used to resist race discrimination and equality legislation. When we look across Europe we find two things. First, the UK has a much more extensive system of legislation against racial discrimination, racial inequality and prejudice. Secondly, despite our manifest problems, we have a somewhat better record on dealing with the problems and challenges of a diverse society than those European societies that choose not to address them but to rely on the tradition of debate and tolerance. Over 30&nbsp;years or so, the UK has with some success updated and adjusted its framework of anti-discrimination and hatred legislation to respond to emerging problems and issues.

 There is of course incitement legislation already.

<a name="stpa_168">In the past, however, the House has decided three things: first, in relation to race, that action against a group of people, as opposed to particular individuals, is so pernicious and corrupting that it should be outlawed; secondly, that the corrupting effect of racial violence or harassment is such that it should be an aggravated offence&#151;we treat it differently from the same action against other groups; and, thirdly, only two years ago, that an act against someone on religious grounds should be explicitly an aggravated offence. The one thing that we have not yet done is to extend protection to a religious group. We have an entirely anomalous situation: because of case law, some groups, especially Jews and Sikhs, are protected by the law, but Muslims and Christians are not. My argument is that we should extend that protection to those groups.

<a name="50621-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_169">I want to deal briefly with some of the major objections to bringing the law on incitement to religious hatred into line with our existing legislation. The House has already addressed some of the problems of definition. Two or three years ago, when we decided to make religion an aggravating factor, we implicitly accepted that the courts would be able to decide what a religion was; otherwise the changes to the law in 2001&nbsp;would not have been workable. The House had no objection to making a religiously motivated offence an aggravated offence. That has already been accepted. We accepted that it would be a workable principle when we incorporated in law the European convention on human rights.
</p>

<a name="50621-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_170">There is an argument that people cannot choose their race but can choose their religion. I do not believe that that argument holds water in any practical way. For the purposes of this debate, it is like saying to a Muslim who is fed up with facing aggravation and harassment, &quot;You really brought it on yourself. Why don&#039;t you become a Jew?&quot; That is a ludicrous argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_171">To take the point further, a person cannot choose their parents and their ethnic background. So, if they happen to have Semitic parents and are Jewish, there is protection under the law, but if they happen to have Semitic parents and are Muslim, which is true of some Palestinians, although by no means all, there is no protection under the law. We have an anomalous situation. Race, religion and culture are in truth intimately intertwined, which was actually the very basis on which the courts chose to define Jews and Sikhs as ethnic groups under race relations legislation.

 The trouble is that those people are correct.

 Precisely the same objections were made about the Public Order Act 1986, but they have not proved to be the case in practice. The problem is not primarily the Bill as it stands&#151;I shall address its contents in a moment&#151;but the way in which it is perceived outside.

I have read the measure on many occasions and have changed my view several times about whether it would lower the threshold. I do not believe that the Government intended to lower the threshold, so I welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s commitment to examine such matters in Committee.

<a name="stpa_176">The Bill is the latest in the long line of oppressive measures that has come out of this Government. However, this one is especially dangerous. At the end of the last Parliament, we passed a Bill that managed to prohibit us even from smacking a naughty child without some busybody turning up with a magnifying glass to see whether that had left a mark. This Bill will curtail not action, but the free expression of thought, which has always been the underlying tenet of our democracy. It did not matter whether one was a fascist or a communist, whether one was a militant evangelical street preacher or a militant atheist, or whether one was a carefully spoken professor of philosophy at Oxford or Alf Garnett, because whoever one was and whatever one thought, one was able to express those thoughts freely. One did not have to work out what someone else might think of those thoughts and decide what to do about them several stages down the line.

<p>
<a name="50621-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_177">I am worried about the definition of intention. The Bill will not be restricted to covering the intended stirring up of religious hatred because, as it says, it will apply if an action is &quot;likely&quot; to stir up religious hatred. A person might not think that his or her actions are likely to result in the stirring up of religious hatred, but if an act of religious hatred follows and someone wants to contend that the person should have thought that that would be likely, what matters is not the intention, but what another party has done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_178">I shall draw an analogy away from the subject of religion to explain why I am worried. I frequently make speeches about the pro-life issue. Let us suppose that I address an audience with an impassioned speech about what goes on in abortion clinics, as I frequently do, and make the judgment that the audience will be sympathetic to what I say, as they usually are. I could say, &quot;If we could see the unborn children going into those clinics, we would rise up against it.&quot; I have used the expression &quot;rise up against it&quot; many times and I mean it metaphorically. It might be that the audience was made up of 100&nbsp;people and that 99&nbsp;went away and all they did was to hand out pro-life leaflets. However, one person might take what I said so much to heart that he committed an act of violence against a clinic or, worse still, against someone going to work in a clinic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_179">That is an analogy, but if I were a vicar, which I will never be because that is something else that I disapprove of, I could be addressing my congregation after making the judgment that it was the usual Sunday morning congregation, so they knew me and I knew them. I might use a metaphor, but someone in the congregation could take the metaphor literally and go out and do something of which manifestly none of us would approve. Under the Bill, I could then be charged with the offence of saying something that was likely to stir up religious hatred. The vague definitions in the Bill seriously undermine it. I would be more reassured if the Bill was about intent, but the definition goes way beyond that.

The harbour dates back to 1664&nbsp;and was for many years a major trading post with the new world. Those links to and with the United States continue to this day and are perhaps best illustrated by my informing the House that the grandmother of George Washington is buried in the grounds of Whitehaven&#039;s St. Nicholas church alongside her servant, an African slave.

In 1778, the townsfolk of Whitehaven repelled the invading forces of the American continental navy, led by a one-time son of the town and founder of the American fleet, John Paul Jones. That attack sent a tremor throughout the empire, proving that our island was not impenetrable and that the colonial rebels were serious about their intentions.

The need for coal to fuel the development of the nation and the empire led to an undersea pit being sunk at Saltom, a feat of engineering akin to the construction of the channel tunnel. Work began in 1729&nbsp;and by 1731&nbsp;the pit had reached a depth of 456&nbsp;ft.

Following the end of the war and the actions of the US Congress in withdrawing from co-operation on an Anglo-American nuclear research programme, this area, known as Sellafield, was chosen as the site at which our country should produce materials for our nuclear deterrent. It was done in the service of our nation. Soon thereafter Sellafield became home to the world&#039;s first commercial-scale nuclear power station. That, too, was done in the service of our nation. The passage of time in no way lessens the value of that service or the relevance of those feats. Far from being a distant folk memory, the legacy of those achievements can still be seen from Copeland.

Consequently, the future of the site and the economic future of my constituency are inextricably linked. Copeland is home to what is probably the single largest concentration of nuclear engineering, operational and technical skills anywhere in the world. That unique skills base represents a priceless national asset and it must be utilised and built upon for the well-being of Britain as a whole, not just my constituency.

It will also further cultural understanding and social integration. Against a backdrop of rising race-related crime in some areas&#151;Northern Ireland in particular, if the figures published yesterday are to be believed&#151;and the growth of far-right parties in the UK, it is difficult to present a coherent objection to the Bill.

I do not know what will happen in our land, but I would not like to put my faith in any Attorney-General to protect the freedom that ought to be mine. There are many misconceptions about the Bill. I missed part of our debate today, because I had an appointment with the Home Secretary to discuss this very matter. I told him that many people think that the Bill has been introduced in the House as a sop to Muslims. That is a general opinion around the country. There is a general belief that the freedom to preach in the streets and so on will be curtailed. The issue must be settled by the House, and our debate has been more than useful, as Members who are poles apart religiously believe in the right of every Member to express himself, stand up for what he believes, take what comes to him, and give as good as he gets. That is good for democracy and good for the country. It reflects the true spirit of this nation and can do nothing but good. But I hope that before the Bill comes to the end of its passage, it will be changed in such a way that there will be no doubt about what it is really about, as the Home Secretary said.

<a name="stpa_207">We are told that the Bill will help equality of treatment. If equalising religions were the real aim, far greater progress could have been made by seizing this perfect moment to abolish the blasphemy laws, whose repeal was suggested by the Law Commission over 20&nbsp;years ago. When is the right time, I ask the Home Secretary, for those laws to be repealed? Many of us might have been able to support the Bill&#039;s provisions if they applied equally to all religions.

<a name="50621-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_208">Similarly, if equalisation was the aim, No. 10&nbsp;could have guaranteed the teaching of all religions and all non-religious value systems in all our schools, which is not the case at present. Instead of reducing the current religious privilege of Christianity in order not to offend some Christians perhaps close to home and to appease some UK Muslims, No. 10&nbsp;is choosing instead to extend religious privilege. Many of us in the House, content to tolerate existing faith schools, were deeply annoyed at No. 10&#039;s successful attempt to extend their number even further by Executive action, without even bothering to consult the House. It beggars belief also that a Labour Government have sponsored an academy that spouts creationism to our young children. When it comes to pushing ever more religion into politics, my view is that not only should we stop digging, but we should have a serious programme of filling in the holes.
</p>

<a name="50621-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_209">The biggest problem with the Bill is false expectations. It is designed to ensure that people who take religion seriously will feel protected. Sadly, exactly the opposite of what No. 10&nbsp;intends will happen. If passed, the Bill will be a charter for zealots and self-appointed religious vigilantes. They will be on an each-way winner. Either they will be able to obtain the prosecution of their opponents, or, more likely, they will be refused, giving them the maximum opportunity for self-publicising martyrdom and for challenging the authority of moderate members of their faith.

Those who want to ban a play, stop the criticism of the systematic subjugation of women by some religions or force children to wear particular forms of dress will feel aggrieved by this law if, as the Minister promises, it does not give them redress. The finesse between a law and a signal may well be appreciated by moderate religious and political leaders, but it may not be appreciated by their communities.

<p>
<a name="50621-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_211">That will play into the hands of the Protestant bigots, the Catholic zealots and the Muslim fundamentalists alike, for this law will not defend them or their icons from insult or offence. Indeed, cases are likely to concentrate on those who specialise in inflammatory language to prove how devout they are. Rather than mainstream religious communities being defended by the Bill, it is religious extremists who will be queuing up, keen to generate press attention and followers by provoking judicial martyrdom, made all the sweeter if it is at the hands of other faiths.

<p>
<a name="50621-25_para11">

Throughout our country, there are members of faith groups and sects who seek to dictate how other people live, particularly if the other people are young, gay or women. Those people treat themselves as the custodians of their religion. They interpret any challenge to themselves as an attack on their religion. They will be the first to seek to use the law, and perhaps the citizen&#039;s arrest powers that probably go with it. They will publicly demand prosecution of their opponents and the seven-year maximum penalty.

<a name="stpa_213">It will be up to the Attorney-General to accept or refuse such requests, often against a backdrop of controversy or perhaps even in the run-up to a general election. That is a job that no one in his office should have to perform. It will force him to make judgments on matters of faith. It will turn Ministers of the Crown into ministers of religion. It makes the Government judge of what constitutes a religion, who belongs to it, who represents it and when it is permissible to attack it. No. 10&nbsp;cannot have it both ways. Either the Bill does the business protecting religious minorities, or it does not. Either way, there are consequences to be faced.

One may argue that that is welcome&#151;I certainly would&#151;but one cannot argue that it was specifically in the Public Order Act 1986. An extension of the Bill might also take place. Those who will be absent from the courtroom will be the vast majority of British people from all ethnic backgrounds who care nothing for the esoteric debates of religious fundamentalists.

Open, honest, vigorous debate around ideas should not give way initially to silent acquiescence, sullen grievance and the festering, repressed anger in which racism breeds. Yes, there are those who say, &quot;My religion, my way, allows me to indoctrinate children, to allow no debate, to permit no disagreement, to disallow all alternatives.&quot; They are entitled in our culture to think that, but I must be allowed to challenge those views without fear.

 I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) has said. I did not agree with everything that he said about religion and Churches, but I agree with the main thrust of his argument on the unintended consequences that will flow from the Bill. I&nbsp;want to make five points about the Bill, all of which are, I hope, reasonable, and explain why, apart from the fact that we are on a three-line Whip, I shall oppose it this evening

<a name="stpa_218">I strongly support the Government&#039;s intention to build a more tolerant society. Most hon.

We live in a modern, pluralist society, and we must find space for each other and get along together. We must exchange ideas, but at the same time we must co-exist. I have much more in common with a strong Muslim than I do with an atheist, which is why many of my friends are Muslims&#151;we have great debates and a great deal in common. We must build a pluralist society in Britain, or we are all doomed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_219">First, the Government do not know what is in their own Bill. During his recent appearance on the &quot;Sunday&quot; programme, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) was asked whether the question, &quot;Was the Prophet Mohammed a paedophile?&quot;, which I would not ask of my own initiative, would fall foul of this Bill. His answer was &quot;yes&quot;, if the person asking the question intended to incite religious hatred. However, that is not the right answer, because the matter concerns not only intent, but whether the act is likely to stir up religious hatred, which is an entirely different test. The difference between those two offences is huge, and it is deeply worrying that the Minister does not appear to know the test in his own legislation, and I hope that that matter will be clarified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_220">Secondly, the Bill is unnecessary. Several of us have asked the Home Secretary and other Labour Members to give us examples of activities, speeches and events that take place in our country today that this Bill will catch and that existing legislation does not already catch.

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsible should be arrested by the police and charged under existing legislation, which they most certainly could be. I am sad to say that in some parts of the country the police do not provide the service that we used to experience, which is another matter. However, I am convinced that the law already exists to deal with that situation and that we do not need this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_221">When we discussed this matter in December, I asked the former Home Secretary what we are trying to prevent, and this was his answer:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;We are trying to stop groups of people who are prepared verbally, communicating through writing or the internet, to incite others to hate because of someone&#039;s faith.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7&nbsp;December 2004; Vol. 428, c.1056.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">He was pressed to provide specific examples, but, like the Home Secretary today, he could not do so. If we are legislating to restrict, or possibly restrict, freedom of speech, we should certainly know why we are doing so and the mischief that we are trying to prevent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_223">Thirdly, like the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, I am concerned about unintended consequences. He cited a couple of possible unintended consequences of the Bill, and I shall provide another. Extremists exist on the fringes of a number of different religions in this country. They do not come from particular faith groups, and I am sad to say that Christian fundamentalist extremists are present in this country today. Many of my constituents were offended by the BBC programme, &quot;Jerry Springer the Opera&quot;&#151;it offended me, too, but that is my personal problem&#151;but some of the activity by Christian extremists against that programme was reprehensible. It was outrageous to give out the home telephone number of the programme&#039;s producer and encourage people to ring it at all hours of day and night, which was not a Christian response to the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_224">If we are not careful, one faith group will see another faith group becoming militant, and it will up the ante. If we are not careful, arguments that are currently confined to our pulpits, our streets and our debating chambers will be taken on to the barricades and into the courtrooms, which will ratchet up the whole process. If one faith group uses the Bill to put pressure on the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney-General to prosecute in a certain case, we know that retaliation will follow. Before we know it, we will have holy wars in this country&#039;s courtrooms, which will be unedifying. The Bill will not reduce racial and religious tension or increase tolerance&#151;it will do the opposite. If an organisation such as Justice can see that point, the Government should, too.

<p><a name="st_249"><a name="50621-26_spnew5"><b> John Hemming  (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b> 
 My constituency is in Birmingham, which is a city with a large number of faiths. In Birmingham, we have a faith leaders group, which discussed the matter earlier today. The faith leaders group includes bishops of various faiths, leading imams and others. It represents the Anglicans, the Catholics, the Muslims, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the Hindus and the Jews, and it feels that something must be done to address the issue. Will the hon.

<a name="50621-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_225">Fourthly, another unintended consequence will be disappointment in some faith communities, which the hon. Member for Nottingham, North mentioned. I have had many meetings with Iqbal Sacranie, the former chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain, whom I deeply respect and who is a man of the utmost integrity. On the BBC Radio 4&nbsp;programme, &quot;The Moral Maze&quot;, on 14&nbsp;July last year, however, he said that he envisaged that under the new law any &quot;insult&quot; or &quot;outrageous comments&quot; about Islam or the Muslim community, would be illegal, as would any defamation of the character of the Prophet Mohammed, which would be

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_226">That is simply not the case. If a man of such standing in the Muslim community so misunderstood what the Bill is about only nine months ago, when the Government had already brought it to the House on two occasions, I fear that this law will disappoint people. That will lead to further outrage, protest and reaction, and not to more tolerance but to greater intolerance, protest, and racial, religious and inner-city tensions&#151;the last thing that we need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_227">For 12&nbsp;very enjoyable months in my first Parliament, I was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Attorney-General, Sir Nicholas Lyell. I saw that he was a man of the utmost integrity, as were the Law Officers, who are men and women who perform a sterling service to the Government. However, even in those days&#151;Members have asked whether there have been changes, but I will not comment on that now&#151;I saw that Law Officers could come under political pressure. I am deeply concerned if our last resort&#151;the greatest safety check in the Bill&#151;is that the Attorney-General will ultimately decide whether to prosecute. Intolerable political pressure could be applied to that office, particularly in the run-up to a general election. That might have two results: first, the integrity and reputation of that office could be damaged further, which we do not want to happen, as we have had enough of that in the past 12&nbsp;months, and Law Officers are very important people who perform a great service to the Government and to the country; and secondly, poor decisions might be taken for political reasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_228">I do not believe that the Bill is the safety valve that the Government claim it to be. It is a very bad Bill that puts Law Officers under intolerable pressure. I hope that the Government will listen carefully to the many points that have been made by Members on both sides of the Chamber tonight and that they will withdraw it.

<p><a name="st_253"><a name="50621-27_spnew0"><b> Sir Peter Soulsby  (Leicester, South) (Lab):</b> 
 My constituency is one of the most ethnically diverse of any represented in this House outside London. In the last census in 2001, more than 40&nbsp;per cent. of its population described themselves as other than white British, and the proportion is probably somewhat higher today. In giving that description, they used many different criteria, the two most notable being race and religion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_229">It is not only in the census that the two criteria of race and religion are used as indicators of how people identify themselves. For them, when it comes to race it is not a matter of choice, and, contrary to what has been said several times during this debate, neither is it a matter of choice when they identify themselves by religion. For many of those in that 40&nbsp;per cent. in my constituency, their religion is as fundamental a part of their culture, family and tradition as their race&#151;in many cases, more fundamental. Of course, it is also on the basis of race and religion that many of those who seek to promote division, discord and hate categorise people in my constituency and in others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_230">Today, Leicester is very fortunate. Relations between the various ethnic and religious groups tend to be very good, and are very different from how they were in Leicester and in many other places some 30&nbsp;years ago, and still are today in many places. That is partly because the people of the city have been very sensible in the way they have worked together to understand and get to know each other. It is also because of the general legislative framework whereby promotion of racial hatred is against the law and clearly unacceptable. The legislation forbidding the promotion of racial hatred has not required many prosecutions, but it has provided a legal framework and enabled a culture in which the promotion of racial hatred is totally unacceptable. Of course, it is not only on the basis of matters of race that those who seek to promote hatred categorise others&#151;it is also, sadly, by religion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_231">The four in 10&nbsp;in my constituency may have some degree of protection if they are threatened by racial hatred, but it is different if that hatred is promoted purely on the basis of their religion. As other hon. Members have said, particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), there are two exceptions. If hatred is stirred against the one in 20&nbsp;of my constituents who are Sikh, they will protected, because Sikhism is covered by racial hatred legislation. Similarly, if the one in 100&nbsp;of my constituents who are Jewish find that hatred is being promoted against them, they too will find some protection because they happen to have an identification that is beyond racial and includes a religious identification. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said, the extension of the law preventing racial hatred has enabled them to get some degree of additional protection. Unlike my hon. Friend, however, I do not feel that that should be regretted as an extension of the existing legislation&#151;rather, that it should be extended to include other religious minorities.

<p><a name="st_256"><a name="50621-27_spnew3"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 What I actually said was that I was pleased about the extension to cover Jewish and Sikh people but that it had not been in the original legislation, and therefore as we pass legislation tonight there may be other unintended consequences as a result of case law being built on it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_257"><a name="50621-27_spnew4"><b> Sir Peter Soulsby: </b> 
 I entirely accept that that was my hon. Friend&#039;s point and that he was welcoming the extension; my argument is that it should be extended to other religious minorities, which is the purpose of the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_258"><a name="50621-27_spnew5"><b> Dr. Evan Harris: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that case law in cases regarding Sikhs and Jews recognises that the existing laws on incitement to racial hatred protected those groups because they are races as well as religions? Is he not making a good argument for extending the race hate laws to cover religions when the motive is racial hatred, which is what the so-called Lester amendment does?
</p>








<p><a name="st_259"><a name="50621-27_spnew6"><b> Sir Peter Soulsby: </b> 
 No; my point was that a significant proportion of my constituents and others identify themselves primarily by their religion, and that that identification that they have of themselves and that others have of them should be protected.
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="50621-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hendrick </b> 
: My hon. Friend makes a strong point, because race and religion are essential in terms of how people see their own personal identity. It is a shame that Opposition Members see religion almost as a lifestyle choice, not as something that is innate in somebody&#039;s identity.
</p>








<p><a name="st_261"><a name="50621-27_spnew8"><b> Sir Peter Soulsby: </b> 
 The fact is that the law preventing the promotion of hatred on the grounds of race deserves to be extended to those who suffer from the promotion of hatred on the grounds of their religion. Members of certain religions are not protected when, as they increasingly perceive to be the case, extremists promote hatred of them and of their friends, families and communities on the grounds of their religion. The Bill is not about giving special treatment to particular religions&#151;it clearly applies to all, and has indeed been extended to apply to those who have no religion. Nor is it about stifling criticism of other faiths, or, indeed, mocking them or making judgments about them. It is about giving the same protection to those who have hatred stirred up against them because of their religion as is already given to those who have hatred stirred them because of their race.

<a name="50621-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_232">In recent years, especially since the events of September 2001&nbsp;but also before that, ordinary, law-abiding, peaceful and productive citizens, who happened to be Muslim, have, with their families, felt themselves targeted and demonised.

<p><a name="st_264"><a name="50621-27_spnew11"><b> Mr. Edward Leigh  (Gainsborough) (Con):</b> 
 Earlier, I spoke to someone from the Christian Institute. Hon. Members will not be surprised by that, but I also spoke to a representative of the National Secular Society. I had an interesting conversation with them and the sincerity of both was transparent. Although they disagreed about everything else, those two gentlemen were profoundly worried about the Bill. Their professions are based on vigorous debate, yet they were worried because the measure is different from legislation on race.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_234">It is comparatively easy to define race hatred. As has been said, there have been few prosecutions under that measure. That is not surprising&#151;it has served its purpose. However, religions grow over hundreds of years on layer upon layer of prescription, faith and often strong statements. Therefore when we deal with a possible prosecution on the ground of an allegation of religious hatred, it is far more difficult to define and prove. The scope of the Bill is potentially far wider than legislation on race hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_235">All hon. Members are united in the view that we should bear down heavily on people who try to incite racial hatred. However, there is a strong division of opinion about the way in which we deal with people who have extremely strong religious views. In a moment, I shall refer to strong and violent statements in the Christian Holy Book. Before I sit down, I shall quote them. Some might take the view that those statements, however honest their proclamation, could lead, whatever the intention of the person making them, to an act of religious hatred. We are therefore in a difficult position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_236">I am trying to understand the Government&#039;s position. The trouble with such debates is that one often gets the impression that neither side is listening to the other. However, the intervention of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Ms Thornberry), who has unfortunately left, was interesting. She cited the case of a young girl who was wearing a veil and was insulted on the bus. She said that the case could not be prosecuted under existing legislation because the girl was white and the person insulting her was doing so not because of the colour of her skin but because she was wearing a veil. I am grateful for a private conversation with my close friend the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) on that. He pointed out that that person would have been caught under public order legislation. Thus many examples of harassment, violence and abuse, which those who support the Bill cite, are covered by existing legislation, which is widely drawn.

<a name="stpa_238">Perceptions are important. Our society, which is uniquely liberal, has been built up over 400&nbsp;or 500&nbsp;years of vigorous religious disputation. That disputation, which is healthy and often couched in strong language, defends liberty and democracy. If we repress that, we will build up resentment and perhaps make matters much worse. The Australian case of Pastor Scot has been mentioned. I was interested by the Home Secretary&#039;s defence. He said that it would not happen here because the Bill is more tightly drafted. However, the pastor in Australia was prosecuted under the religious hatred provisions in Australian law, which are similar to the Bill&#039;s. If Pastor Scot were to engage in those activities in this country once the Bill had become law, there is a real chance that a complaint would be made to the Attorney-General, at the very least.

I understand that there are evil people of bad intent who will use religious disputation to cover an act of racial hatred. Surely, however, the answer to that is that they will be caught by the Lester amendment, so why cannot we in this House unite around that amendment? After all, we all abhor people who behave in that way, and we all say that we do not want to limit strong religious discussion, so what is the harm in the Lester amendment?

Such leaflets, even if they were not already caught by the public order legislation that was used in that case, would be caught by the extension of the law on racial hatred to cover race hate going under the proxy of religious words.

I should have liked to hear a greater variety of views from over there. That uniformity might in part reflect the fact that the Conservative party, in its attenuated condition, has come to speak only for comfortable England.

How do we protect believers while maintaining the right to attack belief? That is the liberal dilemma with which we

I suspect that many of us here want to remedy a wrong, and to extend protection to those who say that they need it because of how things are now. Part of the liberal tradition wants always to protect minorities that need protection. Another part, however, says that we want always to guarantee the maximum ability of people to say what they want to say about anything. Indeed, our history over several centuries has been about establishing the integrity of that tradition. However, some of the exchanges that have taken place today might lead us to believe that the past 300&nbsp;years never took place.

It was precisely the belief that religious identity was the definition of identity that enabled us to slaughter each other quite merrily for a long time. We have now managed to liberate ourselves from that view of the human condition, and it is important that we hang on to the knowledge of what the liberal tradition is all about in this respect&#151;namely, that belief systems of all kinds have fundamentally to be matters of choice. Some people might come to regard them as matters of identity, but the point is that, in our tradition and society, with our history, we have made them matters of choice. That is what our liberal society is about. If we are now saying that we want to depart from that, I suggest that we shall cross a line that, on reflection, we would not want knowingly to cross.

 I oppose the Bill because I think it could amount to an almost mediaeval repression of free speech. I speak as a politician and a journalist who is accustomed to saying things that some people find inflammatory and offensive. I have been accused of offending whole cities in this country. I hope that that will prove to have been a chastening experience. I also hope that if I say anything inflammatory this evening, I will secure some protection from the fact that I am the first Member of Parliament for Henley whose paternal grandfather was a Muslim, or at least born a Muslim.

<a name="50621-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_252">It is hard to know where to begin my condemnation of the Bill, but I will begin with the motives behind it. We have heard that it is intended to combat the scourge of Islamophobia and the attacks on Muslims mentioned by Labour Members, which are said to have increased since 11&nbsp;September 2001. The problem was taken so seriously by the European Commission that it commissioned a report. It discovered that in the four months following 11&nbsp;September, there had been 12&nbsp;serious attacks on British Muslims. Of course that is 12&nbsp;attacks too many, but in the words of the excellent Asian-British journalist Kenan Malik, it does not in itself amount to a climate of vicious Islamophobia. According to the report&#039;s author, Chris Allen,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;there were very few serious attacks, and Islamophobia manifested itself in quite basic and low level ways&quot;</p>

<a name="50621-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_254">I do not want to minimise the problem, but I want the House to accept that we have come a long way since 1978, when violence against Asians was so alarming that 10,000&nbsp;Bengalis marched from Whitechapel to Whitehall to protest about the murder of Altab Ali near Brick lane. There were 49&nbsp;more such murders during the decade that followed. I believe that the problem of Islamophobia is in danger of being exaggerated, and that insofar as there is a real problem there is already plenty on the statute book to combat it.

<a name="stpa_255">Throughout the debate, Members in all parts of the House have asked Ministers to produce a single example of something that would be banned under the Bill. Not a single example has been given, apart from one very feeble one. I hope that I was able to deal with that by pointing out that the amendment of the Public Order Act 1986&nbsp;already prevents the commission of an offence of religious aggravation. There is already plenty of draconian stuff on the statute book.
</p>








<p><a name="st_280"><a name="50621-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Greg Hands  (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend may wish to consider a specific case. During the recent election campaign, a parliamentary candidate was attacked by a radical Islamic group, was decried for being a false prophet and was jostled and assaulted. That candidate is now the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway). Under the Bill, would the hon. Gentleman&#151;whom I do not understand to be of the Islamic faith, but who is very litigious&#151;be deemed to be a victim of incited religious hatred? Clearly that incident included hatred, religion and incitement. Would the hon. Gentleman be defended by the new law?
</p>








<p><a name="st_281"><a name="50621-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Johnson: </b> 
 It is obvious that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) already had plenty of protection under common law, if indeed he was jostled and attacked. The existing provisions are already draconian; why on earth are we producing a new Bill to outlaw incitement to religious hatred, thus eliding two notoriously foggy concepts, religion and hate, into a great cloud of muddle and misunderstanding? It has nothing to do with the needs of criminal justice and everything to do with politics, as Members throughout the House have already said. The Bill is the price that the country is paying in civil liberties for going to war in Iraq. It is of a piece with control orders and identity cards and is intended partly as a sop to communities that feel particularly oppressed by measures such as those. As the Solicitor-General recently wrote in <i>The Muslim News</i>, Muslims feel &quot;betrayed&quot; by the Iraq war. In the run-up to the last election, Labour decided that it needed to do something to appease those feelings. He went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;Iqbal Sacranie, general secretary of the Muslim council, asked Tony Blair to declare that the government would introduce a new law banning religious discrimination. Two weeks later, in his speech to the Labour party conference, Tony Blair promised that the next Labour government would ban religious discrimination. It was a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. victory for the Muslim Community in Britain.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_256">It was not a victory for common sense or free speech. It is not good enough to pretend, as Ministers do, that this is somehow the logical extension of laws against incitement to racial hatred. We have thrashed this out exhaustively in the Chamber today. It is obvious that there is a category difference between one&#039;s race, which is a question of nature, and one&#039;s religion, which is a matter of choice, conscience and belief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_257">If a religion is worth believing in, it ought to be strong enough to withstand the most scurrilous and monstrous attacks. If a religion is worth believing in, those assaults should diminish the critics and not the religion itself. Whether or not a religion is worth believing in, it is the sovereign right of every human being to say what exactly he or she thinks of it. No Labour Member has even begun properly to define a religion. One hon. Member stood up for the Jedi and said that he was a Jedi knight. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>No one was sure whether to take him seriously. There were embarrassed grins on the faces of Labour Members. How do they know that he is not in earnest when he says that he is a Jedi knight and that his faith deserves respect? If religion is a nebulous idea, so too is hatred.

Suppose I were to say in the security of the Chamber that I believe that some interpretations of Islam have a barbaric penal code and that the treatment of women in many parts of the Muslim world is shameful? Am I thereby inciting hatred of that religion, or extreme dislike? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) said, it depends entirely on the perception of the listener. This is the key point: in the post-Macpherson world, we all know that, in determining whether or not an offence has been committed, the police and the courts are bound to place ever more weight on the perceptions of those who take offence.

I invite the Minister to intervene, to help me out and to guide my faltering footsteps in this matter. I invite him to imagine that I am an imam or a mullah. I must apologise to any Muslims who may be listening or watching. I hope that it will be obvious that the quotations I am about to give are intended not in any way to be disrespectful to the holy Koran but to make a point about the logic, or absence of logic, of the Bill.

If this Bill is to make any sense at all, it must mean the banning of the reading of such things in public or in private, which is absurd and paradoxical, given that it is intended to be a protection against xenophobia.

In the last few years, the far right have cynically and deliberately been targeting British Muslims. &quot;Freedom&quot;, the British National party magazine, has explained the loophole to its readers. An article under the headline, &quot;Police drop a clanger&quot; said that a supporter who repeatedly displayed a copy of an &quot;Islam out of Britain&quot; poster in his window was arrested, questioned and charged with &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot;.

<a name="50621-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_275">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) advanced the second objection&#151;that the Bill will restrict freedom of speech. The idea that we have complete and unrestricted freedom of speech is nonsense. Article 10&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights&#151;the article that deals with free speech&#151;also talks about the &quot;rights and responsibilities&quot; that go with free speech in civil society. Free speech has a number of restrictions to ensure the smooth running of society. Examples where such restrictions apply include pornography, intellectual property, race hatred, defamation and national security issues. If Voltaire were inciting hatred on grounds of race, I would not fight to the death to defend his right to say that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_276">The fact that the new offence will not be in breach of our article 10&nbsp;obligations is confirmed by the support for the proposals of such groups as the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Law Society, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, Justice&#151;the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) was wrong to say that Justice opposes the Bill; it supports it&#151;and the UN Human Rights Committee. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 737</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, what many international human rights organisations say is that by failing to protect our most vulnerable citizens, we are in breach of our obligations as a State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_277">The third objection is that this is a sop to the Muslim community, giving them preferential treatment because of the Iraq war. I heard a new one today; apparently, it is blasphemy law for Islam by the back door. Well, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) said earlier, the first time the then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) tried to introduce this legislation was in winter 2001&#151;more than a year before the war with Iraq&#151;so I am afraid that the chronology of those who make that point is simply wrong. If British Muslims really were as powerful and influential as the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) suggests, one would have thought that they could have persuaded the Government not to fight the Iraq war in the first place.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_278">Not only the Government and Labour Members believe in equality before the law for all of our communities. The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Church of England, the Catholic bishops of England and Wales, the Hindu Council UK, the network of Sikh organisations, the CRE and other organisations all support the Bill. They are hardly a bunch of Muslim fundamentalists looking for preferential treatment or special favours, or seeking a new blasphemy law for Muslims by the back door.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_279">The fourth point that has been made is that the Bill will lead to unemployment&#151;of comedians, artists and theologians&#151;and possibly to their prosecution. That is just humbug. The new law will not stop anyone offending, criticising, ridiculing or taking the p*** out of faiths. Police vans will not wait outside comedy clubs, and censors will not go through everything that is said, written or done. Nobody wants to stop our irreverent sense of humour flourishing. The bigots are the only ones who have anything to fear from the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_280">The Bill is about protecting people from hatred, and not about protecting faiths from criticism. That goal is entirely in keeping with Britain&#039;s unique record of religious and racial tolerance. A society should be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable members. A loophole that allows religious hatred to be propagated must finally be closed. This Bill closes that loophole, and I urge the House to support it.

 The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) made at least two very important points in his powerful speech. He said that we need to recognise that there are issues in society that must be dealt with. He also said that some communities rightly feel under pressure and that something has to be done to help them. Neither I nor my Liberal Democrat colleagues believe that the choice is between this Bill and doing nothing. We recognise that it must be made absolutely clear that the people described by the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik) as racists and members of the extreme right cannot hide behind religious words, language and descriptions to escape prosecution under the race hate laws. I wanted to make that point during the hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech, but he would not allow me to intervene.

<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 738</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_281">Liberal Democrat Members believe&#151;as do Conservative Members and, as the outcome of many votes show, a lot of Labour Members&#151;that the best way to make matters completely clear is to extend existing laws against incitement to racial hatred. That would cover the activities of the extreme right and the BNP when they use religious words as a proxy for inciting racial hatred. Nothing that those people do is theological. They are not making theological points when they attack Muslims or Hindus: they are making thinly veiled racist points. If such actions are not covered by the existing legislation, extending that legislation in statute will make matters clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_282">It is also important to recognise that incitement to violence is already an offence, as are direct assaults and vandalism, and that all those offences can be religiously exacerbated. Moreover, direct insults, abuse and threats are already criminal offences under the public order or harassment legislation. No law change is needed to cover that behaviour, but three hon. Members who support the Government have said that such a change must be implemented. The hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) spoke about a person being spat on or abused. That is already an offence, and since 2001&nbsp;it is capable of attracting a steeper sentence if it is considered to be religiously aggravated. That is an example of the type of Aunt Sally that is put up as an argument in favour of changing the law, even though it is not true.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">The hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick) adopted that approach. He is not in the Chamber, but I see the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Ms Thornberry) sitting on the Cross Benches. She said that people had been vilified for wearing headscarves, but that is already a public order offence, at the very least, and it can be religiously exacerbated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) made a similar point in his article in <i>The Guardian</i> on 18&nbsp;June, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;Mothers collecting children from school have been abused and assaulted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Homes have been stoned and fire-bombed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

</ul>
<p>

<a name="50621-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">Again, those are poor examples because those acts are most definitely covered by existing law.

<a name="50621-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_286">Indeed, even the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), is liable to fall into that trap. In an interview on the &quot;PM&quot; programme broadcast on 9&nbsp;June, in response to the presenter saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;You&#039;re saying at the moment that Muslims at the moment are not protected from incitement to violence and harassment&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">That is true because they do not need to be protected on the basis of their religious belief because they are protected by the fact that incitement to violence and harassment are already criminal offences, some of which can be religiously exacerbated. However, such things are offences even without religion exacerbation. The argument that the Bill is needed to close some loopholes has been overstated to say the least. The argument is not about direct threats, direct insults or violence; they are already illegal.

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_289">Freedom of speech and expression are precious, and the freedom to dispute, even in strong terms, is a necessary part of such freedom. The Bill lacks certainty. That shows the problem of the chilling effect. People may want to self-censor or be censored by those who would otherwise want to hear their arguments, publish their books, print their articles or stage their plays. The Bill lacks clarity, as we have heard, because which religions are covered, what is the threshold for hatred and what is hatred are also not clear and are not defined&#151;and, of course, intention is not a requirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_290">Again, there are further examples of people&#039;s doubts. Indeed, the Minister was asked in the same interview whether someone would be allowed to say, &quot;I hate Muslims&quot;, or &quot;We hate Muslims.&quot; He first said no. He then said, &quot;Maybe&quot; and that it would be up to the courts, not politicians, to decide. I have the transcript here. The point is that he says that the decision should not be for politicians, but we as politicians making law in Parliament have a duty to provide citizens with certainty. I have never had an answer to the question about whether I can say, when a group of fundamentalist Christians, for example, are vilifying another group&#151;for example, homosexuals&#151;that we should hate those Christian bigots. Could I say that freely outside the Chamber if this law were in place?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_291">The Minister often makes light of comedians&#151;specifically, Rowan Atkinson&#151;but those of us who have had an opportunity to hear him speak know that he talks about the freedom for him to make religious jokes. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;The Government claim that one would be allowed to say what you like about beliefs because the measure is not intended to defend beliefs but believers. But I don&#039;t see how you can distinguish between them. Beliefs are only invested with life and meaning by believers.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_292">There may be answers to that point, but I hope that the Minister will recognise that the points made by the creative community are relevant and need to be tackled, without simply being dismissed as coming from those in the entertainment industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_293">I believe that the Bill has massively raised expectations among those in the Muslim community, many of whom think that it will provide them with a blasphemy law or that it covers incitement to violence, which they believe is not currently covered. Even some hon. Members tend to have those views. As is well known, during the debate on the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) asked whether &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; would be covered, and said that at that time that

<p>
<a name="50621-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_297">The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), who is not in the Chamber, gave a hypothetical example to show that Muslims would not be protected by the current race hate laws against someone saying, &quot;Muslims out&quot; or &quot;No Muslims wanted here&quot;. Many experts doubt that claim; indeed, a member of the British National party was arrested recently under the race hate laws. However, even if the situation described by the right hon. Gentleman was not covered at present, the Lester amendment would certainly deal with it. That would also apply to his other examples, where some Semites were protected while others were not. It can be made clear that people who are actually attacked racially but on the notional basis of their religion are entitled to protection&#151;they would be covered by the amendment&#039;s extension to the law. The BNP is not making a theological point, but a racist one.
</p>

<a name="50621-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_298">If the Government want to reassure people such as me and the hon.

They are discriminatory and have a chilling effect on free speech. Everyone knows where the Church of England stands; it gave evidence to the Select Committee on Religious Offences. It is time to repeal those laws and the Government&#039;s failure to do so makes many of us doubt their motives and whether they really care about free speech.

 I am a bit surprised by the uniform opposition to the Bill from the Conservative Benches, because during the recent election campaign one of their parliamentary candidates was deselected for having made anti-Catholic comments. There is obviously a procedure to deal with people in the Conservative party who make anti-religious comments, yet the Conservatives do not want to extend it to the rest of the country.

It burns my soul when I see, or recall, war documentaries showing Nazi leaders spitting out hatred of &quot;der Juden&quot; as being to blame for all the ills of the world. That set up the conditions for the Holocaust. In more recent times, incitement to hatred has been instrumental in killings in

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Balkans and Rwanda&#151;tribal in the latter. However, there was a religious aspect to the murders in the Balkans&#151;the Muslim communities, in particular, were deemed to have fewer rights, to be less than human, and thus to be disposed of more easily.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_301">There was clearly an element of religious hatred behind the recent despicable desecration of the Jewish cemetery in West Ham. In the UK, however, incitement to hatred mostly applies in racial assaults. Some of the culprits, although they would not fall foul of any present or proposed law, are national newspapers that repeatedly refer to asylum seekers so unsympathetically and negatively that the words are turned into a term of abuse. As a result, the number of racist incidents in England and Wales&#151;from verbal abuse to vicious assaults&#151;has risen in recent years from 48,000&nbsp;in 2000&nbsp;to 52,700&nbsp;in 2004. Those figures include some despicable murders. We have reached the point where Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said in March:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;Today Jews, Muslims and gypsies tell the CRE that they are under siege in Britain.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_302">In the face of that, the present law against racial violence and hatred needs to be implemented more effectively. No one in their right mind would say that the law is not necessary; clearly, it is. There is a religious hatred element to the violence, and there is certainly huge potential to spread hatred based on religion against Muslims especially, but also against Jews and people of other faiths.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_303">There is an institutional aspect to Islamophobia because it can arise from fear generated by the war on terror, which some deliberately misinterpret as a war on Muslims. The violence inflicted on innocent Muslim citizens on the streets and in neighbourhoods is the ugly personal face of Islamophobia. Hatred is propagated by the British National party, those associated with it and others with similar ugly attitudes. They want incitement to hatred to be converted into violence against Muslims or Jews.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_304">There is currently a loophole in our law because although racial hatred is covered by it, religious hatred is not. Jews and Sikhs are covered by existing laws on the incitement to racial hatred because the courts deemed that they had a distinct ethnic origin, but Christians, Muslims and Hindus are not covered by the current interpretation of the law. The Bill will end that anomaly. Labour made it clear that it would enact the Bill in its recent election manifesto, which said:


</p>

It will not criminalise someone urging followers of a different religion to cease practising their religion and perhaps to convert. It will not criminalise someone telling jokes about religion. It will not criminalise someone expressing antipathy or a dislike of a particular religion.

 First, I commend the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) on his heartfelt address. However, I disagreed

<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 744</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with almost every word of it, because this is a bad and dangerous piece of legislation, which has the scope to limit and undermine our freedom of expression. It will create greater tensions in our communities, and it will be counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_312">Part of the problem stems from the fact that the Bill is born of the Government&#039;s misconception about race and religion in relation to freedom of speech. We have discussed that at length but, surprisingly, some Government Members do not understand that religion is fundamentally a matter of choice, and should not be included in legislation relating to race, which is a matter of birth. In a liberal democracy, it is clearly outrageous to criticise or hate someone on account of something over which they do not have any control or choice such as race. The Bill, however, raises the prospect that argument and disagreement over religion, about which people do have a choice, may be regarded as inciting religious hatred. That is nonsense, and it is clearly wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_313">The Government claim that the Bill is not intended to criminalise religious debate. However, given its poor wording, there can be no guarantee about that. Religious hatred is not properly defined, so a great deal of interpretation will be subjective. For example, the new offence does not include a definition of religion, so if a journalist writes an article in which he claims that Satanists are an evil cult, the Satanists can report him to the police, claiming that he is inciting religious hatred against them. Given that the Government have not been able to produce a single clear instance of the way in which the Bill would apply, there is no reason to suggest that my example would not be caught by the Bill. After all, it is intuitive to hate that which is considered evil.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_314">I am particularly concerned about the new test for both racial and religious incitement, as discussed in the explanatory notes to the Bill. I pressed the Home Secretary on that issue, because it is of fundamental importance, and I should be grateful for a response during the winding-up speeches. The explanatory notes say that for material likely to stir up racial or religious hatred


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;it need only be shown that it was likely to be seen or heard by a person in whom it is likely to stir up racial or religious hatred.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_315">The Bill appears to suggest that the accused is responsible for the unintended and unforeseen reactions to their comments by people who could be bigoted and hate-filled. That is dangerous ground. In principle, the Bill could privilege the interpretations of the most ignorant people in our society at the expense of the meaning intended by the accused. That is wrong, and it will limit free speech. Furthermore, the legislation will create a fear of prosecution, as individuals must consider whether their remarks could be misconstrued by others. Such self-censorship will further erode our culture of freedom.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_316">The Government are trying to calm fears by saying that there will be few prosecutions and that the Attorney-General will have a veto on cases that are brought. In a free society, it is wholly unacceptable to

<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 745</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pass into law something that is intellectually flawed purely in the hope that, as they promised, the Government will not abuse their powers. It is precisely because Governments generally cannot be trusted not to abuse their powers that Parliament exists to protect individual rights and freedoms. That is why we are here, and it is a key part of our job. We should not rely on the Government to take on this particular role, as we would be wandering into uncharted and dangerous waters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_317">But what makes this legislation even more of a nonsense is that it is not needed. Time and time again, Government Members have given examples of cases that were thought to require the protection offered by the Bill but which, in fact, did not need it. We already have laws prohibiting discrimination, intimidation and incitement to violence. In short, protection already exists for everyone, regardless of their religion.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_318">In 2001&nbsp;Parliament passed new laws creating religiously aggravated offences, which provide additional safeguards. The aim of these is to introduce tougher penalties where a crime has been committed. Case history has shown that displaying a poster with the words &quot;Islam out of Britain&#151;protect the British public&quot; is already illegal under existing law, so it is questionable what additional protection could be provided by a law against incitement to hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_319">The Government&#039;s instinct is always to create new wide-ranging laws, rather than enforcing existing ones. Proper enforcement of our existing laws would make the new offence unnecessary. So why is the Bill being introduced? I wish the hon. Member who made the comment earlier was present. I can only draw the conclusion that this dangerous and unnecessary legislation is being introduced by the Government as a sop to the Muslim community for having misled the country and instigated an illegal war in Iraq. It is posturing of the worst kind, for there can be no doubt that the claims concerning weapons of mass destruction were nothing but a fig leaf to justify a war that should not have been fought. A large part of the Muslim community has lost faith in Labour, and the Government are cynically trying to make amends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_320">As regards the time scale, I do accept the point that the legislation was introduced shortly after 9/11, but I also contend that the decision to go to war was made in certain select circles soon after 9/11&nbsp;as well, and it is no co-incidence that the Government promoted the legislation during the election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_321">Meanwhile, there is a real danger that the Bill will be used by some religious groups to seek to prosecute other religious groups, which could corrode community relations rather than improve them. As the Islamic Human Rights Commission in July last year stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;Rather than enjoying additional protection from the law, religious minorities could find themselves the targets of prosecutions under the proposed legislation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_322">In this regard the comments of India&#039;s well respected Attorney-General are worth considering. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">&quot;Experience shows that criminal laws prohibiting free speech and expression will encourage intolerance, divisiveness and unreasonable interference with free speech and expression. . . That is what is increasingly happening today in India.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_323">There is a danger that high-profile prosecutions could give extremists greater publicity. No Member of the House would want that to happen in this country. There is a better way forward than introducing repressive

<br>&nbsp;<br>laws&#151;that is, to encourage freedom of speech. Moral force is more effective than legal force, and for that we need freedom of speech. By banning certain remarks or gestures, we admit that we are scared of them. Indeed, by adopting such an approach we risk becoming complacent about our own reasons for disagreeing with the people who promote those ideas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_324">The Bill is the easy but ineffective option. It is a foolish knee-jerk reaction to deep-seated social problems. We do not need tighter or more combative laws in this area, but instead more freedom of speech and expression in order to promote the greater understanding and tolerance needed to defeat the bigotry and hatred that exists in corners of our society. That brings me back to where I started&#151;freedom of speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_325">The Bill is bad legislation for a number of reasons. It is vague and ill defined. It allows the state to adjudicate on people&#039;s religious beliefs. It is unnecessary in that sufficient protection for individuals or religious groups already exists. It threatens to be divisive and create greater tension between religious communities. Worst of all, the Bill threatens to curtail our freedom of speech, as ordinary religious debate could be criminalised. In my view that represents further salami-slicing of our individual freedoms, which unfortunately has been the hallmark of the Government since they came to power. Attempting to limit the right to trial by jury while introducing control orders are recent examples. The Bill is yet another example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_326">Freedom of speech is essential for the defence of our core values and for society to move forward, embrace new ideas and challenge the established views. It is Parliament&#039;s duty to protect our freedom of speech against an increasingly powerful Executive. Parliament cannot and must not fail in that duty, otherwise we as a society risk progress and our own advancement. I&nbsp;therefore urge the House to vote against the Bill.

 The debate has been interesting, although I wonder whether the hyperbole advanced by Conservative Members has hindered their making some good points.

<a name="50621-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_327">The Bill is primarily about rectifying an anomaly that has led to an inequity in the present legal situation, namely that some groups are protected in law and others are not, which is an argument that we have rehearsed this afternoon. In my experience, protection is not afforded to not only Muslims, but many Catholics. Anti-Catholicism is as virulent now in many parts of the country and in some public discourse as it was four centuries ago. Although we have understandably focused on the Islamophobia that we face in this country, the treatment of Catholicism is also an issue, which is not to say that we should therefore protect either the Catholic faith or Islam.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_328">This afternoon, many hon. Members have argued that the best way to defend the God in whom one believes is to argue, and to argue forcibly. In the 1970s, J. B. Phillips wrote a particularly fine book called &quot;Your God is too small&quot;, which made it clear how it is sometimes better to argue God&#039;s corner rather than protecting him through laws.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>perhaps even established by law, and the vast majority of people who face religious hatred on a daily basis are Muslims. The Bill may not be used after it has received Royal Assent. I hope that it will not be used, because by the very virtue of bringing it into law, we will have made a declaration that religious hatred is a problem in modern society and that we want to row back from it. We do not want to pour yet more water into that pool of religious hatred.

<a name="stpa_354">The Government also claim that it is individuals who will be protected, not religions themselves. However, that rebuttal is contrary to the spirit of other legislation on racial hatred, which protects both the person and their race. Might there not be undue pressure on the Attorney-General, when seeking to protect people from religious hatred, to protect the religions themselves, thereby hindering free speech?

<a name="stpa_355">Of course, Muslims, Christians and those of other faiths and beliefs&#151;and those who have none&#151;should be protected against violence and intimidation, but public order legislation already exists to deal with those issues, despite the denial of that fact by those on the Government Front Bench, and indeed by some Members on the other Opposition Benches. We have seen the extension of provisions dealing with &quot;racially aggravated&quot; crimes to cover &quot;racially or religiously aggravated&quot; offences. In short, there are enough laws and provisions dealing with this issue already.

Where religious hatred exists, it is usually the result of a lack of education, and a lack of understanding and awareness of the beliefs, traditions and world view of a religion. Interestingly, the Islamic Human Rights Commission has said of the Bill that

<a name="stpa_359">The Government&#039;s aim of seeking to create equal rights is a noble one, but they need to tread carefully to ensure that they do not create special rights. In adopting the worthy goal of promoting inclusivity, they should avoid promoting a new, narrow type of exclusivity. The Bill will mute individuals, and will give the courts an air of inquisition. Moreover, I have never known an Act of Parliament to create love, and perhaps that is the only antidote to the hatred of which we have heard today.

<a name="stpa_364">My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) pointed out that the Public Order Act 1986, as currently applied, is already having a powerful effect in curbing and setting limits to religious discourse. Street preachers are now routinely being hauled in, whether in my right hon. Friend&#039;s constituency or mine, on the basis that what they are saying in the street might be insulting to those on the receiving end&#151;even when what they are saying is no more than that someone will go to hell if that person does not share their view. I do not want to become involved in that particular debate, but I will make one point, because it is immensely important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_365">If we are talking of setting limits on what might formerly have been thought to be very important freedoms, the Public Order Act as it stands&#151;along with the religiously aggravated nature of offences&#151;is going a long way towards doing that. Some of what is being done even causes me some disquiet. I do not want the Act to be changed, but I think that the House should bear that in mind. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made similar points.

<a name="50621-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_366">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr.&nbsp;Allen) made a powerful speech against the Bill. I can answer one of his points immediately. As the law stands, and as we have made it in the last 12&nbsp;months, anyone can carry out a citizen&#039;s arrest of anyone on the basis of suspicion that that person has committed any offence. I ask the House to reflect on how that will operate under the Bill. It will be open to anyone to arrest any person whom he considers to fall foul of the legislation that we are about to pass. That will apply irrespective of whether the Attorney-General subsequently decides to bring a prosecution. The fact that the Bill is so widely drawn must mean that people will&#151;technically, or at least allegedly&#151;frequently commit offences. There will not even be the mechanism of redress for wrongful arrest because, even if the Attorney-General decides not to prosecute, it will not be capable of being argued that the arrest was wrongful. We will undoubtedly have to return to that issue in Committee, but it was a powerful point, well made. It highlights what I think are the absurdities underlying the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) rightly said, the Government do not understand their own Bill and that precisely illustrates the point.

<a name="stpa_371">Intense dislike is all that the word &quot;hatred&quot; means, yet in the debate we have heard again and again people say that hatred is tantamount to carrying out an assault or violence on an individual. Incitement to violence is already well covered by the criminal law. The dictionary definition of hatred, the only definition, is &quot;intense dislike&quot;, so the House needs to ponder the question: why should people not have the right to intensely dislike the beliefs of others? The point was well made. One cannot divorce the belief&#151;this was the point made by Rowan Atkinson&#151;from the believer. How are we going to deal with those circumstances to create legislation that is workable? The Minister and the Government have provided no answer whatsoever to that question.

<a name="50621-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_372">We will attempt to look at this issue in Committee, but on the face of it, religion is a matter of personal belief and conscience.

I accept that, but it could equally well be said that many of us are born into our political beliefs as well. However, I have never heard it suggested that as a result of our being so born, those political beliefs should not be open to the criticism and censure in which we routinely engage in and outside this House.

The amendment to the 1986&nbsp;Act, quite apart from the wording of the Act itself, introduces the concept that one may commit this offence without intent, simply because

It was deliberately made wide in race relations legislation because there can be no grounds for insulting somebody on the basis of their race.

That is not a basis, Mr. Speaker, on which the House should legislate. In fact, it is offensive to law-abiding people in this country, leaving them in a state of uncertainty and creating the very climate in which demands will be made for the unjustified prosecution of individuals.

Thirdly, there is compelling evidence&#151;including evidence given to Parliament by the police&#151;that identification of communities purely along racial lines is no longer adequate. Some extremists exploit that to incite hatred against groups and individuals with impunity.

<a name="stpa_392">The first point had to do with what the prosecution would have to prove. Every Opposition Member who spoke raised that point, but I do not think that any of them had a full grasp of the effects of the proposals. To prove incitement, a person has to be shown to have used threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and that, having regard to all the circumstances, the words, behaviour or material are likely to be seen by any person in whom they are likely to stir up religious hatred. All the Opposition Members who spoke mentioned that, but section 18(5) of the Public Order Act 1986&nbsp;states that the defendant must have intended his words or behaviour to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or was aware that his words or behaviour might be threatening, abusive or insulting. That is a very important point. It shows that intention must be proved, as must the use of words and behaviour to that end. The mental element must therefore be present in both limbs of the offence.

Members on both sides of the House will have seen the kind of vile material that could be used to incite hatred on the grounds of religious belief; but, of course, proving such incitement requires a knowledge of the context in which that material was used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_394">It is true that such material might be captured by the religiously aggravated offences that we have created in recent years&#151;it could be captured by the offences of incitement to hatred, to violence or even to murder&#151;but we have judged that there is a gap between the aggravated offences and incitement to violence and hatred. Where people incite hatred, there is a gap that parallels incitement to hatred on the grounds of race, and we believe that that gap needs to be filled. So there is no perfect example that I can give to the right hon. Gentleman.

 Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way. May I say that the private conversation in the Chamber is absolutely deplorable. The Minister is entitled to respond to the debate, and he should be given a hearing.

 Those with strong views about certain beliefs will still be able to speak out. It will still be possible to criticise the beliefs, teachings or practices of a religion, or to claim that they are false or harmful. People will still be free to proselytise or to urge the followers of a different religion to cease to practice theirs. Even if their comments are intended or likely to

<a name="stpa_395">In line with the assurances given by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary earlier, I assure my hon.

<a name="50621-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_396">It is also worth reminding the House, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting did earlier, that in commenting on the offence that we propose to establish in March this year, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">&quot;We accept the existence of a serious, albeit limited, problem of incitement to hatred on religious grounds. We consider that the measures proposed in the Bill are unlikely to give rise to any violation of the right to freedom of expression under article 10&nbsp;of the ECHR&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_397">It is true that we do not expect there to be a huge number of prosecutions. In nearly 20&nbsp;years, there have been only 76&nbsp;prosecutions for inciting racial hatred, 44&nbsp;of which resulted in a conviction. However, we expect that the new offence will have a desirable deterrent effect. The Board of Deputies of British Jews holds the strong view that the incitement to racial hatred offence has reduced the spread of anti-Semitic literature, and we expect that the new offence will stop extreme groups and individuals from using religious belief to stir up hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_398">The debate has been good and genuine. I accept that the measures are controversial but we shall debate them further in Committee in an open-handed way, and we shall no doubt bring the Bill back in an improved form. It is an important Bill, and I commend it to the House.

<p><a name="st_350"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Gillian Merron]</i></p>








<a name="time_25">
<a name="50621-41_time0"><h5>10.42&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_351"><a name="50621-41_spnew0"><b> Anne Snelgrove  (South Swindon) (Lab):</b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise in this Adjournment debate education issues that are of great concern to my constituents in west Swindon. The big issue for primary education in that area is surplus places and the need to demonstrate that action is being taken to reduce them. That there is a problem of surplus places is not in dispute; parents, teachers and the local authority accept the fact. There is, however, a dispute over how much of a problem exists and what action should be taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_404">Swindon borough council is a small unitary authority with responsibility for education. Recently, the local education authority received the good news that it was no longer in special measures, and that there were no schools in special measures in the authority. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the LEA, its officers and the schools and teachers on that achievement. It represents a significant step forward and will undoubtedly mean better education and life chances for all the children in Swindon, including those in west Swindon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_405">Reorganisation of schools is always difficult. I have personal experience of this in my previous career as a local education adviser, and in my political career as vice-chair of Berkshire&#039;s education committee in the 1990s. While I was a chair of governors, I oversaw the successful merger of an infants school and a junior school into a primary school. That was difficult to achieve, even with the support of the staff of both schools and of the majority of parents, with several issues continuing to resonate 18&nbsp;months later at the new primary school&#039;s Ofsted inspection. All this experience has led me to the understanding that school reorganisation can destabilise even seemingly robust school communities. In more fragile communities, it can be a disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_406">My experience has also led me to believe that a number of principles need to be in place for successful reorganisations to occur. First, the educational reasons must be absolutely sound and honest for the current intake of children, and for future intakes. Secondly, the figures must add up, and must command the confidence of the wider community. Thirdly, there must be no hidden agenda on anyone&#039;s part, including that of local councillors, and nothing should be said or done to encourage the belief that there is. Fourthly, the confidence of the majority of parents must be maintained throughout the process and consultation must begin at an early stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_407">TeacherNet, the widely respected Department for Education and Skills website for teachers and education providers, outlines best practice in reorganisations. A successful primary school reorganisation involves a number of factors, it says. First, the ground should be prepared and a set of guiding principles should be developed to underpin the approach, covering preferred size of schools, maximum travelling time of pupils, triggers for school review based on admission numbers, and criteria for demanding action at one school rather 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 773</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>than another. Secondly, options should be identified and all the options should be examined before decisions are made. They might include a reduction in accommodation, alternative uses of accommodation such as extended services, changes in admission numbers, and amalgamation or closure. Lastly, partners should be involved. Key partners include parents, housing departments and trusts, planning and environment, transport, dioceses and many other groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_408">TeacherNet makes clear that local education authorities should


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89">&quot;anticipate and respond to parents&#039; concerns about the options being proposed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_409">As I shall demonstrate, I am not convinced that those principles were followed in the west Swindon reorganisation for all the schools involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_410">The west Swindon consultation involved several public meetings, six of which I attended. My experience of the meetings did not fill me with confidence that the consultation was being conducted in an unbiased and open way. At two of the meetings, local Conservative councillors reassured parents that the school where the meeting was being held would be &quot;all right&quot; and that they had nothing to worry about. As these were public meetings, there were parents present from other schools who did not receive the same assurance at the public meeting on their school site. Naturally, that did not fill my constituents with confidence, and word quickly spread throughout the community that it was a paper exercise and councillors had already made up their minds about which schools would close.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_411">The outcome of the consultation was that one school, Salt Way, was earmarked for closure from January 2006&nbsp;and further discussions were to be held about three others, Toothill, Freshbrook and Windmill Hill. The decision on Salt Way was leaked to the local paper, so parents and teachers discovered that the school was likely to close during the Easter holiday break. That is not a good way to find out about the future of one&#039;s child&#039;s education or one&#039;s job. At Salt Way, most of the permanent staff have understandably found other jobs and will be leaving at the end of this term. I gather from discussions last week with the director of education that only two permanent members of the teaching staff remain, one of whom is on long-term sick leave. It has also become apparent that the closure of the school by January 2006&nbsp;looks unachievable because there are no places in nearby primary schools for most of the children who currently attend Salt Way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_412">The current solution is to bring in teachers from other schools on secondments to teach the children. The process has resulted in plummeting staff morale, disruption to children&#039;s education and a question mark over when and if the school will close. Only tonight I was told by one of the parents that the LEA had announced at a meeting this afternoon that the school would close in August 2006&nbsp;and that an extension would be built at Shaw Ridge school to take the extra pupils. There has been no exploration with parents of the alternatives to closure. On behalf of my constituents, I am genuinely disappointed by the high-handedness of the approach and sad that I learned about it through a parent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_413">The school has been left dangling, and as its representative I must do all that I can to ensure that the children&#039;s education is protected. I ask the Minister to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 774</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>look into the issue for me as it has ramifications for the other three schools whose future is also under discussion. The situation must not be allowed to happen twice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_414">I hope that, from my description, the Minister will understand my concern about the robustness of the surplus place figures used by Swindon LEA. To announce a school closure consultation and then discover that there are not enough places for the existing children to go to is not best practice, and I ask the Minister to examine the figures that have been produced. One of the difficulties may lie in the net capacity figures. Over the years, temporary classrooms have been added to west Swindon schools to accommodate expanding pupil numbers. They contribute to the net capacity figures, but many of the classrooms are past their sell-by date and could easily be taken out of commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para11">
<a name="stpa_415">In addition, many schools, including Salt Way, have done what the local education authority and the Department for Education and Skills asked of them&#151;converted surplus classes to IT suites, pre-school groups, libraries and parent and community rooms. All those are needed, particularly in our more deprived wards, and all are good practice, but it strikes me and the schools as unfair that those spaces are then used to calculate how many children a school could and should accommodate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para12">
<a name="stpa_416">The reality is that the schools cannot take up to the pupil numbers required by the DFES calculations. The situation that the Salt Way pupils are in demonstrates that. In theory, there should be room in neighbouring schools&#151;after all, the figures demonstrate that&#151;but in practice there is not because the spaces are not classrooms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para13">
<a name="stpa_417">Moving on to the other schools under threat of closure, I will first refer to Toothill. Toothill is the most deprived ward in west Swindon and Toothill school serves that community. It has the third highest proportion of children in the borough with English as an additional language. Its unit for children with moderate learning difficulties has been integrated successfully into the main stream. It has a successful buddy mentoring scheme that has reduced bullying and made the playground a good place to be for all children. There are strong links between the school and the local community, with the school seen as the centre for community activities, including the west Swindon family centre. TeacherNet advises that local authorities should investigate the impact of the loss of such an institution on communities, but there was no mention of that in the consultation. I wish to be reassured that the LEA has considered that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para14">
<a name="stpa_418">The local community in Toothill feels under attack because of the threat to the school. From my own knowledge of the area, I believe that significant numbers of vulnerable children would be at risk if the school were to close or to merge on another site. Because of the design of the estate, it would mean a difficult journey to reach another school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para15">
<a name="stpa_419">The school governors and parents have worked with the LEA throughout the consultation and are aware of the falling rolls issue. They have a number of old and decrepit temporary buildings that could be taken out of commission, reducing the space, but they also have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 775</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accommodation problems in their main building and desperately need a new school building. They tell me that they are &quot;up for anything&quot; in terms of the Government&#039;s extended schools and child first policy initiatives. I hope that Swindon borough council will be able to work proactively with the school to ensure its continued future in serving a vulnerable community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para16">
<a name="stpa_420">Now I come to the most difficult aspect of the whole reorganisation. I do not envy the LEA&#039;s task as Freshbrook and Windmill Hill schools are round the corner from each other, yet face very different issues and, despite being neighbours, serve very different communities. Freshbrook&#039;s rolls have fallen, while Windmill Hill&#039;s are robust and show no surplus places. In fact, the school is slightly over-subscribed and parents are passionate in their support of the school, as was demonstrated in the large numbers of Windmill Hill parents&#039; responses to the consultation, but the school is in temporary premises and was built when pupil numbers on the Freshbrook estate exceeded those planned. When I say &quot;temporary premises&quot;, those are the Rolls-Royce of temporary classrooms, having been lovingly maintained and improved over the years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para17">
<a name="stpa_421">Freshbrook school has recently come out of special measures, on which I congratulate the head teacher and staff. However, a significant number of parents removed their children from Freshbrook during its recent difficulties and placed them in Windmill Hill. Therefore, we immediately have a problem in that those parents&#039; memories of Freshbrook are of a school where their children failed. Fair or unfair, that is the situation. Suggestions by the local authority to close Windmill Hill, an over-subscribed school that has been successful for many years, or to merge it with Freshbrook, a newly successful school, have been met with great fear by the parents. There is such a feeling against those options that the LEA needs to reconsider them and meet its obligations to consult parents in detail on the proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para18">
<a name="stpa_422">Another solution must be found. DFES guidance suggests alternative avenues for reorganisation such as federation, collaboration and co-operation. The main rationale of those is to raise standards and to address some of the problems of falling rolls, but under them a school maintains its separate identity. A wide variety of different arrangements for schools working together are available and it is right to ask whether all the options were considered by the council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para19">
<a name="stpa_423">There are two other issues that I ask the Minister to consider. Throughout the consultation, parents were presented with arguments that Government policy is for two-form entry schools. I can find no reference to that anywhere. In fact, the DFES position is that the responsibility lies with local government. DFES guidance says that primary schools of about 420&nbsp;pupils, which are two-form entry, or of 210&nbsp;pupils, which are one-form entry, are the most efficient and offer a critical mass that promotes more efficient teaching and learning. I hope that the Minister will agree that one-form entry schools offer choice for parents and should be encouraged. One size does not fit all and we need a diverse mix in Swindon. Keeping one-form entry schools could remove the need to close schools.

<a name="stpa_424">Parents were also told that the Government&#039;s extended schools initiative means that some schools in west Swindon need to close. I hope that the Minister will tell me and parents that this is stuff and nonsense. My postbag has been full of letters from concerned parents who think that one of our flagship proposals will lead to the closure of their school. An email that I received from a parent at the weekend stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90">&quot;My concerns are around the need to close successful schools in order to raise the necessary funding to build new extended schools. I don&#039;t believe this was the intention behind the government&#039;s proposals. If insufficient funding has been made available to the council for implementing extended schools without these drastic measures then I don&#039;t support their implementation. Otherwise the council is using the extended school proposals as a way of closing schools for economic reasons.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_425">Some of the issues that have arisen in the council&#039;s consultation on primary education in west Swindon are the direct result of interpretations of Government policy and initiatives. There is a case, therefore, for us to explore and answer, and there may be action that we in this place need to take, as well as action that Swindon borough council needs to take in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-41_para22">
<a name="stpa_426">I hope that I have made the Minister aware of my great unease at the way in which this consultation process has been carried out. I ask him to look at the decision to close Salt Way and at the consultation with the schools and the LEA. I ask him to remember that our education policy of extended schools and one-form or two-form entry schools needs to be explained properly and thoroughly to the LEA. I want to reassure my constituents and the LEA that I intend to work proactively with them to find a solution to this problem. I hope that they will meet me and my constituents halfway. It is my constituents for whom I have the greatest concern, along with their children&#039;s education.

<p><a name="st_352"><a name="50621-42_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) on securing this debate. She spoke very knowledgably and forcefully on her constituents&#039; behalf, and she clearly has considerable personal experience of the issues that she raised. I am certainly aware of the interest that people living in Swindon are showing in the current review of primary school provision in west Swindon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para0">
<a name="stpa_427">The Government are committed to continuing the drive to raise standards in education, so it will come as no surprise that we support the council&#039;s stated aims for the review, which are to provide high-quality education, to embrace the extended schools agenda&#151;I will say more about that later&#151;and to provide wide and all-encompassing community provision in west Swindon schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_428">The Department&#039;s five-year strategy for children and learners, following on from the primary document, entitled &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&#151;A Strategy for Primary Schools&quot;, sets out the success story of primary education, with many schools delivering very high-quality education. I am pleased to say that we have seen impressive strides forward in literacy and numeracy in recent years, and teaching has improved in every single curriculum subject in primary schools since 1997.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_429">Although we have already made considerable progress, we recognise the need to provide all primary pupils with a quality primary education. I regret that there is an unacceptable variation in performance between schools. Authorities are encouraged to consider this when determining proposals under a review of provision. I am pleased to say that primary standards in Swindon are improving overall and are now moving in an upwards direction. There have been improvements this year of 4&nbsp;percentage points in key stage 2&nbsp;English and maths, and of 1&nbsp;percentage point in science.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_430">As we have just heard, Swindon council is reviewing primary school places across the whole authority, due to surplus places in the sector. My hon. Friend pointed out at the beginning of her speech that the problem of surplus places is recognised and is accepted as being part of the issue that needs to be dealt with. Swindon&#039;s school organisation plan projects a decrease in pupil numbers of 4.5&nbsp;per cent. overall in the next five years, resulting in a level of surplus places of no less than 16&nbsp;per cent. in 2008&nbsp;if no action is taken. Following a consultation exercise on improving the education provision in west Swindon, completed in March, the education partnership board agreed to a pre-statutory consultation on the closure of Salt Way primary school and further discussions about the way forward for three other primary schools&#151; Freshbrook, Toothill and Windmill Hill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_431">As a result of the pre-statutory consultation, the education partnership board will, on 30&nbsp;June 2005&#151;in nine days&#039; time&#151;consider a recommendation to close Salt Way primary school with effect from 1&nbsp;September 2006, together with a linked proposal to expand Shaw Ridge primary school from the same date. I am not aware of any meeting or decision taken today to that effect, though my hon. Friend mentioned it in her speech. I understand that there has been a visit from Ofsted inspectors today, and I am not sure whether that might have created some confusion. I am sure that my hon. Friend will find out more when she returns to her constituency. Shaw Ridge primary school is in the same planning area as Salt Way primary school and places will be required to accommodate pupils. Statutory notices will then need to be issued to implement the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_432">The outcome of discussions about the three other primary schools&#151;Freshbrook, Toothill and Windmill Hill&#151;will be reported to the education partnership board on 22&nbsp;September 2005, which may lead to pre-statutory and statutory consultation, if appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_433">My hon. Friend referred to staffing. I understand from the authority that staff are now being appointed at Salt Way primary for one year, in the first instance, pending decisions on the future of the school. I appreciate that there is inevitably a period of uncertainty for everyone involved, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and I would encourage the local authority to continue to give active support to the governing body of the school during this difficult period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_434">On the issue of school organisation, the Government wish to encourage changes to local school provision that will boost standards and opportunities for young people, while matching school place supply as closely as possible to pupil and parental needs and wishes. The Education Act 1996&nbsp;places a duty on each local

<br>&nbsp;<br>education authority to ensure that sufficient school places exist to meet the needs of the local population in order to promote high standards of pupil attainment. If an authority decides to reorganise provision, decisions are not taken by Ministers, but made locally, which is what Swindon council is currently doing. The proposals for the schools mentioned have not yet moved into the statutory phase of the process. In view of my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns about the process, I would like to say more about how it is undertaken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_435">First, all interested parties must be consulted before proposals are published; they must be provided with sufficient information and allowed adequate time. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend&#039;s comments on how she saw it happening in Swindon. On deciding to proceed with closure proposals for individual schools, formal notices must be published in a local newspaper, posted at the main entrances of schools named in the proposals and placed in another conspicuous local area. There is then a six-week period for people to submit their representations in support of, or against, the proposals, except in the case of a school in special measures where one month applies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_436">If the authority has published the proposals and there are no objections, it may proceed and implement them. In all other cases, such as when objections are received, they are referred to the school organisation committee, which is made up of five or six groups each representing major stakeholders in the provision of education. Each group has one vote and must consider all the evidence in line with the guidance issued by the Secretary of State before reaching a decision. After that, if a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the case is referred to the independent schools adjudicator for a final decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_437">Importantly, as my hon. Friend noted, the guidance for those publishing and deciding proposals for changes to local school organisation makes it clear that the Government are committed to greater personalisation and choice, with learners and parents at centre stage. However, that must be set in the context of raising standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_438">Our guidance is that decisions must be made in the light of a range of factors, including the potential impact on local standards, the contribution to diversity, views of interested parties and cost effectiveness. We expect authorities to take full account of our offer on primary education, as set out in the five year strategy, when planning for primary school provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_439">On the specific issue of the review of primary schools in west Swindon, surplus places can represent a poor use of resources that could be used more effectively to support schools in raising standards. In the light of a downward trend in the number of pupils in primary education, that is a concern both nationally and locally. We have developed, in conjunction with the Audit Commission, a web-based toolkit offering a range of practical advice and guidance on dealing with falling rolls, as has happened in Swindon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_440">As I said earlier, I understand that Swindon&#039;s school organisation plan, published last year, identified a potential increase in surplus places in the west of Swindon and hence the need for a review. The latest Ofsted report for Swindon LEA stated that the authority was now making good progress in this area 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 779</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and that planning was satisfactory. It did, however, mention the high level of surplus places in primary schools in the west of Swindon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para14">
<a name="stpa_441">Along with the need to remove surplus places, the 2004&nbsp;Ofsted inspection of Salt Way primary school identified that the school had serious weaknesses, especially in leadership and management. Although it provided an acceptable standard of education for its pupils, it was not effective enough. As I said earlier, Ofsted inspectors were due to visit the school again today, but it is for individual authorities to decide whether, and how, they reduce levels of surplus places taking into account local circumstances, including school performance as well as geographical and social factors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para15">
<a name="stpa_442">My hon. Friend asked about extended schools and their use in these circumstances. I emphasise that extended schools are an important element of the Government&#039;s commitment to primary education. In embracing the extended schools agenda, Swindon council is implementing the Government&#039;s vision on what schools can offer their communities, as expressed in our publication last week of the extended schools prospectus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para16">
<a name="stpa_443">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in her announcement, the prospectus sets out how schools can develop additional services for families. We know that schools are at the heart of our communities, and it makes sense to extend the services that they offer beyond the traditional school day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para17">
<a name="stpa_444">By the year 2010, all children under 14&nbsp;who want it will have access to breakfast and after-school clubs that offer exciting activities from 8&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;pm. That will give children the opportunity to keep fit and healthy, to acquire new skills and build on what they learn during the school day, as well as to have fun. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be pleased to see that aspiration and commitment implemented in extended schools in her constituency and around the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para18">
<a name="stpa_445">In west Swindon, the LEA proposes that, if a decision is made to close Salt Way primary school, the nursery would remain, with the feasibility of providing services to children and families being considered for the site.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para19">
<a name="stpa_446">We welcome the signs of positive improvement in the education system within Swindon, and early signs of progress on implementing the every child matters agenda. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jun 2005 : Column 780</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The aims of the west Swindon primary review appear to support that improvement. Swindon&#039;s education partnership board has an independent chair appointed jointly by a former Secretary of State and the council, and it has had a positive effect on educational progress in the council area. The latest report from Ofsted, as part of the October 2004&nbsp;corporate governance inspection, reported continued overall progress in education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para20">
<a name="stpa_447">I want to refer to capital funding, which my hon. Friend mentioned this evening. Of course, the Government are supporting the raising of standards with unprecedented investment in schools. Capital investment will reach more than &#163;5&nbsp;billion in 2005&#150;06, and will increase further to &#163;6.3&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. Primary and secondary schools receive funding under existing programmes to provide repairs and improvements. In addition, our proposals for strategic investment include a long-term commitment to deliver 21st century learning facilities in primary schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para21">
<a name="stpa_448">The Chancellor announced in the 2005&nbsp;Budget that the &#163;150&nbsp;million of new investment in 2008&#150;09&#151;rising to &#163;500&nbsp;million in 2009&#150;10&#151;will form part of a 15-year programme of primary school funding. Along with other capital funding already in the system, all primary schools will be maintained or, indeed, transformed. That funding has been made available in support of the Government&#039;s every child matters and extended schools agendas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50621-42_para22">
<a name="stpa_449">In short, having listened carefully to my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns&#151;I am sure that people outside the House will listen to those concerns as well&#151;we believe that the Government have in place a framework that seeks to address her concerns. We have a primary strategy and the five-year strategy for children and learners, which set out our plans for the future of primary education. We have established a framework for local decision making on school organisation that places decision making in the community that those involved serve and know. We have taken robust action to drive up standards in all schools, and we have greatly increased the capital available for investment in school buildings. I hope that, with the commitment of parents, the education authority and, indeed, my hon. Friend, the framework that we have put in place will ensure that the transition process that is happening in her constituency achieves the best outcome for the people who matter most&#151;the children of her constituency.
