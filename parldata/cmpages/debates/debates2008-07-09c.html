 I thank my hon. Friend for that extensive answer. I know he realises that the Commonwealth games are very important to Glasgow and, for that matter, to the UK. However, the people I have been speaking to have some concerns about job opportunities and investment in the city that might have a knock-on effect on the games. They cite the 40 per cent. cut in funding for Glasgow&#146;s science centre, with a loss of 28 jobs, as an example of what could happen if the Edinburgh Executive have a go at it. Will he assure me that he and his Department will ensure that the Glasgow Commonwealth games are properly funded and go ahead as planned?</p>

 I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is not too grand to debate the issues with me today. Of course, when the Olympic games were won by the United Kingdom for the city of London, the SNP said that the games would do nothing for Scotland, and when the Commonwealth games went to Glasgow, Fergus Ewing MSP said that they would do nothing for the highlands. The insularity and parochialism of the SNP is, quite frankly, breathtaking. The Olympic games will be good for Scotland, good for Scottish athletes and good for Scottish business, and the hon.

We have seen unemployment halved in Glasgow, East and hundreds of people coming off incapacity benefit and going into work&#151;people who were left languishing on incapacity benefit when the Opposition were in government. There are nine new primary schools, three more on the way and two new secondary schools in that constituency. I know that the hon.

The situation may not have worked its way through to the unemployment figures yet, but unless the Government take urgent action, it soon will. Owing to the long distances that must be travelled by road, the high fuel price is causing serious problems for business and putting the economy at real risk.

 My hon. Friend is entirely correct to say that there is at least 25 to 30 years-worth of viable economic activity in the North sea. We have to make sure that we get that oil out, particularly in areas such as those west of Shetland. Of course, high oil prices are bad for Scotland, for the economy, for businesses and for motorists. The politicians who gloat over high oil prices as though all that they represented was a windfall for the Exchequer, and who use the prices to make their dodgy sums add up, would do well to focus their effort on reducing the cost of oil, instead of trying to divide the spoils as though they were a big cake.</p>

 On the subject of dodgy figures, the National Audit Office reckons that for every dollar increase in the price of oil, the Treasury gains &#163;200 million. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates that there is a net gain to the Treasury of &#163;140 million per dollar. That means that with prices at $130 a barrel, the Treasury gets an extra &#163;4.6 billion in revenue. Given that the Chancellor is raking in that extra revenue from the North sea, will the Minister agree not only to fight for the people of Scotland but to use some of the extra money to mitigate the high fuel costs that highlanders and people in the rest of Scotland face?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that there is tremendous tourism potential around the distilleries. More than 1 million visitors visit them each year, and they spend an average of &#163;16 each visit, which is tremendously important. I have been to the Glenfiddich distillery in his constituency, where there is a beautiful visitor centre. We were offered a dram, but it was 9 o&#146;clock in the morning so sadly we had to refuse. He is right to say that there is room for increased tourism potential. I shall have a look at the report that he mentions, and I hope that everyone will take it seriously.</p>

Following the discussions at the G8, which has sent forward a strong message about Zimbabwe, further action will be taken at the UN shortly.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about &#147;Communities in control&#151;Real people, real power&#148;, a White Paper that sets out the Government&#146;s proposals to pass more influence, power and control to local communities and citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08070953000173">As we reflect on the founding of the national health service this week and celebrate the achievements of this most civilised of British institutions, it is worth reminding ourselves that the NHS came about because of democratic politics. It is as much a testament to the powerful potential of politics as it is a testament to our common bonds of humanity. Like most noble achievements, the NHS was not a product of a cosy consensus; it was the product of a titanic political struggle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08070953000174">Those of us elected to this House would do well to remind ourselves from time to time of the great struggles for democracy in this country. We should remember the ordinary soldiers who stood and debated with their generals at St Mary&#146;s church in Putney during the English civil war, the families who gathered at St. Peter&#146;s field in Manchester in 1819 to support parliamentary reform and were trampled and killed by the cavalry, the textile workers and miners who met on Kersal moor in my own constituency in 1838, the women who faced prison and even death to win the right to vote in the early part of the last century, and the men and women who fought and defeated fascism 60 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08070953000175">Whenever we risk taking our democracy for granted, we should recall the brave men and women on whose shoulders we stand, and give thanks for their fortitude and courage. When we look around the world, from Burma to Zimbabwe, we should recognise that the struggle for democracy is universal and that the drive for people to want to control their own lives is part of human nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08070953000176">This White Paper represents some significant steps forward towards giving local people a greater say over their lives and greater control over the forces and decisions that shape their neighbourhoods. I am convinced that in the coming decades, people will expect and demand much greater power within the political system. There is a tide of history flowing in the direction of greater democracy, and all of us who are part of the political system would do well to understand it, anticipate it and adapt our system to take account of the change that is coming. We are building on the devolution and decentralisation already enacted by this Labour Government&#151;devolution to Scotland, Wales and London, more powers and resources for councils, and more ways for citizens to play an active role&#151;but we need to move further and go faster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08070953000177">The White Paper has two broad aims. The first is to rehabilitate local political activity as a worthwhile activity, conducted by decent people in pursuit of noble aims. We cannot function as a democracy without strong local democratic institutions and vibrant political parties in every area. Local authorities have a vital role. There are now many excellent examples of councils being at the heart of local democracy, and that should be the case everywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08070953000178">Secondly, we must pass more power to local people so that they feel that if they get involved, it will be worth their time and effort. People are perfectly rational. They will get involved if they can see the change that they make, and if they do not, they will soon fall away. People are not apathetic: almost 70 per cent say that they want a bigger say in how the country is run. People want to be involved, but the structures and cultures of politics sometimes alienate them. They are disengaging themselves from the political process because they feel that they lack power. It is also crucial for young people to become involved, because our democracy rests on future generations being part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08070953000179">The White Paper will contain measures to enhance local democracy, but the Government are also committed to offering the public more opportunities to influence national decisions. Today the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), will publish a discussion paper providing a national framework for greater citizen engagement and suggesting mechanisms for involving the public in debates and decision making on national issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000180">So what do we propose at local level? First, we want to place a new duty on councils to promote democracy. They will have to run campaigns to register voters, explain voting to local people, work with schools to explain local councillors&#146; roles, and train staff to be able to say which group controls the council, how to register to vote and when the next elections are. Councils should be vibrant hubs of local democracy, not units of local administration. We will allow councils to provide incentives to encourage more people to vote, perhaps entering voters in a prize draw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000181">Alongside the White Paper, we are publishing our response to the report by Jane Roberts&#146;s Councillors Commission on the barriers and incentives to becoming and remaining a councillor. Many of Jane&#146;s ideas are incorporated in the White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08070953000182">There will be a range of measures to increase visibility and accountability in local services.

The consultation will be about making it easier to demand a referendum on whether to have a directly elected local mayor, for instance by accepting electronic petitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000184">We are also announcing a review of redress when things go wrong in council services. The review will consider the way in which redress is being used across the public and private sectors, and will make recommendations on how it can be used better in local public services to improve satisfaction and service delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08070953000185">We support the provision of more councils at community level, such as parish and neighbourhood councils, and will introduce a new right for local people to appeal to the Secretary of State if their council denies them the opportunity to establish a community council.

 We will revise the so-called Widdicombe rules, which restrict council officers from political activity, and allow more council officers to engage in political activity if they choose to do so.

There will be a &#163;7.5 million empowerment fund for national third sector organisations to establish innovative schemes, particularly for young people who would otherwise not have the opportunity to gain vital community leadership skills and become involved in planning and social enterprise.

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08070953000189">Petitions have been a well-understood part of our public life for centuries.

Many local authorities handle petitions very well. However, we want all of them to do so at the level of the best, so we will place a duty on councils to respond to all petitions, and if a petition has the support of more than 5 per cent. of the local population there will have to be a debate in full council. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08070953000190">Petitions will help local people to direct their council to clear away abandoned cars, build a new road crossing, introduce traffic calming measures or deal with an empty property. Councils will also act as community advocates, for example for petitions relating to NHS primary care trusts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08070953000191">I am convinced that there is no conflict between representative and participatory forms of democracy. They are mutually reinforcing, and the best councillors are the ones who are in touch with the views of their community. We want to build on the success of participatory budgeting schemes, which allow local people to have a real say over how local investment is made, including in youth, community safety and health budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08070953000192">We hear many negative things about young people today, and we are told that they have rejected mainstream politics.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for giving me advance sight both of her statement and of this essentially harmless White Paper. Until her statement, I thought I was the one who was advocating &#147;Just say no&#148; to the right hon. Lady, but it appears that her colleagues in the Home Office and the Department of Health have taken the very life out of these proposals, and have found it remarkably easy just to say no to Hazel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08070953000196">May I rise to the right hon. Lady&#146;s defence and support a number of the measures in this document? We agree that there is a strong case for more city mayors where they are supported by local people. The hurdle for a community to get one is far too restrictive, but as the people of Bury decided last week, local choice must be paramount. However, why is the right hon. Lady so timid in allowing mayors just to join police and crime reduction partnerships? Why does she not go all the way and give them real control over policing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08070953000197">The right hon. Lady calls for online petitions, but if she is such a supporter of e-democracy, why is her Department axing all funding for the International Centre of Excellence for Local eDemocracy? Does she not appreciate that that centre has been instrumental in helping local community groups and parish councils establish and publish community websites, and that it is the only organisation offering impartial advice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08070953000198">We support devolving the management of services to local groups, and the strengthening of social enterprise is very welcome. However, a rag-bag of proposals is no substitute for policy. Does the right hon. Lady not understand that there is a contradiction in stripping local authorities of real powers in planning, housing and waste and transferring them to an unaccountable quango, and in replacing them with a few toys, few of which will see the light of day? It is less than a year since the last local government Act received Royal Assent. How many of the community provisions from that Act have commenced, and why has the community call for action introduced way back in the Police and Justice Act 2006 never been implemented?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80709-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08070953000199">The right hon. Lady mentioned that in order to encourage people to vote, their names will be entered into a prize draw. Will she confirm that the booby prize for such a draw would be a Labour councillor, especially when, under a scheme announced on page 137 of the White Paper, she suggests that councillors should be allowed to vote in meetings from the comfort of their armchairs, without being put to the inconvenience of meeting a voter? That is hardly an inducement for people to vote.</p>

This is jobs for the boys masquerading as human rights.

Even in the London mayoral election it was only 45 per cent. Unless we are prepared to have courage and convictions and to do things differently, we will see this disaffection and disengagement from local politics continue, to the detriment of all our political parties and of democracy in this country.</p>

I do not think that it is fair for a highways engineer who does not advise the council and has no role on policy, but earns &#163;33,000 a year, to be barred from any democratic political activity because of that. It sends out the wrong message. It is right to correct that situation, which was caused by the previous Government.</p>

Gentleman said that we had stripped powers away from local government, and that if we gave it more powers, that would be the answer. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Let me just say this to the hon. Gentleman: he seems to have had a bout of amnesia. In the past 12 months, we have reduced the number of national targets from 1,200 to fewer than 200. We have negotiated local area agreements and there are &#163;5 billion-worth of un-ring-fenced funds. We have given local authorities the right, through the duty to co-operate, to draw together health, police, local councils and Jobcentre Plus, and we have given them excellent new tools to tackle antisocial behaviour. That is one area where local councils can make a difference, and that is where they need to put their efforts.</p>

 The Secretary of State has talked about local democracy, but I remind her what happened in Northumberland.

 My hon. Friend will accept that the unitary authority proposals came from communities and local authorities.

It does not matter how low down an organisation is, or how small the assets that it is managing, the line of accountability to representative bodies must be very clear.

 In the past, battles were fought and blood was spilled to get the vote and for collective responsibility, but I know of no evidence that people have quarrelled even once in any high street in Britain about having a lord mayor. People did not fight for something that is the very opposite of collective responsibility&#151;it is nothing more than an example of the development of the cult of personality. If my right hon. Friend wants to help local government and get more people to participate, she should ensure that some of the power taken from local authorities over about 35 years is handed back to people who are elected. As for e-petitions, may I caution her that they do not amount to collective responsibility? They are more like instant gratification, which, sadly, pervades every element of our society.</p>

 There are only 12 in the whole country at present, so it is difficult to draw broad lessons. However, on Tuesday I was in Lewisham with young people and their directly elected mayor, whom they see as &#147;our mayor&#148; and with whom they have a personal relationship. I know that this area is controversial, but people who want a bigger say want a directly elected representative. Accountability must be very transparent indeed, and people need to know that the person turning the vision for their community into action is someone for whom they voted at the ballot box. They must be able to call that person to account. That is the inevitable tide of politics.</p>

 The Government are right to recognise the need for more direct democracy and radically to devolve power to local people. However, does the White Paper contain measures to devolve control over local government finance to local people or to ensure locally accountable police chiefs? Does it contain a right of initiative, rather than merely a right to petition and trigger town hall talk? Without such steps, the White Paper just pays lip service to localism&#151;it does not have the Levellers behind it, so much as Sir Humphrey Appleby.</p>

As I said earlier on police accountability, the White Paper contains a commitment to establishing a directly elected element in the police system.

We recently signed a concordat with the Local Government Association that for the first time sets out the rights and responsibilities of central Government and local government.

As I said earlier, in the past 12 months there has been a significant move towards giving people at the local level more space to do what they really want and freeing up local councils to respond accordingly.</p>

 This White Paper is about transferring power to citizens and communities. It does not profess to be about transferring power to local authorities. In 2006-07, the White Paper and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 amounted to a dramatic shift, with local area agreements freeing up councils through grants that are not ring-fenced. The council thus became the central, democratically elected organisation co-ordinating the whole range of public services, which represented a significant degree of devolution from the centre to the locality. The focus of the White Paper is to ensure that part of the deal is completed, meaning that if there is to be more devolution to local authorities, which there should be, they have a responsibility to devolve power more and more to local people and communities, so that they, too, absolutely feel part of our revived and more vibrant democracy.</p>

The powers are a bit arcane&#151;the polls have to take place before 4 pm for some very ancient reason&#151;and it is time that we looked at the rules. The polls should also be about relatively local issues, on which people will clearly hold strong views, but there is room for the consideration of how we might develop more techniques, so that people can have a say.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I commend Leicester city council on some of the steps that it has taken in respect of the agenda, which have been very impressive indeed. He will find in the White Paper a section on overview and scrutiny, setting out how I want to ensure that the role is strengthened and regarded almost as a Select Committee, with similar powers to take evidence, to call people to account and to ensure proper scrutiny and accountability. Councillors who take on the role also need more training and support, because it is still relatively new, and some of them would benefit from sharing the experience that we have gained in the House. I am absolutely determined to ensure that the overview and scrutiny role is seen not as a second-best option, but as one of the most important jobs on any local authority.</p>

 The Secretary of State has said that local government is vital, and I am sure that we all agree. However, the Government removed planning powers from local authorities in my constituency and set up a quango that paid little attention to local opinion. Is she now saying that she will scrap that quango and restore those powers to local authorities? If she is not, this White Paper will not be worth the paper it is printed on.</p>

 I presume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to our debate just last week about the independent planning commission.

 My right hon.

She will be aware that what matters most to most people is what happens outside their front doors&#151;in their block of flats and on their streets and estates. She will also recognise that in deprived areas, where there are the fewest facilities and the poorest conditions, there is a real lack of accountability, local control and influence over what goes on.

 My hon. Friend, like several Members, has a tremendous record not only on empowering his community, but on his work with the Community Development Foundation. I am more than happy to confirm that, in the White Paper again, there are a number of proposals for us to work not only with the foundation, which will play a central role, but with a range of organisations to increase capacity and help our communities to develop. One thing that I am keen to do is to ensure that ordinary council officers, such as housing officers and planners, work in a way that builds the capacity of the local community. It should not always be a job for a specialist; it should be part of the day job.</p>

 Some aspects of the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement were statements of the blindingly obvious. I cannot believe that she can say, &#147;We must give more power to the people, so that they feel that if they get involved it will be worth their time and effort.&#148; People are perfectly rational, and they get involved if they can see any point to it. If, during a consultation in my community, my constituents were offered option A and option B, and option A was 34 and option B was also 34, there would be little point in getting involved.

 Consultation and involvement should involve dialogue and conversation, and my experience is that people who want to get involved do not necessarily expect to get 100 per cent. of what they want. They want people to be properly engaged and to achieve some change as a result of their involvement, so it is important for local authorities to enter into dialogue with people with a view not only to listening to what they say, but to acting on it. People will not keep getting involved if they keep getting rebuffed. That is a very important message, and I can see that the hon. Lady agrees.</p>

 Is it not the case that properly engaging with local communities on issues that matter empowers local councillors and councils? I commend to the Secretary of State the excellent and fully resourced scrutiny function at Tameside metropolitan borough council and its district assemblies, where it has already devolved decision making, staff and budgets to community level. That is in stark contrast with Stockport, where the authorities have done everything to obstruct the Friends of Reddish Baths, which wants to reopen under community management that much- loved and well cherished community facility.</p>

He also has a four-star, excellent local council&#151;it is one of the best in the north-west&#151;that is not afraid to devolve power to the community.

 Very often in local authorities, scrutiny is led by the opposition, and clearly that is a matter for local authorities to determine. In this House, Select Committees are chaired by a variety of people. Often, it is best practice to be able to drill into the policies. Now that there is to be a cabinet structure, there is an even greater requirement for scrutiny to be very active and rigorous. I would like scrutiny increasingly to involve the local community. There is provision to co-opt local people on to scrutiny committees and to take evidence from the community, which is a measure that I commend.</p>

The Secretary of State will know that in certain areas people have overwhelmingly voted to abolish the local parish council in a parish poll.

However, I am concerned about the number of new devolutionary Bills that local authorities are having to process at the same time. There was local government legislation and the 2007 Act, and now there is the new White Paper.

local authorities feel that they own the process, want to champion it and feel that it will make them stronger in their communities. He makes a very good point about taking an integrated approach across those pieces of legislation. At some point, we will see the proposals in the police Green Paper, and the issues and arrangements resulting from the NHS constitution. With regard to local communities, we really need to get to the point where there is an integrated offer across the public services. We need an integrated way in which local people can be involved that is not complicated or bureaucratic, but that really bites and makes a difference. My personal challenge is to try to make sure that that is coherent and inspiring to local authorities, so that they will want to take the agenda forward.</p>

 I commend my right hon. Friend for her very strong statement, but there is a great deal of cynicism among local people in Swindon, because they do not feel properly represented. They are particularly concerned about a weak local plan that leaves the people of Eastcott very vulnerable to houses in multiple occupation. Will her White Paper help them? Constituents are also concerned about Coate water, a much-loved beauty spot that is threatened by building next door, which is being undertaken by the local council, and about their heritage buildings, such as the Mechanics institute.

The participatory budgeting powers will enable them to have more of a say in how local authority budgets are spent. The proposals on community justice will give the people whom she represents the right to have a bigger say on community punishments.

I should point out that I do not support the Government&#146;s bid to reclassify cannabis. They should have accepted the findings of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which recognised that cannabis was dangerous but stated that it was not as dangerous as other drugs in category B.</p>

That is the purpose of the Bill. I can give a simple illustration of the consequences of that absence of legislation. If Members come to Wallington, I will show them Your High, a shop trading legally in drugs paraphernalia and cannabis seeds. It is around the corner from a primary school and down the road from a secondary school. It was brought to my attention by parents and the head teacher of the primary school, and shortly afterwards by the head of the secondary school and by local churches.</p>

I am sure that Members can anticipate parents&#146; concerns: the shop&#146;s location, its trade and, perhaps most importantly, its message that there is no difference between a shop that sells flowers or repairs TVs and one that sells drugs paraphernalia. Someone can pop to the corner shop for a pint or to their local drugs paraphernalia shop to pick up a bong. Is that really a message that we want young children to absorb? Certainly not according to the 500 or so local people who have so far signed a petition against the shop.</p>

The shop is trading legally, and as the unit was previously used for retail purposes as a fireworks shop, which was only marginally less unpopular, planning had no say in the matter. Ironically, there was a possibility of taking action against the shop for failing to apply for planning permission for its neon lights, but not for selling pipes and other drugs paraphernalia.</p>

I discussed that legislative review with Ken Jones, the president of ACPO, and it would be fair to say that ACPO is sceptical about the approach.

There is no confusion about what constitutes cannabis seeds, certainly not among retailers who are selling seeds on the net.

Wallington (Tom Brake) that it would have many unintended consequences for a group of people that he has not mentioned: the thousands in this country who use cannabis for medicinal purposes. There have been Bills before the House that would have allowed cannabis to be prescribed. Frequently when I speak on the subject, some newspapers link the fact that I have arthritis to my enthusiasm for legalising medicinal cannabis. There is no connection. I have never in my life used an illegal drug, and I have no intention of using one.</p>

It was a COX-2 inhibitor and pain reliever that was prescribed more than 1 million times in this country before it was discovered to have caused 150,000 heart attacks and strokes in another country. The merit of cannabis, which has been used as a medicine for more than 5,000 years on every continent, is that all its side effects and problems were discovered through experience many years ago.</p>

I am happy to reflect on the fact that only 12 ten-minute Bills, I think, have become law in the past 25 years, so it is unlikely that this one will, but the Government might be persuaded to go down a similar path. If it were to become law, those people would have to move to the criminal market. At the moment, they are doing something perfectly legal. They can buy their seeds on the internet, in other countries or in shops such as the one that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, which are fairly rare. If they do so and grow their own, they know the quality and strength of the cannabis that they take when they engage in a perfectly harmless activity that gives pain relief to people, particularly those suffering from multiple sclerosis, who find that the chemical drugs that are available to them cause terrible problems, including nausea and all kinds of serious side effects. People have come to demonstrate at Parliament in the past 12 months, showing that they want the law to be changed. If the law is changed, and a simple Bill is introduced to differentiate between the recreational and medicinal use of cannabis, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill might be appropriate.

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80709-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08070953000294">The hon. Gentleman rightly said that he was against the irrational proposal to move cannabis from class C to class B, but I am sure that that will happen. As a result, the maximum sentence for possessing cannabis&#151;and, presumably, for possessing seeds&#151;will go up from two to five years. We would be doing that in the knowledge that we do not have a single prison that is free of the open use of heroin and cocaine to which to send anyone who is convicted. They could go to prison as an MS sufferer using their medicine of choice&#151;as a cannabis user&#151;and come out in five years&#146; time as a heroin addict.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s well-intentioned Bill, major injustices will be done, and the anxiety that it and any proposal from the Government will cause is not worth its suggested benefits. He did not give any evidence of harm&#151;certainly, people will be understandably anxious if such a shop is set up in the neighbourhood&#151;but there is harm from other temptations for young people, particularly from tobacco. Virtually everyone&#146;s first use of cannabis as a drug of abuse is when it is mixed with tobacco, which is an addictive or killer drug. It kills 120,000 people a year, whereas deaths from cannabis are probably non-existent and certainly extremely rare. There is concern about the side-effects, and no one would advocate its greater use, but I urge the hon. Gentleman to think deeply about the unintended consequences of his Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80709-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000301">Across the United Kingdom there is evidence of an economic downturn, which has many aspects to it. In fact, today&#146;s national newspaper front page headlines give a stark indication of what we face in the coming months, which has all the hallmarks of the nation&#146;s worse downturn in 30 years. While all parts of the nation and all sectors of society are suffering, the region whose suffering is among the worst is Northern Ireland. The price of oil in all parts of the UK is hovering near $150 a barrel, which means that the prices of diesel in Northern Ireland filling stations&#151;I am sure that this is the case elsewhere in the UK&#151;has increased by 35 per cent. since this time last year, and that of unleaded petrol by 22 per cent. Regions such as Northern Ireland, parts of Scotland and the south-west of England suffer most, because food and goods have to be transported to the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80709-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000302">We have seen electricity price rises of the order of 20 per cent. in 12 months; natural gas prices have risen by 28 per cent., and home heating oil in Northern Ireland has risen by 100 per cent. in a 12-month period. All that provides a clear indication that consumers and vulnerable groups, to whom I will turn in a moment, are suffering horrendously. Today, I read that home repossessions are set to rise throughout the United Kingdom by 60 per cent. by the end of the year&#151;not in 12 months&#146; time, but within the next six months. The credit crunch, coupled with the other issues that I have mentioned, means that people are suffering across the UK. Indeed, every constituency MP hears on a daily basis of the genuine hardships faced by people who find it difficult to meet mortgage costs. The increase in repossessions in the next six months indicate how difficult it is for people to meet those increasing mortgage costs.</p>

The Government are moving in the correct direction, but those gestures are just that&#151;gestures&#151;and they are not sufficient, because elderly people have found that even a &#163;50 or &#163;100 increase in the winter fuel payment does not extend to their covering the purchase of one tankful of home heating oil to get them through half of the coldest part of the winter. Only four years ago, the winter fuel allowance allowed a senior citizen to acquire sufficient heating oil to get them through the entire winter, so the scale of the problem is increasing, and the measures that are intended to deal with the problem have fallen significantly short.</p>

 My hon. Friend mentioned vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly. Does he agree that inflation for older people is running ahead of inflation rates for the community in general? The winter fuel allowance, which helps many elderly people, has been increased only once since 2000, and has not kept pace with inflation. The allowance would be a practical means of helping older people in particular, and the Government need to act on that, given the escalating price of fuel to which my hon. Friend referred.</p>

I have read with interest the information disseminated by the financial services group Clerical Medical, which has said that senior citizens have seen the cost of the whole range of goods and services that they use rise by 36 per cent. in the past decade. Retail price inflation, however, has risen by only 32 per cent. over the same period. That is precisely the point. The situation for those vulnerable groups, particularly elderly citizens, is worsening. It was worsening by the year, as the figures from Clerical Medical indicate, but in the climate that we face in 2008, it is worsening by the week.

Employees are doing that because of the problem to which I have alluded.

It is still lower than in the USA or the euro zone, and it is far lower than in the early 1990s, when for nearly two whole years it was more than twice as high as it is now. That did not happen by accident. The reform of fiscal policy established by this Government in 1997 laid the foundations for this steadiness in the economy. Interest rates are much lower than they were in the past. The strong and steady growth that we have seen over the past 10 years, from which all families have benefited, has taken us from having the lowest income per head in the G7 to the second highest, and real household income available to spend has risen by more than 30 per cent. in that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80709-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08070953000324">Crucially, employment is high, with more than 3 million more jobs than in 1997, and unemployment is low. In Northern Ireland, unemployment has been halved in the past decade, with long-term unemployment down by 90 per cent. Its unemployment rates are among the lowest in the UK, and there are 100,000 more people in work than there were 11 years ago: a fact that brings me particular pleasure given my short time&#151;one year&#151;as Minister with responsibility for employment in Northern Ireland.</p>

VAT is a percentage of the price, so it rises with fuel prices, but as people spend more on fuel, there is likely to be an impact on VAT revenues from elsewhere in the economy, leaving the overall level of VAT roughly the same&#151;particularly as businesses can reclaim the VAT that they spend on fuel. It is also compulsory under EU law to charge VAT on fuel, and the House should remember that the UK has one of the lowest rates of VAT on fuel in the EU.</p>

I am, of course, always happy to listen to proposals from any Member, but hon. Members will know that tax credits support around 20 million men, women and children across the country, and those credits have made a major contribution to lifting hundreds of thousands of children above the poverty line. They mean that 3 million out of Britain&#146;s 7 million families with children now receive more in tax credits and child benefit than they pay in income tax. Let me say that again: of the 7 million families with children in the UK, almost half now pay less in income tax than they receive in benefits through tax credits and child benefit.</p>

 I have listened to the Minister&#146;s argument, and it is a refinement of the argument put forward time and time again to excuse the Government for not reducing fuel duty at a time when money from VAT on fuel and North sea revenues would be expected to rise. The explanation that she has given is not borne out by the figures that the Government published in the Budget report for 2009, which do not show, over the next three years, either a fall in North sea revenue duties or VAT duties.

prices. The analysis that I have given to the House of the impact of the changes is based on the best available information. Despite the case that Opposition parties are making for an opportunity to grab at this perceived or suggested windfall, the truth is very different. There is no opportunity to do what is suggested by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party or the official Opposition.</p>

 Although the Minister said that the United Kingdom has one of the lowest VAT burdens, she did not say that it has one of the highest rates of tax burden on fuel in the EU. Let us have all the facts.</p>

 But the hon. Gentleman will know that VAT rates are very difficult to adjust in the face of the European Union rules under which we work. I say to him and the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) that the Government responded to the increase in pressures on household costs by not raising fuel duty in the Budget in 2008, and the Chancellor will keep all those factors under review&#151;as he always does&#151;when considering the measures introduced in the pre-Budget report.</p>

 I really do not think that the Minister should be allowed to move on while she is trying to give the impression that we are somehow better off than the European Union. The duty we pay in this country is over 50p per litre. The EU average is 25p per litre. To talk about VAT rates&#151;I will not say it is misleading because I would not be allowed to&#151;is moving away from reality. The fact is that the duty is twice as much.</p>

 The fuel duty we apply is based on the sound approach that we introduced. In fact, it was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party that introduced the fuel duty escalator. We moved away from that on the grounds that it was unsustainable. Had we stuck with his party&#146;s fuel duty escalator, which was introduced, if I remember rightly, for environmental reasons, fuel duty would now be 35p a litre higher. We are sensitive to the costs that apply to motorists, but this debate should not go by without taking note of the Royal Automobile Club report on the costs of motoring, which shows that the total cost of motoring, including the cost of fuel, has fallen by 18 per cent. in real terms over the past 20 years. Hon. Members will have read accounts of that report today, so I will not labour the point, but it is worth noting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80709-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000345">Turning to winter fuel payments, they are an important part of the increased support that we have provided to pensioners over the past 11 years. In the Budget, we announced that households with people over 80 years old will receive an additional &#163;100 alongside their winter fuel payments this year, while households with those over 60 will receive an additional &#163;50. That will benefit 9 million households nationwide, including Northern Ireland. It is not true to say that we have not acknowledged the difficulties of dealing with rising fuel prices.</p>

 I thank the Minister for being kind enough to give way again. She alludes to the proposed increase in the winter fuel payment, and all hon. Members say that that is a step in the right direction. But can she not accept that that increase is significantly short of what the people who avail themselves of the benefit need to pay for oil? That is the point.</p>

We are supporting the Bank of England&#146;s special liquidity scheme, which is helping to stabilise the financial markets and to promote confidence. We are also working to strengthen mortgage finance markets, which funded about a third of new mortgages last summer, but which have since frozen.

I apologise for not having figures immediately to hand on relative electricity prices in the European Union, but I am conscious that the nature of the electricity market in the UK is different from structures in other member states. Northern Ireland Electricity advises that, following the 14 per cent. tariff increases in domestic electricity prices, Northern Ireland prices will be 2.1 per cent. above those in comparator regions in Great Britain, 9 per cent. lower than the western European average and 9 per cent. lower than those of the Electricity Supply Board in the Republic of Ireland.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) on securing a debate on a subject that is vital for many people throughout the country. There is no doubt that the rising cost of living is one of the most pressing issues for millions of people in Britain today. That includes families, pensioners&#151;indeed, pretty much everyone on low and fixed incomes, who struggle to cope with increased prices. Many are younger people who are starting out on their working lives and are therefore on much lower incomes than other people. They find that food is getting more expensive and fuel bills are increasing at an alarming rate, as we discussed earlier. Mortgages are harder to come by and the cost of transport&#151;whether cars, buses or trains&#151;continues to rise. A report by Asda stated that the cost of transport had increased by 6 per cent. between May 2007 and May this year.</p>

However, people in today&#146;s Britain are already living frugally; many are already struggling to keep their heads above water financially. Disposable income has fallen by 6 per cent. That means that by May this year, families had 6 per cent. less to spend on leisure and entertainment than they had in May last year. A cost of living index, which Capital Economics researched for <i> The Daily Telegraph, </i>showed that a typical family that spent &#163;100 a week on food a year ago now pays an extra &#163;406 annually on groceries. Families clearly face difficult challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80709-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08070953000364">Many people have all their disposable income committed; they simply have no more money to give the Government. The savings ratio is a tenth of what it was in 1997 and many people have nothing in reserve. For the many who live on the tipping point, life is not happy. It is stressful for families who are doing all they can to get by in such challenging times. It is unbelievably frustrating and stressful for people to be in a position where, although they are doing everything possible to keep the cost of living down, they face a constant daily challenge to make the household budget add up. They end up feeling that they have no control over their situation and little influence over events as they unfold. They need a Government who offer them the hope of a way out of their troubles.</p>

Have they recognised the urgent need to do everything they can to help struggling families in Britain? The answer is no. Instead, it is abundantly clear that the Government&#146;s attitude to the problem is, &#147;Don&#146;t blame us, it&#146;s not our fault.&#148; We see that in the tone of their amendment. Inflation, food prices, fuel prices: these are global issues to the Government. They are telling us, &#147;What can we do about them?&#148; That is their attitude.  <br>

There is nothing in the Government&#146;s amendment to give people facing challenges caused by the cost of living any hope whatever. It talks about &#147;global leadership&#148;, but frankly, people up and down this country would settle for some national leadership.</p>

 It is kind of the hon. Lady to give way so early in her speech. I sought to set out why we were taking the course of action that we are, based on our confidence in the reforms that we made to fiscal policy arrangements early in government. I would be very interested to hear whether she believes that there are any alternative measures that we could take, perhaps at a macro-economic level. Would she intervene over interest rates, for example? I am interested to know what exactly she would do in this situation that she believes would bring about a better outcome for the British economy.</p>

 I will come to that shortly. On interest rates, my understanding is that it is the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, not our side, who are chuntering behind the scenes about what the Bank of England should do. The Government talk about leadership, but the reality is that there is a complete lack of leadership. Unfortunately, however, the Government&#146;s involvement in the cost of living goes beyond that.</p>

We can see that global trends are pushing up the cost of commodities such as corn and energy, but the Government have choices that they can make. The Financial Secretary has challenged me on what the Conservatives would do, and I will come to that. However, rather than trying to come up with solutions, the Government are, for many millions of people up and down the country, now part of the problem, because they are adding to the economic burden that people face. Despite all their warm words, and what they claim is their understanding of people&#146;s predicament as they try to keep up with rising fuel, energy and food costs, the Government have nevertheless decided to add to their economic misery.</p>

Such policies will be the final straw for hundreds of thousands&#151;probably millions&#151;of households that are on the brink of going under financially. The Financial Secretary talked about the winter fuel allowance. Yes&#151;a one-year winter fuel allowance paid for by permanent tax rises.

 I will withdraw that remark. The Prime Minister was ill advised to make comments to British families about economising on wasting food on the same day that he sat down to an eight-course meal at the G8 summit that, as I understand from the menu, included white asparagus and truffle soup and what is called in French an amuse bouche&#151;I understand that it is called corn-stuffed caviar in English&#151;which was all washed down with champagne. People must wonder what planet the Prime Minister is living on when he can have that meal in the evening and then in the morning tell people that they are wasting their food.</p>

How about if the Government were not bringing forward road tax rises that will cost some families &#163;245 a year? The Government could be playing their role in helping people to cope with the rising cost of living, but they are not. The Prime Minister is in no position to lecture the British people about waste when he has presided over a Government who most people feel have wasted billions of pounds more than any Government in living memory&#151;indeed, they have wasted &#163;1.4 billion on tax credits alone.</p>

reason why they cannot stop themselves from going ahead with their swingeing tax rises on low-income people&#151;is that they have run out of money. As we have said, they could have fixed the economic roof when the sun was shining and the global economy was in a better shape. They chose not to, and now they are left with no alternative but to impose tax rises on the people who can least afford them, at a time when their financial situation is getting worse and worse.</p>

As we discussed earlier, only last week the House had a choice to avoid going ahead with swingeing, punitive increases in road tax, but Government MPs decided not to take that road. They decided to press ahead with increases on road tax&#151;and for what? To tackle motor vehicle emissions, which, by their own admission, the policy will reduce by a fraction of 1 per cent. by 2020.

The credit crunch that we have all been talking about is now a consumer crunch, and consumers are now experiencing a situation of crunch and grind as more and more bills are rising higher and higher.</p>

In the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment took evidence from people in the energy market who made the point that a barrel of oil is traded 11 times before it is consumed. Those trade transactions are driving up the cost to the end consumer. Similarly, it was pointed out that gas in the UK is traded six times before it is consumed, whereas the additional ratio of trade in the continental gas market is only 0.6. I know that there is a different structure in the gas market on the continent, including more state ownership, but the fact is that we need to take account of the market factors that are driving up the costs for consumers before they have to pay the end cost. It is clear that they are paying more than just the price of scarce production, and that they are having to take on price increases that are the result of up to 12 transactions for profiteering and speculating purposes.</p>

I accept that, in circumstances in which the property market has taken a hit, banks and other institutional investors are looking for commodities to deal and speculate in usefully and profitably, not least because they are trying to maintain the value of pensions on behalf of us all. However, we really need to see some action that says to institutional investors that the degree to which they trade in commodity indices and in futures is doing wider economic damage. We know from the warnings given to the US Senate Commerce Committee by George Soros, among others, that the degree of dealing that is going on in commodity indices is creating a dangerous bubble. That is creating the immediate price pressure that everyone is feeling, but it will also create a dangerous collapse at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80709-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08070953000410">The Government have used reflex arguments before in respect of fiscal issues, including spending a long time saying that it was a figment of everyone else&#146;s imaginations to suppose that there would be problems from the abolition of the 10p tax band, only eventually to recognise that there were serious problems requiring fairly dramatic responses and interventions to ameliorate the resulting situation. I would appreciate it if the Government, as well as cautioning the rest of us about the argument, promised to show exactly what is or is not happening.</p>

They should separate out petrol, diesel and other fuels and find out what exactly is happening in respect of added revenue yield coming from ever-increasing domestic energy bills. The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred earlier to the sort of price increases that consumers in Northern Ireland have faced, with one gas company&#146;s consumers having to pay 28 per cent. extra and electricity customers facing an interim increase of 14 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08070953000412">The hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) then intervened to say that the same, if not worse, increases were going to happen in the autumn. In the circumstances, the Government should look further into those revenues with an eye to redirecting any windfall VAT benefits on domestic energy bills towards adopting measures aimed at improving energy efficiency or curbing fuel poverty for those domestic consumers. We need to target and keep our eye on that issue in circumstances where it is very easy to get distracted and preoccupied with a variety of other issues. We need to keep an eye on the Government&#146;s successful drive on fuel poverty. It would be consistent with the Government&#146;s approach if Ministers were to refocus their case on the general argument for windfall taxes in order to deal with that particular issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08070953000413">I intervened on the Minister earlier about the difficulties faced by the construction and property sector in the current crisis. In a constituency and region such as mine, that is not only a problem for businesses. Yes, construction and property is a very significant sector in Northern Ireland&#151;indeed, it has been a very significant driver of the regional economy recently, just as it was a hugely significant driver in the economic success of the Irish Republic over the past decade&#151;but it is now a sector in crisis. Given the land prices developers were prepared to pay and the house prices that they were prepared to charge, not everyone will have much sympathy for them, but the fact remains that it is not a crisis entirely of their own making. After all, the banks were throwing money at them to buy land at these significant prices, and they were putting up the money in very generous mortgage deals at 100 per cent. and 125 per cent., which fuelled the market, but we are now seeing a virtual collapse of that market with the banks putting the squeeze on some of those very same businesses. Houses are available at much lower prices than were sought last year, so it is paradoxical that they are now in market terms out of the reach of many people, who can no longer access the finance to buy them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08070953000414">Given the commitments of the Government and the various Administrations around these islands to affordable and social housing, positive intervention is important. We need more effective intervention to ensure that houses that should be available at lower prices are available at lower prices. Influencing the banks is a key factor, because they have moved from over-lending to under-lending as far as that market is concerned. Action needs to be taken to strike a better balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08070953000415">I argued earlier that the credit crunch has become a consumer crunch, and I want to close by mentioning my visit to a credit union in my constituency. Those working there told me that they are now being asked for loans so that people can pay their fuel bills or cope with significant household bills, including groceries. That is a new situation for credit unions. Some of the older credit unions may have faced it many years ago and some may have started by helping people to cope in that way, but now that problem is biting again, it really is a call to us all to wake up and see what we can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08070953000416">I accept what the Government say about their good economic management over the past 10 years, and I also respect what they say about all their headline macro-policy initiatives, but policy management does not always help people to cope in circumstances where they have to turn to a credit union to cope with an oil  <br>

bill. If this is happening as we come into the summer, what situation are people going to face as we move into winter? It was good to hear from the Financial Secretary that the Government appreciate the pressures that people are experiencing, as it is important that they feel the pain of those who are struggling on marginal incomes with ever-rising bills. However, it is even more important that the Government translate that into significant action and real intervention that helps real people to cope with very real pressures.</p>

 Let me add my congratulations to the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell). A couple of weeks ago we had an Opposition day debate on the same subject, but no Ulster Members had an opportunity to speak on that occasion. As I do not want to restrict the time available to the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson), who is obviously waiting to speak, I shall be fairly brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08070953000418">A couple of distinctive Northern Irish issues are relevant to the debate. The first is that as Northern Ireland has a large rural hinterland, it is probably proportionally more affected by transport costs and by a relatively poor train system. The impact on the farming community is particularly significant, and it involves factors that also affect Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and other parts of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08070953000419">A second issue that was mentioned by neither the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) nor the hon. Member for East Londonderry is Northern Ireland&#146;s proximity to the Irish border. Nowadays there is a large amount of cross-border trade and movement across the Euroland frontier. Anyone importing goods from southern Ireland or crossing the border to buy them will know of the substantial impact of sterling devaluation against the euro, which is probably about 15 per cent. That currency change is an important element of the increased cost of living in Northern Ireland, which may be mentioned in the winding-up speeches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000420">I want to develop some of the points made by the Minister and the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) about the oil sector. Although the motion contains nothing desperately controversial&#151;it is worded very openly, and I am happy to support it&#151;I worry, like the Minister, about the constant references to a windfall from oil. It is tempting to jump on to the bandwagon, as the Conservatives and the Scottish National party have, and I am tempted to imagine that there is a pot of gold that can be spent on good causes, but I want to dwell a little on where the money comes from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000421">The sums that I have seen suggest that if we are talking purely about the existing windfall tax from the North sea&#151;the petroleum revenue tax and the extra rate of corporation tax&#151;if oil prices were maintained at their present level throughout the financial year, there could be an extra &#163;6 billion from that source and, on similar assumptions, &#163;3 billion or &#163;4 billion from value added tax. That apparently quite large sum would come simply from higher oil prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08070953000422">There are two points to be made. First, we are talking about not a separate silo, but a single stream of Government revenue. What is happening to oil revenue is no different from what is happening to stamp duty or income tax.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="9 July 2008">

<notus-date day="9" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>9 July 2008 : Column 1452</b><br>
Some taxes are going up, while others are going down. This is not free money waiting to be allocated, and if it were allocated to something else there would presumably be an opportunity cost. That is the obvious point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08070953000423">Secondly, there is a slightly more subtle point, which I think the Financial Secretary was trying to make, although I do not know how subtle it proved to be because I had to leave the Chamber. It is an economic point: as the fact that oil prices are rising contributes to a slow-down in the economy and therefore has an impact on income tax, corporation tax and all the other taxes that are going down, it is questionable whether there is a net revenue gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000424">I am on the Financial Secretary&#146;s side, and I am somewhat sceptical about the existence of a net gain. The think-tanks have clearly reflected on the matter, which they consider to be complex, and they have not come up with any definitive conclusions. I think it would help the Government to make their own case, not only with Opposition parties but in the drawing rooms and pubs of Britain, if they explained the model that they use to produce their figures. I do not know whether the outcome would be positive or negative, but I think it would increase their credibility if they explained their calculations rather than the Financial Secretary simply telling us that she has the information on good authority. After all, it may or may not be good authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08070953000425">The hon. Member for Putney spoke of the new approach to the duty regulator. She is to be commended for coming up with a new idea that deserves serious discussion, and although I think that she will acknowledge that it is based largely on an idea that the Scottish nationalists have been advancing for some years, it has joined the mainstream of the debate, so let us discuss it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08070953000426">On the basis of what the hon. Lady said today and what I heard her say on the radio during the rain intervals at Wimbledon on Sunday, I think that I have pieced the argument together, and I do not think what she is saying is enormously different from what the Government are doing. When oil prices rise, a decision is made not to increase the escalator. The difference is that the Government do that on an ad hoc basis, while the hon. Lady suggests that it should be done according to a formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08070953000427">During our last debate on the cost of living, the Chief Secretary acknowledged that the price of petrol had been reduced by, I think, about 16p a litre as a result of the freezing of the escalator since 1999. The hon. Member for Putney argues that such action could be taken more effectively if it were taken systematically. Her explanation&#151;it was more detailed on the radio than it was today&#151;is that because there is a cycle in prices, we can be reasonably confident that when prices rise the duty can be withheld, and when they fall again it can be increased. It all balances out in tax-neutral way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08070953000428">The problem is that the oil market does not actually work in cycles. In the 19th century, when Daniel Day-Lewis was drilling for oil, there was a cycle, and then for the best part of a century there was not, because the oil industry was controlled by companies that had access to cheap oil. They controlled the supply to keep the price flat. Since then, we have had three rather random shocks: one caused by a cartel, one caused by a war and one caused by specifically economic conditions&#151;rapidly rising demand in Asia and restrictions in capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08070953000429">I think that to create a model based on the idea that there is some regular cycle, as the Conservatives seem to be proposing, does not correspond to the way the system works. To make their proposal work, they would need a reference price&#151;a trend price&#151;against which they could make judgments on whether the price was above or below normal. The price would have to be established somehow, and I do not know how they would establish it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08070953000430">The honest truth is that no one, whether they know a lot about the oil industry or not, has the faintest idea what will happen to world oil prices. They could continue to rise indefinitely, as some theorists argue. If that were to happen, under this proposal there would have to be a permanent freeze on increased revenue, leading to a black hole of some kind which would have to be explained. The price might come right back down again because of a recession or increased supply, in which case the Conservatives would be able to pick up revenue, but they have not explained whether that would be possible to the extent of cancelling out the original concession, and whether there would be indexing. It would all be very difficult, although I do not want to be too damning, because the idea may be in its preliminary stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08070953000431">The hon. Lady was absolutely right to say that what she proposes would stabilise the impact on households. That is obviously true, and it is an advantage of her approach. It is, however, untrue to say, as she did, that it would stabilise Government revenue, because it would do the opposite. That is a simple matter of logic&#151;it must destabilise Government revenue. When the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal is analysed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others, they will make that point very strongly. Putting in the hands of a future Chancellor a policy that destabilises Government revenue would not be terribly helpful. Perhaps we should return to the issue later, but it has some relevance to the debate, because the motion refers to the potential source of oil revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08070953000432">The Conservatives are pushing their constructive idea on oil prices, and I am pushing mine on the housing market. I want briefly to refer to, as the hon. Member for East Londonderry has mentioned, the impact of the slow-down in the housing market in the Province. I should, perhaps, be less kind now to the Financial Secretary, as we had a debate a few months ago on what was happening in the housing market, and I ask her to read some of the things she said then, when I was accused of scaremongering, exaggerating and finding doom in that otherwise happy corner of the economy. If she looks back, she will find that what I was saying was deeply conservative compared with what is now happening with the falls in sales and prices and the ripples felt in the building industry, which have had devastating consequences, and which none of us, including me, had anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08070953000433">I commend to the Financial Secretary an idea that I and others, including some Labour Members, have been putting forward. One way of helping to stabilise the situation, and also of doing an important social good, would be to take advantage of the fact that there are now substantial amounts of unsold property and unfinished developments&#151;including, I suspect, in the fairly prosperous suburbs around Belfast and elsewhere&#151;which social landlords such as the council and registered  <br>

social landlords could acquire at a very substantial discount and make available for rent on the basis of need. There is a major opportunity for the Government not to intervene directly, but to empower social landlords to do that. It would be a very attractive economic proposition. I am aware that it would raise borrowing levels, but as an economic intervention, it would be a sensible and helpful thing to do, and I ask the Government to reflect on that.</p>

 I am sure that those at home who might be watching this debate will be saying to themselves, &#147;We&#146;re not interested in the technicalities of why there are difficulties; we&#146;re interested in how much money will be in our bank accounts and pockets to pay bills.&#148; Come September, households will have to face buying school uniforms and other things for their kids, and shortly after that we will be facing the Christmas period. Those of us who do a lot of work on the large housing estates in our constituencies will know exactly how those folk have to live. This is a very difficult time for them. The Financial Secretary mentioned the word downturn in relation to the economy. I am sure that Members will agree that this is more than just a downturn. The debate focuses on Northern Ireland, but I believe that the whole of the United Kingdom will face a very difficult time over the next three to four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08070953000435">I wish to rehearse certain points and facts mentioned in the debate that need to be reiterated. The price of oil has reached an all-time high, and that is causing a major difficulty. Petrol prices have surged in the last year, and motorists across the United Kingdom are paying in the region of &#163;14.3 million more per day than they were 12 months ago. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) mentioned transport. It is a vital and integral part of delivering goods and services not only in Northern Ireland, but across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08070953000436">The Financial Secretary is currently absent from the Chamber, but I wish to pay tribute to her. She visited Northern Ireland on Monday past in her Treasury role in order to investigate the issue of the illegal fuel that is coming into Northern Ireland via the Republic of Ireland. That is a major difficulty. As Members know, there was a large lobby here last week, and we met representatives from a number of transport companies from Northern Ireland who told us about the difficulties they were facing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08070953000437">Reference has again been made to the south of Ireland and the economy, and I am very glad that my party did not move towards having an all-Ireland economy as recommended by the party of the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). If we had done so, we would be facing even more difficulties, because the so-called Celtic tiger which, we were told, was on fire for so many years, is starting to wither like grapes on a vine. Sadly, it is going down the tubes, as we in Northern Ireland would say. We did not go down such an all-Ireland route, but the Government must pay attention to the issue of the fuel coming into Northern Ireland illegally.</p>

 Surely the case for an all-Ireland economy is reinforced by the current situation? Part of the answer for consumers to the question of energy costs is to make sure that we have a more active competitive market, and the way forward on that is to have a strong island market and then a stronger market within these islands.</p>

 To a certain extent, I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. However, he will know that in November last year we linked up our electricity through an interconnector, but we are told that Northern Ireland will not receive the benefit of that for some years, and the reason is that the power plants in the Republic of Ireland are so old that they need a lot of investment in repairs and so forth to come up to the level of what we would term efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08070953000442">Farming and food production make a major contribution to the Northern Ireland economy, more so than in any other region in the United Kingdom. Agriculture contributes 0.5 per cent. towards the total gross value added across the United Kingdom, but the figure for Northern Ireland is 1.3 per cent. It therefore follows that pressures in agriculture are felt twice as much in Northern Ireland as they are across the United Kingdom as a whole. The farmers in Northern Ireland also experience twice the degree of hardship as a result of rises in the cost of feed and grain. Across the United Kingdom, 28 per cent. of gross output comes from the cattle, sheep, pig and poultry industries, while the proportion for Northern Ireland is 43 per cent. As a result, Northern Ireland farmers have to purchase more than twice the amount of feedstuff as their mainland counterparts and must therefore bear the cost of grain prices, which have exploded in recent months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08070953000443">The Government may not control oil production by OPEC, but they do control the amount of taxation levied on fuel, and the UK has the greatest tax burden on fuel of any of the EU countries. The tax on a litre of petrol in Britain is some 57p, compared with 31p in Spain, 45p in Italy, 48p in France and 52p in Germany. The Exchequer has the power to reduce the cost of fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80709-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08070953000444">Unfortunately, whenever there is a downturn in the overall economy, small businesses are especially affected. The Federation of Small Businesses has given us some figures on the difficulties that its members are experiencing. A poll carried out by the federation showed that 9,000 small business owners&#151;more than 80 per cent. of those surveyed&#151;said that fuel costs are likely to make it more difficult for them to expand their business and hire more staff in the next 12 months. Nearly 40 per cent. said that fuel costs would make it likely that they would have to reduce staff numbers in the next 12 months.</p>

The businesses that provide those jobs have major concerns that if this trend continues&#151;as economists tell us it will&#151;they will have to pay off massive numbers of staff. That is a sad reflection on the state of manufacturing industry, which is dwindling in many parts of the UK. The Government could do more. Their amendment goes some way, but it does not go far enough. More could be done to help people, not only in Northern Ireland, but across the UK, to get out of the poverty that they are in.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson), who is always worth listening to. His experience in Northern Ireland is most helpful to this debate, but so are his comments about the rest of the United Kingdom. I also wish to congratulate the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) on his reasoned and thoughtful introduction to the debate.</p>

How can they oppose a motion that proposes the consideration of ways to protect the poorest in our society?</p>

This is not a &#147;new Labour&#148; Government: there is nothing new about them. They are like any old Labour Government: they tax and spend, tax and spend, and then destroy the economy. Then a Conservative Government come into power and have to spend many months fixing the mess that they have inherited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08070953000452">I suppose that there is one difference. Former Prime Minister Blair tried to hide the tax increases so that people did not notice them, but now the stealth taxes are coming home to roost. The current Prime Minister does not bother. He does not even try to hide the tax increases. He scrapped the 10p rate of tax, harming millions of our most disadvantaged citizens, but at the same time the Government continue to waste millions and millions of pounds on useless projects. Before a Labour Member jumps up&#151;oh, there is no one on the Labour Benches apart from the Minister and the Parliamentary Private Secretary&#151;</p>

 I would not say that, because for important debates, such as regulatory reform tomorrow, the Labour Benches will be packed.

Why not scrap the Standards Board for England, saving &#163;12 million a year? Why are we building new driving test centres across the country, costing &#163;71 million?

the European Union like other countries did. Instead, the Government said, &#147;Let&#146;s spend &#163;71 million. It&#146;s only taxpayers&#146; money so it doesn&#146;t matter.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08070953000455">All that expenditure pushes up taxes and increases the cost of living. As we heard earlier, from both sides of the House, it is extraordinary that when our lorry drivers fill up with diesel they pay 50.35p per litre, whereas our continental cousins pay just 25p. Those additional costs work through and increase the cost of living. It does not stop there. I know that the hon. Member for Upper Bann mentioned some figures for the rate of tax paid on every litre of petrol by private motorists, but I have obtained the latest figures from the Library which show that 70p in every litre goes to VAT and duty. Every time the price of petrol increases, another 17.5 per cent. is added in VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08070953000456">What is the latest wheeze? What will the Government waste our money on next? Of course, they never say &#147;taxpayers&#146; money&#148;. It is always &#147;Government spending&#148; or &#147;Government investment&#148;. They really mean that they are taking money from the taxpayers&#146; pockets, and spending it on their pet projects. The next wheeze is that tomorrow, in this House, they will try to get through the final stages of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill&#151;the &#147;Yes Minister&#148; Bill, for short. The House is being asked to set up a department of administrators and bureaucrats to control other administrators and regulators at a cost of &#163;73 million. The idea could have come straight out of &#147;Yes Minister&#148;. It is the department of administrative affairs in everything but name and Jim Hacker would have been proud of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08070953000457">At a time of economic crisis, with the Government in complete disarray, what is the Government&#146;s solution? It is to set up a department of administrators to administer other administrators. Only this Government could come up with that solution: &#147;Let&#146;s create more administrators so that the Government can be more efficient.&#148; That is a most courageous decision by the Prime Minister, who is in deep crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000458">It might be said that saving &#163;71 million here and &#163;73 million there is nothing&#151;it is chickenfeed in relation to the Government&#146;s overall spending. Of course, that is true, but if you look after the pennies the pounds look after themselves. In Government terms, if they look after the millions, the billions will look after themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000459">Let us look at the areas where the Government have really been wasteful at the cost of billions of pounds. Government spending on health care when Labour came into power was &#163;42.7 billion, or under 14 per cent. of public expenditure. That rocketed last year to &#163;107.2 billion, about 20 per cent. of public expenditure. That massive additional cost to the taxpayer has not brought an equivalent improvement in health care. Far from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08070953000460">Health care outcomes, as measured by finished consultant episodes, have risen from just under &#163;12 million in 1998-99 to just under &#163;15 million in 2006-07, an increase of 23.7 per cent. In the same period, Government health spending increased from &#163;47.1 billion to &#163;97.4 billion, an incredible increase of &#163;50.3 billion and a cash increase of 107 per cent. When adjusted for inflation, that was an increase of 74 per cent. The taxpayer is paying, in real terms, 74 per cent. more and getting only a 23 per cent. increase in outcome. That is clearly a massively  <br>

disproportionate increase. Vast sums of money have been poured into health care but the focus has not been on improving efficiency and outcomes. That money has been wasted at a time when we are in economic crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08070953000461">Let us look at the cost of living in relation to health care. Unbelievably, that cost is &#163;5,000 a year for each family and each household in the country. It will increase this year to at least &#163;5,200 per household. The next Conservative Government would concentrate on outcomes, not artificial targets and would give power to the clinicians&#151;the people who understand how to improve the quality of health care in this country. That would dramatically improve the outcomes for the public without increasing costs. The Conservatives want to move the operation of the health service out of the hands of politicians, into the hands of doctors and nurses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000462">Let me turn now to the real scandal, which is the complete and unjustified waste of taxpayers&#146; money that is our contribution to the European Union. Last year, the net contribution paid to the EU out of taxpayers&#146; pockets was an extraordinary &#163;4.7 billion. It is beyond my comprehension how on earth there could be any justification for paying that sort of money so that we can be part of a free trade area. The truth is that we pay &#163;10.3 billion to Europe and some bureaucrats in Europe decide to give us some back for their pet projects. Our net contribution is &#163;4.7 billion. That would be bad enough, yet the Government have already forced through the House the budget until 2011 and in that year the net contribution that taxpayers will have to pay will be &#163;6.8 billion. We pay &#163;4.7 billion for very little in return, and we are due to increase that by 45 per cent. in 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08070953000463">Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show that the common agricultural policy adds &#163;10 per week to the average family&#146;s cost of living. What do we expect to get from the huge increase in payments to the EU? We have no guarantee that the cost of the CAP will be reduced. My suggestion, which would save an enormous amount of money for the Government without harming us in any way, is to freeze our contribution to the EU at the current &#163;4.7 billion until there is real reform of the CAP, which in turn would reduce the cost of living. Better still, why do we not take a lesson from the previous Conservative Government? When we left power, the contribution to the EU was &#163;1.6 billion.</p>

If that were true, why have they not done something about the CAP? Why are the world trade talks stalled? It is because the EU is so protectionist. The idea that this Government have been at the heart of Europe is a farce. If they have been at the heart of Europe, they have achieved nothing&#151;and I notice that the Minister is not leaping to her feet to defend the Government&#146;s appalling record in the EU&#151;</p>

 I am not sure that I can agree with the final comment made by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone). In many ways, I do not believe that the cost of living should be such a party political issue because, as the Minister and others have said, there are many matters that are out of the control of Westminster politicians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08070953000472">A lot has been said about the problems of poverty connected to the current change of economic pace, especially for the hardest-hit families. We have talked a lot about fuel poverty, but I want to say something about a group of people, the middle classes, who are often ignored these days. Quite rightly, they are not a political priority, and they are not usually affected by changes to the economy, but my judgment is that the current downturn&#151;or beginning of recession, whatever one may wish to call it&#151;is starting to impact on a new group of people. I am talking about those hard-working couples&#151;they often have two children, and often both parents are working&#151;who risk being ignored by politicians. Suddenly, and for the first time, they are finding that they are being hit very hard indeed by the cost of living. Of course, it is absolutely right that the Government, with their winter fuel allowance and various tax credit schemes, focus on the poorest in society, but let us not ignore those others&#151;the many hard-working individuals&#151;who fall outside the schemes and are suffering and finding things tough. I want to link that point to the groups in rural communities who, given their dependency on vehicles and on certain forms of energy, are finding things particularly tough.</p>

I do not for a minute suggest that it is a scientific survey, and I hope that the questions were not leading. I can see that the Minister is cynical about the prospect of any politician being able to put in a newspaper anything without a political word in it, but the survey is totally non-political. I am genuinely interested  <br>

in finding out some information, and to be perfectly honest, I am not standing at the next election, so there is no political gain from my doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08070953000474">The responses so far have been quite alarming. They show that the groups being hit by the changing economic climate are not those who are usually hit. The figures suggest that 90 per cent. of people who filled in the survey believe that they are going to be worse off this time next year, and in line with the some of the more respected surveys from various think tanks and groups, there is certainly doom and pessimism about where the situation is heading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08070953000475">In the survey, we looked at four indicators: people&#146;s attitudes towards food prices, fuel, energy and housing. On each, there was pessimism and concern about what might happen. Petrol is a particular concern for Members who represent large rural constituencies. Often, families are dependent not on one car but on two, and people said to me in the survey that it now costs them about &#163;20 a week more to fill up their cars. I suspect that, anecdotally, we could all say the same. I can remember when it cost me &#163;50 to fill my car up about a year and a half ago; it certainly costs me &#163;70 now. It is the same for my wife, which means that it costs &#163;40 a week extra to fill our car up, and although I was off the day we did maths at school, that to me is a lot of money each month&#151;about &#163;160 a month extra just to fill up the car for many couples living in rural communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08070953000476">That is an awful lot of extra income to find and to absorb, and when the Government and others say, &#147;Yes, but there could be a hidden benefit, in that it might persuade people to use alternative transport,&#148; I must say that I would be laughed at in the 56 villages in my constituency if I told people to try to take a bus, a train or another form of transport. For couples with children, trying to do school runs or having to take complicated routes, there is just no rural transport network that can act as a realistic alternative. Some respondents to the survey said that where there had been the opportunity to walk to a post office or to a shop as an alternative, those rural post offices have now disappeared&#151;even more requirement, therefore, to get into the car and absorb those increased petrol costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08070953000477">The second indicator was energy prices, and the survey shows that individuals&#146; electricity, gas and fuel costs have been increased by about 20 per cent. However, owing to the focus on rural areas, I want to talk about those individuals who are not able to obtain gas but are dependent on oil to heat their homes and to provide their fuel. They have faced an enormous increase in costs. I declare an interest, because my monthly direct debit for oil is &#163;225 and has gone up enormously over the past two or three years. If one gathers together any group of individuals in villages or communities that cannot obtain gas, they first talk about trying to find a different oil provider in their area. The figures are enormous, and they are hitting rural communities very hard, because there is just no alternative for them. They cannot switch suppliers as one might do with gas; they are dependent on oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08070953000478">The regulation of gas and electricity would help enormously; I hope that the Minister will pick up on that point in her response. Ofgem and Energywatch are legally required to act as the consumers&#146; champion, to make sure that something at least is done on prices. However, oil for heating one&#146;s house and liquefied petroleum  <br>

gas fall outside the regulatory system. The Minister may or may not be aware that changes to the regulation of energy are due to be made in October and November. It would be enormously helpful to the millions of people who are dependent on oil if that form of fuel were also regulated, and if Ofgem looked at the matter, just as it does in relation to gas and electricity. My fear is that because that form of fuel has not been regulated, companies were able to get away with prices that would not have been acceptable in the gas and electricity markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08070953000479">Democratic Unionist party Members touched on energy prices and on the fact that individuals who pay by pre-pay meters lose out enormously. I am lucky enough to be on the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee, which has just concluded a study of energy prices. When the big six suppliers came to give evidence, I asked them to justify the fact that customers who use pre-pay meters pay 17 per cent. more than those who pay by direct debit. They struggled to do so. They claimed that a meter scheme was more expensive to administer. Of course there will be more administration costs for people who have meters than for people who pay by direct debit, but the increased costs are not equal to the increase in prices. It would help enormously if the Government could speed things up and look at ways of changing the market. The Government could do something about introducing smart meters, as opposed to pre-pay meters; they could help in that respect. Finally on energy, I asked one of the big six to try to give me an indication of how people were coping with increased bills. One of the representatives said that their company&#146;s bad debt had doubled in the past 12 months. That graphic statistic shows how difficult individuals are finding it to pay those bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08070953000480">The Minister did not really answer the question that I put to her in an intervention about the comparison between our energy prices and those in mainland Europe. It is my understanding, from the evidence that the Select Committee received, that owing to the way in which our market is constructed, we as consumers pay more for gas and electricity than our colleagues in mainland Europe. They, of course, face the same global economic problems that we do. We need to look at how the market is constructed in this country, because it is adding to our problems.</p>

 I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman says, but the reason for that situation is that we have a liberalised energy market, whereas our continental cousins have refused to implement the European Union rules on liberalisation.</p>

 The Committee has looked into the issue, but I shall not bore hon. Members with that. Anyway, the report is coming out soon, so I probably should not talk about it. However, there are several, complex issues behind the difference between the markets. What disappointed me as a member of the Select Committee was not being able to find two or three simple solutions to the problem. It is incredibly complex, but it certainly needs looking into, because we have a very complicated market. We need to consider restructuring it, but I shall not bore the House with the ways in which that should be done now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08070953000483">The third indicator that I wanted to touch on is housing. Let us be honest: in areas such as Winchester, most people&#146;s house price has rocketed in the past 10 to 15 years, and they felt very comfortable indeed about the way in which house prices had risen. It is interesting that 50 per cent. of those who filled in my survey said that there had been a fall in their house price. One would imagine Winchester to be one of the last areas in the country that would experience that kind of change. Interestingly, when one asks individuals whether the amount that they pay out each month for their mortgage has increased, the response is split. About half of respondents say that they have experienced an increase, and half say that they have not. I suspect that many of those individuals are still on fixed-term rates, which they have had for some time, and that those fixed-term rates are due to come to an end. In fact, the estimate is that a big change is due this summer, with about &#163;30 billion-worth of mortgages due to come off fixed rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08070953000484">The figures suggest that when the individuals involved try to come off their fixed rates, their average monthly outgoings on their mortgages will increase by about &#163;158 a month. Of course, that is if they can get a satisfactory new rate. It is not just individuals trying to get into the housing market who are struggling to get mortgages but those who are coming off fixed rates. For some, the hike in their rate can have an enormous impact on their monthly bills and the cost of living. It is of concern that in some cases, companies such as Bradford and Bingley, First Direct, the Co-op and the Royal Bank of Scotland&#151;in fact, nearly all of them&#151;have not set lower rates for fixed-rate deals. Many have increased them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08070953000485">I wish to mention two consequences of individuals struggling to pay their increased mortgages, or to get a mortgage in the first place. The first is the power of credit agencies to give people a bad rating, and the impact that that has on them. Many of my constituents have discovered that they cannot get a mortgage because three or four years ago, they missed a small payment on a utility or mobile phone bill. It is enormously difficult for people to track down what is affecting their credit rating. Given the credit crunch and the mortgage companies&#146; closer focus on whom they give money to, people need to be able to check more quickly and easily what is on their record that is causing them difficulties in getting credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80709-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08070953000486">The other consequence is that many people are now desperately taking out loans for inappropriate things. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) said that people are doing so to meet fuel bills, and there is a growing pattern of people borrowing money for all the wrong reasons to get themselves out of current financial difficulties. That, of course, perpetuates the problem.</p>

Ordinary, hard-working families in areas such as Winchester are starting to feel the pinch.</p>

In the past year, Northern Ireland has seen price increases of 19 per cent. for electricity, 28 per cent. for natural gas and coal, and 75 per cent. for oil. Combined with other increases in household bills, that gives great urgency to the need to tackle fuel poverty and the problem of many families going into poverty.

when it comes to their responsibility to govern the United Kingdom. If they do not desire to do so, they should step aside, hold an election and allow another Government to come to power. That is the way in which democracy works, and they have the option to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000495">While the Government have that responsibility, they must carry it out, and take the United Kingdom through these difficult economic times and the problems that we face. For example, people are finding things hard in Northern Ireland. The Consumer Council for Northern Ireland looked at the problem, and found that we paid 47 per cent. more for energy. Fuel poverty is double the average in Great Britain, and it is three times the percentage in England. Incomes are lower; and half of people who work are on gross earnings of &#163;330 or less a week. Benefit dependency is higher: one in six do not have a current account, compared with one in 10 in the rest of the United Kingdom. Those statistics simply mirror a greater problem, because we are talking about families, individuals, elderly people, disabled people, and normal individuals in society who face a credit crunch, which has impacted on their lives.</p>

 I am pleased to attend this debate, albeit that I arrived rather late, because I was chairing a meeting. Does my hon. Friend agree that people in rural areas in Northern Ireland, as in Norfolk, suffer the double dilemma of heating their home or buying food, added to which they face the problem that using a car in rural areas is a necessity, not a luxury, as local services have been shut down because of Government initiatives?</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend, and I am happy to acknowledge that point. I was coming on to speak about rural constituencies. Many people view a car, or even two cars for a family, as a luxury, but in reality, that is not so. For rural parts of Northern Ireland, Norfolk and any other rural region of the United Kingdom, the car is a necessity. Parents have to take their children to school&#151;they cannot keep them at home. They have to travel to the shops, because the arrival of the supermarkets means that many local shops have closed. We must therefore face the reality: we are not talking about a luxury, and we are not even talking about alternative modes of transport. For example, for people in rural parts of my constituency and other rural areas of Northern Ireland, the only alternative transport would be a horse and cart. Do we want to go back to those days? There are no buses or trains in rural parts, but we are now going to say to the people there that they cannot even use their cars because of fuel costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000498">Let us face the reality. We are talking about the realities for families, and that means fuel costs. The Government bear a responsibility for the situation. A few moments ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) and the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) were talking about percentages; when we add VAT to the fuel costs, we are certainly into the 70 per cent. That is a disgraceful situation, and the vast majority of people do not realise that they are being taken to the cleaners by the Government on fuel taxation. The Government are gaining the benefit.</p>

concerned. We and the Northern Ireland Assembly talk about renewables, but they are for the future, not the present. Unfortunately, we are behind the rest of Europe in taking renewable energy forward, but we are where we are and our people have to deal with the realities. The Northern Ireland fishing industry faces a bleak future; its fuel bills have soared at the very time when Europe demands that it should tie up its boats for most of the year. Fishing is allowed only a few days a year, so how will the fishermen keep their families and fuel their boats? Europe and the Government cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08070953000500">A few moments ago, the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) mentioned an important point. We have to look again at where the poverty trap is. Remember that in Northern Ireland wages are in many ways minimum wages. However, hard-working people, who go out every day to work, can be just beyond the boundary of getting any other help or benefit; they have to pay everything from their wages. In my opinion, those people are in a poverty trap today, and they need help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000501">The Government must carry a responsibility, because government should be all about seeking to help such people. I mentioned the statistics given by the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland: an extra &#163;60 a week is required for essentials for an average family of four, as at June 2008, because of fuel, food, heating and mortgage rates. To maintain the same standard of living as they had this time last year, the average family&#146;s income needs to have risen by 12.5 per cent. Furthermore, even as we speak in the House today, fuel costs are probably still going up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08070953000502">We face a tremendous challenge. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) said, we acknowledge that the Government gift for the fuel payment was certainly a move in the right direction. However, as the elderly face this winter, the measure is far short of meeting the real need. I say that not only about Northern Ireland, but about the whole United Kingdom. That situation has to be seriously considered.</p>

 Let me make it clear that as a party we do not take any pleasure in the current economic crisis that is affecting people not only in Northern Ireland but right across the United Kingdom. In the motion, we deliberately did not go out of our way to make a party political point against the Government. As my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) pointed out, the vast majority of people who are watching this debate&#151;if there are any&#151;or who are interested in the issue do not want to know about the macro-economic explanations or the political excuses. They are concerned about how they pay for the uniform that their youngster needs for school in September, how they pay their fuel bill or how they keep their car running. The motion was not designed to be confrontational. Of course, there is no political point for the DUP to make anyhow, because the Government do not put up candidates in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08070953000505">One of the reasons why I am disappointed that the Government found it necessary to table an amendment is that we wanted this debate to explore the possible options for dealing with the issues that are affecting people across the United Kingdom. I sometimes joke with the Scottish National party Members who sit in front of me that since I came into this House, every time there has been a problem the Prime Minister has referred back to 1997, as if all the problems that the Government faced were due to the mismanagement of the Conservative party during its years in government. Nowadays, we never hear him or other Ministers mentioning 1997, because they have found a new way of deflecting the blame: the explanation is not historical but global; the problem is somebody else&#146;s fault, or down to influences beyond our control. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) said, while things may well happen on a global stage, Governments cannot run away from their responsibility for managing the economy and dealing with the issues that arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08070953000506">Although we have not made the motion specific to Northern Ireland, Members in all parts of the House have referred to how Northern Ireland specifically is damaged by the increases in the cost of living. Ninety-six per cent. of our energy sources are imported, and therefore volatile in terms of changes in the value of sterling, and oil and gas prices. The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) talked about the problems that affect his rural constituency. The same problems have a great impact in Northern Ireland; our communities, who live largely in rural areas, are affected by the kinds of costs that are going up. A higher proportion of people are already on low incomes, and measures such as the 10p tax change have a disproportionate impact on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08070953000507">The situation does have some global reasons behind it, but it has been made worse by actions taken by the Government. I mentioned the 10p tax rate and the impact on the lower-paid. Even after the &#163;2.7 billion compensation package, there will still be people on incomes of less than &#163;7,500 who find themselves worse off at the end of this financial year. The increase in vehicle excise duty will catch 2.3 million households across the United Kingdom, many of whom can afford only second-hand cars. People do not understand why they should face an increased bill of &#163;250 per year in running their car so as to reduce global CO2 emissions. They do not see the connection between the well-being that is supposed to come from such a tax and the immediate problem that it causes them in running their much-needed car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08070953000508">The increased tax burden that people across the United Kingdom have faced gives them less disposable income. Since this Government took office in 1997, the tax burden has increased by 6.6 per cent. By the end of 2012, it will have increased by 8 per cent. That means people have less disposable income, which adds to their economic misery at a time of rising costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08070953000509">The Government have slavishly followed EU directives, and I shall just give one example&#151;the idea that we need to get 20 per cent. of our fuel from biofuels by 2020 to cut CO2 emissions. It has already been stated that 75 per cent. of the increase in food costs since 2002 is directly attributable to the fact that we now use grain and land to produce fuels that have no apparent impact on global warming anyway. But we slavishly follow those directives. I just wanted to illustrate some of the ways in which I believe the Government have made the situation worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08070953000510">I shall deal with some of the issues raised, and hon. Members have raised a wide range of them. The impact of the Government&#146;s macro-economic policies on people&#146;s well-being and on the cost of living in the UK cannot be ignored. In the Minister&#146;s defence, I must explain that she referred to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said&#151;I love this phrase&#151;that the fiscal tightening is appropriate. Let us get down to the bones of it: fiscal tightening means that people get more money taken out of their pockets. They have less disposable income. It is a lovely phrase, and the IMF has endorsed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08070953000511">The IMF has also endorsed the fiscal framework as correct. We start off from a position where Government borrowing has been rising. Since 2000, Government borrowing has risen by 20 per cent., and that borrowing started when we should have been putting money aside for the bad times. If we are talking about an economic situation that has been created by profligacy in the years when there should have been prudence, we may well reach the conclusion that the fiscal framework is correct. However, would that all have been necessary if proper economic policies had been pursued during the years when money should have been set aside?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08070953000512">Even taking into account the IMF&#146;s arguments that fiscal tightening is appropriate and that the fiscal framework is correct, I note that when it comes to a crisis that affects the Government, such fiscal tightening is suddenly no longer quite so important or such a priority. If there is a by-election, or a revolt on the Back Benches against the impact of tax policies on the poor and the less well-off, the fiscal purse strings can be loosened, and &#163;2.7 billion can be produced. The tightening does not seem to matter then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08070953000513">The motion says that there is a crisis&#151;one which affects a wide range of people. Those people now find it impossible to pay their fuel bills. They are people on low incomes, or old people who stay at home. It is fine for many of us here; I come to an office that is heated during the day, and I do not have to worry about heating my home. But I think of constituents who are confined to their house all day, who are living on a pension and who have to keep their heat on. When I visit them, I find that some of them have a coat on and a rug around them because they cannot afford to pay their fuel bills. To me, that warrants a little fiscal loosening, especially when money is available from additional fuel duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08070953000514">Let me deal with the Financial Secretary&#146;s second point, which several hon. Members supported. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said that perhaps there was merit in her argument. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) said that there should be greater transparency about it. Her argument is that increasing fuel prices do not mean that the Government have more revenue, because as fuel prices increase, people&#146;s disposable income decreases, so they spend less money on other things. I could take that if the Government&#146;s figures, which they produced in the Budget in March, showed that that was the case, but they do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08070953000515">I assume that the Budget and the figures were drawn up at the last possible moment, when we already knew that fuel prices were increasing. They did not just start to go up in the past month&#151;they have been increasing steadily. The increase has been a bit more rapid in the past couple of months, but prices have been rising for well over a year&#151;well before the figures were produced.  <br>

Yet, when we consider the matter against that background, and ask whether the Government predicted that VAT receipts would decrease overall or would stay the same, the answer is no. They predicted that in 2006 VAT receipts would be &#163;77.4 billion and that, even with rising fuel prices, they would increase to &#163;83.8 billion in 2008-09. The Government&#146;s figures do not bear out the Financial Secretary&#146;s argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08070953000516">The same applies to fuel duty, which has increased from &#163;23.6 billion to &#163;25.7 billion. That provides additional money, which could be used&#151;at least partly&#151;to tackle fuel poverty. My hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann and the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) made that point. On the Government&#146;s own admission, even at a time of rising fuel prices, money is available. If it can be found on other occasions, why cannot it be found now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08070953000517">Of course, there are many ways in which spending can be diverted. Although the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) was cut off in his prime, I was interested in his point about Government waste. It was probably just as well for the Financial Secretary that he was cut off for wandering off the subject, but his points were relevant. It is possible, even in the current financial framework, to consider how money might be better spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08070953000518">The motion was designed to start discussion and tease out from the Government how the windfall from rising oil prices could be spent and how to alleviate the difficult position in which many people find themselves. It was not meant to be confrontational, but the Government tabled an amendment that gives excuses rather than dealing with the problems that we wanted tackled.</p>

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="08070953000519"><a name="80709-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="08070953002932"><b>Mr. Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman mentioned rising oil prices. It was said earlier today in the Chamber that an extra dollar on the price of an oil barrel gives the Government an extra &#163;200 million in revenue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="08070953000520"><a name="80709-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="08070953002933"><b>Sammy Wilson:</b>
 The Government predicted that the oil price increases anticipated at the time of the Budget&#151;which were much lower than what subsequently transpired&#151;meant that they would have &#163;5.4 billion more in the next financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80709-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08070953000521">Perhaps the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has an answer to the problem, but, as several hon. Members pointed out&#151;even those who were supportive, such as the hon. Member for Twickenham&#151;if there is an economic model that shows no overall financial gain, it should at least be transparent. I know from teaching economics in school that the one cardinal rule when examining the way in which one variable affects another is that unless all other things are equal&#151;the old ceteris paribus; even a GCSE economics student will know that&#151;it is not possible to identify the cause and effect of a specific economic event. If the Economic Secretary intends to argue against the points that have been made, there should be transparency and an explanation of how the conclusion that the Financial Secretary outlined was reached.</p>

for many years the economy in Northern Ireland has been good. We have experienced the lowest rates of unemployment.

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08070953000524">In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the country, it is clear that the prices of food and fuel, and energy bills, are rising and that families are feeling the pinch as a result. That is no surprise, given the recent state of world oil and food prices, with oil up by 80 per cent. and food up by 40 per cent. in the year to May. However, Opposition Members may not like this, but it is a fact that our economy is well placed to respond to the disadvantageous global scenario, and that it is coping far better than it could have done in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08070953000525">Oil prices have increased fivefold in the last five years, in what is widely being described as the third oil price shock in living memory, but this time headline inflation has risen by less than 2 percentage points, as compared with a rise of nearly 20 percentage points during the first oil price shock in the mid 1970s and a rise of more than 10 percentage points during the second shock in the early 1980s. That, if nothing else, is a demonstration of the increased resilience of our economy after 11 years of low inflation&#151;the second lowest in the G7, in fact&#151;and steady and strong growth.</p>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="08070953000526"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="08070953002935"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>
 Can the Minister explain why, if we have the cheapest diesel in the Europe and the second lowest price for unleaded petrol, we pay the most tax?</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="08070953000527"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070953002936"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 That is not the case. In fact, we have fallen down the ranking in fuel duty taxation compared with other countries in Europe. Including tax and duty, the UK has the seventh lowest petrol price in the EU 15 and the 19th lowest in the EU 27. We have fallen from our habitual rank, when the Conservative party was in power, of second highest in the EU 15 to around the middle of the range, so I would politely suggest that the hon. Gentleman check his facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08070953000528">In the past 10 years, real household disposable income has risen substantially, by more than 30 per cent., and income per head has risen faster than in any other G7 country, taking us from the bottom of the pile to second place. We are now second in the G7 in terms of GDP per capita, whereas before 1997 we were bottom. We have experienced the fastest rise in income per head of any G7 country since 1997. Real disposable income  <br>

increased by 25 per cent. between 1997 and 2006. Most importantly, growth for the bottom 40 per cent. of people in our country is greater than that for richer households. Employment has also risen by around 3 million, to record highs. The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) tried to imply that things were worse under this Government than under previous Governments, but the facts do not bear her out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08070953000529">In Northern Ireland, as my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said earlier, the economy is stronger, with unemployment halved&#151;it is now the third lowest of any UK region&#151;and 100,000 more people in work than was the case under the previous Conservative Government. We are seeing progress all the time, as the new era of stability in Northern Ireland brings new investment and jobs. This means that Northern Ireland, like the rest of the UK, can respond far more strongly to the challenges that we all face. We cannot be complacent, however. We need to work to tackle the causes of these challenges and to support people in the meantime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08070953000530">Obviously, no national Government by themselves can stop world fuel and food prices rising or end a global credit squeeze, but we are working with our international partners at every level, because these challenges need international solutions. As I have said, we also need to support people in the meantime. We are doing that through the delay in the planned April fuel duty increase and, yes, the Chancellor is carefully considering the October increase. We are also supporting people through the increases in personal allowances this year and through the additional payments that will be made with the winter fuel payment this winter in the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland. We will continue to support people in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08070953000531">I want to turn now to the specific points that have been raised in today&#146;s very useful debate. We challenged the hon. Member for Putney about her own policy during her speech. She mentioned a fuel stabiliser policy, but, when challenged, she said that it was not a policy, simply a consultation. That is yet another example of the Conservatives using salesman-like tactics to get in through the front door of our nation&#146;s households, even though they would be unable to follow them through.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="08070953000532"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="08070953002937"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 When Ministers have gone through the absolute disaster of not consulting properly on issues such as non-doms and capital gains tax, the one lesson that they ought to take from us is on consultation. It is sensible to consult, to make sure that we get things right first time. That is something that we have learned from the Government&#146;s getting it wrong.</p>

<p><a name="st_o246"><a name="08070953000533"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="08070953002938"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 I confidently look forward to this so-called consultation being quietly dropped because the plan simply would not work. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) gave one reason why it would not work, with which I absolutely agree. His understanding of the Conservatives&#146; consultation/policy/not-quite-sure-what-we&#146;re-talking-about was that it would rely on a cyclical oil price, so that households and motorists could be subsidised when oil prices rose, and it would pay itself back when the oil price was in the other half of its cycle. He rightly pointed out, however, that that would not work because oil prices are not cyclical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08070953000534">However, the main problem with the Conservatives&#146; consultation/policy/not-quite-sure-what-we&#146;re-talking-about is that it would require an automatic correlation between the international price of oil and the effect on the public purse. They are effectively saying that if the international oil price rose because of decisions taken in different countries by OPEC, there would automatically be a channel of funding that would go from the public purse to the motorist. If I were a nurse, a doctor or a teacher in this country, I would be extremely worried by what the Conservatives might, or might not, be proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08070953000535">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) finished what might politely be called a wide-ranging speech by saying that his was the party that would control public expenditure. At the same time, however, those on his own Front Bench are saying that they would not control public expenditure, but would simply hand out taxpayers&#146; money on the basis of what was happening to the international oil price.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="08070953000536"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="08070953002939"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 The doctors, nurses and policemen who would have their fuel prices reduced by the stabiliser would welcome that policy. This party is interested in looking after the consumer. The Government are trying to reduce their borrowing because of their inefficient running of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="08070953000537"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew5"><a name="08070953002940"><b>Kitty Ussher:</b>
 It is the overall state of the economy that we are interested in, and we will not play fast and loose with the public finances through cheap gimmicky policies like those being proposed by the Conservative salesperson in order to get in through the front door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08070953000538">My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan), who is no longer in his place, made a useful contribution to the debate and raised several issues to which I should like to respond. First, he expressed understandable concern that the price of oil is being driven by speculators, and asked whether we could intervene to prevent trading in oil futures. The issue is being looked into by the Financial Services Authority, although I have to say that there has been no indication of any inappropriate inactivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08070953000539">Secondly, my hon. Friend asked what we were doing to help people to cope. We understand, of course, as I said in my opening statement, the significant difficulties faced by families feeling the pinch. At such a time, it is right for the Government to use whatever resources are at their disposal to ensure that everybody&#151;whether they be working class or middle class&#151;has access to good impartial advice. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) mentioned the middle classes, but I am not accusing everyone on the Liberal Democrat Benches of actually being middle class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08070953000540">We want everybody to have good financial advice in what we all recognise as a difficult time. That is why in recent weeks we have expanded by &#163;10 million our debt advice funding and why, together with my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, we made a substantial policy announcement earlier this week on the whole issue of financial capability. That includes not only a significant &#163;12 million pilot in the north-east and north-west, taking forward the work of Otto Thoresen in order vastly to improve access to so-called generic or non-product-tied financial advice, but rolling out a programme through schools and the workplace for accessing good financial advice at this important time. That involves an  <br>

expanded helpline available nationally, including to people in Northern Ireland, as a one-stop shop to signpost people to the advice most suited to their needs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o249"><a name="08070953000541"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="08070953002941"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>
 If the Minister is saying that the Government are serious about people suffering from fuel poverty, why have they cut the Warm Front budget for the next three years?</p>

 My experience is that the services offered through Warm Front are expanding. We have the potential to do that, and I certainly see increasing numbers of people in my own constituency taking advantage of what Warm Front has to offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08070953000543">Let me address an issue raised by Members of all parties&#151;whether the Government have a tax revenue windfall from the rise in oil prices. The simple answer is that there is absolutely no correlation between the international price of oil and what the Government actually receive. That is one reason why the hon. Member for Putney is wrong to imply that money is necessarily coming in; as I said in an earlier intervention, an analysis done by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that.</p>

 May I give way after I have finished explaining my point, as it may answer the hon. Lady&#146;s question?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08070953000546">The key point is that we cannot look at North sea revenues in isolation. Higher oil prices will, of course, boost revenues from petroleum revenue tax and North sea corporation tax, but a number of offsetting effects limit the overall impact on the public finances. We have already made this argument: fuel duty is set as a constant amount per litre of fuel sold, and it does not go up as a result of fuel price rises. When consumer spending on fuel goes up, there is likely to be a separate effect elsewhere in the economy, leaving the overall level of VAT revenues broadly unchanged. Of course businesses, including road hauliers, can reclaim the VAT that they spend on fuel as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08070953000547">Higher oil prices have temporarily pushed up inflation, and as most tax and social security benefits are linked to inflation, this will reduce income tax receipts and boost Government spending from April 2009. Higher inflation also increases the cost of servicing index-linked bonds, and higher oil costs could mean smaller profits for companies that have to spend more of their income on fuel, thus leading to reduced Government receipts from that source, and all this depends on the impact on the wider economy. I hope that that picks up a number of points raised by Members in the debate. We will, of course, update all our forecasts in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="st_o253"><a name="08070953000548"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew10"><a name="08070953002945"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 The Minister says that there is &#147;absolutely no correlation&#148; between oil prices and Government revenues. Is she really saying that the Government have some random way of assessing revenues, depending on oil price changes? Surely, there has to  be a model showing some kind of correlation, albeit a complex one.</p>

effects on the public finances. Many other factors are involved, such as the way in which mechanisms operate throughout the economy. As I said, we will update all our forecasts for revenues and the wider economy at the time of the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08070953000550">I do not want to intervene in the debate between the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle, but I thank the hon. Member for Upper Bann for his mixed metaphor about the Celtic tiger which had been on fire withering on the vine. I shall bear it in mind when I consider the economy of the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80709-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08070953000551">The United Kingdom is well placed to respond to the international economic challenges that we face. That also goes for Northern Ireland, where the economy is far stronger than in the past, partly because of the Government&#146;s economic policies but also, of course, because of the new era of stability. Politicians in Northern Ireland have had the chance to build on that stability and to secure more investment and more jobs by completing devolution, which includes signalling their willingness to achieve agreement on the transfer of policing and criminal justice powers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o255"><a name="08070953000552"><a name="80709-0013.htm_spnew12"><a name="08070953002947"><b>Mr. Gregory Campbell:</b>
 The Minister presumably accepts that she is a member of a Government who, for whatever reason, are deeply unpopular at the moment, as a sequence of by-elections appears to show. Today&#146;s debate raised a core issue affecting tens of millions of people throughout the United Kingdom, and gave the Government an opportunity to introduce steps to deal with the deepening problems that people are facing out there. Is not their lack of ideas in this regard an example of what makes them so deeply unpopular?</p>

That is not to say, however, that families are not feeling the pinch, in Northern Ireland as much as elsewhere. Energy bills, petrol and food are all significantly more expensive than they were a year ago, and that is creating tougher times.</p>

We are continuing to support the people of this country during difficult times, and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

 Before we start the debate, it may help if I offer the House guidance on the scope of debate on the order. The order applies to Lincolnshire police authority. The authority was originally considered for capping, along with six other police authorities and Portsmouth city council. The debate may cover the position of Lincolnshire police authority and refer to the fact that the other seven authorities are not to be capped, but it would not be in order to focus exclusively on those authorities that are not being capped, as they are not covered by the order. I hope that that is helpful to the House.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80709-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08070953001569">The order will be made under section 52F(4) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. As you have said, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it caps the rise in council tax levied by Lincolnshire police authority this year. It is the only one of our decisions on eight designated authorities that requires parliamentary action at this stage, and that decision is therefore the focus of our debate this afternoon. Subject to the House&#146;s approval, the order will be made, and I will issue a notice to the Lincolnshire authority about its maximum 2008-09 budget requirement&#151;in other words, its cap. The authority will then have to recalculate its budget so that it is at or below that maximum, and recalculate its precept on the council tax. It will then have to arrange for the district councils, as billing authorities, to send out revised council tax bills for the current year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80709-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08070953001570">In December and February, I said in statements to the House on the formula grant distribution for 2008-09 that keeping council tax under control remains a high priority for the Government. I said that we expected the average council tax increase in England to be substantially below 5 per cent. this year. I also said that we would not hesitate to use our reserve council tax capping powers as necessary to protect council tax payers from excessive council tax increases. No authority could have been unclear about our intent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80709-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08070953001571">Most authorities recognised the public concern about council tax levels, particularly at this time, when all households are under pressure. Some 98 per cent. of authorities did not set excessive increases; two thirds set increases below 4.1 per cent.; one in six set increases below 2.5 per cent. this year; and a further 21 authorities either did not increase council tax or reduced it. That means that this year there has been the lowest average increase in council tax for 14 years at just 4 per cent. Alongside that, by 2010-11, central Government grant for local government will have increased by 45 per cent. above inflation, and it has consistently remained above inflation each and every year for the past decade. Also, investment in police has more than doubled since 1997, with an extra &#163;3.6 billion. Funding is higher and councils are deciding to keep tax rises lower. The threat of council tax capping is helping to keep those rises down.</p>

As a result, as I explained in my statement to the House on 27 March, we designated eight authorities&#151;seven police authorities and one local authority&#151;with a view to capping them in-year. All eight authorities challenged their proposed cap, as is their right. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing and I met all seven police authorities together to hear their cases in person, and I also met Portsmouth city council to hear its case. Having considered carefully the representations that they made to us, I made a statement to the House on 26 June.</p>

 I thank my hon.

 That will indeed be the case. We propose to designate Leicestershire, Warwickshire and Cheshire police authorities for next year and allow them a maximum council tax increase of 3 per cent. When we formally announce the confirmation of that, there will be an opportunity for them to make representations, which we will take into account.

It will be equivalent to a 26 per cent. increase in council tax, rather than the 79 per cent. increase that it planned.</p>

We have gone further than that and allowed an increase of &#163;5.7 million.

 The Minister has acknowledged in the House that Lincolnshire has specific problems, and he was good enough to seek and receive representations from the authority. Given the history of policing in Lincolnshire, the need to develop the service offered is profound&#151;a &#147;rock-solid&#148; case, in the chief constable&#146;s words. The budget may allow Lincolnshire police to stand still, but surely it will not allow it to grow and develop in the way that it wishes.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is always assiduous in making a strong case for his area&#146;s interests, but the police authority budget, following the action that I have proposed to the House, means that the authority will have more than &#163;10 million above the level of last year&#146;s budget. It can add a 26 per cent. rise on its council tax precept, which is more than it said that it needed to set a balanced budget. We have taken into careful account the full case made by the authority, both in writing and in person to my right hon.

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way&#151;he has been extremely generous.

 The decision reflects aspects of the case, to which we listened carefully and which we accepted, made by the police authority, which challenged our original decision under the set process. However, the hon. Gentleman must take into account the fact that this year Lincolnshire police authority has received the fourth-largest rise in police grant of any police authority in the country. It is therefore not the case&#151;this cannot seriously be argued&#151;that the Government have not taken into account the pressures faced by Lincolnshire police authority. It is not right&#151;I have not heard any Opposition Member argue for this&#151;that that police authority should be able to impose a 79 per cent. increase in council tax on Lincolnshire council tax payers this year.</p>

 Perhaps the Minister has missed the principle. I served on Newcastle city council when it was capped by a Conservative Government, and I remember the objections from the Labour party and Labour councillors to the principle of central Government making that diktat. Surely, it is up to voters in the local area to make the judgment and decide whether they agree with the decisions and so on, rather than requiring an intervention from Westminster.</p>

 These are reserve powers. The decision to cap is not one that the Government take lightly.

up to 12.9 per cent. It is not fair on local council tax payers if authorities set excessive increases. It is right that we have a reserve power and that we use it carefully and in a considered way, which is precisely how we have used it in the circumstances that we face this year.</p>

 I do not want to pursue a dialogue with the Minister, but he cannot have it both ways. Either he is saying that capping is an acceptable principle, in which case Labour would have been wrong to oppose it in the Conservative years, or alternatively he must accept the case that I have made, which is that it is wrong in principle, whatever one thinks about the 79 per cent. increase, for central intervention to squeeze out local democratic control.</p>

 I am interested that the hon. Gentleman is saying that the Liberal Democrats would abolish council tax capping. I mentioned earlier the risk that that poses to many council tax payers in local authority areas. It may not be desirable, but my argument is that it is necessary, which is why we have those powers in legislation. It is necessary in the particular case of Lincolnshire police authority this year. We are using those powers, and I have explained to the House and set out in the order precisely how and at what level we propose to do so.</p>

Parliamentary procedure will be required for the three authorities that we propose to designate and restrict to a 3 per cent. increase next year and the following year. No parliamentary procedure is involved in setting notional budget requirements, as we have done for the other four nominated authorities.</p>

However, there is no excuse for setting an excessive council tax increase, and we remain ready to use the powers when necessary. I hope and believe that many people&#151;particularly those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners&#151;will welcome our determination to reduce the council tax burden in Lincolnshire this year. That will also help to protect residents in other authorities against excessive increases in future years.</p>

That, of course, will require rebilling in Lincolnshire. The extra costs will fall on the police authority, but it can have no complaints about that. Rebilling is an inevitable consequence of setting an excessive increase and of being capped in-year. All authorities know that, and the best way to avoid rebilling is not to set an excessive increase in the first place.</p>

 I thank the Minister for the careful and courteous way in which he has introduced the order. I am sure that the House will appreciate that. I understand that, technically, the order relates simply to the situation in Lincolnshire, and I certainly want to respect the terms of the debate. But however careful and measured the tone that the Minister has adopted in introducing the order, he cannot escape the fact that what we are discussing today is a symptom of a wider malaise, for which the Government have to take responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08070953001596">That wider malaise is made up, first, of the consistent and remorseless upward pressure on council tax. That affects not only people in Lincolnshire and the other authorities that were originally considered, but people right across the country. The malaise also consists of the tight financial settlement under which those authorities and others across the country find themselves. We must not forget that the Government cannot say that they are seeking to protect council tax payers in Lincolnshire while escaping the responsibility, which has to lie with them, for that underlying malaise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08070953001597">The increase in council tax is down to Government policy. The tightness of the financial settlement that affects those authorities is, again, the direct result of Government policy. It is worth reminding the House that for all the Minister&#146;s words about the protection of council tax payers, his Government have seen council tax double in the past 10 years. The tightness of the financial settlement, described by the Association of Chief Police Officers as the tightest settlement for police authorities in years, was, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) pointed out when the matter was first debated in the House, the direct consequence of a macro-economic problem&#151;the borrowing problem&#151;that the Government have got themselves into.</p>

available to local authorities. Local authorities are feeling the pinch, and that means reductions in budgets or pressure on council tax. The Government are introducing this order because of a situation that is ultimately of their creation and their responsibility. That needs to be set in context.</p>

Members from Lincolnshire want to participate in the debate, so I will not go into much local detail. However, it clearly cannot be justified to say that Lincolnshire is historically a particularly profligate authority; indeed, the evidence suggests that police funding in Lincolnshire, in terms of spend per head and so on, is comparatively low.</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend will find that our hon. Friends will say that there is a structural problem with the grant in Lincolnshire that needs to be addressed. I do not expect him to give a guarantee today of what we will do when we get into government, but I hope that if and when that happens, we will look urgently at the grant to see whether it is truly unfair to Lincolnshire. If, as I believe, that is the case, we will alter it to make more resources available to the county and to the police force in particular.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for making that point, which he raised when the funding settlement was originally discussed in this House. In that debate, he said that it seemed pretty clear to many local people that there is a problem with the operation of the national grant in relation to Lincolnshire, as well as in Leicestershire, which also figured in the discussions. It was clear that several authorities in that part of England were suffering from this.</p>

 I want to make my hon. Friend aware that the operation of the funding formula is so penal in its impact on Lincolnshire that in the financial year 2003-04 its police authority was the only one in England and Wales to have its per capita funding cut.</p>

 My hon. Friend has reinforced the point. In the earlier debate, the Government were put on notice of this situation. It was clearly flagged up that, in addition to the other pressures that I have mentioned, the financial risk as regards the financing of the police service had in effect been transferred away from the Government on to the citizens of Lincolnshire. A perverse situation has developed.</p>

That applies not only to police authorities but to local authorities generally. There are problems with the national police funding formula and with the formula for the revenue support grant. People do not have faith in how these settlements are calculated. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Higg) has said, in due course an incoming Conservative Government will need to take some fundamental action on how we allocate and distribute grant.</p>

us what is in that response, but during the past six months, as we conducted our review into policing, I and my colleagues in the Select Committee found that the issue of police funding came up in all our discussions. It was raised by almost all the chief constables we spoke to&#151;I think that we took evidence from 15 of the 42 chief constables in England and Wales, but unfortunately not the chief constable of Lincolnshire. Each one of them raised the issue of funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08070967000019">I shall raise three issues that I hope will be of benefit not just to the Lincolnshire police authority, but to other police authorities that may face such action next year. The first concerns new technology. It is a mystery to me why each different police authority is able to purchase its own equipment separately at whatever cost it negotiates. Surely procurement for all our police forces, including Lincolnshire, would ensure that the cost to all of them would be less. That may have meant that Lincolnshire would not have had to ask for such a rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08070967000020">In Leicestershire, new technology&#151;hand-held computers &#151;was purchased from a different company to the one that I discovered was used by Staffordshire when I visited Staffordshire constabulary last Friday. It purchases from a different company from Greater Manchester police authority, which the Select Committee visited on Monday. More central guidance, with all police forces procuring equipment from the same company, would save a great deal of money and make it relatively easy for police authorities to communicate with each other. That applies to other computers and technology as well as hand-held computers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08070967000021">Different authorities may buy different computer systems from different companies, thus making it difficult in some cases to transfer data from one to another. We already know that there is a problem with, for example, Lincolnshire&#146;s ability to provide information through Europol to police authorities in Europe, because it operates a different computer system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08070967000022">I am sure that the Government have made the right decision, because I know that both Ministers will have examined the representations carefully.

 The right hon. Gentleman said that the Home Affairs Committee had received many comments from chief constables to the effect that there are problems with the formula.

the Government want us to re-examine amalgamations, which the newspapers suggested today&#151;we do not know, because the statement will be made next week, and I am simply repeating what I have read&#151;the Select Committee will clearly want to consider the formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08070967000025">The formula causes me concern because, as I said, seven authorities are police authorities. At a time when we need to put as many resources as possible into policing, it is worrying that so many authorities, including Lincolnshire, are police authorities. I have not examined in the same great detail as Ministers the case that each police authority has made, but we need to consider the way in which they operate if we are to be helpful in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08070967000026">Secondly, let me consider police efficiencies. Again, I do not want to prejudge the Green Paper that the police Minister will publish next week, but I am sure that he will refer to Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s proposed efficiencies. We have taken evidence from Sir Ronnie Flanagan. Of course, efficiencies should occur in the police service in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and all the other areas, but it is essential that that does not detract from visible policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80709-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08070967000027">Last Friday, I went to Burton on Trent, where I met the divisional commander with the local Member of Parliament, who is a member of the Select Committee, and we examined Staffordshire&#146;s innovative approach to reducing bureaucracy and red tape. It had reduced casework files from 16 pages to one page. I do not know whether that has happened in Lincolnshire; nor am I sure whether it has occurred in Leicestershire, because I have not asked our chief constable. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The police Minister claims that that has happened. It is another example of good practice that should be rolled out in other parts of the country, thus releasing, in the words of Sir Ronnie Flanagan, a great deal of police time. Some say that the reduction of red tape can release up to 50 minutes of a police officer&#146;s time. If one compares that with the number of police officers in Lincolnshire, it will mean a huge saving in hours. It would be interesting to know whether other authorities do that.</p>

 The right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08070967000031">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention brings me to my final point, which concerns the number of laws that we pass in this place and the burden that we place on the police, including the police in Lincolnshire. Another great statistic produced by Sir Ronnie Flanagan is that stop and search results in 48,000 hours of police time spent meeting targets and ensuring that, for every stop and search carried out, certain forms are filled in that eventually find their way into the Home Office somewhere. Obviously it is important that there should be recording of certain activities and events, but I am not sure whether we should record every event in the way that we have in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08070967000032">The situation in Lincolnshire is probably different from that in other parts of the country, because it is up to the police authority and the chief constable to decide on certain issues. Certain chief constables have said that there is no need to fill in certain forms. Others have felt that they are obliged to follow everything that the Home Office says. It is important that we should have one practice throughout the country. However, this is not a plea for central control, and it will not save Lincolnshire tonight, because it seems that the Opposition will not vote against the Government, even though the Opposition spokesman is very cross at what they are doing.</p>

If that sounds like an early plea for Leicestershire, it is. I have not dwelt on Leicestershire, in view of your strictures at the start of the debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I hope very much that the Minister will take what I have said into account when he makes any decisions in the future.</p>

 This rare usage of the central check on council tax goes to show, with more significance than ever before, the severe lack of funding for police authorities, which has left Lincolnshire police authority with no conceivable choice but to use its council tax precepts to try to improve its service. The decision is embarrassingly last-minute and will cause huge disruption to the police service planning to use those funds. Furthermore, the administrative costs of changing the council tax increase will be disproportionate to the benefits that it will reap. Indeed, the Minister has already told us the colossal cost of changing the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08070967000035">This situation has come about because the tight police funding settlement has left police authorities with relatively little choice. As we heard from the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), a great deal of work has to be done, and that is increasing all the time because we pass too many laws in this place. Unsurprisingly, it therefore follows that certain police authorities, including Lincolnshire, feel obliged to make substantial increases in the council tax demand in order to achieve their goal.</p>

It will be 2.8 per cent. in 2009-10 and 2010-11. That is effectively a real-terms freeze, or perhaps a contracting budget if inflation does as we fear it will. The needs formula is obviously seriously flawed, and some areas are already missing out on additional grant resources that the formula itself says they need. This will simply exacerbate the existing problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08070967000037">The police authorities are forced to make up the shortfalls through the council tax&#151;they have no other way of doing it. Yet again, the Government&#146;s spending squeeze has pushed the responsibility on to police authorities, yet the Government are blaming them for shortfalls created by underfunding from central Government. That is the paradox. A police authority can find itself being capped for trying to achieve the income that it needs to fulfil the targets that it has been set by the Government. That is why so many people are angry about this, and it goes some way towards illustrating the frustration that the police authorities unquestionably feel at having to cut back on plans that were, after all, designed to improve public safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08070967000038">This will have an impact on police services on the ground.

He has said, however, that plans to employ 100 additional officers and police community support officers&#151;which he claims would have made a real difference to people living in Lincolnshire&#151;will be abandoned. He had wanted to increase the number of officers monitoring serious offenders, including sex offenders, but that will now have to be put on ice indefinitely because the police authority does not have the necessary money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08070967000039">This is also bad for police service planning. How can authorities be expected to plan their services and ensure that they can adequately protect their local community when the Government move the goalposts at the last minute? As I have said, the administrative costs involved are quite significant, but the principle behind the action conspires with the logistical problems to create administrative chaos as well as political contradiction. For example, some people who already pay by standing order will have no time to make the necessary change and could find themselves in arrears. We have already discussed the content of the funding formula. Incidentally, most council tax rises are above 5 per cent. if precepts are included. So there is a practical problem, and also one of principle.</p>

 Perhaps the hon.

Thirteen years ago&#151;we are not talking about the 1980s here&#151;the Conservatives capped the Lincolnshire police authority. When they were sitting on the other side of the House, they did exactly the same thing that they are condemning the current Labour Government for doing. It is encouraging to hear the hon. Gentleman say that times have changed, but I remind him of the simple statistic that between 1991 and 1997, the Conservatives capped 31 authorities. I do not understand how he thinks he can get away with saying that capping is a thing of the past, when the Conservatives used it with gay abandon throughout the time they were in government in the 1990s. Perhaps there are other political reasons why Conservative Members are so keen on condemning capping now, but they need to provide a great deal more evidence before any Member could seriously believe that if the Conservatives were in government, they would do anything other than what the present Government are doing.</p>

Once again, we hear hints from Conservative Front Benchers that they do not like capping, so I would infer that they are not terribly comfortable with the council tax system as a whole. Perhaps, then, we could make common cause with a better system in the form of a local income tax, which would do away with these problems.</p>

That is exactly what we are doing here. Either we believe in local democracy and accept that local people have the right to vote on and object to these matters&#151;in this case through consultation with local representatives&#151;or we believe that the central state has the right to usurp those decisions.</p>

Nobody thinks that a 79 per cent. increase is good, but any right-minded person who is serious about devolution and democracy can see that the principle of capping is very bad. For that reason, we shall press for a vote.</p>

 I was rather brought up to believe that the prime and foundational task of a Member of Parliament was to defend his or her constituents against unreasonable, excessive or unjust taxation. I rise this afternoon, conscious that that is what I am trying to do. I am struck by the fact that no Conservative Member&#151;from Lincolnshire or anywhere else&#151;appears to be remotely interested in playing that particular role. They are here, either explicitly or silently, to defend a completely unreasonable precept proposed by Lincolnshire police authority. With the honourable and laudable exception of the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), who is not in his place, Conservative Members from Lincolnshire have been so much behind this precept&#151;unreasonable and absurd as it is&#151;that I am led to believe that the Conservatives on the police authority were whipped to vote in its favour.</p>

I have nothing against him personally: he is a Front-Bench spokesman and he has to do as good a job as he can; he did so on the basis of a very bad brief. We know what that job consists of, however, because we see it done every day. Opposition Front Benchers come to the House and say, &#147;It&#146;s all the Government&#146;s fault&#151;it&#146;s all terrible.&#148; This afternoon the hon. Gentleman talked of a long-term malaise that was apparently all the Government&#146;s fault, without ever saying what the Conservatives would do differently. He did not suggest for a moment that they would introduce a different level or form of grant, or change the formula. What is more, he did not have the  <br>

courage of his convictions in criticising the Government. Obviously he does not want to make himself even more unpopular in Lincolnshire by voting against the order, so he announced that he would not vote against it or call on his colleagues to do so.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s speech was a complete washout, although it was delivered in his usual charming fashion. As I have said, I do not blame him in any way. All that he is doing is coming to the House just as his colleagues do. It is only because we listen to the same thing every day that we can see through it. I understand why the public might initially think, &#147;That sounds very plausible: something must be wrong, and it is all the Government&#146;s fault&#151;how terrible.&#148; Nice Tories, with their modern image, would not apply their critical faculties and realise that what is being proposed is complete air, complete hollowness, complete nothingness. That is the background to so many debates in the House of Commons nowadays, and to so many Opposition motions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08070967000053">Let me turn to the specifics of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire is very well policed. We are fortunate enough to have a good police force, and there are very good relationships between the public and the police. That is not the case in every part of the country. In rather more than 20 years in politics representing the people of south Lincolnshire in slightly different constituencies&#151;the constituency boundaries changed midstream&#151;I have never encountered a case of police corruption or police violence. I will touch wood, because we all know that human beings are fallible everywhere, but I do not believe that there have been any such cases over that period, and probably for a long time before. We are deeply appreciative of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08070967000054">It is perfectly reasonable for a chief constable to have ambitious desires to develop the force, improve the service to the public and improve the facilities available to officers and civilian staff. I am sure that I would feel the same if I were a chief constable. Anyone who runs an organisation feels like that. There is an element of empire-building in any form of management. In the private sector it is controlled by competition: those who become uncompetitive go out of business. In the public sector, it must be controlled by some other discipline. There must be some external countervailing force or influence to prevent excessive spending. That is why we need the disciplines that we have in the public sector today, one of which is the capping mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08070967000055">I do not blame the chief constable&#151;a previous chief constable, in fact&#151;for producing a wish list that seems to have been excessively imaginative. I do, however, blame the police authority for not only accepting the wish list but adding to it, in an extremely uncritical fashion. I read with great attention the business plan and budget that the authority produced last summer, and begged its members not to proceed with it. Several things were wrong with it. First, it was far too long and full of verbiage and jargon. It was very incoherent and badly organised, and as a result very unconvincing. I think that someone else should draft the police authority&#146;s business plans in future. Secondly, it made a number of extravagant demands without any critical examination of the possibility of internal savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08070967000056">A year ago almost to the day, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the police authority and the chief constable asking a number of questions. I asked, for example, why  <br>

the number of civilians employed in the force could not be increased. Lincolnshire has a lower civilian quota than other shire counties. I received no reasoned answer to that question. I asked why we were not using specials more, and about a number of aspects of policing that seemed to me to be less than essential. I asked why we did not drop them and use the resources elsewhere, employing the officers concerned in other tasks. More recently, I have asked why our financial proposals do not take account of potential savings from the Flanagan reforms, and why we have not&#151;as some constabularies have rightly done&#151;tried to anticipate the reforms by getting rid of superfluous bureaucracy in advance. There is a lot of superfluous bureaucracy in the police force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08070967000057">The Lincolnshire police force has over the past few months not been behaving in the way we would expect if it were true that it has been reduced to penury; far from it, in fact. We opened a very nice new police station in Grantham last year, and within a month or two it was being repainted. On a Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago in Lincolnshire, I saw two policemen with speed guns engaged in traffic policing, but traffic policing should, on the whole, be done by civilians operating electronic equipment. I am always told that the real strain on policing occurs at the weekends&#151;that that is the expensive time, and that that is when there are often law and order difficulties in various places, such as at football matches on Saturday afternoons. I believe that we should use more specials at such times, but leaving that point to one side, there were those two uniformed officers not chasing after dangerous criminals or engaged in the kind of dramatic police operations that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) was saying will have to be sacrificed if Lincolnshire does not get  the money it is demanding, but simply handing out speeding tickets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08070967000058">Neither my analysis of the Lincolnshire police budget and business plan, nor my own experience of Lincolnshire police, nor the reactions of my constituents&#151;whom I believe are 100 per cent. behind me in everything I am saying on the subject&#151;lead me to think that the demand for a 78 or 79 per cent. increase in the police precept from one year to the next was remotely reasonable or justified. The police authority&#146;s task should be not to accept uncritically what the force is asking for, let alone to add to its wish list, but to act as an intermediary between the police and the public, and to take account of the taxpayers&#146; interests and of what the taxpayer can reasonably be expected to pay, and of what it is reasonable to ask for by way of an increase in charge for a public service from one week, month and year to the next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08070967000059">Last week, we were talking about how great an increase in the pay of Members of Parliament it might be reasonable to ask for, even if in the past they have been underpaid in relation to other professions, which is, of course, perfectly true. We asked whether it would be acceptable to have a sudden dramatic catch-up over the course of a year. Even if there is an argument that Lincolnshire should have been more generously funded in the past, which I think it should have been, and even if there are arguments about the funding formula&#151;which there are, and I believe the funding formula could be greatly improved&#151;was it reasonable to go for a 78 per cent. increase? Was that even sensible or pragmatic? The people who did this have public responsibilities. They are supposed to act in a way that is not only sound in  <br>

terms of the philosophy of what they are doing, but which makes sense pragmatically in terms of making it likely that they will achieve the objectives of the institution for which they have a charge. They suddenly asked for 78 per cent&#151;I think the figure is 78.5 per cent. actually, but I always say 78 per cent. to try to be fair. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Minister says the figure is 79 per cent. Regardless of which is correct, to ask for such an increase from one year to the next is immediately not to be taken seriously. Therefore, I think the police authority did a very irresponsible job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80709-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08070967000060">Moreover, the police authority is entirely responsible, as it knew the score. It had people, including me, begging it not to go down that road, and it knew it would have to rebill if it was capped. Therefore, it is entirely responsible for this &#163;500,000&#151;that is the figure we have heard this afternoon&#151;which it will cost to rebill. I have called in my constituency, and I call now in the House, for the resignation of the chairman of the police authority and of all those members of it who voted for this completely inordinate increase, because I think they did a very bad day&#146;s work in doing so. They were quite irresponsible in the way in which they conducted that exercise, and they have now lost all credibility. I suspect they have lost a lot of credibility in Whitehall, and they have certainly lost a lot of credibility with the public in Lincolnshire, who can see that they were trying to get &#163;100 or more out of them for a band D property, and they have now succeeded in getting only &#163;30 for such a property. Also, as has been made clear, there will not be any redundancies as a result. A lot of the panicky propaganda that has been mouthed in Lincolnshire over the past few months has been seen to be as empty as the rhetoric we heard this afternoon from the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.</p>

police authority did reflected a serious underlying problem within the Lincolnshire police force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08070967000065">Those of us who have represented the county for many years, and my hon. Friends who have been in their places throughout this debate, know well that the Lincolnshire police force faces a serious problem of structural underfunding. Only a limited number of sources of finance are available to the police service. There is the precept, there is central Government grant and there is a special grant. The problem that Lincolnshire faces&#151;and has faced for several years&#151;is that the underlying grant has been too low. It is possible that we could criticise the police authority, in temperate and courteous language, for not having in the past increased the precept by as much as it could have done. I am inclined to think that there is some merit in that criticism and if the hon. Gentleman had confined himself to that, I would have had some sympathy with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08070967000066">It is also possible that further savings could be made by the police service. I was, many years ago, a Home Office Minister with responsibility for the police and I am conscious that there are few police forces of which one could say that there are no further savings that they could sensibly make. However, that does not go to the root of the matter, which is one of structural underfunding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08070967000067">The Lincolnshire police force is now looking at a structural shortfall&#151;a deficit&#151;in 2010 of &#163;14 million. It can put that right only through an increase in its funding or a decrease in expenditure. One of the real problems that face police services&#151;and local authorities, fire and ambulance services&#151;is that more than 80 per cent. of their budget goes on manpower. If police services want to shrink their budgets, they have to cut manpower. It can be done over time by reducing the number of uniformed officers, but I do not think that many people in Lincolnshire want to see that happen. It can be done by sacking civilian staff, but that involves up-front redundancy costs and then requires uniformed staff to do the tasks previously done by the civilian staff. That also reduces front-line services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08070967000068">We should be as unpartisan as we can about this problem&#151;and I make that point to the hon. Gentleman. There is a structural problem in Lincolnshire. I suspect that that is also true of Norfolk, Suffolk and some of the other forces. Why that should be so, I am not wholly clear. I have some difficulty in understanding the formula, as does the hon. Gentleman. He attended many a meeting that I did, and he did not understand, any more than I did, exactly how the formula was calculated. I have a strong feeling that rural areas are being discriminated against. That is not deliberate or malevolent, but because the Government&#146;s sympathies are not with the rural areas they have not focused on the matter with the intensity with which they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08070967000069">I suspect that something like the following is true of Lincolnshire. Although it is a sparsely populated county, habitations are located quite close together. There are not many areas of wildness where there is nobody. Areas that contain nobody do not have to be policed too much, but sparsely populated counties with a lot of habitation have an intensive police requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08070967000072">There has been recognition of the underlying problem because the Home Office made a specific grant of &#163;3.4 million last year. The fact that the capping has allowed the precept to rise by 26 per cent. or so is also an implied recognition of the problem. At the very best, it allows for a standstill budget and no more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08070967000073">Most people in the county, and most sensible commentators, too, will accept that the police in Lincolnshire are not performing as well as they should. They need more resources and unless there is a determination to drive up the base income, which is derived from the formula, there will be no prospect of a substantial increase in the resources dedicated to the county in the foreseeable future. I will not vote against the order, unlike the Liberal Democrats, because I recognise that it will be a considerable relief to my constituents. I will not embark on intemperate criticism of the police authority, such as that which I found so deeply unattractive, because it is wrestling with a serious problem and doing the best that it can in difficult circumstances. Unless we confront the problem of the formula, Lincolnshire and other police forces will find themselves in continuing difficulties that they will be unable to resolve.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend is eloquently putting the balanced case that is of great concern to our constituents. Is he also of the view, as I am, that the significant increase in population in certain parts of Lincolnshire, particularly in my constituency around Boston, caused by a significant number of economic migrants coming to work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors has not yet significantly been taken appropriately into account and reflected in the funding formula and the money that comes to the police authority?</p>

 I am sure that that is right. Thinking back to when I had dealings with the formula, which I always had great difficulty in understanding, I knew that there were long lead times and that the configuration of the county would change but that the changes in the configuration would take time to be fed into the formula. In the case of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, I am well aware that there has been a huge influx, particularly from eastern Europe, of migrant workers, many of whom bring special problems&#151;for example, linguistic problems. That raises an issue for the local force and I am sure that that has not been reflected.</p>

 Incidentally, I find visitors from eastern Europe quite charming, especially those from Romania. My point about the funding formula relates to the discrimination that I am certain is taking place and that is taking funding away from rural areas.

 There is some truth in that. May I speak as a barrister, just for a moment? I practise in the criminal courts and in that capacity I am aware of the intensity of crime in inner-city areas. I represent people from Leeds and Bradford, and often from London as well, and I am really conscious of how lawless large parts of the inner cities have become. I recognise therefore that the Government feel that the police have to address those issues seriously, and I agree, but I think that they tend to overlook the problems that occur in the countryside. Although crime levels as such are lower in rural areas, anxiety about crime remains very high, and particular types of crime remain very difficult to detect, in part because of the sparsely populated nature of the countryside. I think that the Government&#146;s sympathies are not inherently with the rural areas, which they find easier to neglect than they do the cities.</p>

If the honest answer to that is no&#151;and that is the proper answer to give&#151;they need to work together and with others to see whether more central Government funding can be brought to the Lincolnshire police budget.</p>

Before I speak about the police funding formula and Lincolnshire, I should like to put on record the fact that the Ministers for Local Government and for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing have both treated the representations made to them with care and courtesy.</p>

I have understood local government finance only twice, and then fleetingly. My right hon. and learned Friend said, with a degree of humility matched only by his eloquence, that he barely understood it at all when he had responsibility for it. The first time that I understood it fleetingly was when I studied it at university as part of my degree, and the second time was when, as a Nottinghamshire county councillor, I proposed a budget amendment during that council&#146;s annual budget meeting.</p>

with my hon. Friends, I suspect that that is due in part to the formula&#146;s failure to cope adequately with the particular problems of rural areas and their sparse and scattered populations, and in part to its unresponsiveness to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08070967000083">My hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) will speak about the situation in Boston with altogether more knowledge than I can, but, as has been mentioned, the incoming population from central and eastern Europe has caused dramatic change in the area. I am not sure that the formula is terribly good at dealing with the rapidity of the changes that we have seen in Lincolnshire, or with the difficulties of providing a public service in a demography such as Lincolnshire&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08070967000084">We might say the same about health provision or the social services, but the problem is exaggerated in respect of policing, which faces a combination of demands. One is the need to respond to urgent problems, and that is coupled with the need for a profile which, if not ever present, is at least sufficient to reassure the public and deter criminals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08070967000085">I am sure that the Minister has recognised that the formula needs to be re-examined. Unless it is, we will end up in this circumstance again, we will debate the matters in a similar fashion and Ministers will spend inordinate amounts of time trying to come to a settlement, following the representations made to them by people such as us, the police authority and others. That would not be a satisfactory position for the House, for Lincolnshire or, indeed, for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08070967000086">The feeling in Lincolnshire about those matters is running high. I was pleased to present to 10 Downing street a petition that was signed by several thousand of my constituents and organised between me and the local newspaper, the <i> Lincolnshire Free Press</i>,<i> </i>which was kind enough to publish coupons that local people filled in, demanding that the Government take action. In that much I agree&#151;although it pains me to do so&#151;with the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), whose presence is a delight to me, if only because, however inadequate my contribution, by contrast with his it will shine.

However, by allowing the 26 per cent. increase, the Government have implicitly acknowledged that there is an infrastructural funding problem, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham described it. By accepting an increase of that size, they acknowledged that the police authority was in crisis, and that if they had not permitted that&#151;still very large&#151;increase, it would have faced cuts and closures, jeopardising public safety and public order in the estimation both of the authority, which has done a good job in making its case,  <br>

 May I just refer to the point that my hon. Friend made about allowing the precept to rise by about 26 per cent?

 Yes, indeed. It is not only an implicit acknowledgement of the scale of the problem, but, as my right hon. and learned Friend suggests, a transfer of responsibility for solving the problem. People in Lincolnshire will say, &#147;We&#146;re doing our bit, why isn&#146;t the Government doing their bit?&#148; We may be judging Ministers too harshly, and at the end of the debate, the Minister may tell us that he will conduct a root-and-branch review of the formula and make a special grant available to the police force, as the Government did last year.</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend is coming to the crux of his remarks. He is absolutely right that there was a special one-off grant of &#163;3.4 million last year to the Lincolnshire police authority, but is he aware that when the Government calculated the increase this year, they did not take into account that &#163;3.4 million as the base figure, thereby making the authority&#146;s increased funding actually a decrease in the amount that it received last year?</p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="08070967000093"><a name="80709-0017.htm_spnew15"><a name="08070967001606"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 My hon. Friend brings to the debate an understanding and a knowledge that I could not hope to emulate, and he is right to say that the addition of that &#163;3.4 million effectively raised the baseline. It had become the standard, the norm, for the police authority, because it had spent and absorbed it, and the assumptions on which its future plans were predicated were built around that absorption. My hon. Friend has made a useful point. When we debated the matter in previous weeks and months, I wondered whether the Government might not only allow an exceptional rise in the precept but make a similar kind of grant, given the facts that my hon. Friend set out so clearly. That would, in a sense, be a compromise. It would broadcast the message that Government were doing their bit and the council tax payers were doing theirs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08070967000094">However, as I say, perhaps the Minister has something up his sleeve&#151;a rabbit that he will produce from his hat&#151;in the form of extra money, or at least a commitment to a root-and-branch reform of the formula. I also hope that he will give a commitment&#151;I make this request to him quite plainly&#151;to meet representatives of the authority and the force as a matter of urgency to plan what will happen in the immediate future and in the next 12 months, so that we avoid a recurrence of these circumstances.</p>

lowest spending force per head of population, and the force with the fewest officers per head of population. Despite having less resources than any other force in the country, Lincolnshire police are expected to cover the third biggest geographical area. Is it any wonder that the police authority, but more especially the police force, in the form of the former chief constable and our new chief constable&#151;a splendid man, who I know will do his very best with the resources available to him&#151;are so worried about their ability to provide the level and quality of policing that, in their judgment, the communities in Lincolnshire need and deserve? The chief constable has said</p>
<a name="80709-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08070967001543"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we cannot make the investment into policing in Lincolnshire which we know is necessary to provide acceptable levels of service.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80709-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08070967000096">When policemen make remarks of that kind, we know that there is a serious problem.</p>

I totally disagree. I think that the case made by Members of Parliament, local authority representatives and the force has been measured. The authority and the force want to be able to respond to changes in population demands, and they want to devise a plan for dealing with serious organised crime, which does exist in Lincolnshire, despite the bucolic image often painted of our county&#151;and indeed, it is a splendid place to live. They want to develop policing to meet current needs and dynamic demands. They deserve the chance to be able to do so.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who is an articulate and tireless campaigner on behalf of his constituents. He was absolutely right to highlight the real concern felt when the police authority put forward its initial precept. Both our constituencies have a significant number of hard-working but low-waged people who find things difficult, particularly given the current economic contraction, rising fuel and food prices, and the fact that they have little public transport and little alternative to using their cars to get to work and go about their daily business. A rise of nearly 80 per cent. in the police precept therefore presented a significant challenge to their personal and family finances. That is one reason why I will not vote against this capping order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08070967000101">I was delighted that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), who is a distinguished and eloquent former police Minister, made a forensic analysis of the issues. He was absolutely right that the lack of flexibility in the funding formula is to blame for Lincolnshire police authority&#146;s current problems. I will return to that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08070967000102">I shall not say too much about the contribution of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), who is a constituent of mine, except that it was disappointing. I found it slightly offensive that there was a direct implication that Conservative Members representing Lincolnshire constituencies do not represent their constituents to the best of their ability. We were concerned about the proposed rate of the police precept, and he is absolutely wrong to suggest that we acquiesced in it. I am pleased that the Minister has introduced the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08070967000103">I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, who has been courteous throughout the process. He has at least listened to the concerns of Lincolnshire MPs of all parties. I follow my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings in requesting that he examine some specific issues prior to future funding reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08070967000104">The Minister for Local Government introduced the order in a typically calm and considered way, but I am afraid that he cannot get away with implicitly passing the blame on to the police authority. The reason for its problems is insufficient resources from central Government. The point has already been made, but it is worth re-emphasising that Lincolnshire police authority is the lowest-funded force per head of population in the whole country. The next lowest, Suffolk, gets &#163;11 million more. It is recognised and acknowledged that the problem is with the funding formula. It is inflexible and unresponsive to Lincolnshire&#146;s population, geography, rurality and sparsity. As I said in my intervention on my hon. Friend, the &#163;3.4 million grant last year was made in recognition of the fact that the authority has funding problems. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham rightly pointed out the deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08070967000105">Of course it is right that police funding is not awarded on a per capita basis, and there are complexities and differences between urban areas and rural ones such as Lincolnshire. However, the disparity in the numbers is stark. The West Midlands police authority gets &#163;189.78 per head, Greater Manchester &#163;189.54, Northumbria &#163;188.62, and South Yorkshire, the Minister&#146;s own police authority, &#163;162.74. Lincolnshire gets only &#163;112.29 per head. I shall say more in a moment about the significant increase in population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08070967000106">There has been underfunding for a number of years. I accept that it is not a new phenomenon. There are no more police officers in Lincolnshire than 10 years ago, and there are fewer officers per capita than in any other force in the country. Its limited resources have to be applied over the third largest police authority area in the whole country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08070967000107">My right hon. and learned Friend made a pertinent point. Had the Minister not allowed a significant precept, 25 per cent. of the police officers in the Lincolnshire police authority might have had to be made redundant. As I said in an intervention, that confirms that the  <br>

funding formula is not working for Lincolnshire. Such redundancies are not legal, and the authority&#146;s only alternative would have been to make 364 civilian staff redundant and withdraw police officers from the front line to do that civilian work at additional cost to the police authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08070967000108">If there is one consistent theme articulated by my constituents in Boston and Skegness, it is that they want a more visible police force, and I believe that that is true elsewhere in Lincolnshire. If the precept had not been allowed at 26 per cent., we would be moving in completely the wrong direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08070967000109">The argument that the Minister for Local Government seemed to make&#151;and a small part of it may be true&#151;was that Lincolnshire police authority must be more efficient. That has been looked into by PricewaterhouseCoopers and academics at Loughborough university. The Minister will be aware that the police authority has made year-on-year efficiency savings, rightly demanded by the Home Office, to the tune of &#163;12.3 million over the past nine years. Because of the overall funding problems, the police authority has not been able to use those savings to improve the provision of services, as it has had to use them to bridge the deficit.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that the Lincolnshire force produced an economic recovery plan, which was submitted to the Home Office which, as far as I know, has not suggested that its proposals for efficiency savings were seriously defective?</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend makes a fundamental point, and he is right. The issue goes even further, because Loughborough university, which looked at Lincolnshire police authority in relation to other police authorities, said not only that it was a highly efficient authority, but that it might well be the most efficient police authority in England and Wales. The point that he made about the report that went to the Home Office confirms the view that, contrary to what the Minister said, Lincolnshire is already an efficient authority, and the increase in the precept has nothing to do with inefficiency, but much more to do with the chief constable and the police authority wanting to increase the provision of services for people who live in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08070967000112">May I say a few words about the significant increase in population in Lincolnshire, particularly in Boston in my constituency? The Minister will be aware of the contribution made by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government before the Communities and Local Government Committee, in which she confirmed that even Government figures, which tend to lag behind the reality on the ground, showed that one in four people in the borough of Boston were economic migrants&#151;primarily from eastern Europe, but there is also a significant population from Portugal. Indeed, in one primary school in the centre of Boston, nearly 40 per cent. of pupils speak English as a second language. The population of Boston has risen dramatically: according to the 2001 census, the borough then had a population of 55,000; in 2006, according to the Office for National Statistics, the population was nearly 59,000. Boston borough council, however, estimates that it could really be as high as 70,000&#151;nearly 25,000 more than the figure in the official 2001 census. That is not reflected in the funding formula at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08070967000113">The migrants working in the borough of Boston are welcome, as long as they are here legally and legitimately to participate in the essential functioning of the agricultural sector. However, Ministers will be aware that there have been tensions in Boston, which culminated in terrible riots in 2004. There are additional burdens, financial and otherwise, on the police authority. It is calculated that in that population of 60,000 to 70,000, some 65 languages are spoken, creating immense challenges for the police authority, which has had to produce documents in Portuguese, Russian, Polish and other languages to try to communicate with the new communities that have arrived. There is a strong case for giving population growth in Lincolnshire greater consideration in the allocation of funding. I know that the Home Office has been lobbied, but that does not seem to have had any material impact, so I very much hope that Ministers will take on board what I have said when they consider these matters in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08070967000114">Finally, I want to look at the impact on policing in Lincolnshire and what the police authority will not be able to deliver that it wants to deliver because of the lack of Government funding. There will be insufficient resources to address serious crime, a good example of which is the famous Stirland case, which involved a double murder between Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. There will continue to be serious failings in the management of sex offenders and rape. Only today, assistant commissioner John Yates called for every force to have its own rape protection unit; Lincolnshire will face serious challenges and problems in fulfilling that important task. There could be high-risk failures in Lincolnshire police authority&#146;s approach to special branch and intelligence work. Lincolnshire will have 100 fewer police officers than other, similar authorities. It might well be unable to meet the criteria required for the management of dangerous offenders, including sex offenders and violent offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08070967000115">The chief constable and the authority wanted to implement a whole series of additional services, but they will no longer be able to. I shall not give all  the details, because I am sure that the Minister is aware  of them, but they include plans to use 19 officers  to establish a 24-hour rape investigation team, and 63 additional officers in neighbourhood policing. Those plans and those officers would have brought about exactly what the people of Lincolnshire want: higher visibility for the police force. The Government must respond to those serious and significant deficiencies. If left unaddressed, they could have a detrimental impact on safety, security and the quality of life for people in my constituency and elsewhere in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08070967000116">In conclusion, I should say that the issues have been accepted and acknowledged; the Minister acknowledged them in the House on 27 March. The Minister  for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing acknowledged that there was an issue in an interview on BBC Radio Lincolnshire when he was in the county on 26 June. The fact that the Government have allowed a 26 per cent. increase in the precept is recognition in itself that there is a problem; even that extensive increase allows only a standstill service. Without change, Lincolnshire will have the lowest spending per head on policing, with the lowest number of officers per head covering the third largest geographical area in the country. The Government have made it clear that Lincolnshire police  <br>

In consultation with the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing and the Lincolnshire police authority, will he consider the necessity for a one-off payment yet again to assist Lincolnshire police authority for this financial year? Secondly, I reinforce the point made by other hon. Members. Will he undertake a fundamental review of the funding formula to ensure a permanent solution to this time-consuming annual exercise, in which the police authority has to lobby the Government for the requisite resources? That could be done simply in the short term through a consideration of the flaws that were going to stop the Lincolnshire police authority from getting up to &#163;8.2 million in the next three years under the comprehensive spending review.</p>

We cannot have this annual event in which the chief constable, his senior officers, the police authority and Lincolnshire Members of Parliament of all political parties are involved in this time-consuming exercise of trying to make sure that the Lincolnshire police authority gets the requisite and appropriate resources. The issue needs to be sorted out once and for all, and that can be done only by reworking the funding formula.</p>

 I am pleased to have the support of those on the Conservative Benches in introducing the order, even if they are not going to support it by voting for it this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08070967000121">The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) mentioned the funding settlement. I take him back to what the Association of Chief Police Officers said about the settlement for the police forces around the country:</p>
<a name="80709-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="08070967001544"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The overall settlement is broadly in line with anticipated rises in core costs, and this will help preserve many of the key gains in police officer and police staff numbers made in recent years.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08070967000122">The hon. Gentleman also raised points about the funding formula for police, as did the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) and the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds). As he will know better than many, that was drawn up in conjunction with ACPO and the Association of Police Authorities. It was last reviewed in 2007 and fully consulted on after that to produce the basis on which we have made decisions for the next three years. One of the factors taken into account in arriving at the funding formula is population sparsity in the area concerned. In addition, Lincolnshire is benefiting from  <br>

the former rural policing fund, which is still distributed to police authorities on the same basis, but now with no strings attached. This year, the contribution from that fund is part of an extra &#163;10.7 million going to Lincolnshire police on top of the general police grant and the revenue that it raises from its council tax precepts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08070967000123">We have to base calculations for the funding formula on figures that are consistent across the country, and on the most recent figures produced by the independent Office for National Statistics. Those have weaknesses, particularly as populations across the country become larger, more mixed and more mobile, and it is clear that we have to improve our data and the evidence on which we base funding formulae. That work is ongoing. It is being led by the national statistician, has the strong involvement of the Local Government Association, and reports to and is supported by a group of Ministers jointly chaired by my right hon. Friend the policing Minister and myself. Let me say to the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness that ACPO indicated in a recent report that there has been no crime wave associated with migration into this country. The hon. Gentleman did not argue that point, nor to my knowledge has his police authority, although others have. Nevertheless, we have now created in Government a fund to assist local authorities, including police authorities, in meeting the transitional costs caused by migration pressures such as those that he mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08070967000124">My right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), who is not in his place, made a series of wider points. As always, my right hon. Friend the policing Minister listened carefully to those, as well as to his special early plea on behalf of his own Leicestershire police authority. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) asked whether my right hon. Friend the Minister will meet his police authority as a matter of urgency to discuss the way ahead. He will, and I am sure that that meeting can be fixed without delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08070967000125">My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) was right about the need for financial disciplines in all parts of government, particularly in relation to fall-back powers to be used in extreme cases, as in the situation that we face with Lincolnshire police authority. He has clearly followed closely the decisions that the police authority has taken on its precept and its budget, and he is right to be critical of those. He was sharp in his critique of the vague Conservative position in relation not only to this order but to the wider issue of local government funding, and to wider policy on local government as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80709-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08070967000126">In response to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), I must explain that there is a cost to rebilling, as the police authority knew when it took its decision to set a 29 per cent. increase in its budget for this year and a 79 per cent. increase in its council tax precept. He claimed that the action in the capping order was disproportionate. Given that it results in every band D council tax payer in Lincolnshire having their council tax bill cut by &#163;69 this year, it is not a disproportionate move but a necessary one. People in Lincolnshire will be astonished that the hon. Gentleman intends to lead the Liberal Democrats into the Lobby tonight to vote, in effect, for a &#163;70 increase on council tax bills for this year.</p>

They will be relieved that we have debated the order, and I hope that the House will give it the go-ahead, so that we can put measures in place to protect council tax payers in Lincolnshire from an excessive council tax rise as a result of the police authority&#146;s decision. We will do so having listened carefully to the case that it has made, and having set the cap at a level that allows it to live within its means and to avoid any reduction in police officer numbers. The police will be able to carry out their duties, as a good police service should.</p>

<h3 align="center">Social Fund (Funeral Expenses)</h3>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08070967000480"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i> [Mr. Blizzard.]</i></p>
<a name="ordayhd_24"><a name="80709-0019.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08070967001573"><h5 align="left">7.9 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o321"><a name="08070967000481"><a name="80709-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070967001942"><b>Mr. Tom Clarke (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab):</b>
 I should like to start by thanking you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise the subject of funeral expenses. Highlighting the vexed questions surrounding making a claim for social fund funeral expenses is not regularly debated in the House, so I am particularly grateful. I might also add in my preliminary comments that for fairly obvious reasons this is not a subject with which people easily or willingly engage, but it is none the less a serious issue that, in my view, requires Government intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08070967000482">I have an excellent working relationship with councillors representing my party on North Lanarkshire council. Indeed, the council has introduced an outstanding best practice initiative on claiming funeral expense payments, which I will describe later. My friend and colleague Councillor William Hogg and I have had extensive discussions about how constituents on low incomes cope with bereavement and, in particular, with funeral expense payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08070967000483">Councillor Hogg represents the former mining community of Moodiesburn, and we will never forget the enormous sacrifice miners made over many decades to the economy, as their health was severely damaged and they contracted diseases such as emphysema, pneumoconiosis and silicosis. We will never forget the darkest day ever suffered by our community, the Auchengeich disaster in which 47 men lost their lives back in 1959. The people of that community will never forget that day, when so many men were killed, women became widows and mothers lost their sons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08070967000484">That brings me appropriately to my introductory point: we can fix almost anything where there is a determination to do so, but death is final. When a person dies, people are saddened; when a relative or a close friend dies, we are emotional&#151;in many cases, absolutely devastated. When we are in such a state of shock and there is no money for a burial or to pay for a cremation, we do not have time to grieve properly because we are anxious to avoid the embarrassing humiliation of a funeral without dignity. There is, of course, a safety net in the shape of the social fund, but I am sorry to say that public understanding and knowledge of that fund is not as widely known as it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08070967000485">There are three specific areas that I aim to cover in the course of this debate: accessibility, eligibility and funeral payments. On accessibility, I want to be constructive and positive in sharing with my hon. Friend the Minister information about a pilot programme that was introduced by North Lanarkshire council. The initiative was designed to help people access social fund funeral expenses. The partnership between the Department for Work and Pensions and the council resulted in benefit packs being made available in registration offices&#151;a perfectly reasonable proposition, given that when a family is bereaved, one of the first places it has to visit is the local registry office in order to register the death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08070967000486">Customer feedback was greatly encouraging, as one woman was quoted as saying:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08070967000487">Another woman said that</p>
<a name="80709-0019.htm_brev12"><a name="08070967001557"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it was nice to know people cared&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08070967000488">If constituents on low incomes need to claim funeral benefit, we need to ensure that the service is easily accessible. The service provided by North Lanarkshire council ought to be seen as best practice when it comes to communication, but even when it is known that such provision exists, making a successful claim can be difficult for those who are eligible. A local funeral director told me:</p>
<a name="80709-0019.htm_brev13"><a name="08070967001558"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The biggest problem is when the relatives actually think they are entitled to a payment but don&#146;t qualify. It then turns out they are responsible for payment of the total funeral account. In these situations the demeanour of families can be aggressive towards Funeral services staff.&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08070967000489">Establishing an accurate record of the position in regard to eligibility, nationally and locally, has not been without difficulty. When preparing for the debate, I wrote to my local DWP office on 27 May requesting detailed information about what has happened in my constituency. I wanted to know how many funeral claims had been submitted, how many had been successful, how many had been partially successful and how many had been rejected. Due to a reorganisation of resources in the DWP, I have not yet received a definitive reply to all my questions, but, to its credit, the Department has furnished me with details of the funeral payments for Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire district, which covers my constituency. According to those figures, the number of claims received in 2005-06 was 1,790, the number of initial awards was 1,150, the number of partial initial awards was 1,130, and the number of initial refusals was 460. In summary, the refusal rate was a considerable 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08070967000490">However, I wish to record my appreciation to the funeral directors in my constituency whom I consulted. I wanted to learn of their experiences in dealing with members of the public who had made applications for social fund funeral expenses. I was impressed by the professional responses that I received from Co-operative Funeralcare. Donald McLaren, a member of the National Association of Funeral Directors, Joseph Potts and Mr. Flannigan, who represents Lanarkshire and is incredibly well informed on the subject, could not have been more helpful. Funeral directors are very important: they have a wealth of knowledge as well as experience. Although I consulted them about the generality of what happens, I am certain that they have much more to offer by way of detail, which could make the process a little less painful for bereaved relatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08070967000491">Let me give just one example of what is happening to some bereaved families. According to Rights Advice Scotland, some funeral undertakers&#151;not those whom I have mentioned&#151;demand a down payment that can range from &#163;440 to &#163;675 before they will take a deceased person&#146;s remains into their care. Despite my references to my constituency and to Scottish organisations representing low-income families, my hon. Friend the Minister can be assured that I have no intention of being parochial, and I do not wish to pretend that problems associated with funeral payments are peculiar or exclusive to my constituency. The complexity of funeral payments, from accessibility to eligibility, spreads throughout Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08070967000492">Let me make one more point before I turn to the main theme of the actual level of funeral payments. If I can be entirely open, people are not comfortable about discussing matters relating to death. I fully understand their reluctance to do so, as nothing is more emotive than bereavement. Making funeral arrangements is not a simple task: it is complex, but, more importantly, it is costly, and ever increasingly so, and it is that aspect that was the catalyst for this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08070967000493">External research shows that it costs an average of almost &#163;6,000 to die in Britain, after the cost of a funeral rose by 10 per cent. during the past year. The average cost of a funeral is now &#163;2,390, with cremations, which account for 72 per cent. of funerals, costing about &#163;2,160 and burials costing &#163;2,620. The funeral is only the beginning of the costs families face when they lose someone, however, with about &#163;229 typically spent on flowers, &#163;98 spent on a death notice in a newspaper, and a further &#163;149 paid for a funeral notice. On top of this, people also spend an average of &#163;341 on catering, &#163;612 on a memorial such as a headstone and &#163;2,107 on the administration of an estate, bringing the total cost to &#163;5,923.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08070967000494">The cost of funerals looks set to continue to rise, with charges estimated to increase by a further 38 per cent. between now and 2012 to average &#163;3,299. Unsurprisingly, the cost of dying is highest in London, where it averages &#163;8,020. A consultant who studied the industry said:</p>
<a name="80709-0019.htm_brev14"><a name="08070967001559"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Funeral prices alone have risen faster than inflation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08070967000495">I cannot find a funeral director or a constituent who will confirm that the current funeral payment made via the social fund is sufficient. The Social Security Committee in 2001 cited evidence from funeral directors who said that</p>
<a name="80709-0019.htm_brev15"><a name="08070967001560"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;they find it very difficult to offer dignified funerals to claimants at this level of the Funeral Payment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08070967000496">The social fund is the main political concern within the funeral industry. Funeral directors believe that it is unfair to include their fees in a price cap that is frozen for uncertain periods of time with no formula in existence to increase the cap or reflect the increase in inflation. Moreover, the &#163;700 price cap, which has not increased since April 2003, does not take into account the cost of a simple funeral. There is uncertainty over what &#147;Other Funeral Expenses&#148; includes, and the industry, together with the Churches Funeral Group, believes it is wrong for the minister&#146;s fee to be included in the &#163;700 price cap. Allow me to cite the reasons for the funeral industry&#146;s concerns: the retail prices index has increased by 16.4 per cent. since April 2003, and the average cost of the NAFD simple funeral in March 2007 was &#163;1,050.70.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para32"><a name="08070967000497">There are a number of solutions that the Government could introduce to resolve the current situation, and I shall cite some examples. They could immediately increase the &#163;700 price cap in order to reflect the cost of a simple funeral. They could index link the price cap to ensure fairness. They could provide clarity to the funeral industry, Department for Work and Pensions staff and the bereaved as to what is included in the price cap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para33"><a name="08070967000498">I respectfully urge the Minster to conduct a review of the present rate of funeral payments awarded through the social fund, and then to draw a comparison with the average funeral costs. It would be extremely beneficial to consult local authorities, and particularly the NAFD. Only by engaging in such a meaningful process are we  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para34"><a name="08070967000499">Before I conclude, it would be remiss of me not to pay a justifiable and warm tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner), who is the chair of the all-party group on funerals and bereavement. His experienced and skilful leadership of the group is much admired on both sides of the House, particularly for his decorum and vision. Let me also mention Mr. Alan Slater, chief executive officer of the National Association of Funeral Directors, who is to be commended for his outstanding role in representing the valuable contribution of funeral directors throughout Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80709-0019.htm_para35"><a name="08070967000500">This Government have an absolutely first-class record of helping people out of poverty, examples of which I will not weary the House by giving at this time of the evening, important though they are. The Government also have ambitious plans effectively to address decades of inequalities, and those plans will result in a more equal and fairer society. In that spirit, I urge them to end the shameful feelings suffered by relatives who may have had the most unfortunate experience of having a member of their own family&#151;a loved one&#151;who was too poor to die.</p>

cent. nationally. The total expenditure for Springburn last year was &#163;4.65 million, out of a national gross figure of &#163;45.9 million. For the geographical area covered by Springburn, the average award was &#163;1,133, a fraction less than the national average of &#163;1,162.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08070967000505">On my right hon. Friend&#146;s final question about the amounts of money paid out in respect of social fund funeral payments in each of the past three years, we do not have complete figures because of office mergers, as he has said. During 2005-06, when his constituency was covered by the Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire Jobcentre Plus district, the figure paid was &#163;1.24 million. We have only partial figures for the next year from April to December, when the figure was &#163;880,000. Last year, expenditure was &#163;4.65 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08070967000506">As I have dealt with the figures that my right hon. Friend sought, let me now turn to the operation of the funeral payments scheme as a whole. Last year, 40,000 social fund funeral payments were made at a gross cost of &#163;46 million. I say gross cost because there was some recovery from the estates in many instances. In that way, the funeral payment scheme has continued to provide towards the cost of a simple, respectful, low-cost funeral&#151;that is, to provide for the necessary costs of burial or cremation in full plus a significant contribution towards the fee levied by a funeral director. That fee, as he knows, is currently &#163;700.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08070967000507">Those payments are made to recipients, and the partners of recipients, of income-related benefits and tax credits, thus ensuring that the payment is as widely accessible as possible for people with lower incomes. It is worth looking at the list of qualifying benefits, because for funeral payments it is a long one: income support; income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance; pension credit; child tax credit; working tax credit; housing benefit; and council tax benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08070967000508">It will perhaps come as no surprise to the House that approximately 50 per cent. of funeral expenditure goes to pensioners. Furthermore, last year 55 per cent. of initial awards were paid to the partner of the deceased person. I am confident that the funeral payment scheme provides those who have lost a loved one in circumstances where no provision had been made to cover funeral expenses with a means of meeting what they see to be their obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08070967000509">Although funeral payments do not operate in a cash-limited budget, resources are finite. Although the scheme provides for the full necessary cost of burial or cremation and a significant contribution towards funeral costs for those who need that help the most, I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree that we also have a responsibility to keep public expenditure under control in this area. For that reason, the qualifying criteria are stringent to ensure that payment is made only when it is reasonable for the applicant to have taken responsibility for the cost of the funeral. It is interesting to note that even as far back as 60 years ago, regulations to limit who could receive payment, in what circumstances and what the payment should provide for were considered necessary. Those concerns have been carried forward in the current scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08070967000510">The qualification criteria for who might qualify were tightened several times in the 1990s in an attempt to tackle the issue of people taking responsibility for a funeral and claiming when other members of the family were better placed to do so.

were a reaction to a steady year-on-year increase in expenditure which had reached nearly &#163;63 million by 1994-95. As a result, the number of funeral payment awards dropped and expenditure dropped back to about &#163;42 million.</p>

The scheme allows for the full necessary cost of burial or cremation plus &#163;700 for other funeral expenses. In addition, allowances can be made where appropriate for additional necessary transportation costs and the necessary costs of a return journey for the responsible person, either for the purpose of making arrangements or for attendance at the funeral.</p>

However, as I have already pointed out, the scheme does provide for the full necessary cost of burial or cremation, despite the wide range in those costs, particularly for burials, in different parts of the country. The costs vary widely, and cremations generally cost less than burials. Burial costs can range from &#163;774 to as much as &#163;2,750. For cremation, the range is smaller&#151;between &#163;311 and &#163;530. The average amount included in a funeral payment last year for burial costs was &#163;852, and &#163;495 for cremation costs. The average funeral payment last year was &#163;1,162. That reflects the position after deductions have been made to take into account any moneys held by the deceased or insurance on the life of the deceased that is then available to the responsible person. However, the average payment differs significantly around the country. Last year, the average payment in south-east Wales was &#163;952, while in London&#151;to which my right hon. Friend referred&#151;the figure was &#163;1,550.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08070967000513">The cost of the components of a simple funeral, excluding burial or cremation, also vary significantly for different parts of the country. My officials recently looked at the costs across a number of different geographical areas. In some of those areas, including north Lanarkshire, a simple funeral could be obtained for around &#163;1,000, while the lowest cost of &#163;798 was to be found in Newport, Wales. On the other hand, the most expensive simple funeral, at &#163;1,600, was in Edinburgh. I have to say that it is not entirely clear to me why the costs of a simple, dignified funeral should vary so much from one funeral director to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08070967000514">From those figures, one can see that the total cost of a simple funeral including a burial in Edinburgh would be in the region of &#163;3,300. At the other end of the spectrum, in Cardiff the cost would be &#163;1,572&#151;half the Edinburgh figure. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the amount available as a funeral payment still represents a significant contribution to the cost of a funeral.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08070967000515">Funeral directors must take some responsibility for ensuring that they can take account of a customer&#146;s circumstances before taking a contract to provide a funeral whose cost is clearly beyond the means of that customer, even if a social fund funeral payment is to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08070967000516">As I said earlier, I have regular meetings with the all-party parliamentary group, and I also receive correspondence from the industry trade associations. I value the feedback that comes to me from these quarters. I am pleased to say that we recently introduced the facility for funeral payments to be made directly into the bank account of funeral directors. The industry had been keen for some time to have that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08070967000517">I accept there are big regional variations in add-on costs and that currently there is considerable complexity in the scheme that makes it difficult for those claiming a funeral payment, or their funeral director, to work out what they might be entitled to, or indeed even generally navigate the system. I am keen to try to address those concerns. I have asked my officials to consider over the summer how we might better target the help available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80709-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08070967000518">Although the social fund funeral payment scheme has its detractors&#151;my right hon. Friend listed some continuing issues with it&#151;I believe that it plays an important role in social security safety net provision. It is right that we exercise control on expenditure in this area, but it is also right that we continue to provide, for most customers, a funeral payment that meets the full costs of burial or cremation and goes a significant way to meeting funeral directors&#146; costs. As I have said, I accept that there are some weaknesses in the scheme as it currently operates. My right hon. Friend alluded to them, and I am examining ways of addressing them. I hope to be in a position to say more about that in the not-too-distant future.</p>
