Perhaps he should recognise that in his and other constituencies there are 2.5 million more people in work than in 1997.

If he has not, I urge him to talk to Tata Steel and give it any help and support that it wants to ensure that we have a viable, strong steel sector and that we can keep and protect the 3,000 direct jobs and 30,000 indirect jobs in the economy of Teesside.</p>

 I have been up against seven shadow Chancellors in the past 10 years, but the hon. Gentleman is the only shadow Chancellor who never asks me about inflation, interest rates or the economy. Every time that there is a question about employment and economic activity, he wants to change the agenda. First of all, on the national health service, it is because we have invested twice as much in the NHS that we do not have the waiting times and waiting list crises that the last Conservative Government had. It is because we have managed the economy well that we are able to invest in public services. If he does not think so, why does he always say to business audiences outside the House&#151;he knows that they have to hear the truth about it&#151;that Labour has had great success on the macro-economy? Why does he have to admit that the Tories left the economy in a mess? <i> [Interruption.]</i> Oh yes. There were interest rates of 15 per cent. under the Conservatives in the 1990s. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, who was the political adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992?

In the last month, we started a junction on the M1 with  &#163;14.5 million that was derived from having a good economy. That means that there will be another 8,000 jobs where there used to be four pits that were closed by the Tories. As for the man from the Opposition, my right hon.

 The UK is not unusual, as the savings ratio has declined in the United States, Australia, Japan and Canada, and is lower in the US than in the United Kingdom. The level of the savings ratio in the UK is broadly similar to the level in the 1960s, when there was also high employment, a stable economy and low inflation, so people had less need for the cushion of security that savings can offer.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the importance of savings, and his Committee has consistently examined the issue. We recently completed the second pilot on the saving gateway, which shows promising signs of success. He will know that twice as many people hold the individual savings accounts that we introduced as their predecessors, personal equity plans and tax-exempt savings accounts. He will know, too, that one in four families and people on low incomes hold ISAs, which is far better than the performance of previous schemes. The savings ratio in the UK hit its peak at the very time that repossessions and negative equity hit their peak, and I can assure him that what we will not do is introduce economic policies that will drive us back to the point in the early 1980s, when an estimated 1.5 million households suffered from negative equity.</p>

That is why we are encouraging credit unions, in particular, to move into the current account banking market. There are now nine credit unions offering current accounts, including the White Rose credit union in Wakefield, the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh). We want to see more of that. We are also working with the banks to ensure that they help us to spread current account banking to more credit unions. That could be an effective way of spreading the habit of banking to the 2 million people in this country who still do not have a bank account.</p>

 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. All around the country, Sure Start children&#146;s centres are doing a great job in providing financial advice to lower-income consumers. Only a few weeks ago, in Ilkeston, I saw a credit union in a Sure Start centre that provided both debt advice and a much better way of saving for low-income families than the rip-off, Farepak-type savings schemes that we heard about last year. I agree with my hon. Friend that we should do everything that we can to defend Sure Start in our communities and to resist any attempt to cut back its budgets, which I fear would be the inevitable consequence of the third fiscal rule, which those on the Tory Front Bench continue to promote in order to pay for the tax cuts that they promised.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that we need to ensure that we strengthen the way in which our schools curriculum can support financial education. In our report in January, we set out the steps that we will take, and I met ministerial colleagues in the DFES to take that forward. A particular opportunity for financial education will come from the child trust fund. In two years&#146; time, when every seven-year-old in our country gets an extra top-up into their child trust fund account of &#163;250, or &#163;500 for those from lower-income families, we will ensure that we take the opportunity to embed the proper teaching of financial education and financial literacy into our system, using the child trust fund as a real way to communicate that message to both young people and their parents.</p>

 Given that it is more than two years since the child trust fund was launched, and that it is vital that the children of low-income families are the first to benefit from them, is it not disappointing that the Treasury still has no idea whether children from low-income families are indeed benefiting, and that the only general figures available to the Treasury indicate that one in four children do not take up that child trust fund?

 The hon. Gentleman should know that every child is benefiting. Even in a minority of cases when an account is not opened by the parent, an account is opened by HMRC within the year to ensure that nobody loses out. We published the constituency information in January. I can tell him, as I am sure he knows, that 76 per cent. of families in his constituency actively opened the account. He is right to say that the take-up rate is higher in higher-income constituencies, and that the take-up rate is lower in lower-income constituencies. We need to redouble our efforts to increase take-up. As part of that, we have collected the information, which we will publish as soon as we can, to show exactly what the figures are. The reason we had a child trust fund week at the beginning of the year was to ensure that we raised awareness of the child trust fund among all families, including those on lower incomes.</p>

 I endorse what the right hon. Lady says about the Falkland Islands. All of us, whether we were Members of Parliament or not, remember the dreadful events that led, in the end, to the liberation of the Falklands, and the terrible loss of life among British soldiers and personnel and, I may say, among Argentine personnel, most of whom were conscripts. As I have said before, those of us who were Members of Parliament recognise the steadfast courage and leadership shown by Margaret Thatcher.

For example, Britain has, in many ways, enjoyed its best economic record since records began, and there are now 2 million more people in work and 760,000 fewer unemployed.

was raised with me&#151;by two Opposition Members who represent Kent constituencies&#151;I took it up. I held meetings with them and the Information Commissioner, which involved the other parties, too, to try to sort through things. However, the difficulty that had arisen&#151;not caused by the House or the then Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;was that public authorities were getting ready to issue correspondence without so much as a by your leave from Members of Parliament, still less any consideration of the exemptions that might apply. As there was not a word of argument about the fact that Members of Parliament, as Members of Parliament, should not be classified as public authorities for the purpose of the Act, such an action would have been very serious indeed and would have destroyed the relationship between Members and their constituents, which is fundamental to the way in which we operate on their behalf.

It is desirable that there should be different legal jurisdictions for those activities, reflecting the very different circumstances. May I take it that that is still the Government&#146;s view?

Friend the Secretary of State for Health had come before the House today and said, &#147;A report has just been published; this is what we&#146;re going to do&#148;, the Liberal Democrats would have been the first to complain that we had not had a chance to digest the report and come to sensible conclusions on it. They need to get serious. Of course the issue is urgent, but the report is the first objective scientific assessment of the prevalence of abuse against the elderly. The prerequisite for effective action, which is what we all want, is to consider the report carefully, although as quickly as possible.</p>

 That issue was settled in the devolution legislation, and I would like to hear from the hon. Gentleman whether the Conservatives now propose to go back on that. He should also be told that in the House, the English block vote completely outweighs the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish block votes by a margin of about 5:1, yet the House completely controls the size of the block grant that goes to Scotland. Devolution means difference, and I celebrate that, even if he does not. The truth is that there is no evidence that differences in fee regimes encourage more English students to study in Scotland, or deter significant numbers of Scottish students from studying in England.

and the role of the East Midlands development agency in its demise? KBVT has been helping local businesses start up over the past 22 years, creating thousands of jobs in and around the Kettering constituency. When 43,000 new jobs are required in north Northamptonshire in order to comply with the Government&#146;s sustainable communities plan, the loss of KBVT comes at entirely the wrong time. The Government should step in urgently and save this worthwhile local enterprise agency.</p>

the Secretary of State in order to allow assistance  to be given to the visually impaired for digital switchover. As we understand it, in many areas it is a county council that holds this information, so it is the body covered by the definition of a local authority. In some areas, however, it is a district council that holds the information on those with visual impairment. The Bill needs to take account of that. Clause 5(1)(ii) referred to</p>

Members wish to tease out some of the technical details. The original amendment tabled by the Government would have adequately covered the definition for shire areas with two-tier systems. However, the problem arose because although some metropolitan district councils are the relevant authority, it could be argued that they do not have the functions of county councils. The definition was therefore changed to:</p>
<a name="70614-0007.htm_brev8"><a name="07061427001933"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a district council, other than a council for a district in a county for which there is a county council&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70614-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07061427000312">This is a very important change, because there may have been confusion with metropolitan district councils&#151;that is, virtually all unitary authorities not covered&#151;if they were deemed not to have the functions of a county council. In order to help hon. Members to understand the technical and important nature of the amendment, the Minister could have pointed out that a similar amendment was made in the Public Bill Committee to the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, and that this technical change will bring the definition of a local authority into line with the corresponding provisions of that Bill. I think that that is correct, but I would be grateful for his guidance.</p>

 My hon. Friend is doing an excellent job in explaining the amendment given that the Minister was unable to do so. Does the change in definition give rise to a danger that it will exclude other authorities such as unitary authorities or other types of authority that may come into existence in future? Should it not be slightly broader to enable such authorities to be incorporated without yet another amendment?</p>

 I would like a little more information about how many people will be affected by the change. Do we have a list of the relevant local authorities? Many Members may not know that the amendment could affect their constituents. That information should be in the public domain.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. When the Minister writes to me about digital switchover, it might be helpful if he writes to all hon. Members detailing specifically which councils covered by the amendment have the relevant information, so that when their constituents contact them with concerns about switchover they know which council they should contact in order to assist them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="07061427000329"><a name="70614-0007.htm_spnew23"><a name="07061427002208"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 Clearly this will be a key issue. Many Members will have visually impaired constituents coming to them wanting assistance. It is therefore important that the information should be widely disseminated, specifically in the Library. I hope that when the debate is over a little more information will come into the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="st_o213"><a name="07061427000330"><a name="70614-0007.htm_spnew24"><a name="07061427002209"><b>Mr. Vaizey:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right to say that it is a crucial matter. I do not have the statistics to hand about the average number of visually impaired people per constituency, but it will be a significant number, and by definition they will require assistance from their local authority. It is therefore essential that hon. Members are fully informed about the amendment&#146;s implications for their local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70614-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07061427000331">Let me turn to another aspect, which is covered in the explanatory notes on the Lords amendment. Paragraph 8 states:</p>
<a name="70614-0007.htm_brev9"><a name="07061427001934"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The amendment is not expected to have any financial effects.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70614-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07061427000332">Any hon. Member with even a modicum of common sense would realise that that cannot be an accurate statement. The amendment brings into the scope of the Bill a wide range of local authorities, particularly metropolitan district councils, which might not have expected to be included before it was passed. It will clearly have financial implications for them in terms of their providing information on financial assistance to the visually impaired.

 If a district council that picks up this responsibility does not already hold the data and is not in a position to assist because it was not expecting to, there must be some form of financial implication for it, even if it is allocating to one person the job of looking into these matters and discovering where the subscribers or non-subscribers might be.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. When the Under-Secretary was questioned about the matter in Committee, he skirted around the cost implications. Indeed, he implied that local authorities could absorb the cost in their normal functions. That cannot be the case. Digital switchover has been described as the largest civil project in this country for 30 or 40 years. Bringing local authorities within the scope of the Bill by accepting the amendment, which would bring metropolitan district authorities within its scope, has serious financial implications. I hope that the Under-Secretary will deal with that when he responds to my remarks and those of the hon. Member for Bath, who is the expert on the matter after drawing it to the House&#146;s attention.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point about the effect of the amendment on the progress of digital switchover. As colleagues obviously know, we continue to debate the measure, which has not yet received Royal Assent, but digital switchover continues. We were unable to hear about its progress today, but it is interesting that no legal powers yet exist for Whitehaven district council to share information on the visually impaired.

 We could, by bouncing the amendment back, give the Lords or the Government the opportunity to review it in the light of the fact that it might be better to deal with those matters in a statutory instrument rather than in the Bill. It may therefore be worth considering rejecting the amendment.</p>

 I must tell my hon. Friend that we have decided to accept the amendment because it affects an interpretation clause. As I said when I explained&#151; perhaps more fully than the Under-Secretary&#151;the reasons for the technical amendment, we need to ensure that metropolitan district councils are covered by the Bill. However, my hon. Friend&#146;s point is well made in the light of my constant attempts and those of the hon. Member for Bath to ensure that the House gives digital switchover sufficient scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07061427000346">How does the amendment relate to the publication of the digital switchover help scheme? The Department for Culture, Media and Sport published it on 4 May 2007 and it details the agreement between the BBC and the Department on digital switchover. The Under-Secretary has probably memorised the document and he knows that it refers to a policy review group, which includes the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the BBC Trust, the executive board of the BBC, the Department for Work and Pensions and Digital UK. The hon. Member for Bath encouraged the Under-Secretary to include local authorities because of their knowledge of the data about visually impaired people, and he has presented an amendment that specifically relates to metropolitan district councils, yet local authorities are not included in the policy review group for the digital switchover help scheme. That is an astonishing omission.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, which enables me, in summing up, to reiterate the important matters that my hon. Friends and I have raised. We want to know whether the amendment is sufficiently robust to withstand future changes to the structure of local authorities. My excellent hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) has repeatedly made the point about cost implications. He is always a steward of the taxpayer&#146;s funds. He rightly points out that, in an era of sky high council tax rises, the amendment will have cost implications. I stress again the need to include local authorities in the policy review group. I do not forget the point of my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire about local reorganisation in Scotland. We hope to hear more about that from the Under-Secretary.</p>

Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) and I thank him for his praise for me as the expert on the matter that we are considering. He and I share the view with many hon. Members that digital switchover is important and will bring huge benefits to everyone in this country, and we were anxious to support the Bill to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society also benefited from the changes that digital switchover will bring. We were therefore surprised during the Bill&#146;s passage that the Government had missed out a large number of disadvantaged people because they had failed to consider the data available to local councils. We now know from a parliamentary answer of 26 April this year that some 50,000 people will be assisted because the Government have decided to include within the legislation the obtaining of information from local councils as well as from Government Departments.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister for recognising that that suggestion came from the Liberal Democrat Benches and I am grateful that the Government brought forward an amendment in the other place to ensure that it takes place. Having acknowledged my acceptance of what the Government are doing, I, too, like the hon. Member for Wantage, wish to ask the Minister questions&#151;four very specifically about the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07061427000353">The first question is specifically about Whitehaven, which has been referred to on a number of occasions. Different people will have different views on whether Whitehaven is leading the way or is a guinea pig, or whether what is happening there is a trial. The Minister has told us on a number of occasions that it is not a trial for the main scheme, but that it is none the less an experiment from which we will learn.</p>

 May I remind the hon. Gentleman that when we referred to Whitehaven as a guinea pig, the Minister became extremely upset? I would therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to refer to Whitehaven as a pioneer.</p>

 That is why I chose my words carefully, pointing out that there was some concern about the definition. As I suggested in an intervention on the hon. Member for Wantage, the new definition ensures that Whitehaven council will be able to provide the information. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that I am right. If that is the case, will the Minister explain why in the rest of the country people who have been identified from the information from local councils as well as from Government Departments will be informed that they have been identified and then offered the targeted help scheme, but in Whitehaven the reverse will happen, whereby people who believe themselves to be eligible will have to apply and have their eligibility checked out?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07061427000356">If the amendment is passed, we will know the procedure in the rest of the country when digital roll-out takes place for gathering information and from whom that information would come, but would it not still be possible within the time scales to use the same procedure in Whitehaven? Given the importance of the issue&#151;I should point out that, on the Government&#146;s own estimates, we are talking about 8,600 people&#151;I hope that we will receive a positive response to that question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07061427000357">The amendment refers to the obtaining of information from a particular category of councils. We know that many other councils and Government Departments are to provide the information, but, bearing in mind your earlier ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker, has the Minister changed his mind about whether information gathered from that category of councils is to be made available to the BBC? In Committee, we were clearly told that the BBC would have access to this information. Indeed, I moved an amendment to exclude the BBC from the groups of people who would have access to the information, but it was denied by the Government. However, I read that in other place&#151;</p>

Does the Minister envisage any end point at which it will be deemed that such information will no longer be made available? The Minister will be aware that much debate took place in Committee about a proposed sunset clause&#151;a provision that I believed was crucial. The Government have not agreed to a sunset clause for data from all the other sources of information, but will the Minister consider one at least in respect of the data that will be collected from this category of council?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07061427000362">Finally, and I hope very helpfully to the Minister, this category of council and the data that will obtained from it will enable a group of people who might otherwise not have been assisted to benefit from the targeted help scheme. I am sure that that group of people&#151;if, because of your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker, no other&#151;who might be assisted by the new definition would be interested to know about the progress of the targeted help scheme. Will the Minister provide an update of progress on the assistance that that group of people might be able to get? I look forward to hearing the answers to those four questions. </p>

 I pressed my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) on the point about costs related to the amendment. If a local council has access to the data on the visually impaired and those who may benefit from the scheme in the Bill, that information will have to be passed on. The local council will have to respond to individuals who may be claiming their entitlement or, conversely, depending on how the land lies in the Bill proper, the council will have a duty to initiate contact with those individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07061427000364">As a result of the amendment, those councils will now include district councils, which until now may not have expected to be included as a data-gatherer or passer-on of that data. The councils that need to transfer the data may not have been aware that they had that extra function to perform. It thus strikes me, without a shade of doubt, that there are cost implications for the council collecting the data, and even just for the transfer of data that has already been collected to the district council or authority and thereon to the BBC or the Government, and vice-versa. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70614-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07061427000365">I reiterate to the Minister that I have some concerns about point 8 of the explanatory notes, which states:</p>

It is my pleasure to move amendment No. 6 and, first, I declare an interest: my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests shows that I am a director of a property company and a building company and a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Building. When the amendments were tabled, an &#147;R&#148; should have appeared after my name to signify those interests. Could those with a pen please append an &#147;R&#148; in brackets after &#147;Mr. Robert Syms&#148;? I apologise to the Committee for that omission. The Bill has proceeded fairly quickly; it had its Second Reading only last Thursday, amendments had to be tabled earlier this week and we are dealing with the Committee stage less than a week later. I am sorry that my registered interests were omitted in all that haste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07061427000384">The Government committed themselves to making this change in the March 2007 Budget, as a result of the Barker review of land and planning that was produced in December 2006. There are different views about the benefits or advantages presented by Kate Barker. The Government also asked the Lyons inquiry to look into this matter, and when it published its report at the same time as the Budget, it broadly supported the measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07061427000385">Today, we are trying to amend this extremely short Bill. Essentially, it has only one clause&#151;we have seen many examples of one-clause Bills&#151;and that is a cause for concern for many of those affected by it. We tabled amendment No. 6 because the implications of the Bill are far-reaching. According to the Government papers explaining the Bill, it is expected that the changes will raise &#163;1 billion&#151;no small amount. Indeed, business rates in their entirety raise half as much as the total corporation tax take, so this is very big money in terms of what the Treasury raises. We are not talking about small change. The exemptions that the Committee must consider are very important.</p>

 Before my hon. Friend turns to the exemptions, may I take him up on his good point about the amount of money that the provisions are likely to raise? Is he satisfied that those who represent the people and companies affected by the provisions were properly consulted before this Committee stage? It seems to me that the Government are rushing this measure through.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="07061427000387"><a name="70614-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="07061427002237"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07061427000388">Amendment No. 6 deals with exemptions, which would affect the amount of money raised by the provisions. Money will therefore be a key part of the debate on the amendment. There is no doubt that the Bill has been introduced relatively quickly. As I said earlier, the Barker review, the Lyons inquiry and the Budget all contributed to it, but there has not been full and proper consultation. That is regrettable. As we go on to explore amendment No. 6 in more detail, we shall see that the Bill will affect a wide range of individuals. A consultation process would have benefited the Government and, certainly, the Opposition. It would also have created much more awareness of the legislative agenda in Parliament. Sometimes people do not appreciate what measures are going through the House until they become law, and they do not therefore have the opportunity to influence Government and Opposition Members when we are framing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07061427000389">The amendment is about exemptions. It is a pity that there has not been widespread consultation, because it means that we might not have sufficient information on the bits and pieces that we are debating today and cannot fully appreciate how strongly people feel about these topics. As I said in my opening remarks,  &#163;1 billion is a lot of money, and has a big impact on businesses and our constituents. It is therefore a pity that the consultation has not been fuller.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07061427000390">Although the Bill is short, with essentially one clause, its schedules also cause concern, especially given that the Government are going to change some of the ways in which property has historically been valued. With regard to paragraph 4 of schedule 1, concern has been expressed that people might do things to their property to try to avoid the business rate. As a result, the CBI, the British Property Federation and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have raised concerns about definitions and how that aspect of the Bill will be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07061427000391">As we are dealing with a fairly short Bill in a short time span and without full consultation, many questions remain unanswered. The Minister has a great opportunity today to set out more fully how the provisions will operate, especially paragraph 4 of schedule 1. Will properties that have been flooded, burned down or bombed be affected by the definitions? If a firm moves out of a property, and a roof or wall must be taken down to extract machinery to move it elsewhere or to put it up for sale, will that be caught by the scope of paragraph 4? That point will be of great concern to people up and down the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07061427000403">The amendment covers several aspects. The Opposition want certain important conditions to appear on the face of the Bill to ensure good, decent legislation. The first of those conditions is proposed new subsection (1A)(a), which refers to the condition that</p>
<a name="70614-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="07061427001945"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the whole hereditament has, subject to subsection (1B), been unoccupied for a continuous period not exceeding three months&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07061427000404">That is an important aspect&#151;that is what applies at present, but it is not on the face of the Bill. We therefore have concerns, because consultation has not taken place.</p>

<p><a name="st_o246"><a name="07061427000405"><a name="70614-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="07061427002242"><b>Mr. Greg Knight:</b>
 What is magic about the period of three months? I envisage a situation in which a family have an unoccupied property, perhaps because a business has folded, and the family, who are not particularly wealthy, intend to put the property on the market. They might have to deal with a liquidation or bankruptcy of one of the partners, and there might be a delay in marketing the property. In many cases, a good argument could be made for the exemption to run for six months.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="07061427000406"><a name="70614-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="07061427002243"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. Some of the legislation goes back many years. More recently, in the 1980s, the period was three months for most property, and six months for industrial property. There has been long debate about the right length of time for an exemption before the tax kicks in. Clearly, if there had been public consultation before the Bill was introduced, we would have more information. Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition have picked the current period, but if it were extended beyond three months&#151;the amendment would not do that&#151;that would have an implication for the overall tax take and the additional &#163;1 billion that the Government are trying to raise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para16"><a name="07061427000407">I suspect that three months is not long enough; a property might have to go through new planning permissions or be marketed by estate agents, and sometimes people drop out. It is a tight timetable, but, historically, it has been the normal period for most categories of property, so we opted for it. I suspect that there is not much difference between the Government and the Opposition on that point, which is why we have tabled the amendment. The provision ought to be on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70614-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0707133000001">Proposed new subsection (1A)(b) is the second provision that should be on the face of the Bill. If an owner cannot occupy a property for a legal reason, he should be exempt. That is the existing situation. It is important that that is made clear for the many thousands of people who will be affected by the Bill. The exemption should be specified.</p>

 I was critical of my hon. Friend for drafting paragraph (a) too narrowly, because three months is inadequate. However, I am concerned that paragraph (b) is drawn too widely. For example, an owner may be regarded as prohibited by law from occupying his property if he is serving a prison sentence. The sentence might well be in relation to defrauding the business that used to occupy the property, so why should he be exempt in those circumstances?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. We have drafted the amendment on the basis of existing legislation. I am not tempted down the road that he suggests, because we want to make progress and need to speed up. However, his point is reasonable and now on the record. If someone cannot occupy a property for a legal reason, it would be sensible for them not to pay the business rate.</p>

The exemption should remain part of the legislation. Paragraph (d) is also important. As Members of Parliament, we all know the importance of conservation and listed buildings. Many of them are in prominent areas of our towns, and we are lucky to have many beautiful and historic towns.

 Will my hon.

In those circumstances, many buildings in the countryside that might be listed or might contribute to the rural environment would come under the empty buildings regulation.

 I do not want to interrupt my hon. Friend&#146;s flow, but will he clarify whether a particular example would be caught by his amendment? A building in the town of Craven Arms in my constituency has been unused, unoccupied and unsafe for decades. It is situated in a prominent part of the high street and has been a blight on that town for many years. The reason for that situation is that the ownership of the property is uncertain.

 We all know that a number of buildings are in a state of disrepair and would fall under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. It is important to exempt them, and we want that to be clear by stating it in the Bill. Sometimes local authorities or a range of organisations have to give grants to do up such properties. If they were not exempt, renovating them and ensuring that they are saved, salvaged and enjoyed by future generations would be a far more difficult task.</p>

Many of us enjoy watching people on television digging up part of our towns to see what our ancestors built. The exemptions in the amendment are important. All of those who enjoy our heritage would demand that the Government include such exemptions in the Bill. It is important to consider paragraph (e), and I hope that the Minister will say much more about it when he responds.</p>

We pretty much know for a fact that we are going to have a change of Prime Minister, and that the Government will be reshuffled between the time the Bill and the amendment are considered and when the various regulations and statutory instruments are introduced. Therefore, it is important to put some of the exemptions on the face of the Bill so that the rating legislation landscape that people have been used to is not changed. No doubt the Minister will have an opportunity to consider and answer my specific points.</p>

I have great sympathy for the civil servants who must&#151;no doubt very efficiently&#151;deal with the legislation and advise the Minister. The Minister&#146;s contribution to rating reform will no doubt prove legendary. Much of this sort of legislation stays on the statute book for a very long time. As  <br>

amendment No. 6 demonstrates, it tends to be &#147;a little bit here, a little bit there&#148;, but it builds up into important case law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70614-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07061427000424">The Bill involves a good deal of money. As I said earlier, business rates raise half as much as corporation tax, and are often the subject of disputes leading to legal actions and tribunal hearings. It is therefore important to make exemptions clear in the Bill rather than awaiting the uncertainty of regulations at a later stage, when another Minister may be in charge.</p>

Insolvency means a traumatic time for many people, and those people need reassurance. Although I was a county councillor at the time and not yet a Member of Parliament, I remember the 1986 Act as ground-breaking legislation. I hope the Minister will accept the provision in paragraph (i), or, failing that, will explain in detail why he cannot do so.</p>

 So far my hon. Friend has taken me with him, and I am minded to support the amendment. I agree that exemptions should be made clear in the Bill. However, I am slightly puzzled by the wording of paragraph (k). Why should a company that is being wound up voluntarily be exempt? The owners of a company may well wind it up voluntarily to avoid paying their dues under the Bill, then form a new company with a different name and effectively continue to trade as before.</p>

 My right hon. Friend&#146;s intervention shows his experience as both a Member of Parliament and a business man. As we all know, people sometimes misuse legislation, but most of those affected by the Insolvency Act are in that position involuntarily rather than voluntarily. A winding-up order is usually made because the company is owed a lot of money and is trying to get some of it back, or to put a company out of business. However, I do not want to digress, Mrs. Heal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70614-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07061427000438">Paragraph (k) shows how complex and difficult insolvency law is, and how it interacts with the problem of business rates. The Bill is being progressed fairly speedily so our discussions are time-limited, but it is important that we debate this matter fully. The Minister must respond in detail on amendment No. 6. I hope that when he replies, he will talk about the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914, and why he thinks that the amendment should not be made. We need answers. It is important that the Government clearly explain their position. Why have they introduced what is essentially a one-clause Bill?

consultation&#151;I have said that before, but it bears repeating. If we had had a full consultation, the public and the business community, and those affected by specific aspects of the Bill&#151;such as accountants, surveyors or lawyers&#151;would have had a much fuller opportunity to feed in their views. That would have given us an opportunity to address their concerns and talk about whether aspects of the business rate that have historically been in law ought to be continued with or amended.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. The measures are historical in that most of the legislation that contains them was passed during the last century and has been woven long ago into rating legislation. However, progress and technology changes the impact of measures. My right hon. Friend raises a point that I had not thought about when producing the amendment. In the past electricity has been generated in, and transmitted from, large plants or large substations. There has been exemption from rating legislation, and we are keen to include that in the Bill. However, if microgeneration increases and there are more small generators for people&#146;s homes and for estates, what impact would the amendment have on the properties concerned? Because of the point that my right hon. Friend has raised, I am now having a few concerns about my amendment. A person or business who generates electricity from their own property might be exempted. Can the Minister reassure me that this historic legislation is still relevant, given the changes in the electricity market, such as the move to microgeneration?</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a good argument. In view of his expertise in this area, which he outlined at the beginning of his speech, can he explain when a property is deemed to be empty? If someone has a storage warehouse that has nothing in it, but which has a windmill fixed to the roof generating electricity, could a tax inspector argue that because electricity is being generated from that building, it is occupied?</p>

 A startlingly large number of issues and subjects could be raised as relevant to the amendment. Every intervention throws up an important point that I shall have to reflect on. The generation of electricity is usually exempt. If there are concerns about this area, the Government might have to reconsider it if they do not accept the amendment and we do not then win the vote on it.</p>

The Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 is a key part of the overall legislation that ought to be exempted. There is concern about these matters because we did not have a consultation, and because people are unsure about how they will be addressed in regulations, as there will soon be a change within the Government. The Opposition are therefore anxious that measures should be included in the Bill.</p>

If he were to accept it, that would save a lot of anguish, angst and difficulty for those affected by the proposed legislation. We heard earlier that it will raise &#163;1 billion.

 I rise to speak on two principles. I am very much on the Government&#146;s side on the rating of empty buildings, because we have been too lax in the past. Given our serious housing problems, we need to ensure that all the buildings we have are properly used, because the alternative is to build yet more in unsuitable places. I am therefore in favour of the principle behind the Bill. However, a second principle means that I am worried about the form of the Bill. I am sure that the Minister, for whom I have considerable admiration, will understand when I say that the difficulty with what appears to be easy, environmentally friendly legislation is that it sometimes leads us to move so fast that we do not consider the implications.</p>

Members have the same experience&#151;is that bits of Bills have unintended results, with sometimes serious results, because they were never debated properly. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) made the point that we would speak on this occasion especially in defence of the interests of our constituents. I raised, for example, the single issue of the effect of the Bill on microgeneration and the extension from the large generating centre to many smaller ones, which is very much the purpose of the commission that I chair on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition. Without revealing anything new, I can say that we will certainly recommend a radical move towards microgeneration. Even raising the issue in this debate has done some good.</p>

Unless the Bill states specifically that in those circumstances the owner would not have to pay the tax&#151;which he would be prepared to pay if only the law did not stop him benefiting from the occupancy of the building&#151;I suspect that the regulations will also miss the point. I have often thought that I have had a good answer to some political point, but have then discussed it and discovered that those who come at it from a different direction are able to think of several new and difficult questions.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend share my view that new Subsection (1A)(b) is too widely drawn? I shall give him an example. Let us say that a husband and wife jointly occupy a property. The husband assaults the wife and the judge makes an order that by law he is not to return to the property as long as his wife is there. He is then by law prohibited from occupying the property. Why should he escape paying rates?</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right to give that example. At the opposite end of the spectrum, if there is no reference to such issues, there is even more likely to be a difficulty. The point is that we need to have the discussion. I suspect that the Minister will not accept the amendment, although I would be pleased if he did so.</p>

Those in the Box, to whom we are not allowed to refer, will at least be thinking that when they prepare the regulations they will have to get that issue right, although they may not have thought of the point that my right hon. Friend raises. I must confess that I had not thought of it myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70614-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07061427000463">The next example in paragraph (c) raises similar problems. If the local authority to which the money would be paid has itself stopped the building being occupied, it would be perverse for it also to be able to demand the money from the people who are not able to occupy it. Unless we make that clear, I can think of some local authorities that, either from perversity or by accident, would end up in that position. They would say, &#147;Well, Parliament did not make any reference to this point, so we have decided, given the generality of the rules under which we operate, we are going to charge. So you, Mr. Jones, you can&#146;t use your property, but you&#146;ve got to pay for it.&#148; That would be manifestly unfair, and the possibility ought to be excluded.</p>

I declare an interest in advice on planning matters, especially in respect of listed buildings and conservation areas. One problem with the present system is that the time taken to deal with building preservation notices has been extended in recent years. The people involved are extremely pressurised and often have to act precipitately to stop irredeemable and irrevocable changes. That is the nature of that sort of order and it may mean that the time involved is very much longer than what is envisaged in the Bill, with the result that, for good community reasons that the House would favour, people may not be able to enjoy the use of their premises in that period.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. The matter is important for a second reason, which is that historic buildings must have an alternative use if they are to be maintained. Empty historic buildings, and especially the domestic type used for commercial purposes that would be covered by the proposal, do no one any good.

The Government are right to want to ensure that empty properties make a proper contribution to the cost of services, but they must make sure that the provisions do not run counter to other legislation, and bankruptcy is a serious problem in that regard. If people are forced to pay to the state money that would otherwise go to people who have a prior demand, a prior requirement and in my view a prior right, they have a right to feel aggrieved.</p>

that loss because it deals with such a large number of bills. All of us in our constituencies have seen cases of individuals who have suffered considerably as a result of bankruptcy. If we add to that the fact that, before creditors&#146; bills are paid, the local authority will be able to take money for a property which is empty due to bankruptcy, it would be entirely unfair. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Poole for putting that issue in such a clear way in the amendment.</p>

It becomes more important in a sense because the present Government have made arrangements, which I supported, to take a broader attitude to bankruptcy&#151;in the past, we have been too tight about it. The Americans have a better way of looking at it and as a result have been able to create many jobs; unlike us, people there have been prepared to take risks. Under the Government&#146;s arrangements we will have more deeds of arrangement so the subsection becomes the more important.</p>

I repeat that I am not seeking to support or protect the bankrupt. I am concerned about people who will be affected by a bankruptcy, a deed of arrangement or a winding-up order. The terms of the paragraph would mean that we were not providing circumstances in which the local authority could get its fingers on money that would be more properly used to redeem someone&#146;s debt.</p>

The fact that he has suffered in one of the longest liquidations in history, mainly as a result of actions taken by the previous Conservative Government, saddens me a great deal. If the liquidator in this hugely difficult process were to pay rates on empty buildings, I doubt whether by now there would be any money left for the people for whom the liquidation technically has taken place.</p>

Where things are owned abroad, liquidations can take a very long time. Although I am sure that chartered accountants have their uses&#151;sometimes I wonder what they are&#151;there is no doubt that they are not the fastest of people when it comes to liquidations.

Friend the Member for Poole will not mind my saying so, but Oppositions are not professional in terms of such matters. These are matters that civil servants&#151;much maligned under this Government&#151;are very good at handling. If the civil service had produced a list of exemptions for the Bill, many of the issues that we have raised would already have been dealt with.

Will the Minister be kind enough to take a message&#151;I hope from the House, but certainly from me? One of the problems that has beset his Government is their unwillingness to go through these processes in detail, some may say boring detail, as we have tried to do in this case.

I am thinking, in particular, of Clun castle and Hopton castle, which are both in my constituency, and Wigmore castle and Brampton Bryan castle, which are just outside my constituency, in the valley where I live.

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07061427000503">Some of the buildings that I have mentioned are owned by English Heritage and have been in receipt of lottery grants for large amounts of money to restore them as ruins&#151;not as buildings for business use. Some of them receive visitors and so there is some income to be generated from them, but often they are visitor attractions run by volunteers and do not generate sufficient income adequately to recompense the cost of keeping them going. Adding to the burden placed on such buildings, through additional rating duties, would be most unwelcome and would help to put some of them at risk. It is important that such buildings are exempted from business rates in their entirety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07061427000504">I should have declared an interest in the case of Hopton castle, because I have the distinct privilege of having been appointed patron of the Hopton castle restoration fund. We have succeeded in securing a grant from English Heritage of approaching &#163;1 million to restore the property to a state in which it could be opened to the public. To highlight the difficulty, I should point out that Hopton Castle is in a village. In fact, it is barely a village; it is a collection of houses with, I think, 45 inhabitants. It would be quite impossible for that group of people to maintain the property from their own resources. The rates would represent a considerable cost in the event of their applying to the property. It is important that exemptions for such properties are spelled out in the Bill and subsequently in regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07061427000505">Secondly, I want to touch on what happens when properties are empty and the ownership is uncertain or unclaimed&#151;an issue that I raised in an intervention earlier. That will be a relatively rare occurrence, because most properties have a value and most people who have a claim on such property are likely to seek to be identified with it. However, there are properties where, because of the nature of their decay and dilapidation, the cost of acknowledging ownership would be too prohibitive for likely claimants. I hope that the Minister will respond to the suggestion that there are certain categories of property where ownership is uncertain and where business rates should not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07061427000506">I can think of an example of a property that, rather like its former occupier, is unloved and unwanted. Nobody is able to pay for its upkeep. I am not seeking in any way to assist the Labour party out of its financial difficulties, but given that the last occupier was the Craven Arms Labour club, which, as far as I am aware, has not existed in my lifetime&#151;and long may that be the case&#151;the property provides the Minister with an interesting example of the problem that I have identified, and I would like him to help us, in the generality, to find a solution. In particular, perhaps he could help the inheritors of the Craven Arms Labour club&#151;Ludlow Labour party, I believe&#151;to get out of their difficulty by exempting them from business rates on unclaimed property.</p>

It is at the very least odd that the Government are proceeding with the legislation at such a pace; and at the very worst, it shows a disrespect for the public and Parliament. Now that we are in Committee, which followed so soon after Second Reading, we are forced to ask why the Bill was not subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, and why there was not wide consultation with interested parties and groups before the House was asked to make a decision on the matter. That is a relevant point to raise, because the Minister is seeking to hurry the legislation through at the very time when the Leader of the House, who chairs the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons, is telling us that he wants the Executive to have greater respect for Parliament, and to allow greater parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

 Amendment No. 6 has my support, imperfections and all.

Nor has he said that he will deal with the exemptions by putting them in the Bill. My right hon.

I can understand why the provision is there&#151;it is because we want to achieve a balance between being fair to the owner and seeking to bring a property back into use. In some instances, however, there may be good reasons why the property is vacant for more than three months, and I should have preferred paragraph (a) to allow the owner to plead cause beyond that period. I regret the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole chose not to include such a provision. That is a minor criticism of the drafting, however, and I none the less support the amendment.</p>

I gave my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal an example of a situation that may arise when a violent husband attacks his spouse and is subject to a court order that prevents him from re-entering his property. In those circumstances, paragraph (b) would exempt him from paying any rateable charge, which I am sure is not what we intend to achieve. Perhaps the Minister will give us his thoughts on the matter when he responds to the debate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07061427000519">Paragraph (c) of proposed new subsection (1A) is an essential exemption. A property may be kept vacant by the Health and Safety Executive, acting on behalf of the Crown, because a staircase is unsafe. If the property is a listed building, specialists may have to be brought in to carry out alterations to the staircase before it can be safely used. In the interim, the owner, who is using all his endeavours to improve the property, should not face a rates bill, so paragraph (c) is vital. I hope that the Minister accepts it, but if he does not, I hope that a similar exemption will apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07061427000520">Turning to paragraph (h), I had some experience when practising as a solicitor of dealing with the winding up of estates. Sometimes that is easy and quick to complete, but that is not so if there is no will or, if there is one, if the family do not know where the beneficiaries live. Documentation may be missing, so probate sometimes takes far more than a year to complete. In the interim it is wholly unfair to charge the personal representative, who may be a family member and not a well-paid solicitor who can reimburse himself for any charges by charging the estate. Why should the widow or widower who has to deal with the estate in a time of emotional stress and difficulty suddenly find that they have to pay, in addition to any duties payable by the estate, a rateable charge on an empty property? I therefore hope that the Minister will accept the fairness and common sense of the exemption in paragraph (h).</p>

legislation. The Bill should not have been introduced, but we are, however, considering it. We are trying to make it better, so I hope that the Minister accepts amendment No. 6.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="07061427000522"><a name="70614-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="07061427002293"><b>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b>
 I had not intended to speak in this debate, and I certainly do not intend to do so for as long as some of the preceding speakers. Having listened to their contributions, however, I believe that amendment No. 6 is a useful provision, at least in spirit&#151;the phrase used by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)&#151;because it answers one of the main concerns expressed by groups who have lobbied us on the Bill, even those who are well disposed towards it. I recall the evidence from the Federation of Small Businesses, which supported the Bill but said that what was needed to improve it was a better definition of how to exempt groups of property owners who were genuinely trying to occupy their property. That is what the various proposed exemptions try, in their different ways, to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07061427000523">I shall group the exemptions, rather than discuss them individually. The conditions in paragraphs (h) to (l) are designed to help people who are trapped in legal processes entirely beyond their control. That might arise as a result of death or of bankruptcy or insolvency. The legal mills will not grind any faster because the Government have changed the tax procedures. However hard people try, they will none the less be penalised unless some exemptions are provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07061427000524">The second group of cases is covered by the exemptions in paragraphs (b) to (e), which deal with cases in which official authorities have created obstacles to use. That might arise because of historic buildings and, in some cases&#151;this applies to the exemption referred to in paragraph (c)&#151;where there are difficulties with the planning process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07061427000525">In a typical case that I have encountered several times in my constituency, shopkeepers find that their shops are no longer viable. They start using the shop as an office or a burger bar and planning officers come down on them quite heavily for improper use. Enforcement orders are issued, followed by appeals against enforcement orders and applications for permission. The planning staff say that it must be demonstrated over a substantial period that the shop is not viable as a shop. A long process is involved, and the owners are barred from using the premises in the meantime. Such practical situations arise on many occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07061427000526">I have listened to the speeches and I believe that amendment No. 6 is helpful in setting out many of the practical circumstances in which a property owner is entirely genuine in trying to use property but is unable to do so. If the amendment is not acceptable to the Government, I hope the Minister will explain how he would address the problem that the Federation of Small Businesses outlined very well.</p>

I was hoping that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) would tell us what they were, but I suspect, Sir Alan, that you would have stopped him, just as you are about to stop me now, so I will move quickly to the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07061427000529">The problem with the amendment is not the justification or otherwise for the exemptions that it proposes, but a misunderstanding of what the amendment would do if it were written into the Bill. Let me explain why that is the case. I think that that will satisfy right hon. and hon. Members who have raised in depth concerns that were expressed on Second Reading. It is important that we respond to those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07061427000530">When I read the amendment, it looked very familiar. As I looked into it, I realised that the amendment, subject to minor tweaking, is taken from the wording of the Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) Regulations 1989, as amended. The regulations flowed from the Local Government Finance Act 1988, and it is the 1988 Act that the Bill seeks to amend. Putting the 1988 Act regulations into the Bill would insert into it exemptions that are already in place in such a way that we would not be able to change them, should we want to, without primary legislation. In other words, the exemptions are already there.</p>

I increasingly realise why he served in government for such a long time. In fact, I think that he was the longest-serving Local Government Minister, so I take what he says very seriously. Over the summer, we will consult on the regulations to take on board the points that interested parties, including hon. Members, may make. Putting the existing regulations into the Bill would not achieve what right hon. and hon. Members want to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70614-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07061427000532">Hon. Members have referred to several problems. I could use the Aunt Agatha analogy, which is a good one. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) mentioned planning issues, which were also raised on Second Reading. Those and other problems already exist under the current time scale and rate of collection, and they would continue to exist whatever the algebraic formula in clause 1. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) is not here to hear that, but those points are not relevant to the Bill, although the amendment has given us the opportunity to explain the position.</p>

I will contact the hon. Gentleman, who is a distinguished member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel, to explain how his right hon. and hon.

In other words, the 1988 Act gave the Secretary of State the power&#151;subject of course to the passing of the necessary regulations&#151;to determine the exact classes of unoccupied hereditament that should be subject to empty property rates. By means of some rather convoluted double negatives, the effect of the regulations is to include within the empty property rates regime all unoccupied hereditaments except those falling within certain specified classes of exemption.</p>

 Will the Minister clarify the position of cemeteries? As someone in that line of business, I know that valuations have been carried out throughout the country that are aimed at rating cemeteries as businesses. At what point does a cemetery become unoccupied? Is it a hereditament? Cemeteries are obviously occupied for a long time after burials. People who run private sector and local authority cemeteries would like to be reassured that they will not pay rates in perpetuity, despite the fact that those buried are there in perpetuity.</p>

However, the point is not relevant because the Bill does not deal with exceptions and exemptions from rates, which the 1989 regulations already tackle.

That exemption is in both secondary legislation and on the face of the Bill, and the Government have invited support for it.

 Is it on the point that we are discussing? </p>

<p><a name="st_o309"><a name="07061427000547"><a name="70614-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="07061427002305"><b>Mr. Knight:</b>
 On that very point, because is it not the key to the whole debate? If the exemptions were locked into the Bill, a successor to the Minister could not reduce the list of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o310"><a name="07061427000548"><a name="70614-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="07061427002306"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 I would have to come to a judgment on that. The flexibility exists for local authorities to go further in respect of the amount of the exempted rate, but the problem would then be the same as the one that our predecessors faced in 1988&#151;that the overall tax take has to be considered at some point in time. The hon. Member for Poole chided me for the alleged lack of consultation on the Bill. It is, of course, a finance measure that has developed out of the Budget and I would argue that consultation took place through the Barker and Lyons reviews. The regulations will also be consulted on, but this is a finance measure being dealt with, after consulting the House authorities, through a Bill to be considered by a Committee of the whole House, rather than through a Finance Bill Committee. This is a matter of local government finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07061427000549">I hope that I have given adequate time&#151;I certainly had until today&#151;to debate the Bill. I felt that the consultation that flows from it on account of it being a finance measure would be better done this way. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire raises a reasonable point, but it is a question of balance. I have to do what anyone in my position has to do, which is to protect  <br>

business rate payers from too many exemptions. One can envisage circumstances in which many organisations could argue for exemption&#151;the agriculture industry did so successfully, for example, and there may be others&#151;so it is a question of balance. He raises a reasonable point, but I disagree with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07061427000550">I hope that I have explained the logic of our opposition to the amendment. I genuinely believe that it achieves the opposite of what it intends. I studied the amendment carefully and saw that that was the case. I hope that our debate on the exemptions does not cloud the fact that this Bill is about the time period for the exemptions for empty property rates, not about the exemptions themselves. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o311"><a name="07061427000551"><a name="70614-0013.htm_spnew8"><a name="07061427002307"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 We have debated a detailed and wide-ranging amendment, covering subjects as broad as castles, historic cars, violent husbands, labour clubs and cemeteries. That has demonstrated the Bill&#146;s impact on communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) made the point that the provision in the Bill is the fourth largest revenue raiser in the Budget, so it is bound to have a large impact. That is why it is important to debate the exemptions thoroughly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07061427000552">I was pleased by the Minister&#146;s reasonable response to the debate and he dealt with many of the concerns of hon. Members. Regretfully, however, I still feel that we should press the matter to a vote. Bills with only one substantive clause may be short, but because of the range of concerns expressed today, I believe that the Committee should have the opportunity to vote. I therefore press the amendment.</p>

cogent case, but I am afraid that I was detained elsewhere on family business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07061427000948">The amendments fall within two groups. They deal with the broad question of planning and land use, but amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are naturally grouped together, because they form part of one coherent argument, and amendment No. 5 is separate, because although it deals with planning matters, it relates to a different part of the Bill and is meant to deal with a different specific eventuality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07061427000949">Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are essentially tests of the Government&#146;s integrity. Amendment No. 5 is an attempt to achieve the Government&#146;s intentions more effectively than we believe the Bill itself is capable of achieving them. In that respect, whether the Government accept amendment No. 5 is a test of their sincerity. If Ministers genuinely want to achieve the goals stated in legislation and argued for by them in earlier debates, we believe that they will have to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07061427000950">Let me briefly explain why we tabled amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4. They deal with a new and specific exemption that we wish to introduce. In our debate on amendment No. 6 we discussed the whole question of exemptions, their appropriateness, and whether they should be contained in primary legislation or in secondary regulation to be presented at a later date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07061427000951">The Minister accepted that there were exemptions that should be included in primary legislation. We had a brief exchange on the subject when I intervened on him. I am afraid, however, that his customary authority lapsed at that point, because he presented us with a circular argument. We pointed out that we wished to introduce a whole set of exemptions that were entirely in accordance with custom, practice and previous legislation. Cases for all those exemptions were made with exemplary clarity by my hon. Friends. The Minister&#146;s case against the exemptions was that it would be inappropriate to deal with them in primary legislation, but he accepted that the Bill contained exemptions for charities and sporting ventures&#151;because, he said, they were in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07061427000952">That is a circular argument. The Minister is saying that an egg is an egg is an egg, because he says that it is an egg. I am afraid, however, that this combination of yolk, albumen and shell is not an egg, because it does not pass muster with me. There is no logical reason why one exemption is in primary legislation and another set of exemptions are considered appropriate for secondary legislation, other than precedent and ministerial edict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70614-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07061427000953">We know that the Minister is capable of logic, reason and fluent argument. We have seen him display that capability many times at the Dispatch Box. It is incumbent on him now to explain to us why certain exemptions must be in primary legislation while others are fit only for regulation. It will not be good enough to argue, as he did earlier, that a period of consultation is necessary before we introduce exemptions. That argument would strike at the heart of the Bill. On Second Reading and in the Ways and Means debate, Conservative Members argued for consultation. Why? Because when Sir Michael Lyons introduced the idea of removing or amending the relief for empty properties, he argued explicitly that there should be consultation before business rates were reformed, probably in about 2010. The Government chose not to engage in that  <br>

period of consultation. Instead, they decided to legislate precipitately in what was characterised in the previous debate as a rush to plunder.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="07061427000959"><a name="70614-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="07061427002695"><b>Michael Gove:</b>
 Thank you, Sir Alan, for your helpful advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07061427000960">The reason why Treasury Ministers spoke was not any lack of confidence in ministerial colleagues, but the fact that this measure is palpably a straightforward tax demand. It is not about the more efficient use of land. It is about the more efficient&#151;or, rather, the more rapid&#151;acquisition of revenue for the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07061427000961">These amendments put the Government to the test. If they are genuinely willing for land to be used more efficiently, and if they genuinely believe that the measure is about encouraging regeneration, they will have no hesitation in accepting the amendments, because they would exempt from the scope of the legislation properties that are empty specifically because they are going through the planning process. They would exempt properties that are in the middle of a regeneration programme, such as those for which planning applications have been made or which are awaiting the result of a planning appeal. Such properties should be specifically exempted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07061427000962">Let me explain why this specific exemption is worthy of this set of amendments. The amendments relate to the ideal of regeneration and, as we explored in previous debates, regeneration is a difficult process for those engaged in commercial property. When addressing regeneration in areas of past urban blight that require new commercial enterprises for new life to be breathed into them, we must recognise that people who are prepared to invest in those areas are taking a risk. Almost by definition, any area that is not currently a thriving business area&#151;any area where additional commercial investment is clearly required or where we wish to encourage regeneration&#151;is an area where the market fundamentals are not yet in place to attract the investment that we would all wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07061427000963">Therefore, when someone brings forward a specific regeneration project, they do so with a close eye on the balance of advantage and the balance sheet. As they look at any particular regeneration project, they might look at a balance of sites in any particular city or town. They will try to get together a critical mass of land in the right areas to allow them to proceed with a regeneration project that will give them a satisfactory return on capital. As we all know, in the commercial property world sites can come up rather more slowly than one would wish in order to maximise the efficiency of a project. Nevertheless, in order to try to ensure that a project is both successful and genuinely transformative, an enlightened investor will wait and exercise patience until the exact portfolio of sites comes into alignment. As they wait for that to happen, it will of necessity be the case that some of those sites are left empty. They are elements in what will be a transformed landscape that cannot be transformed piecemeal. The developer has to wait until all those areas are available before he is ready to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07061427000964">If the legislation is not amended, an additional tax will have to be paid on many of the parcels of land waiting to be packaged together, because the current relief on rating will no longer exist. That could mean that potentially viable regeneration projects would be rendered unviable as a result of the tax change. It stands to reason for every business that if it faces an increased tax bill, its economic activity will be penalised. As mentioned earlier, that is a not a hypothetical consideration, but a real-life concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07061427000965">In an earlier debate, I mentioned the specific case of Palmer Capital Partners, which has, as reported in <i> Property Week</i>, already had to abandon regeneration projects because of the anticipated tax hit of this legislation. I am afraid that my accent meant that I did not pronounce the &#147;r&#148; at the end of Palmer sufficiently; the name is Palmer as in Huntley and Palmer, or Harry Palmer. The reason why that is relevant is that the Minister interpreted me to mean Palma, the capital of Majorca, the principal Balearic island, so he thought that the company was some sort of Mediterranean fly-by-night enterprise. That was an opportunity for him to suggest, with his characteristic sprezzatura, that the only people who were complaining were the villains whom he had previously identified in the property market&#151;commercial property organisations that deliberately leave properties empty. I hope that he will take this opportunity to reassure Palmer Capital Partners that he appreciates that it is an entirely reputable organisation. He has the lifebelt of being able to say that it was my curious Aberdonian accent that lured him into making that mistake.</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="07061427000966"><a name="70614-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061427002696"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 It could have been my Lancastrian hearing. I did mishear the hon. Gentleman and thought that he had said &#147;Palma&#148;, but I certainly intended no slur against the company involved, or the good people of Majorca. In fact, a study of the regeneration of Palma, especially in the mediaeval city centre, would give us an example of a fantastic property development and regeneration project, from which we could certainly learn a lot.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="07061427000967"><a name="70614-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="07061427002697"><b>Michael Gove:</b>
 I am grateful to the Minister for taking that opportunity to clarify the position. I knew that he meant no ill by his comment. If anything, his comments in the previous debate were evidence of his ludic wit, not a reflection of any desire to condemn the operation of Palmer Capital Partners, or any other company. I am sure that the Minister&#146;s experience of Palma is greater than many other hon. Members&#146; experience, and I am glad to know that when he went to Majorca his principal aim was to investigate how successfully it had regenerated itself economically. I suspect that that regeneration has been most successful in the catering, leisure and hotel sectors, and some UK cities should learn from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07061427000968">It is appropriate to acknowledge that Palmer has had to abandon certain projects, because that is a real-life example of a company prevented by the Bill from going ahead with regeneration. Other companies in a similar position would benefit from the amendment. When properties are deliberately left empty to secure regeneration benefits, an extension of relief while planning permissions are dealt with would mean that the companies involved could bring forward projects that would not occur otherwise. If the Government are willing to stay their hand in a few cases, the resulting economic benefits would be enjoyed by everyone, but especially by people in the areas most in need of economic and commercial development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07061427000969">On Second Reading, we discussed the north-east as a case study of the effects of the Bill. The Minister referred to Eldon square in Newcastle, where rents are significantly higher than in other parts of the city, and implied that there was a dysfunctionality in the planning or local government finance systems that only the Bill  <br>

could put right. However, it is impossible to gauge how effective the economic regeneration of the north-east has been without taking account of the fact that industry there has made its unhappiness with the proposals very clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07061427000970">The Minister may not be familiar with Evans Easyspace, which operates out of North Shields in north Tyneside. A new commercial operation that it opened in July 2005 contains 17 small offices, and the same number of workshops. They are let to new and start-up businesses&#151;exactly the sort of enterprises that a Government committed to regeneration would want to support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07061427000971">The centre is a success, having reached an optimum occupancy of 91 per cent., although the Minister will note that Evans Easyspace is already taking a hit because some properties on the site are not occupied. The company argues that if the changes proposed in the Bill had been in place when it was conceiving its enterprise, it would have had to pay an additional &#163;53,000 in empty property rates. It says that that is a conservative estimate, and that the sum of money involved might have made the difference between deciding to going ahead with the project and staying  its hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07061427000972">There is high demand for jobs in north Tyneside, so how can the Government put forward a Bill that companies in the area consider to be entirely counter-productive? What would the Minister say to Evans Easyspace and other enterprising companies that choose to locate in areas where their services are most needed, and which are explicitly concerned about the potential effect that the Bill as it stands will have on future investment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07061427000973">I accept that when developers gather parcels of property for regeneration, the seriousness of their intent to use all the sites that they have amassed in that geographical area can be open to doubt. It may well be that some of those sites are meant to form part of a regeneration project, but other sites, offices or premises may be left vacant for longer than would otherwise be wise or prudent. That is an extremely unlikely eventuality. As I explained on Second Reading, I do not believe that there is widespread economic masochism in the commercial property sector. I believe that most people who have chosen to take a risk and invest in commercial property recognise that it is appropriate to ensure that there are tenants in the property generating income which can make their investment worth while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07061427000975">However, I will allow that it is theoretically possible that land on which a return could be made is not used to maximum efficiency at a given point. That principle is accepted in the broader debate on land use when we come to talk about land banking. I can see the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) nodding thoughtfully. As a member of the Select Committee that scrutinises the Department for Communities and Local Government, I know that she has been doing some work on the subject. Individuals, for whatever reason, choose to stockpile land that is developable and hold it back off the market in the hope perhaps of making a capital gain rather than to see it used in the most efficient way.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>14 Jun 2007 : Column 931</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07061427000976">It is appropriate that we get land banking in context. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that the principle of deliberately holding land back and not seeking the maximum return on it is at the heart of the Bill and it is something that we question. There is some useful evidence that calls into question whether such hoarding of space that could be more effectively used economically takes place. A letter was published in the <i> Financial Times </i>today from the executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, who points out that in 97 per cent. of developments that have implementable planning permission builders have been on site within three months. That reinforces the truth that most operators are only too eager and willing to see the land on which they have secured planning permission used for commercial ends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07061427000977">We accept that in certain circumstances people might conceivably hoard land. The amendment ensures that in any case in which that suspicion might arise it can be effectively erased. It covers those organisations or individuals who are in the planning process. They might have had planning permission turned down and are waiting for the planning inspectorate in Bristol to give its ruling so that development can go ahead. Given that seeking planning permission is of itself prima facie evidence of an intent to develop, and it is not a cheap process or one that anyone would undertake lightly, if a planning application has been made for a site, it is pretty clear to us that the individual or organisation who owns that site wants to see it used in a healthy, vibrant, commercial fashion. They should therefore not be penalised in the way that the Bill proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07061427000978">The Government have introduced the Bill in the hope that land will be used more efficiently. What better test could there be of the willingness of individuals and organisations to see land used efficiently than the fact that they have sought planning permission for that site? If the Minister&#146;s original thesis is correct that some individuals deliberately hold back property on which they could earn a useful commercial return, whoever these wicked individuals are, they are clearly not people who are seeking planning permission or waiting for the result of an appeal from the planning inspector. So whatever wicked individuals the Minister wishes to catch with this legislation, the amendment will ensure that the virtuous are not affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07061427000979">The Minister may argue that the inevitable cost of accepting the amendment will be taxation revenue forgone. However, I invite him to think about the cases in which such taxation revenue might be forgone: when properties remain empty and under-utilised because an individual is waiting for planning permission or for the planning inspectorate to rule. The answer to any lack of revenue that may be consequent on the passing of the amendment thus lies directly in the Government&#146;s hands. If they ensure through their reforms, which we are discussing in the context of the planning White Paper, that the planning system as a whole is effectively simplified and streamlined, it will ensure that, working hand in hand with local government, there will be no undue delays in the planning system. It will quickly be found that the change of use properties required to achieve maximum commercial return is granted. Industry will benefit. Users of those services will benefit and of course the Government will benefit because we will not have properties caught in limbo  <br>

awaiting the result of a planning application and, consequent on the amendment, not paying tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07061427000980">The challenge for the Minister is to explain why a Government who have introduced the planning White Paper, and hope to legislate this autumn to simplify the planning system, have insufficient confidence in their legislation to accept our amendment. If they are telling us the truth about the planning White Paper and the planning system there is no problem; there will be no delays&#151;certainly none greater than three months&#151;in granting planning permission and beginning development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07061427000981">As the Minister knows, specific targets have been brought in for planning applications; they vary depending on the size of the development and are measured in terms of weeks, but they are indicative guidelines only; some local authorities are better at meeting them than others&#151;it is notable that Conservative local authorities are often more successful in that regard than Labour. Party politics aside, however, we recognise that the Government have through the planning delivery agreement system sought to incentivise the speedy processing of planning applications. There is, however, a problem with the PDA system; as it sometimes incentivises speed over the quality treatment of planning applications, it can lead to the premature rejection of planning applications because a local authority is anxious to meet its PDA targets. Good planning applications, which should be accepted, are peremptorily rejected. As a result, planning applications have to go to appeal and the whole process is elongated and made more complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07061427000982">If the Government simply rely on PDA and existing instruments to guarantee that properties are not left empty and undeveloped for too long, we fear it will be insufficient. It is only through prompt implementation of changes to the planning system that the benefits that the Minister has described, and we recognise are required, can be brought about. I hope that when the Minister replies, he will explain the changes in the planning system that will ensure effective and prompt transfer of land from redundant and uncommercial use to successful commercial use. If he is as persuasive as he normally is, his arguments in favour of the planning White Paper and planning reform will in effect be arguments in favour of amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07061427000983">I have not yet talked about amendment No. 5, which is grouped with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 for the convenience of the House because they deal with planning overall. However, amendment No. 5 is what might be termed a guards van to the rest of the train of my argument&#151;it is connected, but it serves a different purpose. Amendment No. 5 deals with a specific part of the Bill that the Government have introduced following gentle pressure from the Opposition.</p>

We had the unfortunate example of individuals who suddenly found that their empty properties were liable for full rates who felt that they had to vandalise their own property.

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07061427000985">When we put the reality of history&#151;and therefore the real dangers of choosing to legislate again in the same manner&#151;to the Government in the Ways and Means debate, they were to an extent dismissive. They said that they felt that the risk was being exaggerated. However, a few weeks later when we had the Second Reading, the Government, who had been a little dismissive at first, accepted that we had a good point and attempted to deal in the Bill with just such a perverse consequence. They said&#151;I hope that I will not paraphrase them inaccurately&#151;&#147;If we have a commercial vandal who does violence to his own property, we will judge the rates payable on that property on the state it was in before the individual engaged in that act of economic self-harm and harm to the broader community and economy.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07061427000986">On Second Reading, we raised some concerns about that. We could understand why the Government, having accepted our arguments, sought to legislate to deal with the issue, but we were concerned about proving intent. How can one be certain whether any changes that have occurred to a property are tax avoidance or whether they are legitimate? How can one make a window to a commercial property developer&#146;s soul?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70614-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07061427000987">Amendment No. 5 is intended to provide the Government with a lifeline. We still think that the Bill is unnecessarily loose, so we have attempted to tighten it by a few notches to make sure that those whom it captures are smaller in number and more likely to be genuine commercial property vandals. The amendment would ensure that anyone who makes changes to their property in accordance with planning permission is not whacked in the same way by the Bill. It would allow an organisation or individual who had stripped out floors or taken off roofs as part of a commercially sensible or far-sighted change to continue to enjoy exemptions. It would include in the Bill clear protection for individuals who want to change their property in a way that is consistent with maximising long-term benefits from it.</p>

If we take several steps back and look at the train that is amendments Nos. 2 to 4, and the guard&#146;s van that is amendment No. 5, from an appropriate distance, so that we can see them all together and can attempt to judge them, or at least present them, to the House together, we see that one of the things that unites them is an attempt to ensure that the legislation covers only those people whom the Government have said that they intended it to cover. What all the amendments seek to do is to give effect to the Minister&#146;s stated intentions. If the Government are sincere in their belief that the legislation is all about the more effective use of land, and the more prudent development of commercial property; if it is all about ensuring that regeneration can proceed, and that small retailers and other small business have the opportunities that they should have; if that is the  <br>

In that respect, the group of amendments goes beyond the scope of the Bill and strikes at the heart of the Government&#146;s intentions over the next two years. Will they legislate in the national interest? Will they take a sufficiently enlightened view of representations from citizens and other interests within our nation? Will they listen and learn, in the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and will they take a genuinely holistic view of the well-being of the nation, or are they narrowly focused on what is currently in the Treasury&#146;s interests? That broad question&#151;I submit that there can be no broader question&#151;lies at the heart of these tightly framed amendments.

We will shortly hear the Minister explain the reasoning behind his reaction to the amendments, but by tabling them, we have set a clear test.

Again, he put  <br>

words in my mouth when he claimed that I described speculative property developers as wicked individuals. May I repeat that the Bill is not based on the premise that there are deliberate attempts to construct buildings that remain empty? It does, however, give people an incentive to put buildings into the market. None of those matters, however, are dealt with in the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07061427000996">At the core of the debate is the issue of planning, and the hon. Gentleman contended that buildings that are subject to planning application or which are awaiting decisions should be exempt. If we accepted the amendments, every sensible business person in the country&#151;and business people are sensible&#151;would whack in a planning application, and the non-domestic rating system would collapse, because people can submit such applications as often as they want and for as many different schemes as they want to. The amendments would therefore not achieve the objective claimed by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07061427000997">I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument about planning delivery incentives. If we followed his logic, businesses could exempt themselves from rates by submitting a planning application, and most of them would do so. Consequently, local authorities would face a funding crisis, because the amount of money they receive from business rates constitutes, off the top of my head, about 20 per cent. of their income. They would therefore have to deal with applications in a matter of seconds, public consultation would go out the window, and the vicious circle would continue. Of course, that is hypothetical and would not arise, but that is the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, so the amendments would not achieve what he said they would. He tempted me to describe our planning law proposals, but I will resist the temptation because, first, it is outside the remit of the amendment and, secondly, I am not daft. He will therefore have to wait to see the proposals.</p>

 The Minister is indeed not daft, but he is unnecessarily evasive. As he kindly acknowledged, the amendments deal specifically with a requirement that properties that are the subject of planning applications should be exempt. The Government are about to undertake one of the biggest upheavals to the planning system, perhaps since 1991 and certainly since 2004. Given that they say that the planning system will be made more efficient as a result of those changes, it is irresponsible of the Minister to leave that gaping void at the heart of the debate.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman listens to the whole argument, he will find that I answer that point. First, however, I shall attempt to answer his specific questions. He raised the issue of self-vandalisation and companies that deliberately take the roof off, as it were. In discussions with industrial organisations and representative bodies, including the British Property Federation, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is often prayed in aid, and the Rating Surveyors Association, we were told that the phenomenon of taking the roof off, albeit important, was rare. However, representations by those bodies  <br>

prompted the anti-avoidance measures on which we will consult in detail next month. To repeat my argument about the consultation, the Bill arises from a finance measure, but its provisions are not part of the Finance Bill, because they deal with local government finance. The usual consultation periods have therefore been changed. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that full consultation on the &#147;taking the roof off&#148; issue will take place. We listened to representations on that.</p>

 I note the gracious way in which the Minister has acknowledged that consultation will take place on the &#147;taking the roof off&#148; issue, but he will remember from Second Reading what we might characterise as the &#147;windy night&#148; debate. I should say, for the benefit of <i> Hansard</i>, that that is &#147;windy night&#148; as in a night when it is windy, not Wendy Knight, whoever she may be&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> From Palma, no doubt&#151;a Balearic dance queen, perhaps.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a fair point. I shall come to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07061427001003">I shall deal first with the reason why charities and community amateur sports clubs are exempted in the Bill. Section 45 of the 1988 Act placed those two categories in primary legislation. I imagine&#151;I do not say this to impugn the intention of the Secretary of State at the time&#151;that he wanted to highlight those exemptions, so he wrote them into the Bill. If I got my newspapers from 1988 back from the Library, I am sure there would be headlines such as &#147;Government exempts charities and amateur sports clubs&#148;. It is because they were specified in the Act and because we are reducing the rate from 10 per cent. to 0 per cent. that we must amend primary legislation and cannot deal with that in regulations. I should have made that clearer before, and I am sorry I did not do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07061427001004">Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 would together have the effect of granting a 50 per cent. relief from rates for any owner of an empty property who makes any planning application or appeal. The intention of the amendments, as the hon. Gentleman explained, is to protect owners from having to pay full rates when they are redeveloping an empty property in order to bring it back into use, which is a desirable objective. That is the overall purpose of the Bill. Let me therefore reassure the hon. Gentleman that, under the existing system, in most cases owners of empty property will not pay any rates while permitted development work is under way. From the point that a builder lays a hand on an empty property to start development work, the property can generally be removed from the rating list, and the owner&#146;s rates liability will be zero. The Government have no intention of changing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07061427001005">The amendments seek to offer relief from empty property rates from the point at which a planning application is made, rather than the point at which the work to develop the property begins. The effect would therefore be to subsidise owners to keep property empty throughout the planning process, however long it takes, and regardless of whether the owner genuinely intends to redevelop the property. That would provide  <br>

a huge incentive for owners of empty property to make a planning application even if they did not intend to redevelop the property, in order to avoid rates. That would not only create a massive loophole, enabling avoidance of empty property rates on a major scale, but would generate a huge volume of spurious planning applications, potentially clogging up the system and slowing down decisions for those who have made genuine applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07061427001006">I appreciate the concerns expressed by hon. Members about the time it can take to gain planning permission to redevelop empty property, which we have discussed in previous debates. The Government, to be fair&#151;I am always keen to be fair to the Government&#151;set out proposals to improve the speed and responsiveness of the planning system in the planning White Paper published in May. The hon. Gentleman tried to tempt me down that road. However, there is no case for subsidising owners to keep property empty while it is the subject of a planning application or appeal. Until development work actually begins, empty property is quite capable of occupation by an active business, and owners should therefore be liable for the full reformed empty property rate to provide a strong incentive for them to re-let the property, on short-term, flexible terms if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07061427001007">On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury drew the House&#146;s attention to the views of a firm that attempts to place small businesses into available commercial property. Let me remind the Committee that in that firm&#146;s professional opinion, the reformed empty property rate will create new opportunities for smaller companies and more innovation and flexibility on the part of landlords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07061427001008">The amendments would create a loophole that would wreck the benefits of reform, in terms of lower rents and better access to premises, that are anticipated not only by the firm that I mentioned but by the Federation of Small Businesses, Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker, the Government, and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who in the previous debate expressed his support for the principal aim of the Bill. The amendments would subsidise owners to keep property empty and place an equivalent burden on to other taxpayers, and they would enable rates avoidance to take place on a major scale. For all those reasons, I have great difficulty with them. Although I accept the Opposition&#146;s objective in seeking to smooth the planning system and to ensure that delays do not cause undue financial penalties on companies, I fear that the proposal would have the opposite effect.</p>

Member for Surrey Heath described it&#151;also deals with planning matters. It relates to paragraph 4  of schedule 1, which inserts new section 66A into the 1988 Act. Let me briefly explain the purpose of that new section. It empowers the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to make regulations to deal with rate avoidance tactics that could potentially be employed by owners of empty property, such as the removal of roofs, which we have already discussed. The amendment deals with the application of anti-avoidance regulations in circumstances where property is altered in the course of permitted development work.  <br>

I assume that the hon. Gentleman wants to prevent the application of anti-avoidance measures if an empty property is damaged when it is genuinely being redeveloped to be put back into use. Let me assure him and the rest of the Committee from the outset that the Government wholeheartedly agree that work carried out under planning permission should not be classed as avoidance activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70614-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07061427001010">The hon. Gentleman may be surprised to hear that the amendment would achieve the opposite effect of what he and I now agree we want to do. It would require anti-avoidance measures to be applied to properties that were being redeveloped with planning permission, meaning that the valuation officer would have to disregard the change in the state of property for rating purposes. If the amendment were accepted, owners of properties that were being redeveloped could end up paying more in rates than they otherwise would. The amendment has highlighted that point, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that. However, I reassure him, on the main point of his argument, that the Government agree that work carried out under planning permission should not be classed as avoidance activity. That will be made clear as the weeks go on. On that basis, I ask him to consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="07061427001011"><a name="70614-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="07061427002705"><b>Michael Gove:</b>
 I am grateful to the Minister for making his case, but he invites us to take on trust his assurances about amendment No. 5 and to accept his argument on amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4. We cannot do that. He accepts that amendment No. 5 serves the purpose about which we agree, but prefers us to wait for subsequent secondary legislation, while we want the provision to appear in the Bill.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for accepting that we agree about the purpose that we are trying to achieve.

 That is merely a variation of the argument that the Minister powerfully deployed against amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4, which is that planning would be used as an anti-avoidance measure. We contend that no one would willingly go through the planning system unless they had to, given the system&#146;s scale, complexity and cost, notwithstanding the changes that the Government will try to make&#151;in good faith, I am sure&#151;to planning legislation.</p>

A key part of the Bill is the Government&#146;s exemption for charities and sports clubs. We tabled amendment No. 1 because, although 86 per cent. of village halls are vested in some kind of charity, a number still might not fall within that definition. Even if 86 per cent. are covered as charities, an awful lot of village halls and community centres are still not covered.</p>

real value to our constituents. The purpose of the amendment is therefore to make it explicitly clear that such halls should not be caught by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07061427001398">For a number of years, I was a rural county councillor. I was always amazed by the sometimes bizarre and unusual methods by which people get village halls. Sometimes, farmers give a piece of land and build a village hall for the community. While, effectively, it is the village hall, its ownership might still be vested in a local landowner or prominent member of the community. That is why we moved the amendment. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07061427001399">Such facilities are greatly valued. People often put a great deal of time into painting, upkeep and ensuring that the facilities are available to the local community. It would therefore be a pity if the Bill, a major revenue-raiser of more than &#163;1 billion&#151;the fourth largest raiser of money in the 2007 Budget&#151;were to catch the small proportion of community and village halls that are not registered as charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07061427001400">The Minister has a useful opportunity, before the end of play, to set out why the amendment should not be accepted. The amendment would reinforce the good aspects of the Bill, and, as we have heard, charities and sports clubs are covered by it. By slightly broadening the provision, it would ensure the survival of valuable community facilities. The Government should not intend those facilities to be affected by this revenue-raising change. I look forward to hearing his comments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="07061427001401"><a name="70614-0016.htm_spnew0"><a name="07061427003083"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 I appreciate the motive behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment. I readily confess that my argument is a difficult one, but I shall explain my logic for not supporting his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07061427001402">The motive of the amendment is to extend to community-owned village halls and community centres the zero-rating liability that the Bill provides for empty properties owned by charities and community amateur sports clubs, where those properties appear likely to be next used for charitable purposes or for the purposes of the club. In essence, the problem is one of definition, as well as of trying to determine where the boundaries of exemptions from rates should lie.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07061427001403">The amendment seeks to protect facilities owned by the community. The hon. Gentleman referred to his experiences as a rural county councillor, and I represent an urban and rural area that has many community and village halls. Once one scratches the surface, however, it is apparent that ownership, and the definition of community ownership, is not always that clear. I remind the Committee that community amateur sports clubs are well defined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07061427001404">My next argument is that a great many of our village halls and community centres are held by charitable organisations and will benefit from the zero rating of empty properties held by charities. Therefore, that provision does not need amending, and I would have had some difficulty had that not been the case. In addition, the opportunities for charitable registration have recently been improved by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07061427001405">I remind the Committee of the wide support that the Government are extending to community organisations as part of our strategy of reconnecting with the public, which the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill and other measures address. For example, the &#163;30 million community asset fund has  <br>

been announced. In addition, on 7 June, we published the departmental third sector strategy, of which a key proposal, subject to the comprehensive spending review, is to support community-owned village halls, community centres and other such facilities. We want to stimulate and develop enterprise by transferring assets to community ownership and management through the expansion of earned revenue. The Quirk report is about exactly that. We are creating more community-owned assets, which makes the issues covered in the amendment more pertinent, and the hon. Gentleman is right to raise them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07061427001406">Perhaps hon. Members are concerned to ensure that parish councils and other bodies that own community facilities, as well as the community itself, enjoy zero rates liability when the facilities are empty, as charitable bodies will by virtue of the Bill. However, the practical effect of any exemption would always be to remove any incentive for owners of an empty property previously used for a community purpose to bring it back into use. We have concluded that in the particular case of charities, whether they own community facilities or any other type of property, the case for exemption does, exceptionally, outweigh our general presumption that all owners should be subject to empty property rates other than in cases where an exemption is already available. I remind the Committee&#151;again, this is an important point in meeting the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns&#151;that properties with a low rateable value of less than &#163;2,200 are exempt.</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="07061427001407"><a name="70614-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061427003084"><b>Michael Gove:</b>
 I might have misheard but, in trying to follow the Minister&#146;s logic, I fear that I might have misunderstood him. Is he genuinely asserting that owners of community facilities, such as those who are responsible for village halls, would wilfully keep those premises empty and would need the goad of the Bill to ensure the efficient disposition of their assets? It seems bizarre that we would have the situation that he appears to have described.</p>

<p><a name="st_o332"><a name="07061427001408"><a name="70614-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="07061427003085"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 I do not think that there would be examples of people wilfully keeping premises empty, but I can envisage how a bill landing on a doormat might prompt change if a community asset has not been used for a number of years, perhaps because the committee members or the activists who kept things going have moved on. The general presumption of the policy is to give incentives to owners of empty properties to put them back into use. There is a balance to be struck in the case of charitable organisations that outweighs the exemption, with the &#163;2,200 threshold and charitable status covering many village and community halls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07061427001409">It is much more difficult to extend new zero rates to different types of owner, such as public bodies. Here the problem of definition comes into play. We could all invent exemptions for types of owner and types of building: we could come up with a list of worthy causes as long as our arm. The purpose of the regime proposed in the Bill is to give owners an incentive to return their empty properties to active use, whether  <br>

they are vacant city offices or rural halls. We do not wish to subsidise properties to lie empty. The application to public buildings, including parish halls and community halls, creates a very difficult situation in which the definition of a community or village hall would make the legislation unworkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07061427001410">As I have said many times, we will examine the issue of exemptions in the summer, and I therefore ask the hon. Member for Poole to withdraw his amendment. I congratulate him on tabling it, because it reflects a real argument that will take place in communities, but I think that, on balance, it is likely to foster circumstances whereby community halls would be allowed to lie empty rather than be put to good active use. Nothing is more visible and more likely to damage a community, whether it is a village or an urban neighbourhood, than an empty hall at the end of the road that is usually covered in weeds and graffiti. We want to return such buildings to use for the benefit of the community, and I fear the amendment would not achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07061427001411"><a name="70614-0016.htm_spnew3"><a name="07061427003086"><b>Mr. Syms:</b>
 I thank the Minister for the way in which he responded to the debate. The problem is that when certain exemptions are included in a Bill, the question arises of where the boundaries should be drawn, and the arguments are always difficult to deploy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07061427001412">I have often seen housing developments on the edge of villages or in towns that have included community facilities as some of the planning gain. That leaves the problem of older halls that might need redevelopment and remain empty. A new hall might not be 100 per cent. provided by a developer: it might need new chairs, or redecoration. This tax proposal could well affect the ability to provide first-class facilities for communities that badly need them and that would use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07061427001413">I am sorry to tell the Minister that we will press the amendment to a Division; it is one of those afternoons. I hope that, in due course, he will take account of the arguments, particularly in his consultation.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07061427001796">In earlier debates on this Bill, my hon. Friends the Economic and Financial Secretaries to the Treasury and I explained why the Government consider this Bill to be such an important piece of legislation. The current policy on the rating of empty properties is based on a set of economic circumstances that simply does not exist in the UK today, and which does not fulfil the requirement for the efficient use of property and the regeneration of brownfield sites to meet our housing needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07061427001797">The Government&#146;s commitment to regeneration and to meeting those needs cannot be faulted, and I assure the House that that will remain the case, but I have also made it clear that devoting more than &#163;70 million in tax relief every year to the owners of empty properties in Westminster is simply unjustifiable. Consequently, it is time to reform the blanket relief extended to empty commercial property. In place of that relief, the Government are moving their support for regeneration and renewal towards a brand new, and much better targeted, 100 per cent. capital allowance for the renovation of property in our assisted areas. I strongly believe that that meets the points made by hon.  <br>

Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley), Opposition Members and Liberal Democrat Members in interventions and in speeches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07061427001798">We have introduced this new allowance now, so that owners of unlet property in these areas can take advantage of the new incentive before the changes to empty property rates. Furthermore, we have consulted on a wider application of land remediation relief to a much broader range of contaminated and derelict brownfield sites specifically in order to promote efficient use of our developed land and to help protect greenfield sites. I believe that those two measures allow policy to meet the reasonable and correct objection made by a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House that there are different types of market in different parts of the country. That point was made by constituency Members of Parliament as well as by hon. Members speaking on a wider policy agenda. I ask the House to consider the other measures that I have mentioned in the round with this measure. I hope that my hon. Friends, and Opposition Members, will see that the Bill is part of a much wider package of measures, supporting regeneration but also meeting the needs of business and our communities for active property markets and efficient use of land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07061427001799">We have decided that for charities and community amateur sports clubs there will be 100 per cent. relief from empty property rates. These organisations play such a key role in our society, often leading regeneration efforts, and the Bill offers substantial additional help to them. For the rest of the business community, this Bill will reduce rents and provide opportunities for new companies, expanding companies and companies wanting to join the most successful economy in the G7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07061427001800">I repeat what I said in the Ways and Means debate and on Second Reading. We have the successful policy of linking business rates&#151;or non-domestic rates as they are properly called&#151;to the retail prices index cap. As that business rate is based on rental value, not capital value, the successful implementation of the policy in bringing rents down over the years will indeed, as the Red Book acknowledges, see a diminution in the revenue that it generates, the more successful it becomes. That is the serious answer that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary gave to the serious objection that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) has raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70614-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07061427001801">This is, of course, a revenue-raising policy. It was a policy announced as part of a Budget package and its process through the House has been unusual. I am grateful to the House authorities for their guidance and advice in this regard. However, it is far from the case that the Bill is simply a matter of raising revenue. It also embodies a policy on land use and properties, and our own Red Book acknowledges that there will be a diminution in the revenue raised. As the cap on business rates exists, the total yield from business rates cannot rise higher than inflation.</p>

Friend the Chancellor has made a huge contribution to growth in the UK economy and to moving it into a state fit to compete with the best in the 21st century. He has provided research and development tax credits, a boost to science budgets and lower rates of corporation tax&#151;which of course have to be taken into account when considering the proportion of revenue raised  <br>

from business rates, because corporation tax has come down, and come down again this year. In addition, there are new investment allowances for all firms. Those are all parts of an economy that can also deliver a minimum wage, expanded support for child care and greater protection for the elderly and most vulnerable in society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07061427001803">There is one league table that we are not willing to sit atop&#151;the ranking of rents paid by firms to locate in our towns and cities. High rents might be a sign of companies recognising the attractiveness of locating in the UK, and to some extent a marker of how successful we are, but in a global economy they are not the measure of success we want, nor something we can afford in the long term. Let me reiterate: we are not saying that high rents are a result of landlords deliberately playing the market. We recognise the value and importance that property investment and property developers play in our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07061427001804">Nevertheless, we have been presented with recommendations from the Barker report&#151;Kate Barker is one of the country&#146;s top economists&#151;and from Sir Michael Lyons, the leading expert on local government finance and incentives, both of which pointed to what my hon. Friends at the Treasury would call the supply side advantages of reducing tax relief for empty property, so as the Chancellor made clear to the House on Budget day, we are introducing the Bill both to answer criticisms that supply is distorted by the current relief and the different treatment of types of property, and to provide new opportunities for start-up and expanding firms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07061427001805">However, we are not insensitive to the possibility that conditions can change, which should not be seen by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath as a weak link or an admission that we are heading for recession. That would be unfair and ridiculous, but of course I know that he would not say such a thing. I pick up <i> The Times</i> every day to see what he has written. I enjoyed his column about &#147;Big Brother&#148;, and strongly agreed  with him; I was grateful that he did not write about the Bill&#151;although not as grateful as his readers will  have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07061427001806">Unlike the last time such a policy was considered, I am not suggesting to the House that the rate of tax be set in stone so that it is impossible to respond to changing situations. That is why we took the approach in the Bill&#151;the point came out during our debate on the first group of amendments. Similarly, we know that leaseholders holding unwanted property are an important group for special consideration; hence our agreement to consult on how best to introduce in the tax system recognition for payments made by companies to rid themselves of onerous leases. Nor are we attempting to remove the returns from property that many investors enjoy; a Government with a track record of introducing real estate investment trusts, providing a framework for parallel treatment of property held by authorised investment funds and maintaining the stable growth in the economy that is the basis of strong demand for property could not fairly be accused of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07061427001807">I hope, therefore, that our willingness to look at the issue in the round and to be flexible in our legislation, as well as the package of measures and ongoing consultations, will serve as proof to the House that this really is a measure to expedite change for the better,  <br>

 I am grateful for that guidance,  Sir Michael. I was simply directed by the knowledge that the Minister has been playing a part as campaign manager for one of the candidates in the deputy leadership race. There is another campaign manager for another candidate in the Chamber at the moment&#151;whose interest in the Bill I am grateful to see at this stage.</p>

As I remarked in Committee, their presence in our earlier deliberations&#151;and the presence of the Financial Secretary now&#151;is welcome, but revealing. In a way, we have seen the hand of the puppeteer. We have seen the real moving spirit behind the legislation, in the presence of Treasury Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07061427001814">It has been our contention throughout that the Bill is not about the right way to incentivise the use of commercial property; it is about providing the Chancellor of the Exchequer with roughly an extra  &#163;1 billion a year to dispose of. The presence of Treasury Ministers is a powerful piece of evidence to underline that case, but there is also the fact that when we asked for evidence from the Government to prove that there are individuals who are deliberately and wilfully keeping property vacant, that evidence was never produced. For all the vaunted eloquence of Treasury Ministers and Ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government, we lack  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07061427001815">When we were discussing the last amendment in Committee, the Minister said that the Government did not wish to subsidise buildings to lie empty. It is a view shared across the House that wherever possible, buildings should be put to effective use, but we profoundly differ from the Government over the contention that the Bill would ensure that land and buildings were used more effectively. Although we were treated to a number of ingenious, entertaining and informative arguments at each stage of the Bill&#146;s progress, we were denied any proof&#151;certainly any proof that would convince anyone with a knowledge of the commercial property sector&#151;that the Bill would ensure that property was better used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07061427001816">It was striking that, as the Bill made its way through the House, people outside the House who have an interest made their view known in a powerful way.

 And the <i> Evening Standard.</i> The Minister sought to convince us that because the FSB had supported a change in the legislation we should accept what he was trying to bring about. However, on Second Reading we heard from my hon. Friends that the case made by the Federation of Small Businesses was much more nuanced than the Minister might have led us to believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07061427001819">Even if the Federation of Small Businesses might appear to be a supportive, if equivocal, witness on the Government&#146;s behalf, the weight of its testimony was overborne by the weight of testimony from other organisations, which were critical of what the Government sought to put forward. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Confederation of British Industry, the British Property Federation and the British Retail Consortium all felt sufficiently moved to argue outside the House that what Ministers were advancing was directly contrary to the commercial interests not just of their members but of the country. However, Ministers did not address their arguments head on, or accept that the competitiveness and flexibility of the commercial property market would be hit by the measure. Because they failed to acknowledge that, I have to say that&#151;however eloquently they defended their position&#151;the case was not made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07061427001820">I suspect that the question &#147;Why do properties lie empty?&#148; is at the heart of the Department for Communities and Local Government&#146;s aim in bringing forward the legislation; it is certainly at the heart of what the Minister claimed was its aim. On Second Reading, Opposition Members brought forward a compelling narrative that explained why vacancies and voids occurred. Vacancies and voids are a natural consequence of a healthy market; we made the point that in the commercial property sector they sometimes last between 12 and 24 months, as one business winds down and a new business is put in place. We said that the legislation, which will end relief after three months, takes no account of the pace and tempo of operations in the commercial property sector.  <br>

Furthermore, in debate on the Ways and Means resolution, on Second Reading and in Committee we pointed out that the real reason why properties lie empty and unused when they could be put to good commercial use derives from the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07061427001821">In our previous deliberations, I remember my hon. Friends the Members for Salisbury (Robert Key), for St. Albans (Anne Main), for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) pointing out a variety of examples, taken from their constituency casebook or furnished to them by interested parties, of cases in which commercial concerns wished to see their properties filled, but were prevented from filling them by the operation of the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07061427001822">When we discussed the Bill in Committee, we put it to the Minister that he should seek to amend the legislation to take account of the weaknesses in the planning system. We said that he should, at the very least, furnish us with evidence that the planning White Paper and the legislation consequent on it would deal with those problems. Regrettably, he once again disappointed us. He certainly showed&#151;I am grateful for his sensitivity in acknowledging it&#151;that he was aware that our case was not ill-founded, frivolous, or made in a spirit of partisan wrecking. He acknowledged that all the points that we made were genuine and rooted in the experience of our constituents or commercial organisations with genuine expertise. He acknowledged that, and we thank him for it, but he did not provide any measure of intellectual relief, as it were; he did not show how the changes that the Government would make to the planning system would ensure that property was used in the most effective way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07061427001823">When talking about planning and the justification for the measure before us, the Minister prayed in aid Barker and Lyons. They were the two presiding deities in whose name the Bill was introduced&#151;but again, one of the things that he failed to acknowledge throughout our debates was the fact that he had been quoting selectively from the Barker review and the Lyons report. The Barker review made it clear that when considering non-domestic rates, it was important to acknowledge that relief was a balancing mechanism; relief is there to ensure that when no commercial activity is taking place, no taxation penalty is exacted. There has been no reflection of Barker&#146;s acknowledgment of that balancing mechanism either in the case that the Minister made or in the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07061427001824">As for Sir Michael Lyons, the Minister calls him perhaps the greatest expert on local government finance whom we know. I respectfully submit that when it comes to authorities on local government finance, my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)&#151;and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), for that matter; I am happy to concede that point&#151;are entitled to take their place alongside Sir Michael. Nevertheless, we both agree that Sir Michael Lyons is a pretty big cheese in the world of local government finance. Why is it, then, that the Government are prepared to take only the crumbs that they consider savoury, and push the rest to the side of the plate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07061427001825">Sir Michael Lyons made it clear that changes to non-domestic rates should be taken in the round, should be introduced after consultation, and should not be made before 2010. As we have pointed out at  <br>

every stage, the changes are piecemeal, and they are being introduced early, after inadequate consultation, simply so that we can ensure that the Treasury is satisfied with its yield.</p>

Friends in the Treasury, which put me in mind of the television series &#147;Our Friends in the North&#148;, because the Opposition inferred that the legislation was introduced by friends in the north, who were the heavy mob. In the presence of the Financial Secretary by the Minister&#146;s side, we see a representative of management who is here to ensure that the legislation delivers what it was meant to deliver: a tidy sum into the coffers&#151;no questions asked, squire&#151;to ensure that the big guy in No. 11 gets what he wants. It is for that reason that we find the legislation profoundly unsatisfactory. It has been introduced to balance the books, which an improvident Chancellor over the past 10 years has failed to balance in the nation&#146;s interests.</p>

 I should like to develop some of the comments that I made in the Ways and Means debate, which were consolidated by my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07061427001828">Time sat rather heavily on us this afternoon. It was enlivened by some erudite shafts of wit from the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) and some rather nice turns of phrase that we may hear again on &#147;Newsnight Review&#148;, but apart from that, it was rather heavy going. I want briefly to recap the basic arguments about the Bill, at the heart of which is a perfectly sensible proposition about providing an economic incentive to use property more efficiently. We have three basic reservations, which have been partly, but not entirely, alleviated. The first concerns the process, particularly the consultation; the second concerns the Government&#146;s motives, particularly the revenue aspect; the third concerns unintended consequences and special problems arising from the fact that there is no such thing as a uniform property market, as that market is complex and variegated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07061427001829">It is true, as the Government argue, that if we impose an economic penalty on unoccupied property, business has an incentive to use property more intensively and cut rents to fill it. The model is obviously sensible in a simple market framework, but the position is a little more complicated than that. I reread the Lyons report and what Barker had to say. It was interesting that  Sir Michael Lyons quoted Stiglitz, one of the top global economists&#151;I am not sure whether he is a Nobel laureate, but he has certainly been lined up for that prize&#151;who tried to set out the basic economic arguments about empty property and taxation. He made the point that the property market is different from markets in apples and pears, or in cars, because entrepreneurs have to build property ahead of demand&#151;that is the nature of the business&#151;so a certain amount of spare capacity is built in. There is a risk associated with that, particularly if there is a risk of being penalised for creating excess capacity. The economic argument is that there is a good case for empty property taxation relief, because risk sharing is involved. Without that relief, investment would never take place. At issue, therefore, is not the principle but  <br>

the period within which it is sensible to create empty property relief to encourage the healthy growth, as well as the balancing, of the property market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07061427001830">The first of our three main concerns is about the process. It was clear from the Lyons report that Lyons himself envisaged a much longer period of consultation before his recommendation was put into legislation. The Government are consulting about exemptions, and they are consulting separately about particular problems with leases, which is welcome. That is welcome, but the fundamental point, which has been made several times by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, is that when the results of those consultations bear fruit, they will take the form of secondary legislation, which will not be subject to the same extensive scrutiny as the Bill. The process is therefore not as satisfactory as it could be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07061427001831">Secondly, it is clear that the Bill is a revenue-raising measure. Ministers have turned that to their advantage as a debating point by saying to the Opposition parties, &#147;Well, if you&#146;re against the Bill, how would you raise the &#163;950 million?&#148; That is a fair debating point, as far as it goes, but it raises the obvious question about who pays that &#163;950 million. I have never been clear who the Government think would pay it. They would argue that it is not paid by the tenants of commercial property, because they argue that rents will fall. When Ministers were challenged, from the Liberal Democrat Benches I think, about the potential impact on institutional investors who have extensive property portfolios,  they said that those investors would not lose anything either, because there would be an increase in profits in the sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07061427001832">So how will the miracle happen whereby the  Government acquire substantial revenues&#151;&#163;950 million, although admittedly those would be regressive as rents fall? Who will pay? No one, apparently. There is something odd about the logic. If the Government were a little more honest and accepted that there will be serious losers in the property sector, at least we would be clear about their thinking. The Government could argue that, to a degree, nobody is a loser if the whole system becomes much more efficient and the British economy becomes more efficient. That could indeed be the case, but I have not heard it explained what the Government&#146;s objectives are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07061427001833">We know from the helpful tables at the back of the Library research paper that the average level of voids is about 9 per cent. in England and Wales. Sophisticated property companies probably operate on a 6 to 7 per cent. basis. It would be interesting to know what the Government think the natural level of vacancy should be, and how realistic it is to expect that to be achieved. Unless the level falls, the property sector will pay more, and that will be paid by the owners, who are usually institutional investors, or by tenants, directly or indirectly. Somebody must pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07061427001834">The third set of issues relates to the exemptions and the special difficulties, which fall into two parts. The first was debated extensively today, and I will not review all the arguments, which were well made, about the problems associated with legal difficulties, planning and historical buildings. Those will have to be dealt with. The second set of issues, which has not been debated, involves the differences between different parts of the country. In the Ways and Means debate and on Second Reading we argued about the particular  <br>

problems that were said to be likely to accrue in areas like Wales, where there have been many factory closures, and parts of west Yorkshire, which are subject to regeneration, and the difficulties that those areas have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07061427001835">Regeneration often takes place in the industrial sector by advance building, with an expectation that property could remain empty for a considerable time. It relies very much on speculative building on industrial estates, so those areas could be penalised. One of the difficulties that I have in trying to understand what is going on is connected with the differences between different parts of the UK. Perhaps the Minister can explain. I am not trying to make a point. I am trying to understand what is going on. There are big differences between different local authority areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70614-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07061427001836">It was not surprising that the biggest area of unused property in Britain, let alone in London, is Hackney, because Hackney is an extremely problematic area with serious regeneration difficulties. There are some strange anomalies. My own borough, which is quite prosperous and is rapidly growing, has a vacancy rate of about  6 per cent. Next-door Hounslow, which is equally dynamic, has a vacancy rate of about 14 per cent. Manchester and Birmingham, which have problem areas, have very high vacancy rates. Newcastle, which has the same problems, has a very low one. Why these enormous discrepancies occur, and what the impact of the Bill will be on them, is not clear to me. The Government have expressed their willingness to be flexible&#151;if, for example, there is a period of recession&#151;but how flexible can they be in recognising the differences in different parts of the UK and in allowing regional exemptions? Many of those issues will be pursued in the other place, as there are clearly a lot of unresolved questions.</p>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise the complex issues of the north-east regional spatial strategy. The regional spatial strategy is the blueprint for future development in the north-east, so, if we are to flourish, it must reflect the needs and aspirations of the region. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated that his objective is to equalise growth rates across the country. Under the Northern Way strategy, it was agreed that our objective should be to narrow the output gap of &#163;29 billion between the north and the south. Despite claiming to be a document that will tackle deprivation, create a buoyant employment market, and adopt an holistic approach to climate change and energy use, the detailed plans completely fail to do that. On this matter, County Durham speaks with one voice. All the local authorities, county and district, and all the county&#146;s Back-Bench MPs are united in our concern about the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07061427001843">Our argument is clear: the regional spatial strategy underestimated the potential for new investment, economic growth and jobs. In doing so, it put a clamp on our excellent, existing employment sites. Consequently, housing allocations are too low and the transport plans inadequate. By concentrating development in the city regions, it does nothing to cut travel-to-work distances, promote sustainability or counter climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07061427001844">NETPark is a highly successful collaboration between Durham university, the county council and the private sector. Let me give one example of what has happened in my constituency as a result of our having NETPark in County Durham. Thorns, the lighting manufacturer, which has its headquarters in Frankfurt, has decided to build a wholly new site, guaranteeing 600 jobs for another 20 years, partly because there is collaboration between the private sector and the university to develop organic lighting at NETPark. That is the best of modern manufacturing. However, by limiting the development at NETPark to 13 hectares instead of the proposed  49 hectares, the regional spatial strategy compromises its stated goal of facilitating north-east regeneration through what it calls</p>

The negative impact of those gloomy growth forecasts is felt most acutely in the housing allocations. Despite net inward migration, which the north-east has experienced in recent years, and the poor quality of housing stock, the regional spatial strategy plans a net increase of 6,500 new properties a year&#151;a small fraction of the 120,000 homes a year that the Barker report stated was necessary nationwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07061427001853">Although I appreciate the need not to overdevelop in specific areas, especially on the western side of my constituency, to protect the beauty and tranquillity of the local environment, a high level of sustainable development is clearly possible in the north-east. In County Durham, the regional spatial strategy proposes only 19,000 net housing additions between now and 2021, which equates to 1,100 homes a year. However, the county council believes that we need at least 1,300 homes a year simply to maintain the population at its current level.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) on securing this Adjournment debate. It has proved extremely timely and I have to say that I agree with her. One of the arguments that she has put forward against this plan applies equally to many areas in Northumberland. I represent a rural area, which will suffer from virtually no development over the period of the plan. Indeed, Tynedale council has an allocation of fewer than 200 houses over the next five or six years&#151;totally inadequate.</p>

I am not talking about affordable homes, which is a somewhat separate matter I am referring to ordinary families who want to own their own houses, but who are increasingly priced out of the area because my constituency now has million-pound houses: the era of million-pound houses has arrived. People cannot afford to live there, so families are moving from rural Northumberland areas into the Durham area, where they can sometimes buy houses cheaper, particularly around Consett. That can break up families and the loyal connection that many people have developed with their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07061427001860">If that trend continues, the very people on whom rural communities depend to provide services in future years will not be there. We can see the problem in places such as Gloucestershire and we do not want to repeat the same mistake, having to bring in people from the cities to run shops, entertainment centres, pubs, hotels and other services in country areas. We want to maintain a healthy, balanced community and the regional spatial strategy simply does not meet those requirements.</p>

We were told that the Department for Transport had a plan on how to improve that highly congested bit of road, but the regional spatial strategy has now changed the terms of that plan by stating that the Department is only &#147;investigating&#148; the prospect.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) on securing this timely debate. The regional spatial strategy has more to do with the era of Soviet-style planning than a modern dynamic economy such as the north-east&#146;s. It will put a stranglehold around County Durham, which will affect not only jobs and industry, as my hon. Friend has articulated, but, more importantly, as the hon.

The proposals would also not allow councils and other agencies to redevelop some of the former mining villages in my constituency. When I was elected to this place in 2001, one of the first things that I did was to ask Northumbria university to carry out a study of the dire need for housing and redevelopment in those villages. Chester-le-Street district council has taken on board some of the findings of that report, and it is using some of the development sites to cross-subsidise other developments involving social housing and other projects in the villages. That redevelopment plan will be extended to other villages across County Durham, but unless we add to it the housing element that can be put to private development, the schemes will not stack up financially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07061427001870">A survey has just revealed that median house prices in my constituency are six to seven times average earnings. People who were brought up there and who work there cannot afford to live there. If the strategy is continued, and areas such as Berwick and Alnwick are allowed to build only 60 or 70 houses a year, the price of the existing housing stock will soar even further, and the impossibility of people buying a house locally will extend to more and more people in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07061427001871">In the meantime, the builders will not go down to Tyneside and build 100 houses because they have been denied the opportunity to build 10 somewhere near Berwick. They will either give up that side of their work completely or move over to Berwickshire, in Scotland, where these restrictions do not apply, and build houses there. This process is not going to assist the regeneration of the central urban areas in the region. Social housing simply will not be built, partly because it is increasingly dependent on deals involving private sector building, as the hon. Member for North Durham pointed out. In many rural areas, it also involves the conversion of, and sensitive development around, existing buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07061427001872">Relaxation of the housing limit would not harm anyone. The builders would not go mad and build vast numbers of houses that nobody wanted to buy. They understand the market, and they know that they have to sell the properties that they develop. There is no reason to suppose that a vast explosion of house building would occur if the restrictions were taken away completely from the rural areas that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="07061427001873"><a name="70614-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="07061427003471"><b>Mr. Kevan Jones:</b>
 Is not the real point of the local plan that local people have an input in dividing up their local unitary development plan? That would lead not to a free-for-all but to sensitive development, and at least local people and councils would have a say over it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="07061427001874"><a name="70614-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="07061427003472"><b>Mr. Beith:</b>
 Existing planning laws, regulations and practices are a sufficient protection for all the things that we care about. They ensure that we have a village envelope, that there is not continuous building from one place to another, and that building is subject to some restraint. Central Government must say to the north-east, &#147;You don&#146;t need to impose this kind of restriction on housing.&#148; That restriction arises from central Government pressure to impose such restraint. I ask the Minister to lift that restraint and to tell the regional assembly to forget about putting housing limits on areas such as the one that I represent or other parts of rural Northumberland or County Durham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07061427001875">Transport is another issue, which the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) mentioned. A lot of our problems in relation to the A1 date from the extraordinary practice of referring matters to the interim regional transport board, which then overlays whatever is in the spatial strategy. The Minister of State, Department for Transport, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) now blames that for the failure to dual the A1. It has become a useful buck-passing exercise, but the way in which the matter has been handled makes a nonsense even of the aspirations in the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07061427001876">One other element of the regional spatial strategy that is causing anxiety to many of my constituents is the vast number of wind farm applications. The reason that we are getting so many in the beautiful area that lies between the area of outstanding natural beauty and the Northumberland national park is that it is an area of least constraint in relation to wind farm applications. That is not simply a bit of gentle guidance to planning authorities to consider each case on its merits, but is having the effect of funnelling lots of applications into the area. Local planning authorities do not have the capacity to cope with those applications&#151;they do not have the staff to deal with them, still less the large developers that they face. One of the effects of the strategy has therefore been to place an unreasonable burden on giving proper consideration to wind farm planning applications in a beautiful area where each case must be considered extremely carefully. The risk of harm to the landscape, the environment and tourism must be placed against the objective to expand our renewable energy generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70614-0018.htm_para30"><a name="07061427001877">The regional spatial strategy is not popular in my constituency. It imposes a wholly unnecessary and extremely damaging restriction on the provision of desperately needed housing, and its effects in relation to transport and the handling of wind farm applications are not benign either.</p>

Then there were revisions. The Government then had about eight or nine months to comment on the  <br>

revisions. We are now in a period of consultation on the Government&#146;s response. Changes will then be made. Finally, another eight-week period of consultation will take place. I apologise to the House if I have missed out a stage in the process, because it is labyrinthine in the extreme. I am not sure how the public or their elected representatives are supposed to engage in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07061427001880">After all the drafts, counter-drafts, evidence and deliberation, the document has ended up being extremely damaging to my constituency and my constituents in a number of ways. First, on housing, which other Members have mentioned, the figures in the document would allow a couple of hundred houses each year to be built in Durham from now until 2021. We have independent planning inspectors&#146; reports showing that, because of the backlog in the provision of affordable housing in Durham, about 500 units a year are needed just to catch up.</p>

 The allowances would not enable us to deal with the backlog. The underlying message is that the Government do not consider County Durham to be worthy of growth, but it is an environment where there should be growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07061427001884">The second issue that I want to raise is that of the Tursdale rail freight depot. After many years, we have a developer who has experience across the country of providing rail freight depots and who wants to develop one at Tursdale. That has been taken out of the regional spatial strategy as a potential opportunity apparently because it will get in the way of the development of the ports of Tyne and Tees. However, extensive arguments have been made to suggest that they are complementary developments. There is not necessarily any competition between the two, but the Government have not taken that on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07061427001885">The third issue that I want to raise is that of NETPark. It is not in my constituency but it provides the space for the spin-out companies from Durham university, which is in my constituency. We know from the regional economic strategy and its action plan that the Government and One NorthEast want to develop a knowledge base as the basis for future economic development in the region. Durham university and its spin-out companies will be critical to that. Yet the development of NETPark will be capped. Not only does that not make any sense, but there seems to be no alignment of the regional spatial strategy and the regional economic strategy. That also sends out a very damaging message. We are trying to raise aspirations in County Durham and get our young people jobs in the knowledge sector, yet they are being denied that by the document. That is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07061427001886">My last point relates to sustainability. It is important that we mean what we say in our rhetoric and develop sustainable communities. That means having employment bases that are close to our communities and not dragging everybody in County Durham either north to the Tyneside area or south to Teesside to get employment. The transport network for that does not exist and there is nothing in the document to develop it. Crucially, we  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07061427001889">The Government of course share the ambition for the north-east region and have a proud record in investment and in improving its economic prosperity. The test, however, is for us not only to improve gross value added in the north-east, but to narrow the gap between the north-east and the rest of the country. We could achieve that goal by reducing the GVA for the rest of the country, but having discussed the possibility, we decided that it was not appropriate. The setting of that test presents us with a real challenge. I know my hon.

I hope that Members will understand, however, that I cannot answer specific points about the regional spatial strategy. Suffice it to say that at this stage the Government have not accepted the recommendations on large sites or affordable housing. As for the number of houses, the Government are seeking feedback through consultation. I think it is clear what the feedback from Members will be.</p>

 I understand the Minister&#146;s difficulty, but perhaps he can clarify one point.

 Broadly, the answer to that question is yes, that is the purpose. However, I would not, of course, want to give a specific commitment on numbers or the outline. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will be reassured by what I have to say on the process.</p>

Its purpose is to set out a broad development strategy for the region for the period up to 2021. I acknowledge that the process that is being gone through is often described as laborious, but the RSS is an important document. It is part of the statutory development plan under the 2004 Act. Local planning authorities prepare the other components of the development plan, the local development frameworks, which must be in general conformity with the RSS. Therefore, this affects not only regional policy, but the LDFs of local authorities. The regional transport strategy is also incorporated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07061427001902">First, the panel said that it was not persuaded that the transport proposals set out in the submission draft reflected the proper balance, or that the priorities for investment set out could be justified, and it recommended that the Government review them. In light of that, we have prepared a revised version of that material in the section of the RSS that deals with transport. That new material was based on the outcome of the regional funding allocations exercises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07061427001903">Secondly, the panel recommended that further consideration should be given to the district housing allocations for Easington, Sedgefield and Blyth valley, with a view to ensuring that they were consistent with the locational strategy and the panel&#146;s conclusions and recommendations on the de-allocation and urban capacity study assessments. In view of the importance of the issue, we asked the panel for further clarification on this view, and it suggests in its addendum report that the assembly should be asked to review its forecasts in the light of that analysis.</p>

 How does what the Minister has described is proposed on housing in County Durham fit with what the Government are trying to do nationally, and with County Durham funding from English Partnerships for village regeneration and the possibility of new housing for villages in County Durham? How does all that fit together if we still have an artificial figure, as national Government are paying for something with taxpayers&#146; money at one level and at the local level things are prevented from happening?</p>

That may be achieved in other ways, and my hon. Friend makes his views known with characteristic clarity, but some consideration at that level is important.</p>

Consultees have therefore been invited to supply information on matters relevant to aspects that the panel have recommended be changed. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland welcomes that acknowledgement. We anticipate that many stakeholders will wish to comment on the proposed changes, and they have been widely circulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70614-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07061427001907">As we announced in both Houses on 24 May, we have decided that in the light of the requests for supplementary material we should carry out a two-stage consultation. In the first and current stage, we are consulting on the proposed changes now being put forward. That stage will last for 10 weeks. Following that, Ministers will consider the material that they receive, and will then hold a further consultation, to last eight weeks, to give all concerned an opportunity to consider any further changes that may have been made as a result. Following the consultation, the Secretary of State, having considered the representations, will then approve and publish the final version.</p>
