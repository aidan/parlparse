<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60207-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Trade  (Ian Pearson): </b> 
 The Government are working closely with our European and international partners to promote political reform in Burma. We have consistently made it clear to the regime that it must release Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners as a first step to restoring democracy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60207-01_spnew0"><b> Julie Morgan: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his reply. In view of the continuing human rights violations, the drug trafficking, the outflow of refugees and the continuing house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, what can he do to work towards a binding resolution by the United Nations Security Council to ensure democracy in Burma? Members of the National League for Democracy are being imprisoned and harassed. Is there not something more that he could do to get a resolution at the Security Council?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60207-01_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point to the human rights abuses that are going on daily in Burma. She will be aware that the UN Security Council met on 16 December and that Burma was discussed at that meeting. At present, there is no consensus within the Security Council even to put Burma on the agenda, let alone to secure a resolution, but I assure her of the Government&#039;s commitment to do all that they can to press for further progress. I am pleased to be able to note the progress that has been made through some of our lobbying efforts with the Association of South East Asian Nations. She will be aware perhaps that, just before Christmas, ASEAN put out a statement. The fact that ASEAN is showing concern about the political situation in Burma and is perhaps prepared to do something about it is welcome.

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60207-01_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met the Thai Deputy Prime Minister last week. We certainly acknowledge the work of the Thai Government in making a welcome home for those fleeing from persecution in Burma. The Foreign Office has a project working with the Thai authorities to assist in that process. It is a difficult issue. More and more people are fleeing the country because of the despicable nature of the regime, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will take what appropriate action we can to help the situation.

 (Lab): I have every reason to believe that ASEAN&#039;s move was largely due to pressure from the British Government. I compliment my hon. Friend on that. May I ask him about the EU common position on Burma, which I am sure he agrees is one of low impact&#151;arguably, of no impact? The sanctions against the regime are patchy, weak and of no practical consequence and very little symbolic consequence. We hoped that change would come during the EU presidency, but now the common position is due to be renegotiated. Will he do his level best to ensure that the EU adopts real, significant, biting sanctions against that abysmal regime?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60207-01_spnew5"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for her words of welcome about the UK&#039;s lobbying efforts. Not just the UK but many other countries have been talking to ASEAN about the need to do more on Burma.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The EU common position is due for renewal in April this year. We believe that there have been no improvements in the situation in Burma over the past 12 months and therefore there is no case for weakening the sanctions, but let us be clear. Our policy of sanctions is deliberately targeted on the Burma regime and its cronies. We do not believe that economic sanctions that would harm the Burmese people are appropriate. They are already suffering enough as a result of that despicable regime and sanctions that affected their livelihoods would be inappropriate.

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60207-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 We remain very concerned about Iran&#039;s approach to terrorism and the nature of its relationship with Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. We also continue to investigate Iran&#039;s links to extremist groups in Iraq. We have repeatedly pressed Iran to renounce all support for groups using terror and violence. I raise these concerns whenever I have the opportunity to do so, most recently in my meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister in London last week.

That resolution attracted wide support, including from Russia, China, India, Egypt, Brazil, Sri Lanka and Yemen, which I hope will underline to the Iranian leadership the strength of feeling internationally on this matter and encourage them to take the opportunities offered by the resolution.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60207-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I have seen no evidence of Iranian support for insurgent groups in that province. As is often the case, Iran&#039;s record can vary very much, in apparently contradictory ways. Overall, Iran has worked responsibly in respect of its relations with Afghanistan. Iran has good reason for doing so and suffers grievously from the trade in opium; it has been suggested that there are more than 2 million heroin addicts in Iran, fuelled by drugs from Afghanistan. For the time being, on the issue of drugs and in its relationships with Afghanistan, Iran&#039;s interests are the same as ours. However, in respect of other terrorist groups to the west of the country, the picture is a different one.

 (Lab): Will the Foreign Secretary take this opportunity to reaffirm the United Kingdom&#039;s support for the Iranian resistance people in Camp Ashraf in Iraq, bearing in mind that they have protected person status under the Geneva conventions? Will he confirm that he will resist any attempt by the Iranian Government to make the coalition or the United Kingdom falter upon that commitment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60207-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friend but the answer is an emphatic no. The MEK/MKO organisation is a terrorist organisation that is proscribed in this country following a decision that I made as Home Secretary in 2000, which was endorsed by Parliament. We have a consistent position on terrorist organisations. As I repeatedly make clear to my Iranian counterparts, it is they who have a contradictory position. They ask us to take a firm position in respect of terrorist groups that threaten Iran, and we do; at the same time, Iran is supporting terrorist organisations that threaten Israel. That is unacceptable.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60207-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I would need notice of that question. However, like any other organisation similarly proscribed, the MEK/MKO has had every opportunity to make strong representations to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission. As it was subsequent to my leaving the Home Office, I cannot remember whether it has done so. If it has, its objections have been overruled. The decision was made by this House on the basis of my recommendation, endorsed by my successors.

 (Lab): Iran supports terrorism, wants to see the extermination of every Jew from the face of the earth in its region and soon will possess a nuclear bomb. My right hon. Friend has tried with might and main to find a diplomatic solution, but we are on a glide path to a serious confrontation. In that regard, 35 years ago the main enemy of the United States&#151;it had an ideology that America opposed and supported action that America opposed&#151;was China but, in a great diplomatic coup, President Nixon went to China, recognised China and world history was turned. Does my right hon. Friend think that the time has come for the United States to offer diplomatic recognition to Iran&#151;a personal opinion, please?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60207-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60207-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Straw: </b>

 (LD): In considering what a long-term solution might be to the relationship between the outside world and Iran, does the Foreign Secretary believe that there is a case for some form of security assurance for Iran? Of course, such an assurance was one component in the draft agreement between the United States and North Korea in September 2005. If he does believe that, can he confirm what reflections the EU3 have made on what such a security assurance might look like, and what discussions he has had with his opposite numbers in Washington on that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60207-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 On the first question, yes, I do, and what is frustrating, to say the least, is that security assurances&#151;I point out to my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) that they could have led, over time, to a normalisation of relations with the whole of the international community, including the United States&#151;and all other such issues were on the agenda following the decisions and agreements that we reached in Geneva at the end of last May. They were included in the detailed document that we submitted to the Iranians, on time, in early August, but, infuriatingly, the Iranian Government decided on 2 August to reject whatever we said before they even saw it. That is the cause of the current difficulties.

<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60207-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. William Hague  (Richmond, Yorks)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Foreign Secretary accept the Opposition&#039;s strong support for the work that has been done to achieve a united position among the permanent members of the UN Security Council, including China and Russia, on reporting Iran to the Security Council? In the event that Iran does decide to reconsider Russia&#039;s nuclear proposal in the coming weeks, is the Foreign Secretary confident that that scheme, which the British Government have endorsed, will be robust enough to prevent Iran from pursuing a covert nuclear weapons programme while appearing to co-operate with Russia?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60207-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 First, I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his endorsement of our work; the fact that there is broad all-party consensus on this issue helps our hand 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 725</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when we negotiate within the EU3 and with international colleagues. Our being able to get agreement last Monday from Russia and China on the next and most difficult step&#151;a report to the Security Council&#151;has been very important. As I said earlier, I hope that that gives the Iranian leadership pause for thought.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">The Russians have made it clear that their proposal, by which they would enrich uranium, is not an addition to uranium being enriched at the Natanz operation in Iran but an alternative to it. If that happens, and the IAEA is able to continue with the kind of inspection regime that the additional protocol provides for, I believe that we could be pretty certain that Iran was not doing anything of a covert nature. But in the absence of those two conditions, it is very difficult to accept such a move.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60207-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hague: </b> 
 If Iran does not pursue the Russian offer, how does the Foreign Secretary see the situation developing in Security Council discussions over the next few months? Will it be possible, for instance, to propose an end to all exports of military technology and hardware from other countries to Iran, and to achieve such a position in the coming months? If it will not, what genuine hope is there of applying real and concerted pressure on the Iranian Government in the future?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60207-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 First, we hope that the Iranian leadership&#151;notwithstanding their rhetoric, which has been extreme&#151;will think carefully in the next three to four weeks about where they are taking their country, because if they take this path they are heading toward international isolation, which is not the direction in which they ought to be travelling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">Secondly, if we end up with a report to the Security Council and its considering the matter, the first stage will be a Security Council resolution exerting its authority in support of IAEA processes. There are people who say, &quot;If you do that and nothing else, you won&#039;t be able to achieve anything.&quot; I do not agree with that. We can see from the experience with Syria in the past 18 months that although international pressure and the authority of the Security Council&#151;without sanctions&#151;has not achieved everything, it has achieved a great deal. But if those steps fail, extensive discussions will have to take place with our partners on whether article 41 measures would be appropriate. The right hon. Gentleman will excuse me if I do not anticipate those, but I make the obvious point that what we can agree in the Security Council will depend above all on the consensus that we can secure among the permanent five members.

I can confirm that a meeting took place with Mr. Caleb McCarry, as the US-Cuba transition co-ordinator. That meeting took place on 7 November 2005, when the individual was on his way to a conference in Brussels where he met many European partners. It is entirely normal for Foreign Office officials to meet equivalent officials in the US State Department to discuss matters of mutual interest. On my hon.

That is why we support Afghanistan&#039;s national drug control strategy and why we must work with the Afghan Government to combat the narcotics trade at every level.

 I very much agree with the hon.

However, the approach must be multifaceted. We should not just be trying to address the demand; we must also take down the drugs mafia in Afghanistan, which supplies not only the UK but millions of heroin addicts in Pakistan and Iran. The industry is very market-responsive and we have to recognise that fact and try to help the Afghans to overcome it in whatever way we can.

He will also be aware that, horrific though the Taliban regime was, opium production was almost eliminated under the Taliban. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, they had gone some way towards that. Does he accept that our policies in Afghanistan will not be deemed a success unless we are successful in interrupting and suppressing the production of opium?

<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60207-02_spnew17"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 I certainly agree with the last part of my hon. Friend&#039;s question. I have looked very hard on my visits to Afghanistan at the story of how the Taliban stopped heroin production. What I discovered when I was out there is that they were very astute business men. They realised that the price of raw opium was pretty low. They held stocks back for a couple of years; the price shot up, and they released them. I would not look to the Taliban for any kind of moral guidance on what we ought to do about this.

 (Con): We are receiving breaking news that there has been a serious riot in the town of Maymana in Afghanistan, where 300 demonstrators are rioting and one demonstrator has been shot. Of course, British troops have been called in to support Norwegian and Finnish troops. Into that very difficult situation, we are about to deploy 5,000 more British troops to deal with the opium problem, whereby local people and local farmers are exploited by warlords and others, aided by insurgents coming across an increasingly porous and difficult border from Pakistan and Iran. Precisely how do the British Government think that our troops will deal with the opium problem and how long does the Minister think that they are likely to be deployed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60207-02_spnew19"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The deployment is, of course, phase 3 of the international security assistance force deployment in Afghanistan. As the hon. Gentleman will know, UK troops will be deployed to Helmand in support of the UN-authorised, NATO-led mission&#151;the ISAF&#151;and as part of the international coalition. They will help to create an environment in which economic development and institutional reform, both essential to the elimination of the opium industry, can take place. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that this is a question not simply of trying to disrupt those who are producing and moving drugs around, but of building capacity in Afghanistan, so that the reach of the democratically elected Government into a province such as Helmand becomes a reality. We must approach this subject in many ways&#151;including economic development, of course&#151;and that is what our troops will do. They will help to underpin all those efforts, which are many and various.

<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60207-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in Oxford last Thursday, the key issue now is for the European Union to face practical challenges, such as economic reform and energy security. As he acknowledged on Thursday, the effectiveness of a European Union of 25 is constrained by the current rules, but we judge that now is not the time to make institutional debates the focus of the EU&#039;s work.

 I thank the Minister for that answer.

 There is little that I can usefully add to the comments of my right hon.

 The issue of transparency was one with which we dealt during our presidency, as was subsidiarity. We held a major conference along with the Dutch Government on sharing power in Europe.

In that context, do not the Government have to look at existing treaties, which have been the cause of low growth, high unemployment, the failure of the stability and growth pact, regionalisation and a whole range of policies that are deeply unpopular in the United Kingdom? Will he make arrangements to review those treaties properly?

 Mr. Duff has been working as a member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and has brought forward proposals based on his own thinking.

Given the Prime Minister&#039;s change of heart, will the Minister put a stop to the implementation of the European constitution by other means? As the European Scrutiny Committee finds almost weekly, that option is being pushed by the Commission and augmented by member states, including the British Government.

 With unalloyed joy, as usual, I look forward to my appearance before the Committee later this week. On the right hon.

 I recently spoke about exactly that issue to a European colleague, who warned me that one country&#039;s cherry is another country&#039;s lemon. That point is well made in the sense that an aspect of the constitutional treaty that is judged to be perfectly sensible and prosaic in the United Kingdom&#151;the question of transparency, or greater subsidiarity&#151;can be highly contentious in the eyes of the other 24 member states.

<br>&nbsp;<br>is it not now essential that the Government state simply and unambiguously that the EU constitution is dead? Although the Minister says that it is not for one country to say that it is dead and to end it, if he said that Britain would veto it if it came back, the whole thing would be finished and we could concentrate on the real priorities.
</p>

 I can assure the House that we are concentrating on the real priorities. The priorities set out by the hon.

We used the period of reflection to say that we needed a broader debate about how Europe could engage with some of the challenges that we face in the 21st century, whether climate change, energy security or indeed energy supply diversity. That is why, since Hampton Court, work has been taken forward both by High Representative Javier Solana and by the European Commission.

 My hon. Friend is accurate in his reflections on the comments of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary at the last Question Time, when he stated that the constitutional treaty was somewhere between heaven and hell and that it was difficult to argue that it is not dead. He also stated, however, that the document was &quot;in limbo&quot;. I will not go into the broader theological discussions as to whether limbo has altered as a result of the latest papal encyclical.

 (DUP): I am sure that the Minister would like to know that people will be greatly alarmed that Europe is in a period of reflection. I assure him that all the reflection in the world is not going to raise the dead; regardless of a certain religious leader who believed in a certain place which has now been abolished, quite evidently the constitution is not going to purgatory, and if it is not in heaven and it is not in hell, it is dead. It would be better for the Minister now to reflect on the price of the funeral and then get a new constitution.

 In Cyprus, I met Foreign Minister Iacovou and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Talat. I urged the two communities to resume their dialogue, for the longer that settlement negotiations are delayed, the harder a settlement will be to achieve. We also have to ensure that Turkey&#039;s EU accession track and the United Nations settlement process are not competing, but are complementary. During my meeting I stressed to all parties, including Turkey and Greece, which I also visited, that the status quo is bad for Cyprus, bad for the region and bad for the EU.

<a name="stpa_o8">We have noted all the responses to Foreign Minister Gul&#039;s proposals of 24 January, including the positive reactions of EU Comissioner Olli Rehn and the Governments of Italy and Spain. Those proposals are a constructive step and deserve to be taken seriously.

 I am grateful to the Foreign Secretary for that reply, but does he think, on balance, that his visit has contributed to an improvement in relations with the Republic of Cyprus and with the Greek Cypriot community here in the UK, or does he agree with President Papadopoulos that his visit has poisoned relations between Nicosia and London?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60207-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I do not accept the latter. It is a matter of great regret and entirely counter-productive that President Papadopoulos decided to object to my visiting Mr. Talat in his offices&#151;the same premises, I may say, where one of my predecessors, the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), visited Mr. Denktash in 1996. It would have been preposterous if I had treated Mr. Talat less well than the right hon. and learned Gentleman treated Mr. Denktash.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="60207-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am very grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his remarks. I hope that it will send a message to the Government of Cyprus that this is not a partisan issue dividing the House but one on which there is a substantial all-party consensus in favour of the two communities&#151;the Greek Cypriots in the south and the Turkish Cypriots in the north&#151;coming together. I take it from what he has said that he, and I believe the House too, also regard it a matter of regret that the Administration of President Papadopoulos have sought to distance themselves from the Turkish Cypriot community and to cease to have any contact with it. Moreover, because of their unhelpful approach towards

<br>&nbsp;<br>the aid proposals for the north from the European Union, they are in my judgment seeking to marginalise the Turkish Cypriot community and not in any way to assist in their economic development.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="60207-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises another reason why the only salvation for Cyprus is through negotiations leading to a sensible settlement, brokered by the United Nations, and by an end to the division of the island. That is the only way in which the genuine interests of the Greek Cypriot community, including those of Greek Cypriot origin who are British citizens, can be resolved satisfactorily. The issue of compensation for land seized is central to those negotiations. Unless and until the Greek Cypriot Government, as well as the Turkish Cypriots and others with interest, get back to the negotiating table, there is in practice absolutely no chance of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent receiving what is due to him. I wish it were otherwise, but the Mr. Iacovou, the Foreign Minister of Cyprus whom I saw, could offer me no alternative prospect for his own people and for solving their problems. That is why I regret very much the negative approach that that Government are taking.

 (Con): I am glad, as are many of us, that the Foreign Secretary went to see President Talat, who has proved to be a good and constructive leader of the Turkish Cypriots and who tried very hard to reach an agreement on the Annan proposals. That is in contrast to President Papadopoulos, who many of us believe negotiated in bad faith throughout that period and had no intention ever of endorsing Annan IV, V, VI or any other number. It seems that his strategy was to get into the European Union and then put the squeeze on the Turkish Cypriots by squeezing Turkey. The tragedy is that we allowed that to happen. Does the Foreign Secretary think in retrospect that we should never have allowed the Republic of Cyprus into the EU without settling that problem first?

<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="60207-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 Although it was a decision that we made, there was, I think, an all-party agreement on it and it was not an issue of great controversy between the parties in the late 1990s. The problem then was that the Greek Cypriot community had reasonable leadership who wished desperately for a deal both on EU membership and a settlement with the Turkish Cypriot community, but the Turkish Cypriots under Mr. Denktash were almost impossible to negotiate with. Had EU membership been proposed under the current circumstances, neither any British Government nor most European Governments would have touched the idea of allowing a divided Cyprus into the EU.

<a name="stpa_o9">What I said to those whom I met from the Government of Cyprus was that if they go down that road, they will get exactly what they do not want, because they will make it impossible for Turkey to enter into full negotiations for membership of the European Union and then, over time, there will be a status quo in Cyprus which some countries may start to recognise in practice. That is not the position of the United Kingdom Government. We do not recognise the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and we want to see a unified Cyprus, but the current approach of the Government of Cyprus does not in any way represent movement towards a united Cyprus and objectively is likely to lead to the opposite result.

 As the House is well aware, the Palestinian elections produced a majority in their Parliament for Hamas. We have made it clear that we respect the outcome of any free and fair elections, but we have been equally clear that those who take part in the democratic process have a responsibility to reject violence. The result therefore presents Hamas with a very clear choice. Last Monday the Quartet agreed that all members of a future Palestinian Government must be committed to non-violence, to a recognition of Israel and to an acceptance of previous agreements, including the road map. We, along with our EU partners, will continue to work with the Palestinians, the Israelis and the international community to make progress on the road map, to which both the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Israeli Government remain committed.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="60207-04_spnew11"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The European Union and the United Kingdom put in place strong accounting measures to ensure that money going to the Palestinian Authority, which was at that stage Fatah-controlled, was not going to fund terrorism. I know that the EU as well as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development are satisfied with those controls. For quite separate reasons, direct budgetary aid from the British Government and, I think, from the EU was suspended to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority because we were not satisfied with the way in which some of the money was being accounted for, nor with their budgetary discipline. That aid apart, aid is being paid to people in the Palestinian Authority area. It is important that that should continue for humanitarian reasons, but again, the Quartet, with our full support, made it clear that any future assistance to any new Government would be reviewed by donors against the Government&#039;s commitment to the principles of non-violence and the other conditions that I mentioned.

 I view those articles extremely seriously. They are completely objectionable and obnoxious. What we look for from the Hamas leadership, if it wants the beginnings of a proper relationship with the rest of the international community, is an indication that it is willing to start travelling away from positions that it has previously adopted.

In the debate that is now going on within Fatah, many of its members are saying that it was Fatah that lost the election rather than Hamas that won it, because of its history of being in existence for so many decades and because of allegations of inefficiency and corruption, and worse. I suspect that those in Fatah who are saying that are more likely to be correct in their analysis.

 (Con): The Foreign Secretary has been very robust in saying that through the Quartet we will not be seen to be directly negotiating with or rewarding Hamas until it gives up on terrorism and on its attitude towards the destruction of the state of Israel. Can he tell the House whether he has any evidence that any members of Hamas are involved in terrorist activities directly or indirectly affecting British interests in the middle east?

 As I said, we have no intention of punishing the Palestinians for &quot;voting the wrong way&quot;. That is not the appropriate response.

Friend would not approve of a position whereby, if a Hamas-based Government were formed and we paid aid, we could not be certain whether some of it was going towards terrorist causes. I do not believe that my right hon. Friend would be happy with that outcome. The Quartet&#039;s cautious approach, which we share, of continuing to pay money at the moment because the Administration remains dominated by President Mahmoud Abbas, but subsequently expecting some change by Hamas, is the appropriate way forward.

<a name="stpa_1">In his Budget statement last year, the Chancellor made the welcome announcement that all Departments would be mandated to spend 2.5 per cent. of their external research budgets with small and medium-sized companies. That is important because it enables high-tech, science-based start-up companies, which venture capitalists often perceive as too risky, to trial their new ideas in the security of a 100 per cent. funded Government contract. It is good for manufacturing because many of those companies become the manufacturing success stories of the future. As a member of Amicus, I welcome that. It is good for the taxpayer because it will help us to use the latest technologies in this country&#039;s universities and business parks to find smarter new methods of solving public policy problems. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I welcome that, too. Indeed, I hope that high-tech incubator units, such as the digital technology centre in my constituency, may benefit from the measure.

<a name="stpa_2">The Chancellor&#039;s announcement represented a victory for a group of business people, scientists, venture capitalists and academics, who were admirably led in the House by Anne Campbell, the then Member for Cambridge, and outside by the venture capitalist David Connell. I congratulate them both on their achievements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Bill would enshrine the Chancellor&#039;s commitment in law. It would make it not only mandatory for Departments to spend at least 2.5 per cent. of their external research budgets on smaller companies, but illegal for them not to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">It is my firm belief that, without a change in the law, the commitment given by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is unlikely to be translated into reality.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and details of how the new scheme will work are still sketchy. In America, by way of contrast, a policy similar to the one that I propose was enshrined in legislation in 1982, and enhanced a decade later. The results have been astounding. Despite the target of 2.5 per cent., 13 per cent. of all federal Government research and development contracts&#151;worth over $5 billion&#151;now end up with small businesses. The average award is far greater than anything routinely on offer in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The system in America is carefully designed to help small companies take the first step on the Government procurement ladder. They are encouraged to retain and, indeed, exploit their intellectual property, which means that they often go on to create larger companies. For example, large US firms, such as the biotech companies Amgen and Genzyme and the communications giant Qualcomm, employ 30,000 American people between them, but they began as recipients of small business innovation research awards from the American Government. In 1999, the US Congress concluded that the renewal of the programme would

<a name="stpa_9">My Bill aims to replicate the American experience in this country. Specifically, it will set up a process through which, by law, Government Departments will, at twice-yearly intervals and over the web, define their requirements for innovative new technologies. Small businesses would then be invited to bid for innovation contracts of up to &#163;500,000 in value to develop and trial technologies capable of meeting those requirements. Unlike elsewhere in Government, the procurement process would be streamlined, standardised and rapid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Without such measures, we are already losing talent and ideas, and therefore jobs and wealth. For example, the scientist Dr. Helen Lee developed in Britain a simple new diagnostic test for HIV and hepatitis, but decided to commercialise it in the US, specifically because of the availability of SBIR grants and awards. She took five people from Cambridge with her to America to help with the process. However, Teraview&#151;widely recognised as the world&#039;s leading company in terahertz imaging&#151;decided to stick to the existing system here. It took two years for the company to get a contract out of the UK Government, and that lost it time and money. In addition, all hon. Members have constituency stories of bright new start-up companies that fear that trading with the Government will cause them to lose their intellectual property.

<br>
That this House notes that one in four people will suffer mental health problems; is aware that mental health trusts are facing some of the largest cuts in planned budgets whilst already having to cope with worryingly high recruitment shortages; further notes that patients with mental illness are often denied real choice in their treatments due to long waiting times for referrals and an acute shortage of non-drug therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy; is alarmed at the particular problems experienced by black and minority ethnic patients in accessing services; is concerned at the continued absence of a Mental Health Bill almost four years after the first draft Bill was published; and calls on the Government to raise the relative importance of mental health within the NHS, making early intervention a priority in order to enable access to a range of appropriate services and urgently to publish a revised Mental Health Bill which recognises the rights and dignity of people with mental illness.
<br>



<p><a name="st_4">May I say at the outset that I am sorry to hear that the Secretary of State is indisposed? We send her our best wishes. We are sure that it will be only a temporary indisposition and that she will be back performing her duties very soon. However, we are happy that the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), is here to speak for the Government on this subject, for which she is directly responsible in the Department.</p>





<p><a name="st_5">The purposes of this debate are threefold. First, given that there has been no debate in Government time on the Floor of the House on mental health services since 1997, this debate will permit hon. Members not only to assess the future of those services, but to express their appreciation of the staff who work in them and their understanding of the needs of patients with mental health problems. Secondly, we want to express what I hope will be the view of the whole House, namely, that mental health services must not be the Cinderella services of the NHS that many people have often perceived them to be. The services deserve, and must have, priority, and that priority must be reflected in the delivery of the services. Furthermore, that delivery must not be compromised&#151;and patients must not suffer&#151;as a result of present or prospective NHS deficits. Thirdly, we want a reformed Mental Health Bill that people across the range of mental health interests can support to be brought before the House. Such a Bill was promised in the Gracious Address, but there have been long delays. We want it to contain provisions that will provide dignity and a positive framework for those whom it is intended to serve.</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60207-06_spnew0"><b> Angela Browning  (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that this so-called reformed Mental Health Bill must address the considerations of the Scrutiny Committee&#151;on which I sat&#151;most of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 743</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which were rejected by the Government? Does he also agree that any reformed Bill will need to have been really reformed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60207-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) also served on that Committee, and he and I are convinced that substantial changes to the proposed mental health legislation are required. The need for such changes could well be the reason for the delay in introducing the new Bill, but perhaps the Minister will tell us why the delay has been so great. There are things that we need from that legislation, and when we see the Bill in due course I hope that it will have been reformed in such a way as to command the support of the House. I also hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), with her experience, will contribute to those debates.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60207-06_spnew2"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point) (Con):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend confirm that there would be fewer people suffering from mental health problems in this country if the Government were to reclassify cannabis as a class B drug?
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60207-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I am glad that my hon. Friend made that intervention. I had not intended to deal with that issue, but I think that he is right. Leaving aside the criminal justice issues, we should not underestimate the public health issues associated with drug use, and especially with the prolonged use of cannabis by teenagers. Some of the latest research by the Medical Research Council is pointing towards the existence of a common genetic mutation, occurring in about a quarter of the population, that could give rise to a substantial increase in the likelihood of psychotic episodes and schizophrenia as a result of prolonged cannabis use during the teenage years. That evidence should not be just put to one side&#151;it should inform directly the calculation of potential harm that is supposed to underlie the advice given by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Sir Michael Rawlings, who leads that council and is chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, ought to be rigorous in his examination of the medical evidence underlying those issues. If that has not been true up to now, I hope that it will be in future.

How will he deal with that issue?

 I will not get into a debate about criminal justice issues. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I will make my point about the health issue, which I have put on the record. Many Members want to speak and I do not want to take up too much of the limited time available.

<p>
<a name="60207-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_15">Let us be clear that combating and overcoming the stigma attached to mental illness is at the heart of what we must do in relation to mental health services. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I visited the Brent Mind housing project this morning, where we talked to some of the tenants, most of whom have a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and substance misuse of some kind. In relation to the impact of stigma, our discussion was very interesting. For example, they said that there is still a sense in which the public push the problem not just to the margins, but out of sight and out of mind. There seems to be an assumption that someone who has been mentally ill will not recover, and that the condition is permanent. That is not true. People do recover, medication is capable of assisting dramatically nowadays, and talking and other therapies can be very successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_16">At any one time, 630,000 people might be receiving mental health treatment in this country, but that is only a fraction of the number who will at some time in their lives have mental illness&#151;probably one in four of the population will have mental illness at some time. For many, it is a very traumatic but temporary condition. Therefore, we should not treat people who have mental illness and recover any differently from those who have had a broken leg. People recover and move on. Even if people are on medication, perhaps on a more or less permanent basis, we should not treat them differently. We do not say to diabetics that because they take insulin their ability to work is necessarily compromised. We support such people, encourage them, help them into work and expect them to be integrated into society. The same should be true of people with mental health problems. Illnesses, whether physical, psychological or mental, should be treated in the same way.

 My hon. Friend has talked about people recovering from mental illness. Does he agree that what he has said applies particularly to people in prison? Is he aware that 90 per cent. of prisoners have mental health needs, but are treated first and foremost as prisoners, which means that those needs are often neglected? If they are to leave prison, play a valuable role in society and be rehabilitated, should not their mental health needs come first?

If primary care trusts are to take over responsibility for that&#151;and most have already done so&#151;it does not bode well if they are trying to cut mental health services at the same time, as too many are.

 Not at this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_18">We need to be clear about the current state of mental health services. The Government&#039;s amendment understandably emphasises the publication of the national service framework in 1999. As I have said, while it is to be applauded as a statement of priority, we need to ask what it does in terms of delivery. Let us examine some of the national standards contained in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_19">First, there is the intention that there should be health promotion and that discrimination should be combated. Spending on promotion of mental health specifically has fallen to &#163;2 million, a tiny fraction of the mental health budget, and is 60 per cent. lower than it was in 2001. As for discrimination, I am afraid that it is still unhappily true that black African and Caribbean patients are 44 per cent. more likely to be detained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_20">The second national standard emphasises access to diagnosis and effective treatment. Access to cognitive behavioural therapies is seriously lacking. In his recent report, Professor Layard said that we needed 5,000 more psychological therapists, and the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health recently spoke of GPs with no access to CBT for their patients and a wait of up to six months for counselling. Responding to a survey by Mind, 47 per cent. of mental health service users said that their treatment was held back considerably by not being given the treatment that they needed. That standard, too, has not yet been met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_21">The third standard relates to round-the-clock contact. Crisis resolution and assertive outreach services are of course useful, and they have perhaps been the principal innovation of the national service framework. However, if core services are plundered so that crisis resolution and assertive outreach services can be fed, the net effect will be that although it may be possible to intervene at night and try to deal with a problem&#151;and I know that many GPs&#039; out-of-hours services value crisis resolution&#151;the system will not work if the patient cannot be dealt with immediately the following morning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_22">The fourth standard recommends a care programme, but 50 per cent. of mental health service users are not offered a care plan. The fifth standard refers to timely access to hospital beds. Just over a fortnight ago, the Mental Health Act Commission said
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;Over half of all wards are full or have more patients than beds.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_23">As an indication of the way in which mental health services are viewed, what could be more compelling than the simple fact that when the Healthcare Commission&#039;s

As Members will know, given the definition of &quot;unacceptably dirty&quot;, that was a pretty condemnatory conclusion for the teams to reach.

<a name="stpa_25">Some of the progress that has been made is directly threatened because of the reductions in funding to meet deficits. It will not surprise hon. Members that I want to talk about Cambridgeshire. It is one of the areas where the cuts in mental health services are most profound. A letter was sent to me just a fortnight ago by psychologists and psychological therapists working for the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. They say of the changes in Cambridgeshire:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;these are not minor trimmings or adjustments to services: they are cuts of essential, frontline services.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_26">We are talking about the closure of in-patient beds. What most distresses me and many people in Cambridge is the closure of Douglas house, which provides a young people&#039;s service, and the cutting of access to services for young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_27">I have raised that matter with the Secretary of State. We have had meetings. I have received correspondence. Everyone in Cambridge knows perfectly well that it all tracks back to the Government&#039;s failure to reflect adequately the genuine mental health needs in Cambridgeshire, and in Cambridge in particular. They should look not at their own demographic analysis, but at the actual demand and need in the community. All the Secretary of State keeps telling us is that it is not her responsibility but that of the local primary care trust. The trust keeps saying, &quot;We just do not have the money to reflect the need that we have.&quot; When we go back to the Secretary of State, she says, &quot;The statisticians have done their work and the work is as good as we can make it.&quot; So everyone is responsible except the Secretary of State&#151;it is the statisticians and the primary care trust that are responsible. Never does she take responsibility for the impact of her changes and cuts.

<br>&nbsp;<br>That    is affecting not just Cambridgeshire but Oxfordshire, which has lost seven consultants, and seven senior house officer and registrar posts. Mental health wards have closed in Westmorland. Supporting people budgets have been reduced in many parts of the country. In south-west London, particularly in the St. George&#039;s Mental Health NHS Trust, there have been widespread reductions and there is a major deficit. Psychiatric beds have closed in West Park hospital in Durham. In Lambeth, there is the potential closure of the Maudsley emergency clinic. There is also the possible closure of a mental health ward at Loughborough or Coalville hospitals. There are other examples.

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is being a little unfair on the Government, who have increased resources in real terms by 25 per cent.

He seems to be drawing together examples from university towns&#151;Cambridge, Oxford, Loughborough and elsewhere. Does he agree that we need to do much more in the FE and HE sectors to promote mental health? Ten per cent. of young people between the ages of 11 and 25 self harm, suicide is the cause of 20 per cent. of the deaths of young people and the age group that commits suicide the most is young men aged between 15 and 24.

<a name="stpa_31">We must look for a positive change in the future, in terms of priority and of the mental health legislation, which I hope we will have an opportunity to debate in substance when the new Bill is published. However, it must be a Bill that has neither a broad-ranging definition of mental disorder nor a broad-ranging definition of medical treatment, while giving an opportunity for community treatment orders to be imposed on a widespread basis. There are many people&#151;particularly from the black and minority ethnic communities&#151;who know that they are far more likely to be the subject of detention and who fear that the extension of such orders in the Bill will lead to widespread assumptions that they can have community treatment orders imposed upon them.

We need the Bill to be published in a way that is geared to the positive treatment of patients, encourages compliance with treatment and supports clinicians in what they have to do, rather than taking the Home Office approach of coercion. Mental health services need greater priority and I want the Minister to tell the House that the increase in mental health resources will match the increase in NHS resources as a whole. We need to bring mental health more into the mainstream, so that GPs have greater access to mental health budgets for their patients and more responsibility for seeing the whole of the mental health patient pathway, rather than their being, as at present, more or less forced to abdicate responsibility and hand it over to mental health trusts.
</p>

<a name="60207-07_para16">
<a name="stpa_34">Patients need more choice. At the moment there is no &quot;choose and book&quot; for mental health patients.

<a name="stpa_35">We must have dignity through the Bill, we must have no discrimination and we must have support for carers. At the moment, many carers who are supposed to have annual appraisals very often do not have an appraisal of their needs. We need them to be supported. We need all of that, and we need more. However, what we need most of all is to understand that the stigma of mental illness is completely misplaced. All of us are at some risk of mental illness at some time in our lives and we would not want that stigma to be applied to us. We would wish those services to be available for us if we needed them, so we should do no less for our constituents.

 My hon. Friend will be aware that I worked as part of a primary care psychiatric team when the Conservatives were in power. They introduced a policy called care in the community, which was in a fact a con in the community, and led to many psychiatric patients wandering around city centres throughout the United Kingdom. Since then, have we not introduced a co-ordinated strategy consisting of investment not just from the health service, but from local government and the voluntary sector?
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60207-08_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend describes very well the direction in which we are travelling, and it is important that we have such support in the community; we need input not just from the health service but from local government and the voluntary sector. I have seen some very good examples of the three working together to make an incredible difference not just to people with mental health problems, but, crucially, to those who support them&#151;their carers, families and friends. Such support in the community is vital.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60207-08_spnew4"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 I am grateful to my namesake for giving way. Will the Minister not express some concern about the over-rapid closure of mental hospital beds, which has caused huge problems not only for the mentally ill who really should be accommodated in hospital, but for their families and the community? Community care has an important role to play, but have not too many hospital beds been closed? Will she consider that issue, and in particular the proposed closure of acute mental hospital beds in east Cheshire by the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Trust?
</p>





<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60207-08_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Perhaps I can combine my answers to the interventions that have just been made. Rapid closure under the previous Administration left people vulnerable in the community, and I hope to demonstrate that this Government have provided support in the community through crisis resolution teams and early intervention teams. The idea is that in-patient care should become very much the last resort. I hope that Members appreciate that removing people with mental health problems from their families and their home environment is not always the best road to recovery; if we can support them in their own homes, that is the way to go. I have visited a number of places where it has proved possible to switch resources from in-patient care to community home care teams, and we should not underestimate the importance of making that shift.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Such reshaping of services can help people to live for longer in the community and to avoid removal to hospital, which is sometimes inappropriate. That approach is ambitious, and that is why we have a 10-year programme. In many instances, it requires services to make switches that they may not be used to, but once the changes have been made, a big improvement has been seen. The plan followed widespread consultation and was warmly welcomed by the professions. I accept that professionals would like to see further changes, but in general the plan has been well received. In 2000 we followed it up with the NHS plan, which set some clear targets for mental health services.

 I accept what the Minister says about the desirability of people being treated in the community if possible. Will she in turn accept that if someone suffers from an acute psychiatric breakdown there is no prospect of their being able to look after themselves in the community, and they will need to be an in-patient? It is important that such an in-patient should not be put in with people with different types of mental illness, who may be psychotic or even violent. What progress have the Government made to ensure that regard is had to the very different types of mental illness, so that people are treated separately where appropriate?

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60207-08_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 It is important to ensure that people who are dangerous or violent are held in more secure units than those suffering, for example, from a clinical breakdown. That is why we have increased the number of medium secure beds, why we have looked at changes for the high-security hospitals and why we have many more low secure beds.

The Mental Health Act Commission report cited by the hon.

 Recently we announced investment of &#163;130 million to improve in-patient facilities&#151;but my hon. Friend is right, in that there has been a long tradition of using the independent sector in mental health care. We need to look closely at the commissioning that PCTs and others undertake in the private sector, to ensure that they carefully consider local needs so that people can remain as close to home as possible. There have been big advances in that commissioning, but we can certainly make improvements and I want to ensure both that we get good value for money, and that care takes place as close to the patient&#039;s home as possible, so that people can obtain the necessary back-up.

<p>
<a name="60207-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_43">The national service framework was accompanied by record investment. According to the European Commission, the UK has one of the highest proportions of its overall health budget devoted to mental health of any EU member state. Those extra resources, which the Opposition voted against, have been put to good use. Compared with 1997, when we took office, we have 20 per cent. more psychiatric nurses, 50 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists and 75 per cent. more clinical psychologists.

In addition, the NHS plan envisaged 335 crisis resolution teams to give intensive support at home to people suffering a crisis in their mental health. By March 2005, there were 343 teams and they had been able to help nearly 50,000 people.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60207-09_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I agree that the needs of carers, especially those who look after people with mental health problems, are paramount. In the NSF, we have tried to provide extra support for carers, not least in the difficult situations that can occur. Sometimes it is difficult for a person to live close to someone with a mental health problem, and such situations need to be managed. In the White Paper, we set out a raft of measures in relation to carers, which, obviously, will apply to people caring for those with mental health problems. The best services that I have seen are those that have involved not only service users, but carers as well, in shaping them.

 There is not much point in closing down purpose-built institutions for residential mental health care, such as the Brischam unit in Brixham, on the basis that people with dementia would prefer to be looked after by carers in their own homes, if the carers are driven to distraction by having nowhere to send their cared-for person with dementia, because all the purpose-built residential homes have been closed down.

 The hon. Gentleman is referring to the need for good respite services. It is not necessarily perhaps a case of the constituents to whom he alludes wanting their loved ones to be elsewhere; they want a combination of care and support at home, with respite facilities as well. He is right to say that we all need to consider how we can increase those respite facilities, sometimes by turning inappropriate beds into respite care beds. That is an important approach to take, and it is sometimes important to consider what lies at the end of such proposals. For example, if a trust is talking about closing an institution, it should consider whether any such decision is backed up by a different type of service that better fits patients&#039; needs, and respite care is very often involved.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that having some form of mixed economy in mental health service provision is important?

</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60207-09_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We need to make better use of the voluntary sector, because in many senses it has been able to reach out to people who may not have been gaining access to services. We need to maximise the use of those skills. Last year, I launched some guidance with Victor Adebowale. It was all about how trusts needed to look closely at their relationship with the voluntary sector, and how they could operate services jointly. That approach fits in with our recent White Paper, and it applies particularly to mental health.

 My hon. Friend is right, because obviously, any suicide is a suicide too many. However, the success of the suicide strategy has meant that the numbers have dropped considerably and we are leaders in the European Union. There are a range of things that we can do to support more people in the community, but I will come to that later.

 I thank the Minister for giving way&#151;she is being very generous. When I went to see her in July, I mentioned Shelton hospital, which is set to be the last working Victorian asylum unless it is rebuilt, which is the plan of Shropshire County primary care trust&#151;the lead organisation&#151;Telford and Wrekin PCT and Powys local heath board. Five years ago, the cost of the project would have been between &#163;40 million and &#163;50 million, but it has now grown to &#163;85 million. The strategic health authority has put the project on hold because of the problems in Shropshire&#039;s health economy. If the delays carry on, there will be a bill of &#163;400,000 each month. When does the Minister think that the last Victorian asylum will be replaced, thus saving taxpayers the &#163;400,000 that is lost for every month that the delay continues?

 The hon. Gentleman knows very well that it is for his local trust and strategic health authority to examine that matter closely. It is important to move services into the community as much as possible. Obviously we must preserve some in-patient care, but the more we can provide modern reformed services in the community, the better. We have announced extra investment to improve in-patient facilities, but that matter is for local discussion.

 Much of the debate has been focused on adult mental health services and services for younger adults, especially in relation to suicide. Will my hon. Friend say a few words about mental heath services for children and adolescents, and the fantastic work that is done in that area?
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60207-10_spnew2"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that excellent work is done in that area, too. There have been shortages in some of the professions involved in mental health services for children and young adults, so we are trying to address that problem. It is important to ensure that there is co-ordination between mental health services for younger adults and those for older ones. Too often people get caught in one area or another, which causes enormous difficulties. We have taken steps 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60207-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_47">In 1999&#150;2000, the NHS and social services spent &#163;4.74 billion on mental health services. In 2003&#150;04, the figure had risen to more than &#163;6 billion, which was an increase of more than 27 per cent, or a &#163;1.2 billion increase in real terms. As was shown in a recent independent survey of planned mental health investment, the increase has continued in subsequent years. There has been an increase every year since we published the national service framework. Such unprecedented investment has allowed us to make significant improvements to mental health services.
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60207-10_spnew5"><b> Liz Blackman: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will agree that early identification is paramount; often, people who are developing mental illness first come into contact with generalists rather than specialists. What conversations has she had with professional bodies representing different medical practitioners about making mental health a core component of their training?
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60207-10_spnew6"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We have been looking closely at specialist GPs, who can make an early diagnosis. We also want to facilitate the professional exchange of information, so that practitioners can look out for those early symptoms, and they can be followed up by intervention teams if people are obviously deteriorating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">I want to address some of the points that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made about what he called cuts to mental health services, and it will be helpful if I set out some of the facts. In response to concerns expressed in the past few months, we recently asked for information from all 28 strategic health authorities. Twenty of them reported no reductions to planned expenditure on mental health services this year; the remaining eight reported that there would be reductions in planned expenditure affecting 11 trusts&#151;11 trusts, of 84 trusts in England. Those trusts had planned to spend &#163;894 million this year, and they are reducing their planned expenditure by a total of &#163;16.5 million&#151;2 per cent. of the total.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">To summarise, 11 of 84 trusts are making expenditure reductions that amount to &#163;16.5 million out of a total expenditure on mental health of more than &#163;6 billion&#151;0.3 per cent. of the total. Of course, in the light of the extra investment that we have made, we would prefer it if there were no planned reduction in expenditure. However, I hope that I can assure right hon. and hon. Members that strategic health authorities are working with those trusts to minimise any impact on patient services.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60207-10_spnew7"><b> Anne Milton  (Guildford) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Minister agree that despite the figures that she has quoted, many people working in mental health services, particularly in the community, still feel that they are part of a

<br>&nbsp;<br>Cinderella service, that there are huge gaps in their opportunity to deliver services, and that those gaps are being filled week after week, day after day, by those working in the voluntary sector?
</p>





<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60207-10_spnew8"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I believe that there has been a turnaround in the delivery of mental health services in this country, owing to the extra investment and the changed ways of working. It is important that we, as Members of Parliament, recognise those changes. There have in the past been difficulties in recruiting people to mental health services because they are constantly told that those are Cinderella services that are on their way out. We must recognise that mental health care is an exciting place to work, with new, modernised, reformed services that have received extra investment. We must recognise, too, that three out of four patients who use mental health services are very satisfied with the service that they receive.

<a name="60207-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_51">We have introduced many new community services, but as I have said, it is also important to ensure that there is high-quality in-patient care, which is why we committed &#163;130 million of capital investment to that. However, it is true that some people are still waiting too long for treatment and some are having difficulty in accessing the sort of treatment that they would choose for themselves, particularly psychological therapies such as cognitive therapy. For people with signs of mild depression or anxiety, psychological therapies can extend choice, reduce waiting times and help to keep them in work or support them in getting back into work earlier.

<a name="stpa_52">We are committed to widening access to psychological therapies as a supplement to medication, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and we clearly set that out in the White Paper that we published last week.

We will set up two demonstration sites that will focus on people of working age with mild to moderate health problems and aim to help them stay in, or return to, work. We also know that people with mental health problems suffer from serious inequalities in physical health, which is why our White Paper on public health set out a series of ways to tackle those inequalities.

<a name="stpa_53">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire spoke of access to, and experience of, mental health care for black and minority ethnic communities. For decades the problem went unrecognised and unchallenged. We have begun to change that. A year ago, following the report on the death of David Bennett, we published &quot;Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care&quot;, a comprehensive five-year action plan to put right what was clearly unacceptable. One of the first steps along the way was last year&#039;s census of mental health in-patients. It confirmed the problems that we knew existed for people from black and minority ethnic communities. That is why, alongside the census, we have chosen 17 places throughout the country that are leading the implementation of the five-year action plan.

It is vital that we modernise mental health law and bring it into line with human rights legislation. Where compulsory treatment is necessary, we must reach a quality and level of service that gives people the treatment that they need and minimises the need for further periods of compulsion. These are not easy issues to deal with, but we are determined to do so.

<p>
<a name="60207-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_55">Improving the mental well-being of individuals and our wider community, and tackling the stigma and discrimination suffered by those with mental health problems, will not be achieved simply by modernising mental health legislation and reforming mental health services. We need an approach that stretches across Government, which is why in 2004 we published the social exclusion unit report, which sets out a series of steps that need to be taken by the Government at all levels. For example, we need to examine access to housing, employment and a range of local services, which many of us take for granted. That is also why we published the health, work and well-being strategy at the end of last year, which looks at how to help people stay in work, and also how to help people back to work. That was part of the overall direction of travel set out in our recent Green Paper on welfare reform.

There is a real gap&#151;I do not mean this pejoratively&#151;between the relatively superficial level of support and care that an untrained generalist can provide and the most acute in-patient care.

<a name="stpa_75">Before I consider broader policy matters, I want to examine emergency provision in circumstances in which a family member with mental health problems, who perhaps lives in a care setting, comes home, for example, for Christmas and things go wrong. I have recently come across two cases of people with mental health problems spending the night in a prison cell. Parts of the country have a protocol whereby that should not happen, but it has happened twice in my area relatively recently. At short notice, there was nowhere for those people to go and they ended up in a prison cell. That was traumatic for the family and the individuals, and the police knew that it was the wrong place for them. Will the Minister say something about short-notice crisis provision and alternatives to a prison cell?

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_76">As I said, we must consider whether GPs need substantially more training and whether there are alternative ways of accessing mental health services. However, we must take into account not only the mental but the physical health of those with mental health problems. When I recently attended an event that was organised by the charity Rethink, I was startled to discover that people with severe mental health problems can expect to live perhaps 15 or 20 years less than someone with similar physical problems.

<a name="60207-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">For example, American evidence shows that people with severe mental health problems who develop cancer are 50 per cent. more likely to die of it than those without mental health problems. There are genuine worries about the ability of people with mental health problems to access care for their physical health. Looking after people&#039;s physical health helps their mental health. We need a much broader agenda that does not separate budgets for mental health and for physical health but perceives them as an integrated whole because one can beneficially feed into the other.

<a name="stpa_78">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr.   Flello) mentioned mental health services for children and adolescents. He rightly said that much good work is being done. However, the charity YoungMinds suggests that the pressures on primary care trust budgets mean that those for community and adolescent mental health services are also under pressure. What reassurances can the Minister give that those groups are being properly looked after?

<a name="stpa_79">Let us consider the other end of the age scale. Many hon.

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_80">This week, the Commission for Social Care Inspection published a report, with which the Minister will be familiar, which found that the management of many elderly people&#039;s medication in care homes is inadequate. That will undermine the mental health of many vulnerable older people and I am worried about that.

<a name="60207-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_81">The motion mentions the position of those in black and minority ethnic communities, who are more likely to be in hospital with mental health problems, to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 and to be physically restrained. Do the Government understand the reasons for that and how far it is due to discrimination or different patterns of provisions? What is being done about that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_82">Let us consider positive action that can and should be taken. The Minister will have come across the Institute for Public Policy Research report that was published last year on &quot;Mental Health in the Mainstream&quot;, which makes several specific recommendations. I shall touch on just a couple of those recommendations. First, the report talks about getting access workers into health services where GPs are inappropriate. What does the Minister think about that idea? How seriously has it been taken over the past few months? Secondly, it considers the use of &quot;non-pharmacological&quot; treatments, therapies and so on, and says that the key is prevention&#151;getting in early, before things get out of hand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_83">Before concluding, I want to mention a couple of wider issues. The first has been mentioned already in the debate&#151;the position of people with mental health problems in respect of the incapacity benefit system. It is worrying that the Government are proposing a carrot-and-stick approach: although it is possible that more money will be given to those people who jump through the right hoops when they apply for the benefit, the stick of sanctions might be applied to others. What discussions has the Minister had with the Department for Work and Pensions about the impact on mental health patients who fear that they will lose their benefit if they do not do certain things? What assessment has she asked that Department to make of the impact that changes to incapacity benefit will have on people with mental health problems?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_84">There are three prisons in my constituency, so I was pleased that the problem of mental health in prisons has been raised. However, if we think that the mental health service as a whole is a Cinderella service, the mental health service in prisons is even lower down the scale. I am pleased that mental health in prisons is now the responsibility of the Department of Health and not the Home Office, but will the Minister say what progress is being made? There have been an alarming number of suicides over the past few years at the Eastwood Park women&#039;s prison in my constituency: how much of a priority is that for the Government?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_85">Finally, mention has been made of the mental health Bill, which has yet to be published. So far in the debate, the Government have said some relatively enlightened things about the importance of mental health, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 763</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about prevention. However, that contrasts with the tabloid-driven, draconian, lock-&#039;em-up mentality that seems to underlie the forthcoming Bill. I hope that the Department of Health will take ownership of the Bill and not allow the grubby hands of the Home Office to be all over it. We need a mental health approach to these matters, not the law-and-order approach driven by tabloid scare stories that is inappropriate in the vast majority of cases. Although there is agreement today that we should not stigmatise people with mental health problems, there is a real danger that that is precisely what the Bill will do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_86">This a vital and valuable debate. My concern is that the people in GPs&#039; surgeries providing the front-line provision for those with mental health problems are not adequately trained or resourced. As we have heard, mental health services are being squeezed as deficits get shunted around. A key remedy would be to pool resources across different forms of health and social care, so that provision is made for the whole person and the totality of his or her needs. We must not see people only in terms of what is wrong with one part of their lives. That is the more enlightened approach that we in the Liberal Democrat party advocate.

 I am very pleased to have this opportunity to debate mental health services. As has been noted already, they are enormously important to the lives of service users and their families. It is good to see a measure of agreement across the House that it is important to put the stigma associated with poor mental health behind us, and that the mental health services should get the attention and priority that they deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_87">Too often in the past, mental health care has been a poor relation, but there is no doubt that the extra money provided by this Labour Government has made a big difference. Although more needs to be done, it is no exaggeration to say that mental health care in Oxfordshire has been transformed over the past nine years. That is thanks to investment, the achievement of NHS staff at all levels and to the work of excellent local community groups such as Restore. The local trust has made great strides in providing better services and more facilities for patients. Tangible improvements are clear for all to see, and patients appreciate the improved standards of care that they receive. A recent survey of the Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust&#039;s service users showed that more than three quarters of the respondents rated the standard of their overall care as excellent, very good or good.

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para13">

<br>&nbsp;<br>health problems will open up more places and allow the trust to provide separate areas for boys and girls. More services are being made available. In the past, people with a personality disorder had a choice between hospital and repeated GP appointments. Now, they have access to dedicated out-patient and day-care support.

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_89">My constituents can now receive in-patient care in Oxford for eating disorders, instead of having to be transferred to faraway hospitals. The new forensic pre-discharge service helps people who have been mentally ill and in secure hospital care to take the first steps towards living in their own community again. That is just the kind of gradual supported approach for people going back into the community that patients and the public want to see. Those and other developments, coupled with careful financial management, enabled the Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust to progress from one star in 2003 to three stars in 2005. No praise is high enough for the dedication of the staff at all levels who made that possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_90">Despite all this outstanding work, however, local mental health services face the enormous challenges arising from cuts that are being made to tackle the financial deficit in the Oxfordshire health economy&#151;a deficit, moreover, that was not of their making. My right hon. Friend the Minister quite reasonably gave the House the relevant figures earlier. However, what this means financially for Oxfordshire is that, whereas in 2004&#150;05, Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust spent &#163;51.2 million and budgeted &#163;53.7 million to meet this year&#039;s expenditure, it is now being asked this year to cut &#163;1.1 million from its spending, even after having received &#163;1.5 million one-off help from the strategic health authority, which it may yet have to repay over the next two years. All in all, the trust has almost 10 per cent. less than it says that it needs to meet service and cost pressures. We can argue about these figures&#151;and about what proportion of them represent legitimate efficiency gains, and so on&#151;but however we measure them, the cuts are damaging to the trust and its services, and deeply worrying for patients, their families and staff, as the many letters that I have received from my constituents make clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_91">What this means for services is that the trust is having to look at bringing forward the closure of in-patient beds, leading to a real rush to put in place the 24-hour crisis community cover that is needed. It would have been much better to plan and carry through such a change in a measured way. The trust is also having to consider the closure of the psychiatry liaison service at the John Radcliffe hospital, which provides support in the accident and emergency unit to people who have attempted suicide and which also supports people in acute beds who are suffering from chronic illnesses such as cancer. The trust is also considering the closure of an in-patient unit for older adults where patients are assessed for depression and Alzheimer&#039;s disease. It is also now unable to invest sufficiently in support for older people in the community or to ensure that early intervention is available to help young people at the first onset of mental illness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para17">
<a name="stpa_92">The seriousness of the position is compounded by cuts in the Supporting People programme budget locally, as well as by the current state of NHS funding mechanisms, which is a more general problem for mental health care

<br>&nbsp;<br>trusts. Whereas additional work for other acute hospital trusts is funded according to the national tariff, additional work at mental health care trusts has to be absorbed within the block allocation, which puts skewed pressure on their share of overall expenditure. This makes it more important that we all speak up for the needs of our mental health care services, both here and in our constituencies, so that they do not get squeezed out by competing demands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para18">
<a name="stpa_93">All of that poses a real danger of damaging and obscuring the excellent progress that has been made in mental health care locally and nationally. However, it also puts a question mark over exciting developments planned for the future in preventive community provision in partnership with social services, round-the-clock community crisis support, the development of the complex needs service and the pre-discharge unit for mentally ill offenders, which addresses the issues raised by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para19">
<a name="stpa_94">To build on what has been achieved rather than put it at risk, and to make the most of opportunities to improve mental health care in our community, I urge Ministers to consider again what can be done to ease the financial pressures in Oxfordshire, particularly in the mental health care trust, even now in the remaining weeks of the financial year. The mental health care trust is working with the rest of the local NHS to address the underlying financial problems that affect services in Oxfordshire. However, a more measured view needs to be taken of the trust&#039;s ability to bear the funding cuts, considering that it has a high proportion of vulnerable service users, many of whom are in no position to speak up for themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-12_para20">
<a name="stpa_95">In addition, given the body blow that services have suffered this year, Ministers need to assure us that they are taking action to avoid any repetition of this financial fiasco next year, and that budgets across PCTs and hospitals will be properly planned so that those in mental health and other services in the NHS can look ahead with confidence and work with patients and their families to make the most of the huge extra investment that this Labour Government have made and continue to make in the NHS. That has made a terrific difference to the quality of care available to patients and the wider community locally. Let us keep up that good work and carry it forward, not put it at risk as has sadly happened this year.

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60207-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood) (Con):</b> 
 Like others who have spoken in this debate, I congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench on providing Opposition time to debate mental health services. Constant improvement in the services delivered to mentally ill people is a core responsibility of the national health service and my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are entitled to credit for providing time for the House to debate those important issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">If I may paraphrase the speech of the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), it is fair to say that he argued that the Government have provided substantial extra money to the national health service, which is true, and that that has made possible significant improvements in services to mentally ill people, which is also true. However, difficult issues remain for those

<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 766</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsible for managing those services locally. Whatever level of resources is likely to be provided to the national health service, difficult choices remain to be made about the pattern of delivery of local services. That relates directly to the point made by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">The Minister does neither herself nor her Government any credit when she seeks to persuade us that, before 1997, there was a dark age in which no progress was made on any of those issues, and that there was suddenly a new dawn on 1 May 1997 when all requirement for choices was removed. That is not a vision of events that will be recognised by those who work in the mental health services of the national health service. It seems much more accurate to say that the direction of mental health services has been consistent under Governments of all political complexions since the days when Enoch Powell was Health Minister and first committed the national health service to the policy of taking mental health services out of the Victorian institutions and providing proper, high-quality, community-based care for mentally ill people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">We all know that the story of the changes in mental health service delivery over the intervening 40 years has been one of individual local successes and failures, but it is surely true to say that, throughout those 40 years, Ministers of all political complexions have been committed to broadly the same vision of the future of mental health services. If we acknowledge that, we shall be able to engage in a much more mature and adult debate on the issues that we face in delivering what is a broadly shared agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">Various speakers have rightly sought to avoid the phrase &quot;Cinderella service&quot;, which is generally applied, almost by default, to mental health services. I believe that it emanates from the wrong train of thought, because it implies that mental health service delivery in the NHS is somehow different from, or separate from, all other NHS health care delivery. In my view, the similarities between the priorities involved in mental health care delivery and those involved in physical health care delivery are more important than the differences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_100">As the hon. Member for Northavon pointed out, the great majority of mental health service delivery through the NHS takes place via community and primary health care services. Exactly the same applies to the rest of health care delivery in the NHS. Mental health services are an integral part of the delivery of health care to elderly people. He was right to say that we should not imagine that all elderly people need mental health services, but we cannot think of mental health service delivery without thinking of it in the context of delivery to individual patients, many of whom are elderly and many of whom suffer from physical illnesses that are complicated by the presence of mental health problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_101">The hon. Gentleman was also right to stress the importance of the interface between social care and health care delivery. If we are to deliver high-quality, successful mental health services, we must bear that in mind. Any multidisciplinary team responsible for delivering mental health care in the community must include both a health care and a social care element. Throughout those 40 years, too many failures could be traced to their roots in the breakdown of communication between health care and social care 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 767</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>delivery. As he said, that remains an institutional issue    that Ministers&#151;those responsible for policy development&#151;have not yet cracked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_102">Mental health services are sometimes represented as being driven by a mysterious political orthodoxy under the title &quot;care in the community&quot;. That was mentioned earlier in the debate. It surely cannot be stated too often that caring for people in the community, whether they are mentally ill or physically ill, is not a manifestation of political correctness, nor is it the manifestation of a Treasury-driven desire to close hospitals and get people into the community, although it is sometimes represented as such. In fact, it represents the central purpose of all health care. Why do we have health care in our society? Surely its purpose is to enable people, as far as is humanly possible, to live their lives normally. That is why community health care, whether it is delivered to the physically ill or to the mentally ill, must be at the heart of the development of health care delivery generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_103">The priorities in the development of mental health services are thus very similar to the priorities in the delivery of the rest of health care. For instance, they relate to the development of primary and community-based care. I welcome the Government&#039;s White Paper on the subject, published at the beginning of last week. There is almost nothing in the White Paper that I could not have envisaged writing as the Secretary of State for Health 10 years ago. I observe without rancour that it is a pity that we have gone on such a long detour to get back to some of the ideas that we were developing 10 years ago, most notably and obviously what we used to call GP fundholding and what the Government now call practice-based commissioning. There is no difference of principle between the two and it is a pity that we have lost 10 years in the development of that important idea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">I ask Ministers to reflect, in the context of the delivery of mental health services, on the implications of the recent changes in the GP contract for access to primary care services at evenings and weekends. All studies of mental health service delivery emphasise the importance of people at short notice being able to secure access to services, particularly young people in the acute phase of mental illness and elderly people who have a short-term requirement for respite care. Now in our communities, Tesco and Sainsbury&#039;s are open all through the weekend, but our primary health care delivery facilities are more difficult to access than they used to be. That is an issue for health care across the field but it is a particular issue in the delivery of mental health services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">I ask Ministers, too, to reflect on the need to ensure that there are properly integrated community-based health care services, including not only social care, but residential care for those who are in an acute phase of schizophrenia and psychotic illness and residential care for those requiring respite care. We all know that, if we are going to deliver successful integrated care in the community, there will have to be proper patient plans&#151;pathways of care&#151;that integrate the different elements of the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">What we look for from Ministers is a clear commitment that the Government recognise that there is no difference of view in any part of the House about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 768</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the type of service that we want to see delivered. Nor is there any difference about our commitment to see resources grow year by year, as they have for 50 years in the NHS, to support the growth and improvement of the delivery of those services. What we have to see is detailed planning locally to avoid the ups and downs in the delivery of service, which were described by the right hon. Member for Oxford, East, and integrated delivery of care, so that, from the perspective of the patient, the service is more reliable, and of better and more consistent quality than we have seen in the past under Governments of all political persuasions.

 For three years, I was a member of the Mental Health Act Commission. I visited patients not only to check that they were legally detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 but to talk to them about their concerns. With that experience, I am pleased to be able to say a few words this afternoon.

<a name="60207-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">Although as a Mental Health Act commissioner I was working at the acute end of mental health, dealing with people who were detained, it was interesting to talk to them about their pathways and how they ended up being sectioned.

The focus on mental health services has increased since 1997. The investment has gone in since 1997. When we talk to the community and voluntary sector, it says that the joined-up thinking and the investment in mental health services in local communities has been staggering in some instances. From my right hon. Friend the Minister, we heard that there are 8,000 more psychiatric nurses, 1,200 more psychiatric consultants and 3,000 more psychologists. Those are real people providing a real service to our constituents with mental health problems.

<a name="stpa_110">On children and young people, on Friday I went to a meeting of the Humber mental health trust, a three-star mental health trust that does excellent work. It said that, although the national service framework for adult mental health services&#151;it includes sections involving children&#151;was a good start, we needed an NSF for young people. The chief executive said that the split between children and adolescent mental health services that goes up to 16 or 18 years of age was not providing the kind of care we should be providing for young people. We need a service that spans the age group from, say, 15 to 30.

<a name="stpa_112">Getting in early is important. I was pleased to see that Sure Starts were putting emphasis on developing emotional well being in the support that they are providing to parents and carers of our youngest children. Such guidance to those who look after children uses creative activity to improve children&#039;s self-esteem, social skills and emotional well being. That is absolutely right. It is a stark fact that a child living in a low-income, lone-parent household is twice as likely to have emotional disorder as a child in a two-parent family on a reasonable income. There is a clear link with poverty and it is right that Sure Starts, which were based on the most disadvantaged areas, are putting the focus on emotional well being.

<a name="stpa_114">We have heard about the massive investment in PCTs for mental health services and it is worth putting on record that &#163;300 million has gone into PCTs and local authorities to improve child and adolescent mental health between 2003 and 2006. However, there are still some gaps. I visited Hull domestic violence refuge and was told by some teenagers that there were counselling facilities available to younger children to help them deal with the trauma they had experienced, but that there was nobody to provide teenagers with counselling.

We need to ensure that particular resources are attached to making sure that those in the 12 to 25 age group get the help they need. Of course, the recently published Health White Paper will work to counteract the stigma of mental health.

As was pointed out earlier, there can often be a mixture of people with various mental illnesses and disorders on a given ward.

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60207-14_spnew0"><b> Angela Browning  (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</b> 
 During this debate, which I very much welcome, we need to reflect on the scale of mental ill health. We are told that one in five adults will experience mental health problems at some point in their life, which means that, of the 20 Members currently in this Chamber, four of us could well experience such problems. It is very unlikely that the same ratio of Members will experience any other type of health problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_119">As with many other conditions, mental ill health does not affect just the patient. The impact on families, particularly the prime carer, is enormous; indeed, it is so great that, ultimately, it can affect both their mental and physical health, particularly if that patient has a long-term condition. Many of us&#151;certainly me&#151;have experienced at first hand in our families the agonising condition of mental ill health and its impact on people&#039;s lives. It is one of the most distressing conditions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_120">In discussing mental health, I want to focus on the two age extremes. Many Members have mentioned young people, and at that age suicide is an issue. The Mental Health Foundation and Mind have pointed out that the highest rate of suicide is among young men between the ages of 15 and 24, that 20 per cent. of all deaths among young people are through suicide, and that one in 10 of 11 to 25-year-olds self-harm. Given the scale of the problem, we have to find the answers and the policies to alleviate it. Behind those bare statistics are very real tragedies for the families concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_121">It would be remiss of me not to add one more statistic on behalf of a group of people whom I mention probably far too often in this House. However, I make no apology for doing so. A recent report by the National Autistic Society pointed out that the attempted suicide rate among adult sufferers of Asperger&#039;s syndrome is 8 per cent., which is very high indeed. When we consider, in managing such patients, how they reached the point of attempting suicide, there is usually&#151;not always, but usually&#151;an identifiable pathway in their relationship with the statutory services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_122">In the recent past, I have had more than one Adjournment debate on in-patient deaths within the Devon Partnership NHS Trust. I wish to put on the record that since I have raised the issue and some of the concerns have been addressed, we have seen&#151;under the management of Mr. Iain Tully and his team&#151;a real rethink on why those tragic deaths occurred in our area. The mother of one of the young men who died showed me a plan of his relationships with statutory services 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 771</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>during his long history of mental ill health. The relationship usually started well, but eventually failed. We euphemistically call that falling through the net, but too many young people do so&#151;especially in their relationships with community services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_123">I wish to pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb). Often, the first professional a patient sees is their GP. I sympathise with GPs because they have an eight-minute slot in which to listen, assess and decide what to do. There are GPs in my constituency&#151;and I am sure they are not unique&#151;who ask how they can do anything other than pick up the prescription pad at the end of the eight minutes. A prescription may solve a short-term problem, but&#151;and I mean no disrespect to GPs&#151;it does not address the underlying cause. Many of the young people who end up as suicide statistics do so because not enough time has been spent with them, there has not been enough continuity in their care and the people who could help are not out there in the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_124">My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) pointed out that when people break their legs, they recover. Well, people do make full recoveries from certain types of mental illness, but mental health problems make people fragile. Such problems are often recurring. Also, when people present to GPs and other professionals, their instinct is often to conceal the underlying problem. It often takes many hours of discussion and counselling before even the best trained psychiatrist can start to identify the right approach for an individual. It is time-consuming, painstaking work that is very different from other areas of medicine. Therefore, while I understand the Minister&#039;s wish to put the statistics in the best light possible, we still have a huge way to go. The suicide statistics prove that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_125">At the other end of the age spectrum are the elderly. The mental health of many elderly people breaks down from a simple cause&#151;social isolation. To put it more simply, the cause is loneliness. Many elderly people who are unable to get out and about, or whose family and friends have started to die off or have moved away, spend far too many hours on their own, and that inevitably leads to depression. As we know, depression is a spectrum. It can be intermittent and addressed by medication, but all too often it leads to more serious mental health problems. Depression is also a common side effect of other physical conditions, such as Parkinson&#039;s disease. It is extremely difficult to disaggregate the depression and the underlying mental health problems from the physical conditions in elderly people who are often not able to be very good self-advocates. I can think of some of my elderly relatives who always put on their best face when the doctor came to call&#151;a natural response for that generation&#151;even though they had problems that the doctor needed to know about. It is a complex and grey area, which is not easy for professionals, let alone politicians, to enter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_126">More than 13 per cent. of the NHS budget is devoted to mental health services and I am concerned about care in the community. We have heard much about the packages to deal with people&#039;s physical needs, but if we are to move towards more people being cared for at home for longer&#151;as we certainly are in Devon&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 772</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>especially when they are extremely dependent physically, their emotional and psychological needs must also be met&#151;otherwise, many elderly people will develop serious mental health problems. All too often when serious problems occur, whether with younger people in suicide cases or with elderly people with mental illness&#151;the health service has to respond to a person in crisis. The statutory services have to respond suddenly to situations where, to put things in crude financial terms, much more money will have to be spent than if there had been regular, lower-level interventions at an earlier stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_127">There is a dilemma. Health authorities and social services departments work on annualised budgets and the system mitigates against such regular interventions. It has to deal with people who are in crisis, so it is easier to pare off services and facilities that may be regarded as low level, even though they might have ensured that many people who appear in the crisis statistics had a better quality of life and did not succumb to mental illness. The fact that more people have been admitted to mental hospital since the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1983 is an indication that intervention takes place only when there is a crisis. We must address that issue. Crisis management is never the most effective outcome, for either the patient or the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_128">As I said earlier, I served on the scrutiny Committee on the Mental Health Bill, so it would be remiss of me not to mention my grave concern about two aspects of the Bill; indeed, the Minister would expect me to do so. I still believe that the Government&#039;s broader definition of mental disorder is wrong and if the Bill is introduced I hope to put my case to the Minister even more robustly than in the past. I urge her to reconsider that aspect of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_129">My second concern relates to compulsion. We received evidence from the Royal College of Psychiatrists that, under the provisions, we should need to detain one in 2,000 people with no previous indication that they would cause severe harm. I realise that the proposal came from the Home Office rather than the Department of Health, but if we broaden the definition of mental disorder so that it is based not on clinical diagnosis but merely on behaviour, and if that is accompanied by wider provisions in civil legislation for indefinite detention, the infringements of civil liberties that we have discussed in this place in the past will be as nothing by comparison. If the Minister does not address that aspect of the Bill, the rebellion will not be merely in this and another place; people will march in the streets.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_131">I pay tribute to the many people and organisations in Hackney, South and Shoreditch and Hackney as a whole&#151;such as Mind and the Chinese Mental Health Association, which put time and effort into supporting people with mental health problems&#151;as well as the people with mental health problems who also play a key role. My hon. Friend knows of the good work done at Homerton university hospital and by City and Hackney Mental Health Trust. It is important that all those organisations play a big role in a constituency with a high incidence of mental health problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_132">I will not bombard the House with statistics in the short time that I have, but it is startling that admissions to hospital for schizophrenia are three times more common in Hackney than in England as a whole, for both men and women. I want to touch very briefly on three issues: employment, ethnicity and the impact on welfare benefits for people suffering from mental health problems. The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) rightly highlighted the need for preventive work. He said something about the Minister suggesting that everything in the garden was rosy. In some ways, I agree with him. Not everything in the garden is rosy, but it is a lot better than it was, which is a good step.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_133">General Practitioners in Hackney are very much at the sharp end of dealing with people with mental health problems. Other hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), have highlighted some of the difficulties of dealing with mental health problems in the short time that many GPs have available. That is one of the reasons why I welcome those aspects of the health White Paper that will improve and promote community care provision at that initial presentation point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_134">We all know that people with mental health problems have much more difficulty finding employment than the general population. That is so even when compared with people who are physically disabled. About 16 per cent. of physically disabled people are more likely to be unemployed, compared with 50 per cent. of people with mental health problems. Some 86 per cent. of people with longer-term mental health problems are unemployed. The other side of the coin is how employers react&#151;only 37 per cent of them are prepared to consider employing people with such difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-14_para16">
<a name="stpa_135">I am very proud that the two local mental health trusts&#151;East London and the City, which covers Hackney, and North East London&#151;the local strategic health authority and South Bank university have joined forces to fund a consultant occupational therapist for employment. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that that is the sort of joined-up government to which she referred in her comments. The two mental health trusts have adopted a joint partnership approach&#151;the roots to employment project, which is the first of its kind in the UK to help people with mental health problems into work, by working with employers to ensure that they address the issues and understand the need to help people with mental health problems back into the workplace.

</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60207-15_spnew1"><b> Meg Hillier: </b> 
 My hon. Friend may have a point. I cannot draw on enough experience of people bringing such issues to my surgery&#151;I am only a new Member compared with him&#151;but I am proud to see what happens when I go to forums in Hackney. For example, I opened a Jobcentre Plus office at the end of last week, and some of the employers there, including Hackney council and the local hospital, recognised the need to support people with mental health problems. They work positively with those people and take on board their problems. Perhaps that happens because we have the roots to employment project in Hackney, and perhaps my hon. Friend may wish to raise that with the primary care trust, the mental health trust and the other health and employment bodies in his constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_136">I said that I was going to touch on ethnicity. Hackney, South and Shoreditch is especially affected by the Eurocentric nature of much psychiatric training, which helps to contribute to the fact that Afro-Caribbean people are typically three to five times more likely than white people to be admitted to hospital with a first diagnosis of schizophrenia, and then 10 times more likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenic. The Chinese Mental Health Association has much of interest to say on the subject. The Chinese community in Britain is often isolated and many Chinese people do not wish to talk about mental health problems for cultural reasons. Problems due to language affect not only the Chinese, but other groups across the board.

<a name="60207-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_137">I am delighted that north-east London is one of 17 nationally focused areas for delivering race equality in mental health. The Government have taken a major step forward by recognising the white Eurocentric approach to psychiatry. Such initiatives are sorely needed and much welcomed in Hackney. When I spoke to Hackney Mind, I found that many mental health service users were especially pleased that the scheme was moving forward, but we need to see results on the ground. We are only at the beginning with the scheme, but I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will keep a close eye on the situation from Whitehall. As other hon.

<a name="stpa_138">When I said that I would be brief, I meant it in all sincerity, but I want to touch on incapacity benefit, as did the hon. Member for Northavon. Hackney, South and Shoreditch has the second highest number of incapacity benefit claimants of any London constituency&#151;only Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North, which is in west London, has more. My constituency, which nestles close by the City and runs right down to Liverpool Street station, is 31st equal nationally for the number of claimants. We have 7,400 claimants, 63 per cent. of whom are under 50.

<a name="stpa_141">The primary care trust wants the Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust to save &#163;1 million. Additionally, the strategic health authority is requiring the trust to save a further &#163;5.3 million over the next three years to break even and has imposed a cut of &#163;1.7 million on top of that, not because the trust is in any way overspent, but because the rest of the NHS in Oxfordshire is overdrawn. The SHA thus imposed an implied deficit of &#163;1.7 million on the trust to make up for overspends in other parts of the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_142">In addition to all that, there has been a reduction of at least &#163;400,000 in the Supporting People budget, which I have raised in the House on a number of occasions. The sum of all those interactions is that the cuts represent about 10 per cent. of the mental health care trust&#039;s budget for patient care and at least 15 per cent. of the money for supported housing, which is likely to have a devastating impact on the lives of people affected by mental illness and the people who care for them.

<a name="stpa_147">There are three issues that I want to mention to Ministers. First, in the overall context of NHS spending, if there is a squeeze on spending, mental health seems to take a disproportionate share of it.

<a name="stpa_148">Secondly, we are moving into a world of payment by results. There has been no real discussion about that this afternoon. I do not see how payment by results will work with NHS mental health care funding. There has to be an alternative system to ensure that mental health work is properly funded in future; otherwise, there will be real tension. I am not confident that GP practice-based commissioning will ensure that mental health trusts in Oxfordshire and elsewhere are properly funded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_149">I turn to my last point about the squeeze on mental health care work. In the acute sector there is a reasonably clear divide between work done by the NHS which is free at the point of use in the NHS and funded by the NHS, and work done as part of social care, which is means-tested and provided by social services. Often there is a black hole, and there is a debate about where the line should be drawn, but there is a reasonably clear line. When it comes to mental health care services, that line is much more blurred, so the mental health care trust ends up carrying up many more services, such as those under the Supporting People budget. There is a much greater tension there, and people expect the trust to deliver those services.
</p>

<a name="stpa_150">I am sure that the Minister genuinely believes that this is one of the Government&#039;s three priorities. She and her colleagues are very welcome to come to Oxfordshire, because I am not being flippant or frivolous&#151;I increasingly believe it&#151;when I say that we are living in a parallel universe there. It may well be something to do with its being a comparatively small county with a large teaching hospital and a major centre of research. Something is causing a problem when we have an NHS in freefall, but the effects are being felt particularly by those with mental health problems. That is not fair and

</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_152">The PCT, echoing the Minister, claims that closure of acute wards will be offset by the reorganisation of community services and investment in assertive outreach work. The trouble is that the PCT is requiring &#163;2 million of cuts not next year but in the current financial year. There is no lead-in time to get the community and crisis resolution teams fully in place. I fully accept that crisis resolution and community outreach are a good way to run mental health services, and preventing in-patient admission has to be a good idea. However, if there were no financial pressure, the change would have been brought in over a much longer period.

 My hon. Friend may be aware that in my constituency the hospital trust is to lose &#163;500,000 because the primary care trust is trying to save the same sum by closing two wards in Kendal. The pressure, of course, is on the PCT to balance its books; the reality is that the NHS overall loses out. If we look at those entities as separate organisations, not as a single national health service, we do not have sensible joined-up government. I wonder whether that experience is reflected in my hon. Friend&#039;s area.

<br>&nbsp;<br>places, when an assertive outreach service is set up, the teams find unmet need, so the need for in-patient beds goes up, not down. In Cambridge, the change is happening all at once, and risks are being taken with patients&#039; welfare. The whole thing resembles tightrope walking without a net.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_154">The mental health trust is, of course, acting under duress from the PCT. The PCT has little choice because of the dire state of its budget. The Department of Health requires a &#163;15 million reduction in spending, and even that does not cover the current deficit. Another &#163;23 million deficit is on the way in subsequent years. Ministers keep saying that vast sums have gone into the NHS. In written answers to me the Minister has said that Cambridge PCT is receiving 29 per cent. extra, and that even after the cuts Cambridge&#039;s spending on mental health will still be above the national average.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_155">We need to tackle those points directly. There has been an increase in funding, but as the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) said, one of the problems is that if there is a foundation hospital, the PCT&#039;s cheque book is, in effect, handed over to that hospital, which writes itself cheques that deal with all of its previous financial problems. Effectively, the financial problems of the acute trusts have been transferred to the PCTs, and the PCTs have had to remove the budgets of what remains under their control&#151;mental health and other services. When the mental health trust acquires the right to charge at tariff rates for the patients who cross its threshold, its problems may be solved in the same way as those of acute trusts, but what then will happen to PCT budgets and GP fundholder budgets?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_156">On national averages, the point is not the average but the need. In October and in meetings with Ministers I raised several problems about the green book&#151;the index of mental health need. The measure of poverty that the green book uses is based on benefit take-up, not income. For Cambridge that is catastrophic, because successive Governments have taken away students&#039; right to benefits. Students have serious mental health needs, as the hon. Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) said. Suicide rates are high and self-harm is a problem. I should add to that&#151;I know this from experience as a university teacher&#151;the problem of eating disorders, which I have seen blight the careers of several brilliant young women.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_157">The second point about the green book is the measure of housing condition rather than housing tenure, despite the fact that all the academic work shows that the link with mental health problems is with housing tenure. The third and most important point for us is that the needs index reduces funding if one&#039;s area is near a good mental health institution, such as Fulbourn hospital. The reason for that is the cost of reaching the facility, but in reality being near a good facility increases the number of patients in the area, because of migration and because people stay in the area once they return to the community. The Secretary of State conceded that some work needs to be done on these matters, and I will be glad to hear what further work has been done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_158">The cuts in mental health services in Cambridge have had at least one good effect: they have brought the community together in opposition to them. Thousands of people joined the public protests, attending meetings

Despite all the brave and good things that people have done&#151;including, in a live BBC radio interview, the interviewer mentioning to me that he had suffered from mental illness and had recovered&#151;the campaign that we are waging is not just to change public attitudes but to get more funding. That is the problem that we face. I gather that today the county council&#039;s health scrutiny committee is meeting, and it has the power to refer the issue to the Minister. I very much hope that it does so. Then we shall see the strength of the Minister&#039;s commitment to mental health.

 I agree with comments by Members on both sides of the House that the primary difficulty with the mental health debate is that various types of mental illnesses are minimised and often ignored. Within that broad category of mental illnesses, there are some that are disregarded even more than others. I want to focus my remarks in the brief time available on one of those: post-traumatic stress disorder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_159">Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental illness that is often dismissed, not simply by the rest of us but by those who suffer from it. It therefore presents its own specific difficulties in terms of the work that the Government and the NHS must do to support those who suffer from it. People have always suffered from it, but it has only relatively recently been recognised&#151;from first world war shell-shock to the illness that is diagnosed today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_160">Post-traumatic stress disorder can affect us all. Whether we are holidaymakers or commuters, we are potential victims of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of natural disasters of almost biblical proportions or terrorist atrocities on our daily commute to or from work. It particularly affects&#151;this is the group of people to whom I particularly want to draw the attention of the House&#151;those who feel that they ought to be most able to deal with it, and are therefore least likely to seek help. I refer to those in the armed services and the emergency services. Those who serve this country bravely, and sometimes at great cost to themselves not only physically but mentally, suffer from anything ranging from flashbacks to serious mental breakdowns, and do so often in what might be an unsympathetic environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_161">There is no doubt that post-traumatic stress disorder, like other mental illnesses, wrecks lives&#151;not just the lives of those who suffer from it but those of their families and friends. It often leads to alcoholism, violence, homelessness and family breakdown, and all those problems need addressing in the context of the illness that the person is suffering from. The illness is costly not only in human terms but in financial terms.

<a name="stpa_162">I recently met an experienced firefighter who, as a result of a collision with a car in which the driver of the other vehicle was killed&#151;an incident that was not the firefighter&#039;s fault&#151;suffered a series of flashbacks leading to a more serious breakdown, after which he spent six

<br>&nbsp;<br>years away from work. That cost the taxpayer a total of &#163;118,000 in pension, incapacity benefit and other benefits. On that basis it must be right that in framing their Mental Health Bill, the Government give clear and full consideration to the ways in which we can assist those individuals and ensure early intervention, so that they can receive the care and treatment that they need as soon as it can be given to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_163">I hope that the Minister accepts that although one option for those individuals when their illness becomes very serious is in-patient care&#151;I am sorry to say that in-patient facilities for military personnel have closed progressively over the past few years, both at Catterick and Ty Gwyn in north Wales&#151;other options include counselling and therapy, which should be available through the NHS but so rarely are. As I understand it, there are only 14 locations where counselling can be given to those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The gap must be bridged by the voluntary sector. In fact, it is bridged very successfully by such groups as Assist, in my constituency, which does a fantastic job in trauma management. I invite the Minister and all those involved in drafting the mental health Bill to consider what can be done to weight the services available to those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder in favour of therapy and access to counselling, either in person or by telephone, in order to ensure that people have early access to support, which they, and we, will find valuable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_164">The firefighter to whom I referred calculated the costs to the taxpayer of his six years&#039; absence from work. He has recently felt able to return to work, and has done so, as a result of counselling provided by Assist which cost &#163;1,000. The Government could profitably consider such approaches to looking after those who have served us so well and ensure that they receive the care and support to which they are fully entitled. All Members will rightly express outrage when members of the armed services and the emergency services who have suffered serious physical injury do not receive the care to which we and they believe that they are entitled. It is surely right that those who suffer mental injury as a result of the same activities on our behalf should receive similar consideration.

<a name="stpa_166">It has been a good debate, but primarily it has been good to have a debate because we have not had one on the subject for more than eight and a half years, despite the fact, as everyone has acknowledged, that the subject is extremely important and affects so many of our constituents. We know that one in four people will suffer some form of mental illness in their lives&#151;people from all backgrounds&#151;and one in 10 school-age children will be affected by some form of mental illness. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North mentioned the importance of early intervention, for young people in particular, which is lacking in too many places.

<a name="stpa_167">Thirty per cent. of all GP consultations have a significant mental health component.

<a name="stpa_168">I agree. The Healthcare Commission inspections last year found that standards in NHS mental hospitals were markedly poorer.

<a name="stpa_169">The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 depression will be the leading cause of disability and the second biggest contributor to illness in the developed world, after heart disease.

<a name="stpa_170">Despite all the evidence, mental health merited just a passing reference amounting to two and a half pages in the 2004 White Paper on health and is virtually absent from last week&#039;s White Paper. The Government promised to update mental health legislation and bring the 1983 Act in line with new practices and treatments in the 21st century, but that Bill remains in doubt, despite the publication of the original draft Bill in June 2002 and a second draft in September 2004, and the scathing report of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee last year. There are real doubts whether we will see the Bill this Session, as the Government promised.

That is why we produced a separate, detailed mental health manifesto at the last election, contrary to the impression given by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier).

We need to examine the issue of mental health holistically. Of all the areas in health care, mental health provision needs a joined-up approach, which has too often been missing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_172">Many hon. Members mentioned funding. Investment in mental health has risen, but not to the level needed to implement the NSF. It has not kept pace with rises in the NHS budget generally. There are serious worries that mental health trusts will bear the brunt of the current deficit crisis, just as the new mental health trusts inherited many of the worst overdrafts after the last restructuring of services&#151;a point mentioned by the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). The near-zero figure suggested by the Minister turned into 10 per cent. in his county, Oxfordshire. That was reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). There have been significant cuts, leading to the diminution of services, and the cuts are not of the order of the very small snapshot amount contrived by the Minister. That is the reality of the services that our constituents are trying to access with increasing difficulty across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_173">Expenditure on day services for mental health patients has fallen from &#163;176 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;149 million in 2003&#150;04, despite more people in the community needing those services. We have had many other examples from across the country. It is a false economy not to continue the investment in such services. That is why Conservatives want a fairer share of the health funding cake to be spent on mental health services. That might start to address the problem of stigma mentioned by so many hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_174">On choice and access, the Secretary of State has spoken much about the choice agenda in health, yet what choice is there, realistically, for mental health patients? The Government are bringing in the &quot;choose and book&quot; system, giving patients with physical health needs the opportunity to choose their hospital and treatment times, yet mental health is one of the few areas where that will not be introduced across the country. Too often, the only treatment available to patients is the GP&#039;s prescription, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) described so well.

<a name="60207-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_175">Can it be right that 40,000 children&#151;some as young as six&#151;and adolescents are prescribed anti-depressants each year? Those drugs are effective, and in many cases they may be appropriate, but are they not prescribed because alternative therapies are not available and doctors do not have time to tease out the more complicated symptoms that accompany mental health   problems? It is not like presenting with a broken   leg. More time is needed.As the Sainsbury centre and our own surveys report, many GPs complain that they have had no access to cognitive behavioural therapy. Elsewhere, patients can wait six months for basic counselling, and all the while their conditions deteriorate, yet we know that early intervention is key.

Worse, they have pronounced medical conditions. A schizophrenic is likely to have a life expectancy 10 years shorter than the average one of us. They are twice as likely to die from respiratory infections. Like everyone else, they suffer those diseases, but they frequently complain that they are labelled primarily as mental health patients when they visit their GP and are treated differently.

It is a false economy not to do so, yet it does not feature in the &quot;healthy schools&quot; programme.

Perhaps if we start to address those problems, we can start to remove the stigma that still attaches to mental health issues.

<a name="stpa_190">I turn to the points raised in the debate. I agree with the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) that it is important to integrate health and social care budgets. The White Paper sets that out very clearly. We can do plenty more work in that area, which creates opportunities for innovation and imagination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Members for Northavon and for Banbury (Tony Baldry) talked about GPs. Practice-based commissioning will help GPs to manage more effective care pathways and allow primary care trusts to commission new services on behalf of GPs. Coupled with an enhanced role for GPs in managing mild to moderate depression in better monitoring mental health, we hope that this will create more flexibility and   incentives for GPs and PCTs to manage mental health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">The hon. Members for Northavon and for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) mentioned the new Bill. They are right to say that it will require a careful balance between a person&#039;s right to make decisions about themselves and society&#039;s duty to protect people with serious mental disorders from harming themselves, or occasionally others. We are confident that our Bill will achieve the right balance, but I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister listened carefully to the points made in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">Members asked about prisons as places of safety when there is a crisis situation. Last year, we announced &#163;130 million to help trusts to create proper places of safety for those who need a settlement under the Mental Health Act 1983 instead of relying on police cells or accident and emergency departments. There has been considerable work within A and E departments to improve the relationship with social services on quick referrals. On prison health, 360 mental health in-reach

<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 786</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>staff are in post, exceeding the commitment to 300 in the NHS plan. NHS mental health in-reach teams now provide services in 102 prisons. Again, there is progress but more to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Members for Banbury and for Cambridge (David Howarth) mentioned particular issues in Oxford and Cambridgeshire. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the three-star trust rating; I am glad to hear about that progress. Last week, the Department issued a set of financial rules for the next financial year, requiring local health economies to develop an operating surplus to create a buffer against unplanned financial problems. We will work hard with NHS bodies to ensure that good finances are in place over the next few years. If we act now, we will help to better protect mental health services against the pressures that some have faced this year. That is an important challenge that we must face up to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">The hon. Members for Cambridge and for Banbury asked about payment-by-results work for mental health. We agree that that is an important issue, and we are working hard to tackle it. We have set out our intention to pilot a new currency in 2007&#150;08, and the move to develop a tariff is being taken forward by the mental health team. We take the matter seriously, but we are not launching an untried system on mental health services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_196">The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) made an interesting speech in which he talked about the integrated delivery of care. That is indeed vital to good services for patients. However, he failed to talk about how in 18 years he missed the opportunity to put some of his ideas into practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_197">My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) made a good speech in which she acknowledged the investment and the changes in attitudes and culture when providing services. However, she was also challenging. We have asked Professor Louis Appleby to co-ordinate children, adult and elderly people&#039;s services. I believe that to be important. We have a national service framework for young people&#039;s mental health, which outlines standards for services and, indeed, sets world-class standards for their provision. Of course, we must ensure that they are delivered on the ground and we want the help of colleagues from all parties to hold agencies to account for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_198">My hon. Friend also made good points about women. We have issued guidance on ensuring that in-patient services are safe for women&#151;we take that seriously. My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Northavon made points about mixed-sex wards. Ninety-nine per cent. of wards are not mixed sex&#151;they have separate sleeping and bathroom facilities. However, we are working to improve matters. Sure Starts and refuges have an important role to play as first contacts for many women&#151;and their children&#151;who may suffer from mental health problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_199">I stress to the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton that we are spending &#163;60 million on pilots to protect older people&#039;s health and we are piloting new centres for older people&#039;s services, which will include work on tackling loneliness. She made a valid and interesting point.

<a name="60207-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_200">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) was right to say that we must tackle the problems of stigma that prevent people from getting work. I hope that we can consider better methods of challenging those problems through the pathways to work programme. She also made points about ethnic differences. The issues are complicated but we have done some work on examining the reasons for problems that mean that some people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are deterred from coming forward until their illnesses are more severe. I congratulate her area on tackling those problems, and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central has promised to visit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_201">The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) spoke about post-traumatic stress disorder. We acknowledge the importance of that work. We have evidence of what works from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and we have issued advice to all GPs in the NHS. That was invaluable in providing support for victims of recent tragedies such as the bombing on 7 July, when different agencies, including the voluntary sector, came together to help with the obvious need for counselling and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para16">
<a name="stpa_202">I shall not specifically answer the points of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) because, if he reads my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s opening speech, he will realise that she covered them. However, I stress that mental health has never been higher up any Government&#039;s agenda. The result has been record increases in investment and staffing. Thanks to the efforts of the staff, front-line services have become more responsive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-18_para17">
<a name="stpa_203">We remain some way from fulfilling all our ambitions but, based on what we have said today, I urge hon. Members to vote against the motion.

 My hon. Friend is making a strong case. Is there not a danger that the amalgamation of these trusts could impose a lot of extra administrative costs as a result of new logos, new staff&#151;owing to the need to employ regional and local people&#151;and new properties?

 My right hon. Friend is correct. There is always a transfer cost associated with any such move, but it is nonsense to incur such costs when there is no identifiable benefit, given that it will involve hard-pressed taxpayers&#039; money that is needed for front-line services.

 When the Conservatives were in power, we had 47 trusts in the Scottish health service. Under the Scottish reorganisation, that figure has been reduced to 15.

Changes to PCTs were expected to be completed by October 2006, and changes to SHAs by July 2006. On 1 December 2005, the Department of Health published the plans that had been submitted to it for consultation, including plans to reduce the number of PCTs to a minimum of 115, and to reduce the number of strategic health authorities to between nine and 11, along the lines of the Government offices for the regions.

 I gather that wards are also being closed in Northamptonshire. That situation is replicated right across the country.

She then told me that the situation was now reversed and that she was now lumbered with all the administration, because the Government are stealthily removing administrative support in an effort to avoid the charge that they are diminishing front-line services.

In the face of fierce opposition from NHS staff employed by PCTs, from MPs, and from the Royal College of Nursing&#151;which launched, but has now withdrawn, an application for judicial review of the decision&#151;the Government have since retreated from their strident position.

I have been contacted by GPs in my constituency who work within the Central Cheshire PCT and who are worried that that is the case.

With them, I favour Central Cheshire and Eastern Cheshire PCTs combining. They are also concerned, as are all Opposition Members, that those structural changes are a deliberate ploy by the Government to mask the consequences of deficits and their impact on patients.

 My hon. Friend is right.

The trust in Gloucestershire faces a cut of &#163;21 million&#151;a 7 per cent. reduction in its spending next year&#151;if it treats the same number and mix of patients and will face tremendous challenges that will lead to job losses.

Can anyone doubt that the Government are conducting a sham consultation on all these changes? Can it be in doubt that the Government will not break the habits of a lifetime, have no intention of respecting the consultation processes and certainly not the responses, and will press on with their proposals regardless of the responses received?

The Secretary of State has sent in turnaround teams to PCTs&#151;proof, if ever there was, of the failure of SHAs to oversee those trusts, and an immense additional and avoidable burden on the taxpayer. I would not mind the Government paying McKinsey were there no Merseyside and Cheshire SHA, but the imposition of KPMG on 18 trusts up and down the country at vast expense shows that the SHAs have not been doing their job. The taxpayer is paying twice over, and over the odds the second time: once for the SHA employees who are supposed to keep trust finances in order and once for the consultant to sort it all out. Surely the Department should ensure that it employs people who can do the job and sacks those who cannot. The turnaround programme is proof that SHAs are not up to it, that this three-year-old Government design has failed and that SHAs should therefore be scrapped. In any other walk of life, and under any other Government, it would be plain that SHAs have failed, and that some, such as Surrey and Sussex, have presided over an almost complete collapse in their health economy. We can, and should, dispense with SHAs. We just wonder whether the Government have the courage to take that obvious step.

<a name="stpa_234">We now come to the ambulance trusts. In June 2005, the Government&#039;s review of ambulance services, &quot;Taking Healthcare to the Patient&quot;, was published. It recommended a reduction in the number of NHS ambulance trusts from 31 to 28. However, on 14 December 2005, the Department of Health began consultation to reduce the number of NHS ambulance trusts to 11, aligned with Government office for the region boundaries. That consultation will close on 22 March. The <i>Health Service Journal</i> reported on 22 September 2005 that the Department of Health expects the changes to be in place by July&#151;a bit swift for a genuine consultation.

The Government took that as an excuse&#151;it was not in the report, and at best they might claim, as a cloak, that it was implied&#151;to reduce the number of ambulance trusts down to nine, 10 or 11. To implement that, the NHS Appointments Commission sent out letters on 30 January this year, to all MPs, I believe, asking for nominations for chairmen and chairwomen of the new NHS ambulance trusts. Do the Government think that we do not believe that the consultation is a foregone conclusion? Were the consultation genuine, money would not and should not be being spent now on the recruitment process; it is a highly questionable use of taxpayer&#039;s money.

It would be easier to know where we were going and settle all the boundaries if the Government were consistent about what the reorganisation is actually for. The primary care trusts were set up when the Government abolished GP fundholding. They then suggested that fewer PCTs were required to supervise practice-based budgeting, which is the same thing that they are going back to. They then 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Consulting in that confusion is quite impossible, which is why we have all the outrage about where the boundaries might go.

 I agree with a significant part of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said. If I can get to it, I will explain the reasoning behind the changes that we are bringing forward. I strongly disagree with him on one thing, on which I must pick him up. The only similarity between GP fundholding and practice-based commissioning is that it involves GPs. Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing in common between the two systems. Under fundholding, every GP could have a contract with any number of hospitals, wasting enormous amounts of clinical and administrative time in negotiations. Under practice-based commissioning, the PCT will hold the contract with the hospitals and the GPs will use that contract to access services for their patients. There is absolutely nothing in common between the discredited system that the Conservative party instituted and the system that we are taking forward.

<a name="stpa_253">Ninety per cent. of patients&#039; contact with the NHS is within primary care settings. About 900,000 people a day contact a GP or a practice nurse. The challenge now is to improve primary and community services. That is why last week we published the White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, setting out our plans to do that. It emphasises that good commissioning is essential to improving services for patients. That means that the NHS needs to get better at securing the best possible services, representing good value from a growing range of health care providers. Reforms such as patient choice and payment by results mean that individual decisions to refer and patient choice will in effect drive commissioning. Patients in discussion with their commissions will choose where they want to go for treatment. Payment by results ensures that the money follows the patient to pay for their care. Once established, the payment by results tariff offers the opportunity for adaptation to encourage alternatives to hospital referral.

: My right hon. Friend is a lady of tact and intelligence and she must know that that, frankly, is a load of nonsense. The reality is that if we move towards this system, the patient will have no way of knowing the quality of surgeon in a particular hospital, and no way of knowing who has the reputation for killing a quarter of his patients and who has the best outcomes. It is nonsense to suggest that patients will have any way of knowing. What they want are good services of a uniform standard in their own area. That is what they want and this division will make it worse.

 I am sorry that my hon. Friend, whom I regard as a very dear friend, takes such a strong opposite view to me. I do not agree with her. I believe that, increasingly, patients will want to know from their GPs the recovery rates for different surgeons and how they perform, as well as how, for example, a hospital performs on MRSA. Those are exactly the kind of questions that people will be asking. Increasingly, they will be able to get the information not only from their GP, but from the internet, where more and more hospitals are providing precisely that kind of information to the patients who receive services from them.

 My hon. Friend has made a sustained and consistent case for the ambulance trust that she knows so well. I repeat that no decision has yet been taken on the consultations that are taking place on PCTs, ambulance trusts or strategic health authority reform. I have heard my hon. Friend make that point on many occasions and we are listening to the representations that are being made. We know that there is more that ambulance trusts need to achieve if we are to realise our vision for ambulance services and integrated urgent care. To do this, we need organisations that have the capacity and capability to plan for tomorrow as well as to deal with today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_257">That is not achieved through small organisations struggling to deal with huge agendas, or through unnecessary duplication of procurement planning and support services. However, it can be achieved through collaboration and getting best value. This reconfiguration is about delivering for the taxpayer. It is about combining high-quality leadership with retaining the best of what can be delivered locally. It is not about change for change&#039;s sake.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_258">In the case of ambulance trusts, there was a clear view from stakeholders that the lack of coterminosity and the small size of some trusts were acting as barriers to improved patient care. This view was reflected in the recommendations of the recent ambulance service review. To achieve the change we are aiming for, we want SHAs to lead the process of reconfiguration locally. We have asked them to work with their local stakeholders, including MPs from both sides of the Chamber, and to put forward proposals for the reconfiguration of ambulance trusts, PCTs and SHAs against a set of national criteria.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the figures on which such amalgamation is based. My PCT is one of the most expensive in my area. In terms of management and administration, it costs &#163;27 a head for every man, woman and child in the area&#151;a sum far greater than that applying to other PCTs in the region. I cannot understand why the Department is still pressing ahead with a PCT that will cover nearly three quarters of a million people and all of south Staffordshire, given that the average figure for west midlands PCTs is 230,000. I am not opposed to any amalgamation that improves services, but I want to know what the criteria are and how they have been arrived at, and how we can provide an effective local service for people on this scale. My hon. Friend has yet to make the case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_189"><a name="60207-25_spnew9"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Obviously, there are one or two of my hon. Friends whom we need to work more closely with to persuade them of our case. One of the best ways to give patients more of a say in local services is to empower the health care professionals who are closest to the patients. Larger PCTs do not mean more remote PCTs. That is why practice-based commissioning is being rolled out alongside reconfiguration, giving GPs and primary care professionals more freedom to redesign better services for their patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_259">Strengthening local commissioning will mean that the money is spent in communities where there is greatest need, rather than being sucked into areas where the demand is more vocal. As was pointed out earlier, our proposed reconfiguring of organisations will strengthen relationships between health care professionals and local authorities through greater coterminosity. London boroughs and PCTs, for example, are bringing about genuine improvements in the delivery of primary and social care in the boroughs. Those improvements have been enabled by the coterminous arrangement of PCT boundaries with social service local boroughs. Currently, just over 40 per cent. of PCTs are coterminous with local government boundaries, and we expect that figure to rise to almost 80 per cent. as a result of the proposed changes in PCT boundaries.
</p>

<p>

 The point that the hon. Gentleman makes is not really very valuable. Benefits will flow from working more closely with other structures. For example, in the event of a very large incident, emergency response is enhanced when services have become used to working together and have developed working policies and protocols. Fewer, larger ambulance trusts will also make it simpler to build the effective relationships with stakeholders that are so important in successfully dealing with major incidents, and in providing the effective delivery of integrated, patient-centred health services.

 I am sure that today&#039;s Conservative Opposition day debate will give some flavour of the rapid structural changes that our national health service will go through in the coming years. The restructuring of primary care trusts has followed a very hasty timetable. That timetable was announced during last July&#039;s parliamentary recess, and the initial consultation period closed on 15 October. That is neither a long time, nor a particularly appropriate time for such consultation to take place. Let us not forget that this is the third restructuring in 10 years, and that it will reduce the number of PCTs from 300 to 100 by this October.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_262">Initially, the proposed changes were supposed to coincide with trusts shifting toward a commissioning, rather than provider, role. That led to outcry in this place, and to Adjournment debates initiated by Labour Members. There was also outcry from the 200,000 workers directly employed by PCTs, who suddenly did not know how much longer they would have a job, or who their employer would be. They did not know whether it would continue to be the PCT, or whether it would be a private sector charity or the voluntary sector. Following some rapid rowing back, the Secretary of State adopted a new position whereby PCTs would move to a commissioning role only as and when they decided to. However, the chief executive of the NHS has not formally withdrawn his reference, contained in his initial letter, to the 2008 deadline by which PCTs should move over fully to a commissioning role. I should be very grateful if the Minister clarified that contradiction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_263">There is still a lack of clarity as to the future function of our PCTs. However, the rationale behind the new structure seems clear: it is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but a case of &quot;any size, so long as it&#039;s bigger&quot;. This approach constitutes a move away from the rationale employed during the previous restructuring of PCTs, which took place only three years ago, whereby greater connection was sought with local communities. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 811</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Only an &quot;any size, so long as it&#039;s bigger&quot; rationale can explain why London&#039;s PCTs are expected to move from a structure that already provides coterminosity with social services to being even bigger beasts, while Cornwall looks set to have its three PCTs reduced to just one. That is indeed a move towards coterminosity, with local authorities providing social services; then again, the existing structures are under review, so the local authorities may in any event change shape. Their future remains in some doubt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_264">As if this dog&#039;s breakfast were not enough, ambulance trusts are also up for reconfiguration. The intention is not to improve services to the public, but to fit the &quot;any size, so long as it&#039;s bigger&quot; mantra by reducing the number of ambulance trusts from 31 to 11.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_265">Ignoring the principle of not fixing things if they are not broken, it seems that even the best-performing ambulance trusts&#151;such as the Staffordshire trust, which has a three-star rating and is the highest performing trust, according to Government targets&#151;are likely to be merged. As the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) said in her earlier intervention, it is not the size of the trust that determines how well it performs&#151;and is there any point in fixing something that is not broken? Surely the emphasis should be on co-operating and sharing best practice with other trusts, rather than on introducing the concept of contestability, which will put trusts in competition with one another.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_266">If the principle is to apply to PCTs and ambulance trusts, SHAs must automatically follow suit, according to the &quot;any size, so long as it&#039;s bigger&quot; mantra. They must go through similar upheavals, with the changes to be completed by April 2007.

<p><a name="st_197"><a name="60207-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree, given her experience in her own area, that PCTs had a difficult task in dealing with rural areas in particular, and that some have made a superb job of it? Mendip PCT, in my area, has really got to grips with delivering primary health care in a rural area. It is a great shame if that is now to be put at risk by reorganisation&#151;by putting the PCT into a bigger structure that simply will not have the same feel or be able to cope with the difficulties of scale associated with rural areas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="60207-26_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution, and that is certainly the feedback that I am getting from my constituents. In the past, there has been a very good relationship between the local PCT and the services offered. There is real concern that a move to a bigger authority will lead to the loss of links that have been built up in the past few years, and that that will have a detrimental impact on the services provided. However, only one proposal&#151;for a single primary care trust&#151;has been put forward for consultation, and the argument is that it will provide a more strategic role. If that is the case, why would we continue to need a strategic health authority?

<a name="stpa_269">When I talked with the chair of an NHS trust in my constituency last week, the point was made&#151;the Minister made it again today&#151;that this is not a time of evolution for the NHS, but a time of rapid and continual revolution. It is unclear what the NHS will look like when we reach the end of this year. A series of potentially destabilising changes will take place simultaneously in an already uncertain climate, in which a quarter of NHS trusts already have to deal with deficits. The impact of many of the changes, even if taken in isolation, is largely unknown because many have not been properly piloted. There has certainly been no piloting of the possible cumulative impact of the changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_270">For example, payment by results will start in the next financial year, but concerns are already being raised about the tariff levels for some operations. In Norway, a system of payment by results was introduced at 60 per cent., not for 100 per cent. of care, and it was seen to create perverse incentives, so it was scaled back to 40 per cent. But this Government think that the best approach is to introduce 100 per cent. payment by results straight off, and damn the consequences&#151;even if that may create even greater financial insecurity and instability for many trusts already struggling with deficits, and even if it will lead to incentives to give every headache patient a CT scan to add to their treatment. Such perverse incentives are like the small butterfly wings flapping that create a hurricane further down the line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_271">Another example of inadequate piloting before rolling out the changes can be seen in the new dental contract. We will not know what the impact of the new contract will be until it rolls out across the country, but I know from surveying dentists in my constituency that about 75 per cent. are thinking of leaving the NHS altogether as a result. That is another unknown factor to be added to an already unstable and high-risk situation. The changes look increasingly like ingredients for a rushed recipe for disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_272">Why the hurry and impatience from the Government? After all, they have had eight years to formulate a solution. Is it the funding time scale of increased investment in the NHS, and the looming end to increased investment in 2008, that is causing the panic? If the changes are not in place and bedded down by then, is their future success even more in doubt? Or is it the hurry to find those pesky efficiency savings demanded by the Gershon review? If so, it would explain the &quot;any size so long as it&#039;s bigger&quot; rationale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_273">Will the savings be real, or will many of them be lost in setting up and branding the new structures? Given that many PCT mergers will have to take place in mid financial year, has the Department made any assessment of the extra costs of having to file two separate accounts, or any of the other transition costs that will result from the changes?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_274">It is clear that it is not the wishes of the public that are driving the changes. That is evident from the amount of time given to consultation on the changes&#151;and often from what proposals are put forward for consultation. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="60207-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_275">The Secretary of State&#039;s own consultation in Birmingham also showed that the Government&#039;s priorities for the NHS were not those of the invited public. The citizens summit in Birmingham last year showed that the public were not interested in improving contestability or even the choice agenda&#151;especially in rural areas, where getting to the local hospital is already enough of a struggle for most people. What they were interested in was increased GP opening hours and out-of-hours provision, which the Government did away with in the most recent contract negotiations. Whatever the priorities of the public&#151;indeed, in spite of their needs and priorities&#151;the changes continue to be pushed apace.

What is even more ironic is that the Conservatives oppose the proposals that will take us back to the last days of their Government.

They are able to focus the NHS on a local area, more accurately assess local need, and receive fair funding provision based on applying the formula to a precise local area.

<a name="60207-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_282">Before I was elected, the provision of resources under the Suffolk health authority did not meet the needs of my area; we merely received a share of the Suffolk average and the needs and deprivation in our part of the county were not taken into account. That organisation was remote and out of touch. It instituted locality management, but that negated the savings that it claimed would be achieved. We ended up with bad relations between the health authority and the community, and even worse relations between the health authority and the medical professionals.

Since the trust was created, Waveney has worked closely with Great Yarmouth, even sharing the same chief executive for a time.

In fact, the strategic health authority encouraged that, recognising the area as a

When Sir Nigel Crisp&#039;s letter arrived last July, asking PCTs to come up with proposals, everybody locally thought that Yarmouth and Waveney was a no-brainer, and the other PCTs in the respective counties were comfortable with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_284">Some time last summer, however, another message came from the centre, which seemed to be talking about county-wide PCTs&#151;the proposal that the SHA made to the Secretary of State, despite representations against it. Because of the strength of our cross-party case and the willingness of the Secretary of State to listen, we now have two options, and there is no doubt that the Yarmouth and Waveney proposal is the healthy option. Those neighbouring areas have similar characteristics, including deprivation factors and health inequalities. They are both very different from their respective counties, from which they are relatively isolated. We share the same general hospital&#151;the James Paget hospital, a three-star trust that is about to achieve foundation status. We have a natural health economy; the two PCTs have for some time undertaken joint working on cancer networks, emergency care and the implementation of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence policy, and share some services and a director of public health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_285">Yarmouth and Waveney has sub-regional status in the eastern region, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently created an urban regeneration company spanning the two areas, part of whose remit is a public health agenda to overcome deprivation. The company wants to work with a Yarmouth and Waveney PCT rather than dealing with the separate counties. Both trusts are performing well, with two-star ratings&#151;the best in the area. Yarmouth&#039;s budget is in balance. Waveney&#039;s budget is close to balance, and KPMG concluded that the trust would be out of deficit next year. Most important, the two PCTs work closely with GPs; there is a 100 per cent. sign-up to practice-based commissioning, which will not happen under a county-wide PCT.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_286">A Yarmouth and Waveney PCT would have to work with the two county council social care departments, but that is not a problem. It is already happening; both councils organise their social care on a locality basis, each matching the Yarmouth and the Waveney PCT areas. There is already a strong record of partnership, with joint and developing initiatives, integrated management arrangements and integrated services under section 31 agreements, and each county leads for the other; for example, Norfolk provides social care services for Suffolk at the James Paget hospital. Social care is not a problem, and as those departments become less and less of a provider, patient choice will take patients from my area across the county boundary.

<a name="stpa_287">The proposed PCT would be large enough to realise economies of scale.

<a name="stpa_288">The people who know&#151;GPs&#151;wholly contradict that; they say that the county-wide option would inhibit that development. There were questions about size, but smaller PCTs in other parts of the country are proposed as single options. We should not fall foul of the size rule.

It is hard to find anybody locally who does not support the proposal. Will my hon. Friend keep faith with the local community and the medical professionals who serve it?

 I entirely agree with what the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) said, and commend him for it. The joint cross-party arrangements show how strongly we feel. I have to depart from the hon. Gentleman, however, when I talk about the strategic health authority. Five Members of Parliament for Suffolk invited their SHA to answer a series of questions, as you will know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because you were there. The questions were answered in two ways: the SHA could not help, either because the decision was a Government one or because it was a PCT one.

<a name="stpa_292">There was no question to which the SHA replied, &quot;Yes, we can do that.&quot; It cannot do anything. There is no known position on which the SHA contributes at all.

The fact that the SHA was unable to do that shows that SHAs have no purpose whatever.

<p>
<a name="60207-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_293">My PCT is very much in debt, as are all the Suffolk PCTs except Waveney. One of the reasons for that debt is that on average, under the funding formula, for every 100p we receive 90p, while Manchester receives 124p,

<a name="stpa_294">The unfortunate changes in the way that the funds are doled out have hit rural areas with large numbers of old people. Because of those numbers we used to receive sufficient funding, but that is no longer the case.

That has happened since the election.

<a name="stpa_295">Interestingly enough, before the election, we were told that a reorganisation would take place and a perfectly reasonable plan was proposed that would improve patient care. I supported that plan. I took the chair of the meeting to encourage people who had doubts about it that that was the reasonable thing to do. Immediately after the election, it was announced that that plan was no good and that those involved had found a new model of patient care. That happened in two months&#151;it was a very clever, speedy change&#151;and during that time, PCT announced that their new model patient plan involved the closure of one hospital and the halving of the other. That was an interesting decision, but we were told that it had nothing to do with money or the general election.

 I cannot speak about Huntingdonshire, but it is clearly a sham when we always have the same answers. Let us take the regionalisation of the ambulance service. Is it not amazing? We ask those in the charge of the police, and curiously enough, they suggest the regions as the natural way of policing. We ask people about the fire service, and curiously enough, a whole lot of other people make exactly the same proposal&#151;that for the fire service, the region is the ideal unit. We then ask the ambulance people&#151;well, we do not ask too many of them, but we ask those who might come to an answer&#151;and what do they say? Surprisingly enough, they think that the regions are the answer. We then to the SHA, and it says that regions are the answer.

Half of them no longer took NHS patients or had closed their books, and the other half of them were in Frinton. He had not noticed that there is a river between us and Frinton, so instead of the dentists being 10 miles away, they were 45 miles away, unless people can swim. That shows the Government&#039;s understanding of my locality.

One of the PCTs covered fewer than 70,000 people. All the other north Cumbria Members disagreed with me, as did all the district councils and the county council, but in 18 months, instead of having three management teams, it was decided that there would be one management team and three trusts. We thus have the nonsense at the moment of having three chairs of trusts&#151;one for west Cumbria, one for Carlisle and one for Eden&#151;and those trusts&#039; non-executive members, but one management team. It cost millions of pounds to make the change, but it caused tremendous confusion about which PCT was responsible for which service because, for example, Carlisle and District PCT could end up being responsible for services in west Cumbria. That is why I support the reorganisation.

However, everyone knows that two-tier local government is to be reformed, so we could end up in three years&#151;this is a 50:50 bet&#151;having created a PCT for Cumbria that is not conterminous with the new local government boundaries, which would not make any sense.

The ambulance service will be merged, too. I have been to see the chair of my local ambulance trust and the chair of the control. They are not concerned because they believe that being part of a big consortium will create greater buying power, so the service will be able to get the equipment that it has been lacking under the present scheme and thus be brought up to the standard that exists in the rest of the north-west. I do not buy the idea that there is an issue about mergers. If it was left to some hon. Members, we would still have the old county borough of Carlisle ambulance station.

There used to be a thing called the RAWP, or resource allocation working party, formula&#151;only two people understood it, and one of them was mad&#151;and that never gave us adequate money.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In fact, the service&#039;s use of those drugs is beyond the normal clinical protocols for the national ambulance services. Staffordshire ambulance service can also provide angioplasty, and through cardiac enzyme testing, which is generally not available elsewhere, it can manage patients with chest pain who are not transported to hospital. There is even a cooling protocol for those with post-cardiac arrest, to stop brain damage and other tissue damage. That is unique, yet the Government, either wittingly or unwittingly, are to destroy it.

<a name="stpa_324">The response to life-threatening emergencies within eight minutes in Staffordshire is a staggering 88 per cent. The NHS average is only 75 per cent. In the east midlands, where there has been a merged ambulance service, it is only 75 per cent. These are Department of Health figures. For category B, which are serious emergency call-outs, in Staffordshire the response is within eight minutes 85 per cent. of the time. In the west midlands it is only 46 per cent. of the time, and in the east midlands, the model for a regional system of ambulance services, it is only 27 per cent. of the time. Any doctor will tell you that time is life. There is a golden period in which, perhaps, someone can be rescued from death. The Staffordshire ambulance service succeeds in that while other ambulance services fail.

If it were a regional-based system that could improve response times, that would be fine by me. I would not care if a regional system were best. If it were larger than a region, that would be fine. I am interested in only one thing, and that is a better service for my constituents. What is clear from looking at the east midlands model and from listening to the professionals in Staffordshire and, indeed, in Birmingham and the west midlands as a whole, is that the fine, high standards maintained in Staffordshire would be lost, and that that would result in lives being lost in Staffordshire and elsewhere.

I shall not reel off reams of statistics, but spending on the NHS in North Staffordshire has almost doubled since 1997. Like for like, it has increased from &#163;267 million in 1997 to &#163;521 million today&#151;a 95 per cent. increase. There is not a single MP who has not seen the benefits of such investment through their constituency casework&#151;shorter waiting lists, fewer complaints about delays in treatment and even the odd thank-you once in a while.

New health centres are bringing better NHS care right to people&#039;s doorsteps in Newcastle, as elsewhere in the country. Of course, not everything in the garden is rosy. Like any company, a huge organisation such as the NHS always faces challenges in managing that investment, not least in the face of constant organisational change. The PCTs in my area and the university hospital of North Staffordshire face varying degrees of deficit, despite the increase in spending. That is a pressing management issue but it is important to keep the scale of the problems in perspective. There should be no short-term panic measures conflicting with investment to meet long-term need.
</p>

<a name="60207-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_334">In our area, we were happy to hear from the new management at the hospital last week that plans for our brand-new hospital remain on track&#151;and rightly so, if I may be partisan for a moment as we approach the 100th anniversary of the parliamentary Labour party.

<a name="stpa_335">Aside from painful decisions about costs and deficits, there is little more disruptive and demoralising than constant, continual reorganisation, not least when the benefits are unproven, the perception is of change for change&#039;s sake, and the end result may be a reduction in standards, a loss of responsiveness and a more impersonal service in our much-envied NHS. That is where we stand in Staffordshire in respect of proposals to merge the county ambulance service into one super-organisation in the west midlands covering over 5 million people and over 6,000 square miles in all.

Over 3,000 residents from the villages signed a petition that I presented to the Secretary of State before Christmas. Many of them turned out last night, too, at a packed public consultation meeting in Newcastle about the changes, to support the continued operational independence at the very least of the Staffordshire ambulance service.

<a name="stpa_339">The second occasion was for an emergency with my family here in London before Christmas. In the early hours of the morning, I called the London ambulance brigade not once, not twice, but three times. Each time, I was held up at the call centre with the same pre-recorded message: &quot;We apologise. We are experiencing unprecedented demand for our services.&quot; When I got through the third time, the operator told me that they had no record of the first two calls&#151;&quot;Probably because we get so many hoaxes,&quot; she said. The air, I am afraid to say, by this time was blue. That is one of the reasons that I have not complained. I would be very embarrassed to listen to the tape recordings. We got to the hospital eventually by minicab. I know that that night, the London ambulance service did not return calls to my mobile and no ambulance ever arrived at my house.

Those concerns are heightened by the fact that, despite the widespread campaign in the west midlands by our strategic health authority, there is only one option on the table in this consultation, and we are all politicians enough to know what a shortlist of one really means. We need guarantees about the operational independence of Staffordshire ambulance service.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_341">Primary care trusts are the bodies that we set up just over three years ago to make the NHS more local, more responsive and therefore, in everyday terms, more efficient in meeting local needs. Here, I am glad to say that we have had more success, with the Department&#039;s help, in making the consultation more meaningful. Instead of just one option, we have two: one for the whole of Staffordshire bar Stoke-on-Trent and one, bringing me even closer in my tryst with my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, for a merger of our two local PCTs.

I must acknowledge the help of Ministers in the Department, who had to remind the SHA of its duty to be fair and balanced in consultation. Nevertheless, as appeared to be the case in Waveney and Great Yarmouth, it had to be dragged kicking and screaming. It was not good enough to sing the praises of option 1&#151;the super-sized approach&#151;while adding a grudging PS in the first draft of the document: &quot;By the way, here&#039;s option 2, which all the local people, voluntary groups, professionals and medics in north Staffordshire support, but we think is rubbish.&quot;

Colleagues in the south and east of the county are also balking at being thrown into one super-PCT, and we will support them as they develop their proposals. One of the non-sequiturs used by the proponents of a super-sized PCT for the whole of Staffordshire is that outside the northern sub-region, which is identifiable in its need, there is no coherent health community. That is clearly designed to set one part of the county against another. It is, of course, patent nonsense to suggest that it is better to have one super-sized PCT covering

From my experience, I wish that Staffordshire social services was shaken up to be just as responsive as my local PCT. That is what the county now says that it is going to do by restructuring it to follow our district boundaries. That remains to be done. The county still has to prove that it can get it right. To use that to justify shuffling the NHS furniture into one super-sized option at the same time defies common sense, particularly given that the PCTs in Newcastle and Moorlands already work well together, and with Stoke. They are getting things right, yet follow two discrete district boundaries.
</p>

<a name="stpa_345">Other claims have been made for a single PCT, but again without evidence. First, it is said that, by being bigger, it will assist the new practice-based commissioning. There are smaller PCTs in the region and that argument of convenience simply does not hold water. Secondly, it is said that a super-sized option will save on the costs of bureaucracy. That is unproven. The SHA, unable to produce the costings, has recently admitted that the two options would be financially neutral.

<p>
<a name="60207-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_346">That brings me to my concluding observation about the driving force behind the reorganisation&#151;cost savings. Of course we must direct more resources to the front line&#151;we made a manifesto commitment to save &#163;250 million through &quot;further streamlining&quot;&#151;but we must do it intelligently. It is not good enough simply to shake up SHAs, PCTs and ambulance services and say to each of them, &quot;This is your &#163;X million share of the cost savings to bear.&quot; It is not good enough for our regional health authority to say from on high, &quot;This is the only option.&quot; Like other Members, my target has been the approach adopted by the SHA. I am grateful for the help that has been given by the Department in the consultation on PCTs. On that basis, I will support the Government tonight, but they must continue to listen and learn from the profound concerns that have been expressed throughout this debate.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_347">Before I became a Member of Parliament in 1992, there was a West Suffolk health authority. We were told that a pan-Suffolk health authority was essential on the grounds of economies of scale, procurement, minimising overlapping and so on. Somehow it was deemed to be the right way to go. A few years ago, we were told that that was all wrong and that we had to have primary care trusts because decisions had to be made more locally and be more attuned to the circumstances of the area. They had to be made closer to the patient.However, a huge error was made. In a county the size of Suffolk, which has a population of only 683,000, no fewer than five PCTs were created, all with expensive chief executives and staff, despite the opposition of Members of Parliament, councillors and health professionals. The Government ignored all their advice. The PCTs were introduced in 2002 and we were told that it would take 18 months to assimilate the reforms. We were supposed to experience the benefits only 18 months afterwards. I say with great regret that there have been few benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_348">The new proposals go full circle, back to a pan-Suffolk health authority. Goodness knows the amount of taxpayers&#039; money that has been wasted in getting back to the future, but the problem is not organisational. As we know from the consultation process, which has elicited responses from throughout the county, the problem is the operation of the funding formula. The Under-Secretary shakes his head, so I shall spell out the matter clearly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_349">After the first change was made in 1998, I went to the then Secretary of State for Health and pointed out its likely effect on rural areas, especially those with an ageing population. Since 2001, no fewer than four changes have taken place. Suffolk West PCT has the third worst audited deficit in the country and is &#163;13.7 million in debt. West Suffolk hospital, the biggest hospital in the area, is running a deficit of &#163;11.3 million this financial year. The total deficit in the county of Suffolk is &#163;35 million. For the strategic health authority area, it is a gargantuan &#163;85 million. That is the heart of the problem and it springs substantially from the change in the formula for NHS per capita spending, which has discriminated against an essentially rural area with an ageing population. No organisational changes in the county will remedy that.

There was complete complacency in that meeting. The Members of Parliament present understood what was going on, but the SHA representatives seemed to have no grip of the situation. How could that be? Their function was inexplicable to all of us.

<a name="stpa_352">By June, the SHA had a new chief executive because the previous one resigned, as did the chairman. When its representatives came up to the House of Commons, their attitude was that we Members of Parliament were being somewhat hysterical, and that the problem that concerned us so much did not exist. However, they had changed their tune when we had another meeting last month. There was a sense of desperation in the SHA management, amid concerns that it might not be possible for Suffolk&#039;s NHS trusts even to meet their national insurance and tax liabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_353">As the SHA has overseen the development of such problems, my colleagues on the Front Bench are right that it should be abolished. It has no clear function whatsoever. The SHA&#039;s chief executive earns &#163;145,000 a year, and the directors of performance and of service modernisation&#151;what a wonderful euphemism&#151;both earn more than &#163;100,000. Its clinical director gets &#163;150,000 and the chief executive of the work force development confederation &#163;100,000. If those people are being paid such sums to look after three counties, goodness knows what will happen if their responsibilities extend to six. Will they get a proportionate increase in pay? It is no wonder that people feel that the NHS is being undermined by a level of expensive bureaucracy that is not appropriate for its task.

<a name="stpa_354">Suffolk is a rural county, and my constituency of West Suffolk gets &#163;1,156 per capita in health service funding. The Prime Minister&#039;s constituency gets &#163;1,576, and the Secretary of State&#039;s Leicester, West constituency gets &#163;1,428. The Minister of State&#039;s constituency, Doncaster, Central, gets &#163;1,489, while the national average is &#163;1,388. If the county of Suffolk received even the national average, we would not be facing the current crisis. The same is true right across the south and south-east of the country.

<a name="60207-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_355">Of course I accept that there have been medical improvements and huge technological advances over the past few years.

The White Paper mentions various much cherished and valuable community services but they are now under threat, with rehabilitation beds already being closed down.

They are anxious about NHS provision in the area and about the stories that their parishioners tell them. The state of the health service is such that they feel compelled to place petitions about it in their churches and places of worship. The situation is terrible.

<a name="60207-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_357">Amalgamation may offer some managerial advantage, but the Government must address the problem of funding and deal with the dead hand of the SHAs by abolishing them. Unless those steps are taken, the NHS will never deliver proper value.

<br>&nbsp;<br>general comments. We in this House agree that we must ensure that NHS funding is used most effectively on the front line, but we must also accept that we cannot preserve the service in aspic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_358">At the risk of mixing my metaphors and similes, we might compare the NHS with a supertanker. A vessel that is so big can turn only very slowly, and in the same way change in the NHS must involve many incremental alterations. I shall offer another illustration: if the NHS were a country, the size of its budget means that it would bear comparison with Poland. It is important that we recognise that the NHS needs to change; the question is how those changes are brought about and implemented. We also need quality management and good administrators in the NHS, and we need to value those support staff. Equally, we need to test every pound that goes into the health service to ensure that we get best value for patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_359">The Conservatives devalue some of their arguments by suggesting that everything in the NHS was wonderful before 1997, and that it has all become terrible since then. That is contradicted by the Fenton health centre, which has just been opened in my constituency, and by the Willow Bank surgery, which opened about a year ago in Longton. It is also contradicted by all the additional doctors and nurses that we now have.

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="60207-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson  (Peterborough) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that between 1979 and 1997, there was a 64 per cent. real-terms increase in funding for the NHS, and that &#163;1 million was spent on a capital project in the NHS for every week of every year of that Conservative Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_225"><a name="60207-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that interesting intervention. The revenues from North sea oil would have funded a new hospital roughly every week during that time, yet there were no new hospitals built until we came into Government. Constituencies such as mine saw no infrastructure changes of any note in the period that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) made the point that there has been a 95 per cent. increase in NHS funding in the past few years, thanks to the new investment that is going in. It is disingenuous of the Conservatives to suggest that everything was perfect before 1997 but not since; the opposite is in fact the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_360">There are two primary care trusts in Stoke-on-Trent&#151;North Stoke and South Stoke. They were, de facto, merging; they were working together more closely all the time. To suggest having a single PCT for the whole city therefore makes a lot of sense. It is simply making a reality of what was happening anyway. I pay tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) on these issues, but there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the appropriate options are put in place for the rest of Staffordshire and that they are able to be introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_361">We need to recognise, however, that the existing system is not the most effective.

<a name="stpa_362">That brings me to the subject of strategic health authorities. The system of consultation has not been open or accessible to the people of Staffordshire; it has not been working. The SHA in charge of putting that consultation system together has done a splendid job, if I can put it like that, of obfuscating and making a mess of the whole thing. If that is its role, heaven help us, but I hope that it will have a much more positive one in future. One such role might be in the managing and integration of services, involving not only the PCTs but social services in coterminous areas. The SHA could have a role to play there.

 Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how expanding a PCT or an SHA to cover a much wider region would make it easier to persuade it to consult and carry out its work properly? Surely that would be a move in the wrong direction.
</p>





<p><a name="st_227"><a name="60207-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 No, I think that the opposite is the case. In north Staffordshire at the moment, there are about a dozen primary care trusts going off in all directions. However, a much smaller number would be able to focus much more closely on a hospice such as the Donna Louise Trust, for example, and address its funding in a much more focused way.
</p>





<p><a name="st_228"><a name="60207-32_spnew2"><b> Rosie Cooper  (West Lancashire) (Lab):</b> 
 Widening SHA areas to a regional authority area would resolve some serious anomalies. In my area of west Lancashire, for instance, PCTs are responsible to the Cumbria and Lancashire SHA, while the hospitals are responsible to the Cheshire and Merseyside SHA, which is an absolute nonsense. The reality is that the challenge for the Government is to make PCTs big enough to be strong commissioners and for there to be a tension in the system, and small enough to be absolutely responsive to the needs of local areas. The size of an organisation should not be easily dismissed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_229"><a name="60207-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I am grateful for that intervention, as it brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) about the idea that one size is okay as long as it is bigger. That is not what this is about. The issue is not one size; it is what is an appropriate size for merging PCTs. I hope that the consultation, once the SHAs get their paws off it, will be about making sure that PCTs are the right size for the localities concerned.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 832</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>years ago by someone who was at that time a manager in the health service, and that relates to my observation about the comments of Opposition Members that everything was rosy up to 1997. That point was that NHS managers had for so many years been used to try to save money, cut budgets and reduce funding, that they did not necessarily have the expertise to apply the huge amount of money that they were suddenly given. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will return to that point in her wind-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_364">Many comments have been made about the ambulance service. The hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) and some of my hon. Friends have rehearsed the arguments in relation to Staffordshire very well. A couple of points have not been mentioned. As everyone knows, the M6, which has perhaps more cars on it than any other road in western Europe, gets very congested from time to time, notably on Friday evenings. It only takes a fairly small incident for the motorway to become closed. Frequently, when it is closed or subject to huge delays, some drivers using that motorway are taken ill. One of the things that the Staffordshire ambulance service has been used for in the past&#151;which, as I understand it, it would not be able to do under the proposals&#151;is ferrying off the motorway people who have been taken ill or diabetics who must eat at certain times of the day and suddenly find themselves stuck in traffic for three or four hours and not able to eat. They can be moved off the motorway to a place where they can receive suitable treatment or be treated at the roadside. That is an important role, which shows the innovation and dedication in Staffordshire ambulance service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_365">Comments were also made about fast access and survival rates. In certain parts of the country&#151;I will not name them, for fear of upsetting residents of those areas&#151;if someone is taken ill with something like a heart attack, he or she has no chance of survival because the ambulance services there do not bring anybody to hospital alive in such circumstances, whereas in Staffordshire one has a very good chance of survival.
</p>





<p><a name="st_232"><a name="60207-32_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 I am listening intently to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s eloquent speech expressing his sincerely held beliefs. Does he agree that one of the problems with the mergers is that we have had, in effect, phoney consultations? In my area of the eastern region, under the auspices of the NHS Appointments Commission, a chairman&#039;s post was advertised a full nine weeks before the public consultation ends. Does he not agree that that undermines public confidence in the efficacy of such public consultation?
</p>

<a name="stpa_366">Today the Staffordshire <i>Sentinel</i> reported that the chief executive of the local ambulance service had suggested that he should form a private company. No doubt that would pose ideological problems for some Members, who would not want a private sector organisation to be funded through the NHS, although it had done such a fantastic job in the past. That would cause some angst to us on the Labour Benches.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_368">The Government frequently say that they want a patient-led NHS. The consultation document in my area on the mergers of PCTs bears the sub-heading &quot;Ensuring a patient-led NHS&quot;. My understanding of that phrase seems rather different from the Government&#039;s. It is a glib phrase that sounds good, but to me it really means something: it means that the views of patients and the public are listened to, valued and acted on. Those views should be picked up from a wide variety of sources&#151;independent patient groups, independent patient forums, GP practice participation groups, overview and scrutiny committees and&#151;as the Minister said&#151;health professionals, who have the closest contact with patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_369">To be fair to the Government, they have tried to listen to people. They organised a large listening event in Birmingham&#151;a 1,000-person citizens summit.

One question, about the shifting of care, asked
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;To what extent do you support or oppose providing more services closer to home including community hospitals, if this means that some larger hospitals concentrate on specialist services and some merge or close?&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_370">Of course, not many would vote against that proposal, but if people had been given the extra information that in losing those hospitals they would probably lose their local accident and emergency departments, the answer would have been very different.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_371">If ever there was a top-down proposal, this is it. It is the very antithesis of a patient-led decision. It is the Department of Health leaning on strategic health authorities, which are leaning on the trusts beneath them to do, in effect, the Government&#039;s bidding for reasons that are largely financial and&#151;as the Health Committee&#039;s report shows&#151;open to very serious question. We should think of the 19 or 20 SHA chief executives and the 200 or so PCT chief executives who are likely to lose their jobs. They are like turkeys planning for Christmas. How can they plan for the future when they know that they are not part of it? How can they be accountable for what they are planning when they are no longer there?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_372">Incidentally, when those chief executives have left they may well be paid by the taxpayer if past experience is anything to go by. Take the example of Finnamore Management Consultants, who are used, I believe, quite widely by the NHS to address some of the deficits. If we look them up on the web, the vast majority of their staff are ex-NHS managers. Presumably, they were made redundant. They may even have been sacked, or changed jobs for higher salaries.

<a name="stpa_377">Many hon. Members have examined the main reasons for mergers. The financial argument does not stand up. As I have said, the Health Committee expressed doubt about that. Restructuring involves redundancies and structures to secure local involvement&#151;but those will be incredibly costly. Another argument is that mergers strengthen the commissioning function. That is already happening. The Minister mentioned collaboration, but collaboration is already happening. For a good example, one has to look only at <i>Whitehall & Westminster World</i>, which I am sure we all read. The current edition describes a national decontamination project. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;Collaborations of up to 8 trusts are now in process and every strategic health authority has signed off a local plan which is consistent with the national plan.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_389">I understand that because of the reorganisation, the pathway project in Leicester is now on hold. That means that the investment of &#163;761 million that was to be made in the NHS in Leicester will not now take place. That means that we will not get a new Leicester general hospital, nor the extra cancer facilities that we were promised, nor the new children&#039;s hospital, which was to be based in Glenfield, in the constituency of my right hon.

That is a worry to my constituents and me, because we believe that the Government are absolutely sincere in their commitment to spending money on the NHS and spending it wisely.

<a name="stpa_390">In addition to the pathway project, other hospitals will also be put on hold. I know that a similar decision has been taken at Barts, for example. I was telephoned yesterday by one of the Barts consultants, who is very concerned that the Leicester changes are being linked to what is happening in other parts of the country. So when the Minister responds, I hope that he can reassure me that the proposed reorganisation of Leicester PCTs&#151;I understand the arguments in favour of such reorganisation, but it needs better justification&#151;will not in any way affect the additional money coming in. I know that some of my colleagues do not favour private finance initiatives&#151;they believe that they will somehow prove unhelpful to local people&#151;but I favour them, because I will get a new hospital out of such expenditure.

I lost that election by 60,000 votes, however, so it is a part of my life that I do not care to remember. The situation in the hon.

I telephoned the ambulance service and asked it to send an ambulance to take him from the crematorium literally down the road to Glenfield hospital, which is one of the finest hospitals in the country. I offered to take him in my car, but I was asked by the ambulance service operator not to do so unless I was a doctor, which clearly I am not. I said, &quot;I am not a doctor, I am a Member of Parliament, so could you please send the ambulance as quickly as possible.&quot; An hour later, the ambulance still had not arrived.

When I spoke to the chair and chief executive of the organisation and asked how they intended to restrict emergency services, the answer was frightening. They want GPs to keep patients with them for longer before calling an ambulance to send them to hospital. I asked what would happen if I were a parent with a child with suspected viral meningitis. What should the GP do in such circumstances? The answer was that they would like the GP to make sure that the child really had the illness. Whereas previously, a GP would dial 999 and have the child sent straight to hospital, now the PCT wants the GP to hang on to the patient.

At the moment, the SHAs&#039; ability to be strategic&#151;whatever that means&#151;must be constrained by their preoccupation in areas such as mine with financial deficits. Of course, there will be some benefits to all of this: the perpetual merging, axing and reforming of health bodies is a fantastic way to blur accountability. People who have tried to identify those who should be held to account for deficits know that very well.

<a name="stpa_413">We have a number of questions, some of which have been fielded already in today&#039;s debate, and we would like the Minister to answer them. First, we would like to know what the Minister intends that PCTs will be doing in the future because that is far from clear. What will be the residual provider function of PCTs? In the summer, &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot; said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;the direction of travel is clear: PCTs will become patient-led and commissioning-led organisations with their role in provision reduced to a minimum.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_414">However, the Secretary of State, Sir Nigel Crisp and Mr. John Bacon then issued contradictory interpretations of what that meant. The confusion has caused real discomfort to NHS staff who are employed directly by primary care trusts. Furthermore, it has made a complete mockery of the restructuring exercise. How can an organisation possibly be restructured if the people at the top do not have the first idea what that organisation will be doing? If Ministers want to use the private sector more&#151;they say that they do&#151;what message do they think that the vacillation will send to non-NHS providers that are possible partners? It will suggest unreliability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_415">Ministers might say that PCTs will be commissioning care, but how will they do so when patients are free to choose and book? I have to say that under our proposals, they would be even freer to choose the treatment that they receive and where it is received. If PCTs are largely divested of provider and commissioning functions, will they not simply become GPs&#039; account clerks? If so, will they be further reconfigured to reflect a new vestigial role? If that is not the case, how will we manage the split between providers and commissioners in the new organisations? It seems to me that Ministers are extremely unclear about that point, so any clarity that the Minister can give us today would be most welcome.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 842</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>commissioning? Does the Prime Minister in fact know full well that abolishing fundholding was foolish and recognise that practice-based commissioning is the closest approximation that he will get without primary legislation and the embarrassment of a complete about turn?

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para21">
<a name="stpa_417">The Government&#039;s interpretation of the dubious consultation exercise &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot; was different from mine and that of several hon. Members who contributed to the debate and people elsewhere. Will the Minister admit the extent to which the consultation was bent to the purpose that had already been devised by his colleagues and confirm specifically that his vision of contestability was largely shunned by the consultees who were selected to give their views? I offer no defence or otherwise of contestability, but it is important that we reflect accurately and sincerely views expressed during the course of consultation exercises. It seems to me that that has not been done in this and other areas. My point obviously relates directly to the consultation in Birmingham, so I would be grateful if the Minister would shed some light on what those who responded in Birmingham thought about contestability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para22">
<a name="stpa_418">Where does the Minister think that public health function will reside in the new scheme of things? Those   of   us who take an interest will have witnessed directors of public health being sidelined in PCTs that are largely focused&#151;often unsuccessfully&#151;on financial management. Could it be that the manifest failure to communicate the recent change in policy on BCG vaccination, for example, is symptomatic of the malaise in public health in recent years? The Faculty of Public Health&#039;s latest work force survey reveals that more than 100 senior public health posts have already been lost in the past three years. It estimates that the latest reorganisation could lead to the loss of a further 120 posts. I hope that the Minister agrees that that would be grossly unsatisfactory. It would be useful to hear from him how the set of reorganisations will enhance public health function, rather than damage it further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para23">
<a name="stpa_419">Will the restructure achieve the Government&#039;s intended saving of &#163;250 million, or will it, like most of its type, end up sapping resources from front-line services? If trusts make savings through reorganisation, for example in the merged Avon, Gloucestershire and Wilshire ambulance trust, will the Minister confirm that they will go towards improving front-line services in the trust, rather than being siphoned off to address financial deficits at the strategic level?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-34_para24">

<a name="stpa_421">In some ways, this debate underlines how far the health service has moved under this Government. When we were elected in 1997, the public&#039;s priority, and therefore ours, was to lift the NHS off its knees and rebuild the services that had been ground down over

<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 843</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>18 years under the Conservative party. We had to end the inequity of GP fundholding, under which some patients could jump to the top of the queue without rhyme or reason. In particular, we had to rescue our hospitals because, of course, some one in 10 people were languishing, waiting for an operation for two years or more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_422">The situation today is somewhat different: 100,000 extra staff, the biggest hospital-building programme ever and, as a result, the shortest waiting lists since records began. Indeed, on 31 December 2005, just 12 patients had been waiting over six months for care. The result, of course, is that people are now living longer. The death rate from circulatory heart disease is down 31 per cent., and the death rate from cancer is down 12 per cent. That benefit is especially felt by older people; life expectancy in the over-65s is rising and the level of vaccinations among those over 65 is at an all-time high. Delayed discharges are down by two thirds, and 1.7 million bed days have been saved through the changes that this Government have introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_423">Now, having stabilised the NHS, the question facing us is how we move forward. Not only have we introduced new choices of hospitals, but last week we laid before the House our White Paper, which is important because it signals a new direction of travel for the NHS, with greater personal care, greater access to primary care services, a shift of resources into prevention, which I think Conservative Front-Bench Members decided to welcome, and a far better relationship between the NHS and local government.

<a name="stpa_424">If the NHS can deliver on that agenda, there is a great prize here to be won&#151;great inroads into health inequalities. Over the past seven years we have made great strides in creating far more opportunity in this country, so surely our challenge now, after the longest record of economic growth and after putting more people into work than ever before, is to make sure that everybody, in every community, has the health and well-being to seize those new chances.

<a name="stpa_425">My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) asked why we have to change&#151;why we have to adapt. Governments have been talking about the need for a shift in the balance of primary care since the 1920s. In 1976, Baroness Castle set out in &quot;Priorities for Health and Social Services&quot; her ambition to move care into the community. The truth is that over the next four years and the subsequent 18 years of Conservative Administrations, we did not achieve that shift in the balance of care. This time, we have to make sure that the shift takes place. I am happy to give my hon. Friend an assurance that the new fair funding that we have introduced will stay in the places to which it has been awarded.

<a name="stpa_426">We have to make sure that, where appropriate, PCTs are coterminous with local authorities. We have to make sure that they are strong enough to hold GPs to account. We have to make sure that they can connect effectively with local communities because that is the only way that they will deliver on the ambitions that we set out in the White Paper.

<a name="stpa_427">My hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) put a powerful case for one of the two options in his local consultation, saying that it was the healthy option, the people&#039;s PCT. I am sure that what he said was heard clearly by those local health professionals managing the consultation. I am happy to give him an assurance that there is no template.

<a name="60207-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_428">My hon. Friend&#039;s near neighbour, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), did himself no favours by quoting answers to named day questions. Frankly, it was shameful of him not to recognise the advances that have been made in his local NHS. It is not worse than 30 years ago, and it is an insult to the performance of NHS staff in his area to pretend that waiting lists and death rates have not come down thanks to the new funding that we have put in, which I might add he voted against&#151;I think&#151;not on one occasion but on four occasions over the past three years.

<a name="60207-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_429">The hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) added that he was frustrated with the way that funding was not geared to areas of need, but that is exactly what the new funding formula has done. He knows full well that &#163;73 million extra is going to his PCT over the next few years. He has the opportunity over the next few years to distinguish himself by having a conversation with the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr.   Dorrell), who is chairing the policy review on health.

 Turning to the west midlands, the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) made a powerful and persuasive case in which he underlined and celebrated the achievements of Staffordshire ambulance service. It is indeed an ambulance service 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 845</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from which many in the country could learn. He was, perhaps, over-hasty in writing off the performance of the rest of the west midlands, but there is a clear message that we should take from his remarks, and it was underlined by my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) and for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello): there must be localisation of control. Surely the question in this consultation, though, is how we export that excellence, not just to other parts of the west midlands but to other parts of the country, and how we ensure that Staffordshire gets better in future. Surely it has not reached its full potential.

<a name="stpa_430">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) was dissatisfied with current arrangements and welcomed a change. I know that his input into consultation arrangements will be well informed by his previous experience.

<a name="60207-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_431">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) had a great deal to say about consultation. I was heavily involved in consultation on the White Paper. I would recommend it to Members in all parts of the House. There could well be more listening to be done on health policy.

<p>
<a name="60207-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_432">I listened very hard to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). I was trying to detect any hint of what Liberal Democrat health policy might be. I know that the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) instigated a sweeping policy review not long ago, saying that he would approach it with a blank sheet. That blank sheet, it seems, is his legacy, and from tonight&#039;s debate we can deduce that it will withstand the test of time. I can think, therefore, of no better quote than that of the former vice-chair and chair of the Hodge Hill Liberal Democrat party, who led a mass defection to Labour on Saturday night. He said that there is a lack of leadership not just in Westminster but in local communities. I think that I can see what he meant.

It remains a bit of a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a taskforce, although the alternative for health benefits from quite sensible leadership. We were not expecting an apology for voting against the National Insurance Contributions Act 2002 or against the Finance Acts of 2002, 2003 or 2004, but I thought that we might have heard a little clarification about the new fiscal rule of the right hon.

<a name="60207-37_time2"><h5>10.21 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60207-37_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b> 
 I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate regarding the behaviour of Network Rail towards my constituents in Sutton Coldfield. I have been in extensive correspondence with Network Rail and its chief executive, John Armitt, since 13 October 2004 regarding a line of grey stainless steel fencing that has been erected along a section of the freight line at East View road in my constituency. That fencing is ugly, does not fit in and is an eyesore.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_444">This is a story of arrogance and insensitivity, but, above all, of a complete lack of corporate accountability. East View road is a residential area in the green belt, located next to the picturesque New Hall Valley country park. It is an environmentally sensitive area and, although my constituents accept that they live next to a freight line and that line security is important, they do not accept the kilometre of monstrous, ugly grey steel fencing that has been erected. They want it to be replaced by green powdered fencing, which would be more suitable for the area. Network Rail has been asked to replace the grey fencing that it erected with more appropriate green fencing, but it has refused point blank.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_445">My constituents have been pursuing this point with Network Rail since March 2004 and I took up their case in October of that year. We have since been in frequent correspondence, and held a series of site visits and meetings&#151;all to no avail. Network Rail has never truly engaged with the complaint or displayed any signs of sympathy towards the case. The arrogance and lack of interest that my constituents&#039; complaint has received has been truly insulting. We can only conclude that Network Rail, although it states that it has an interest in being a responsible neighbour, has no intention of being anything of the sort. I therefore have no alternative but to highlight this sorry case to the House tonight. Network Rail has, through its behaviour, clearly demonstrated that its publicly stated environment policy and improved customer relations objectives are nothing more than box-ticking exercises. They hold no currency in the day-to-day business of Network Rail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_446">In its stated key objectives, Network Rail claims that consultation with community groups, Government agencies and local authorities

<a name="60207-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_448">Network Rail&#039;s published environment policy, which was signed by John Armitt, the chief executive, in March 2003, claims to offer environmental safeguards. Its stated vision is to &quot;achieve environmental excellence&quot; by engaging in dialogue with stakeholders and to seek continual improvement in its environmental performance. The company claims:

<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 853</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_449">There is no evidence whatever of that in the case of East View road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_450">John Armitt is coming to the House next Monday to hold an MPs&#039; &quot;surgery&quot; over line-side issues. I am sure that he is coming with every intention of promoting Network Rail&#039;s neighbourly credentials. However, if he did not feel that it was worth accepting my invitation to visit the East View road site and was unable to use his authority to address my constituents&#039; problems, why should we think that that surgery is anything other than just another tick-box exercise, a cynical stunt straight from a public relations textbook?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_451">When one of Mr. Armitt&#039;s staff came to meet my constituents, after many requests, he was reduced to an embarrassed silence and was unable to defend the actions and attitudes of Network Rail in any way. He promised to go back to Network Rail to try to ensure that a fair and equitable solution was agreed. Nothing of the sort occurred. The subsequent letter that I and my constituents received was a muddle of smug, complacent bureaucracy that addressed none of my constituents&#039; arguments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_452">The views of the residents of East View road are being swept aside by the over- mighty Network Rail and their line-side issues simply ignored. Network Rail did not engage in any dialogue prior to the erection of the stainless steel fence, either with the local residents or the city of Birmingham planning office. The residents&#039; first knowledge of Network Rail&#039;s plans to construct the fence was when they awoke to the sound of workmen cutting back trees, removing bushes and digging up the undergrowth before hastily putting up the fence. The residents of East View road only received correspondence from Network Rail after they had vociferously complained. A request for a temporary halt for a meeting to discuss the issue was rejected out of hand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_453">Despite representations made by my constituents, Birmingham city council planning office and me to request the use of green fencing, it has refused in a most uncompromising, unsympathetic and offhand manner. The current grey fencing is acknowledged to be environmentally insensitive and completely inappropriate for areas in or around the green belt. At other locations in Sutton Coldfield, more suitable fencing of the green powder-coated variety is used. The question from my constituents is: why cannot they be treated the same as others and have appropriate fencing?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_454">Frustratingly, my constituents and I have no recourse to pursue Network Rail for breach of the local authority planning regulations, as Network Rail does not come under its jurisdiction. Birmingham city council planning control office confirmed on 22 June 2004 that the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 allows Network Rail to carry out permitted work on its land without planning permission. Fencing does not therefore require planning permission, and Birmingham city council, whatever its view, has no power to intervene.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_455">Had the residents tried to put up such a fence, Birmingham city council would have insisted, due to the environmentally sensitive nature of East View road, as made absolutely clear by the city&#039;s planning policy, that the fencing must be green. There are innumerable examples of Birmingham city council having erected the sort of green powder-coated fencing that my

<br>&nbsp;<br>constituents are seeking. For example, at the nearby Bishop Walsh school, which is also adjacent to the railway line and New Hall Valley park.

<a name="60207-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_462">Network Rail has made a gross error of judgment in not treating the location with sensitivity and respect, and in not rectifying the clear errors that it made at the outset. It has been unable to give my constituents its reasons for not installing a green fence, despite having installed green fencing in other locations around Sutton Coldfield, including Mulroy road and Four Oaks station. Network Rail says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;the type and finish of the fencing was correctly assessed prior to its erection and given this it will remain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_463">It has refused to give details of how the assessment was made.

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para24">
<a name="stpa_464">In August 2004, Network Rail suggested a compromise&#151;that the residents paint the fence green themselves. Network Rail agreed to provide the paint, but the offer was later withdrawn on health and safety grounds. My constituents sought to use the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to obtain more information about Network Rail&#039;s green fencing policy, only to find that Network Rail was not classified as a qualifying body under the Act. However, the rail regulator&#151;the Office of Rail Regulation, as a qualifying body&#151;offered to try to obtain the information on behalf of my constituents.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_465">The ORR was told by Network Rail that it was under no obligation to release any information under the Act, and it therefore arrogantly refused to release any

<b>7 Feb 2006 : Column 855</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>information relating to my constituents&#039; request. My   constituents asked the ORR whether it could force    Network Rail to install green fencing in environmentally sensitive locations. The ORR explained that while it was sympathetic to the cause, it only set the contractual and financial framework within which Network Rail operates and was not involved in the details.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para26">
<a name="stpa_466">This is a very difficult situation for my constituents. The residents of East View road have the impression that Network Rail is an uncaring, unaccountable and faceless organisation that can exercise its powers without challenge and in an arbitrary way, while ignoring any local resistance to its actions. The ORR has no direct control over Network Rail; it only provides a framework. The local planning authority has no powers, as Network Rail has permitted development rights. My constituents are unable to refer the matter to any third party for a review. They cannot refer it to an ombudsman, to an appeal body or to a judicial review. As for the Network Rail environment policy, it is policed by Network Rail itself and cannot be challenged. The key objective of improved customer relations set out by Network Rail has also been ignored. Network Rail has simply not listened to its stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para27">
<a name="stpa_467">It that context it adds insult to injury for my constituents that John Armitt, chief executive of Network Rail, received a salary of three quarters of a million pounds in 2005&#151;&#163;754,757, to be precise. If it goes up any more, we shall soon be talking serious money. His bonus was presumably not linked to the company&#039;s environmental policy targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-37_para28">
<a name="stpa_468">It is my strong contention, having regard to the sensitivity of the location, and in line with Network Rail&#039;s fencing policy in Mulroy road, Wylde Green road, Station approach, Bowlas avenue and Lichfield road close to Four Oaks railway station, that the fencing in East View road should be fully replaced with green powder coated fencing. However, I acknowledge that there are significant cost implications. I want to be helpful, constructive and suggest a compromise solution. Instead of removing the whole fence and the posts supporting it, which is where much of the expense would arise, it should be perfectly feasible to remove just the panels themselves, which are simply bolted on, and it would take just minutes to remove each one. The original support posts could remain and new green powder coated panels bolted on. The existing silver grey fencing could be reused elsewhere, although only where appropriate and not in an environmentally sensitive area such as this.
</p>

<a name="stpa_469">Network Rail should put an end to the sorry situation and work with the community in East View road, respecting their environment and their opinions to find an acceptable solution.

<a name="stpa_473">The concerns in Sutton Coldfield arise from the installation of new line-side fencing. The main reason for that is to improve safety and to prevent trespass on the railway. The primary responsibility for preventing trespass on the national rail network lies with Network Rail. In doing that, Network Rail works closely with the British Transport police, the Department for Transport and others in the rail industry and the wider community.

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_474">Network Rail&#039;s national fencing programme is designed to reduce the scope for unlawful access to the rail network, and is recognised as a good initiative. I note that neither the hon. Gentleman nor his constituents dispute the need for fencing along East View road.

<a name="60207-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_475">The hon. Gentleman raises concerns about Network Rail&#039;s lack of accountability to local planning authorities, in particular with regard to planning policies about the colour of fencing. As a statutory undertaker, Network Rail enjoys permitted development rights, under part 17 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, for development on its operational land required in connection with the movement of traffic by rail. Statutory undertakers have acquired such rights for very good reasons. They provide an essential service to the public. It would therefore be unreasonable and inefficient to require them to make a planning application for essential development each time they needed to build something on their operational land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_476">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is carrying out a review of the permitted development order arising from its 2002 Green Paper outlining proposals for fundamental reform of the planning system. The review included a research study of the permitted development rights available to railway undertakers. Following publication of the study in September 2003, ODPM will undertake a public consultation before implementing any proposed changes to current rights.

<a name="stpa_477">I would like to go into more detail about Network Rail&#039;s status and responsibilities. Network Rail is a private sector company operating on a commercial basis. It is a &quot;company limited by guarantee&quot;. It has no shareholders and so does not have to earn dividends to pay them. Instead, any surplus it makes can be reinvested in the rail network for the benefit of all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_478">I think that at this point it would be worth explaining the new railway structure following the Railways Act 2005. The changes are vital to drive up standards, improve overall performance and underline who is best placed to deliver. The Government have taken charge of setting the strategic direction of the railways. In future, the Government will decide the high-level outputs they wish to buy from the railway and the public sector funding available for this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_479">Network Rail has been given clear responsibility for operating the network, and for its performance, timetabling and route utilisation. Train and track companies are working more closely together through the introduction of joint control rooms. The Office of the Rail Regulation now covers safety, performance and economic regulation. As part of being a company limited by guarantee, Network Rail&#039;s board is accountable to its 100-plus members. These are drawn from the industry and wider rail stakeholders including local and regional bodies, passenger groups as well as individuals. The Department for Transport is also a member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_480">Network Rail&#039;s members hold the board to account as shareholders would do in a PLC, although of course they have no financial interest in Network Rail. They appoint and reappoint directors, approve directors&#039; remuneration and agree the company&#039;s annual report and accounts, but they do not get involved in the running of the company. Network Rail&#039;s priorities inevitably must be focused on the effective management of the rail network. Its first priority is to operate a safe, reliable and affordable railway and securing the network plays an important part in achieving this goal. However, Network Rail must also strike a balance between operating a safe and reliable railway and addressing environmental and community concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_481">Network Rail is accountable to its regulator, the Office of Rail Regulation. The ORR ensures that Network Rail sticks to the terms of its licence in running the network. If it thinks it is not doing a good enough

<br>&nbsp;<br>job, it can take&#151;or consider taking&#151;enforcement action against Network Rail. The ORR also sets the income that Network Rail should receive and the outputs it must deliver for that income. Network Rail is also accountable to its major funders&#151;the Secretary of State and, from April this year, Scottish Ministers. It must be for Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament, to set the national strategy for the railways. Under the new arrangements implemented by the Railways Act 2005, the Government will set the level of public expenditure and take the strategic decisions on what this should buy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_482">Network Rail is accountable to its local communities. The company owns 21,000 miles of track. That is a lot of neighbours, including, of course, those in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. Despite the problems in his constituency, I welcome Network Rail&#039;s ongoing engagement with wider communities and its initiatives against railway trespass; for example its innovative &quot;No messin!&quot; campaign last summer to warn youngsters of the dangers of &quot;playing&quot; on the network, and targeted at route crime hotspots.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_483">I am glad to see that the chief executive of Network Rail is actively engaging with hon. Members through the planned &quot;line-side surgeries.&quot; I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised, but it is a good initiative. I also believe that Network Rail is concerned about the local environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_484">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns as to whether Network Rail&#039;s responsibilities to its neighbours fell short of what was expected in this instance. I very much hope the concerns of his constituents about the type and finish of the fencing can be resolved to everyone&#039;s satisfaction. But subject to Network Rail complying with the terms of its licence and relevant statutory requirements, we have no powers to intervene in operational decisions. Except in a limited range of circumstances related to security or major emergencies, Ministers have no powers to issue directions or any other binding instructions to Network Rail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60207-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_485">I shall certainly bring the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised, and his compromise proposal, to Network Rail&#039;s attention and ask it to respond directly to him.
