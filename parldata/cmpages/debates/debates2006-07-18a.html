Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham):</b>
The hospital travel costs scheme provides financial assistance to NHS
patients, including cancer patients, who do not have a medical need for
ambulance transport but who require assistance in meeting the costs of
travel to and from care.</p><p><a name="06071887000040"><b><a name="06071887000480">Ben
Chapman:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that cancer patients,
at a sensitive time in their lives, must travel to hospital an average
of 50 times in the course of their no doubt excellent treatment, at
places such as Clatterbridge centre for oncology? In doing so, they
incur costs of hundreds of pounds in travel and in the lottery of car
parking charges. Will the Department move forward with consulting on
better awareness of the hospital travel costs scheme and increasing its
uptake?</p><p><a name="06071887000041"><b><a name="06071887000481">Andy
Burnham:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important
point; he has a distinguished cancer treatment centre in his
constituency. As a fellow north-west MP, I know that my constituents
must travel some considerable distance to Christie&#146;s, while
others in the Merseyside region travel to his constituency. I therefore
accept that people can face extra financial worries at a time of stress
and anxiety due to their illness. First, further work is needed to
ensure that the scheme&#146;s scope is not too rigid and focused on
hospital settings as opposed to primary care, where more could be done.
Secondly, and more importantly, we need to get better information to
people who may be eligible to benefit from the scheme. Many patients
may be able to get significant support for their travel
costs.</p><p><a name="06071887000042"><b><a name="06071887000482">Steve
Webb (Northavon) (LD):</b> The Minister will be aware that the
cumulative cost of car parking, not just for cancer patients but for
other regular visitors to 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 134</b><br>hospital, can be substantial. At this point, the normal ministerial
reply is that that is a local issue&#151;but is the Department of
Health at all responsible? Does it feel that it has any national role
at all in the health service, or will it just allow local trusts to
charge what they like?
</p><p><a name="06071887000043"><b><a name="06071887000483">Andy
Burnham:</b> Normally, Liberal Democrats are the first to jump
up and cry foul about micro-management and targets coming from the
centre. Again, dare I say, they want to have it both ways. As far as I
am concerned, car parking is a big issue for the
public&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>If the hon. Gentleman will hear me
out, I shall go on to say that it is perhaps a bigger issue for the
public than the managers of some NHS trusts accept. In a world in which
patients have more choice, many of them will make an important point of
this issue, and many trusts will be required to think harder about it.
Essentially, however, it is a local decision depending on the
availability of space on trust land and the proximity of the trust to
the town centre.

Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) (Lab):</b> I do not expect my
hon. Friend to comment yet on the publication this morning of the
Health Committee&#146;s report on NHS charges. However, we are deeply
concerned about patients&#146; knowledge of the hospital travel costs
scheme. Can he ensure that that is improved? Can he also consider
setting national guidelines for hospital car park charges, especially
for patients, as the situation is a bit of a mess at the
moment?</p><p><a name="06071887000045"><b><a name="06071887000485">Andy
Burnham:</b> I woke up this morning to reports of the findings
of my right hon. Friend&#146;s Committee, and I detected his
forthright Yorkshire tones in some of the language used to describe the
situation. He is right to say that more effort needs to be made to
ensure that patients, particularly those on low incomes, are given
access to information about their eligibility to claim for their
transport costs, either in whole or in part. How people receive that
money back from hospital trusts, whether after or before their
treatment, is also an issue. My right hon. Friend is also right to say
that car parking is a big issue for patients. Many trusts are making
exceptions for car parking, particularly for cancer patients. Others
that are not doing that should look at those who are, and see whether
they can provide better support to patients at a difficult time in
their lives.</p><p><a name="06071887000046"><b><a name="06071887000486">Anne
Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b> According to the 19th report of
the Public Accounts Committee, more than three quarters of NHS patients
were not given information on financial benefits that could be used,
for example, to help to pay their car parking fees. As it was stated in
evidence to the Committee that progress was hoped for by the end of
2005 on delivery of disability living allowance and attendance
allowance to cancer patients, what progress has been
made?</p><p><a name="06071887000047"><b><a name="06071887000487">Andy
Burnham:</b> The health White Paper published earlier this
year made a specific commitment to consult on the hospital travel costs
scheme: first, on whether the scope needs to be increased so that
patients not under the care of a consultant but another health service
practitioner can benefit; and secondly, working with Macmillan, which
has done excellent work in this 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 135</b><br>area, on exactly how patients are given information about whether they
are eligible to benefit. It is not as easy as sticking a poster up on a
wall; we must see how we can get relevant information to patients who
may be able to benefit. That is a fair and legitimate point, and we
will take that forward in consultation this autumn.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071887000029">Abortion</h3><p><a name="06071887000048">2.

Hewitt:</b> Members of the medical profession, particularly
the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British
Medical Association, have recently made clear that they do not believe
the evidence supports any need to change the time limits specified in
the present law on abortion.</p><p><a name="06071887000052"><b><a name="06071887000492">Richard
Ottaway (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> Does the Secretary of
State accept that if a decision is to be made, it must be made on the
basis of the best advice and evidence available to Members? Will she
seriously consider Cardinal Murphy-O&#146;Connor&#146;s suggestion
that a Joint Committee of the two Houses be set up to hear the evidence
so that a rational and sensible decision can be
made?</p><p><a name="06071887000053"><b><a name="06071887000493">Ms
Hewitt:</b> That is, of course, a matter for individual Select
Committees and for the House, not for the Government. However, I stress
that when the law was revised in the late 1980s, the medical profession
believed that the age at which a foetus was considered viable should be
reduced from 28 weeks&#146; gestation to 24. There was a clear
medical consensus on that, based on evidence. There is no such
consensus or similar evidence today.</p><p><a name="06071887000054"><b><a name="06071887000494">Chris
McCafferty (Calder Valley) (Lab):</b> Does my right hon.
Friend agree that safe and legal abortion is crucial to the mental and
physical well-being of women in this country, given that no
contraceptive method is 100 per cent. safe? Does she acknowledge that
fewer than 0.1 per cent. of late terminations take place at24
weeks, and that the reason for those terminations is usually concern
for the health and welfare of the mother and child or the death or
divorce of a partner in
marriage?</p><p><a name="06071887000055"><b><a name="06071887000495">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Many Members on both
sides of the House fought to ensure that the law would allow women to
choose a safe and legal abortion should they need to do so. Speaking
for myself, I believe that that is right, and that it would be 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 136</b><br>a tragedy for many women if it were reversed. My hon. Friend is also
right about late abortions: according to the most recent figures that
we have, 137 abortions in the last year took place at 24 weeks&#146;
gestation or above.

Gidley (Romsey) (LD):</b> I am sure the Secretary of State
agrees that improved education and access to contraception would help
to reduce the abortion rate. Why are many primary care trusts cutting
the number of community clinics as part of their strategy to reduce
deficits? Will the Secretary of State ensure that clinics do not close,
so that a vital service remains available and doctors and nurses can
retain their skills?</p><p><a name="06071887000057"><b><a name="06071887000497">Ms
Hewitt:</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right: of course it is
better for women not to find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. That
is why we have substantially increased investment not just in
contraception services but in targeted measures to reduce the number of
teenage pregnancies. I know the hon. Lady will welcome the fact that
the number of pregnancies among those under 18 has been falling, and is
now at its lowest since the mid-1980s. However, as was recently
announced by the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon.
Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), primary care trusts
are considering how to redesign their sexual health services, including
contraception services, to ensure that they are as effective and

the long waiting lists for fitting&#151;more than a year in my
primary care trust area&#151;and additional waits for diagnostic
tests, there is a large legacy problem of analogue hearing aids that
need to be replaced by digital aids in the course of time? What would
be a realistic time frame for clearing the large backlog of

awaited?</p><p><a name="06071887000068"><b><a name="06071887000508">Mr.

seriously. It must form an inherent part of the action plan that we
take forward, which will include a number of issues as well as that
one. Other issues are increasing demand, inadequate capacity, work
force skills and competencies, and the fact that we do not yet have

people&#151;suffer so badly that it impacts severely on their quality
of life. Will the Minister confirm whether audiology services for
tinnitus, which are not necessarily linked with digital hearing aids,
but often provide advice about therapeutic treatment to tackle the
problem, are adequately catered for by the NHS? Many advances have been
made in other areas of audiology, but this remains somewhat of a
Cinderella service.</p><p><a name="06071887000073"><b><a name="06071887000513">Mr.

priority because he is not over 90 years old, he is not receiving a war
pension and he is not blind. My local trust cannot cope with the level
of demand with the current level of staff. If the Secretary of State
would consider allowing our trust to recover its budget deficit over

she will be equally honest with her constituents and tell them that
time and again when we have debated the amount of resources that we

considerably
worse.</p><p><a name="06071887000076"><b><a name="06071887000516">Angus

written statement today on audiology services complacent. Does he
accept that the Government&#146;s decision to exclude direct
referrals from the 18-week time target, while including referrals made
through ear, nose and throat consultants, raises the spectre of a
two-tier NHS, in which the articulate and better-off will be able to
ask to be referred through an ENT consultant in order to receive a
hearing aid within 18 weeks, while those who do not know how the system
works will have to wait far longer for their hearing aid? Does the
Minister believe that that represents equitable access for all,
including the 56 per cent. of patients in his local strategic health
authority who have to wait longer than 26
weeks?</p><p><a name="06071887000079"><b><a name="06071887000519">Mr.

that we have equitable access and that the best practice in some
areas&#151;for example, the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, my
local trust, which has zero waiting time for such services&#151;is
replicated all over the country. We need to ensure that we do not have
a two-tier system. However, including direct referrals in the 18-week
target would have led to a perverse incentive that we do not want to
encourage. We want to continue the situation in which the vast majority
of people go directly from their GP to audiology departments. Anyway,
we want to see more such treatment provided in the community rather
than in hospital in the future. Acknowledging the existence of
challenges and issues and committing ourselves to producing an action
plan is a responsible way to tackle that serious
issue.</p>

per cent. since 1997. Those nurses should, of course, have the
opportunity to progress in their careers. The Government recently
changed the work permit arrangements so that in future, junior nurses

are employing more than 85,000 more nurses than we were in 1997. That
substantial increase has meant that newly qualified nurses have found
it difficult to get jobs. The advantage of the managed migration policy
is that where shortages arise&#151;and there are shortages in

action that we have taken, but I do not agree about whether it is
possible to have an ethical recruitment policy. On that particular
issue, we have led the way&#151;not only by making it very clear that
the NHS itself and staffing agencies that work for the NHS are not
allowed to recruit directly from developing countries that desperately
need their own staff, but by entering into agreements with countries
such as the Philippines or India whereby they train more nurses than
they can possibly employ, and&#151;certainly before we made this
change&#151;by being willing to employ those staff here. I also refer
my hon. Friend to the excellent work of my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for International Development and the investment
that we are putting in&#151;for instance in Malawi and other parts of
Africa&#151;to help countries to train the health care workers that
they so desperately need to care for their own

that we are not ploughing resources into training nurses and offering
them the prospect of work, but no jobs at the end of the

a moment ago, there are real difficulties this year for many newly
qualified nurses and indeed others, including physiotherapists, in
getting jobs. We have therefore been working with NHS employers and the
chief nursing officer at the Department recently issued guidelines that
will make it much clearer that, for instance, the director of nursing
within each trust should be working with colleagues right
acrossthe local health community&#151;with other NHS
organisations&#151;to ensure that vacancies are created and filled
wherever possible by newly qualified staff; that private agency
temporary staff are reduced; and that in their place, where necessary,
newly qualified staff are taken into NHS banks, where they can be
offered part-time or full-time work in order to progress their
training.</p><p><a name="06071887000088">There are a
number of practical steps being taken in different parts of the country

continue to recruit junior nurses from outside the United Kingdom and

to one of contraction for the nursing work force? Some 5,500 extra
nurses were recruited the year before last, but 5,500 nursing posts are
now to be lost in our hospital sector. It is not just nurses leaving
education who cannot find a job, because, as my hon. Friend the Member

are losing their jobs. In the context of overseas recruitment, will the

affected?</p><p><a name="06071887000094"><b><a name="06071887000533">Ms
Hewitt:</b> We have indeed removed bands 5 and 6, which cover
the jobs for which newly qualified nurses apply, from the shortage
applications. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises the enormous
increase in the staffing of the NHS. There are more than 200,000
additional staff and more than 85,000 extra nurses&#151;and that was
made possible by the additional investment that he and the rest of the
Conservative party voted
against.</p><p><a name="06071887000095">The hon.
Gentleman talks specifically about nurses and other staff in hospitals.
The reality is that as hospitals become more effective and the NHS
takes advantage of changing medical practice&#151;for example, by
employing more nurses in the community and reducing the number of
emergency admissions&#151;there will need to be fewer acute beds and
thus fewer staff in some of our hospitals. He really has to decide
whether he believes that the NHS should use the best medical practice
to give the best care to patients and get the best value from the
increased investment that we have made, or whether, along with voting
against the increased investment, he is also giving up on any pretence
of using that investment to the best effect for
patients.</p><p><a name="06071887000096"><b><a name="06071887000534">Mr.
Lansley:</b> It is a complete fiction that more nursing posts
in the community are being created. In the last year for which we have
figures, there were 500 fewer district nurse posts and 800 fewer health
visitor posts. If the Secretary of State knows what is going on, she
must have based her policy on a new set of work force supply and demand
figures. Two years ago, the Department of Health&#146;s work force
projection said that we would be short of 40,000 nurses by the end of
the decade, and that we would need to recruit 12,000 overseas nurses a
year. What is the Secretary of State&#146;s current
projection?</p><p><a name="06071887000097"><b><a name="06071887000535">Ms
Hewitt:</b> The work force projections that the Department of
Health undertakes are all based on local projections of need developed
by individual hospitals and other parts of the NHS. It is already clear
that when the assessments of requirements for training places were made
some years ago, several hospitals overestimated their requirements. A
minority of hospitals were, even at that point, overspending their
budgets at the expense of other parts of the NHS, yet also taking on
new staff and commissioning new training places&#151;and now they
cannot find jobs for all the nurses who have been trained. That
situation is extremely unsatisfactory and unfair to the staff
involved.</p><p><a name="06071887000098">We still
have not heard whether the hon. Gentleman thinks that we have done the
right thing. The great advantage of the managed migration policy and
the new system for shortage occupations is that when we see a problem
emerging, as we did earlier this year, we can take action to ensure
that newly qualified nurses from abroad do not continue to seek
employment here. If the situation changes in future years, we can alter
that. The fact is that we have substantially increased the number of
training places, by over 60 per cent., so we have no shortage of nurses
at the
moment.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 143</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06071887000032">Hospital

excellent job that they are doing? Cleaners across the NHS do a
fantastic job but I am sure that, like me, the hon. Gentleman remembers
the billboards at the last election that said, &#147;How hard is it
to clean a hospital?&#148; It was a denigrating attack on the people
who keep our hospitals clean, and I am sure that it was approved by the

however, that often they are cleaning wards that are full of litter
from the Government&#146;s bureaucracy and red tape. To be serious,
is the Minister confident that MRSA, VRSA and ESBL superbugs have left
the Princess Royal hospital in Shropshire? If he cannot tell the House
that they have done so, why has the only isolation unit in Shropshire
at the Princess Royal hospital been closed?</p><p><a name="06071887000104"><b><a name="06071887000541">Andy

remarkable that that was prompted by Health questions, rather than
previous freedom of information requests from Mind, the charity. The
NPSA report is detailed, and it deserves close examination, as it
recognises the important work of health professionals. However, many
people are concerned about the safety of patients and the need to
protect them against assault in mental health units. The report shows
that there were 562 cases of patient abuse by a third party in a mental
health setting, and from my reading of the graph, there were a number
of cases of severe harm and, indeed, death. Can the Minister confirm
that and say what steps are being taken to minimise the risk that

mental health services every year, but of course we take many of those
allegations very seriously. In the report, in collaboration with NPSA,
the Department has looked at examples of best practice which implement
the guidance set out by the Department to ensure high levels of patient

the ending of mixed sex wards. Ten years later, people have a right to
know why patients are still suffering abuse at the hands of the
Government&#151;people who come to the national health service in
their hour of need are found to be abused. My question to the Minister
is simple and can be answered yes or no. Will she now make the

in-patient wards meet the requirements that have been laid down by the
Department. Those requirements are that there should be separate
sleeping accommodation and separate toilets and bathrooms. We also
recommend that trusts could consider whether it is appropriate for
wards to be completely male-only or female-only. Those issues are often
debated, and the hon. Gentleman should recognise that. In some
circumstances it is right that there are areas where males and females
can go. That, in a sense, makes it a normal setting. There are also
those who prefer that in some instances there should be completely
separate wards. We have told trusts that where it is appropriate, they
should consider such matters. As I said, there is99 per cent.

mental health and learning disability units, which it attributed to the
high level of staff vacancies, the lack of experienced staff in
in-patient units, the overcrowding and the lack of a therapeutic and
structured care system in wards. That was last May. Have things got

therefore looking at how it organises, delivers and uses health care,
as part of creating an NHS fit for the future programme. Any proposals
that emerge from the review will be subject to a full public
consultation later this year, probably in the
autumn.</p><p><a name="06071887000130"><b><a name="06071887000563">Michael

the workers of Surrey NHS on the superb service that they deliver.
However, only last week primary care trust representatives told me and
colleagues from Surrey that there would have to be cuts in all five of
our district general hospitals, and that one of those hospitals might
have to close. Can wehave a guarantee from the Minister that
hospitals will not close in Surrey as a result of the Minister&#146;s
mismanagement of NHS funding?</p><p><a name="06071887000131"><b><a name="06071887000564">Caroline
Flint:</b> I am sure that there are some excellent examples of
service in Surrey. The hon. Gentleman is coming to see me next Tuesday,
I understand, to talk through some of his concerns. I cannot promise
what he asks. It is important that we ensure that hospitals are fit for
service. For example, I know that in north Surrey there has already
been the relocation from acute community settings, dermatology services
and vascular surgery services. In north Surrey there is a full service
that provides out-of-hospital support for older people, particularly,
who fall through therapy and ambulance services that work together to
prevent hospital admissions.</p><p><a name="06071887000132">There are different approaches,
which I saw in Doncaster on Friday. There are community matrons. Ken
and Bill, two of my constituents, each had half a dozen visits to
hospital last year. This year, they have not attended hospital. That is
the sort of service that we want. We want hospitals that work for the
community and services that we hope can keep people out of hospital and
enable them to enjoy better health for much
longer.</p><p><a name="06071887000133"><b><a name="06071887000565">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt (South-West Surrey) (Con):</b> What message does
the Minister have for residents of Guildford and south-west Surrey, who
met last Thursday to be told that, because of a deficit, the loss of
accident and emergency services at the Royal Surrey county hospital is
a real possibility? Rather than insulting local NHS managers by saying
that the deficit is the result of their incompetence, does the Minister
not accept that the root cause of the deficit is her
Government&#146;s changes to the funding formula, which
systematically discriminates against rural areas with many older
people?</p><p><a name="06071887000134"><b><a name="06071887000566">Caroline
Flint:</b> However much money the hon. Gentleman&#146;s part
of the country has had, it has been overspending for many years. There
has been an 11 per cent. rise in admissions to A and E, but up to 80
per cent. of visits are non-urgent or inappropriate. Services will be
reviewed to try to find better ways to provide the emergency care that
some people need while allowing four out of five patients currently
visiting A and E to be treated better and safely in alternative
settings.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071887000035">GP

from 41 in some of the more deprived parts of the country to 83. The
number of GPs in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency is less than
the national average, but nevertheless it is somewhere around the
middle. I pay tribute to GPs in his constituency for providing an
excellent service. There are 5,000 more GPs today than there were in

general practices sometimes strike mental health outpatients off their

understand that reaction, but sometimes such patients are then
allocated another practice 30 or 40 miles away, which is no use to them
at all and will not help them to recover their mental health. Will my
hon. Friend look into that system to see if we cannot serve such people
better, rather than just striking them from a list and sending them

some difficult situations. Obviously, GP practices have to take into
account considerations such as the safety of staff and the general
relationships within their practices. It is the PCT&#146;s
responsibility to ensure that everybody has a GP, and it is right that
that GP should be as close to the patient&#146;s home as possible. If
my hon. Friend has examples where that has not happened, I should be
grateful if he would bring them to my attention, but we believe that
that is the right policy to

is a north-west MP and he has far more doctors per 100,000 than I do in
my constituency, which is under-doctored, so I make no apology for
bringing in private sector companies that are willing to provide a

Prime Minister:</b> With permission, Mr. Speaker, I want to
make a statement about the G8 summit, which took place between 15 and
17 July in St. Petersburg. I pay tribute to President Putin&#146;s
chairmanship and the Russian Government&#146;s handling of the
summit.</p><p><a name="06071887000154">The
whole summit was understandably overshadowed by the tragic and terrible
events in Israel, Palestine and Lebanon. For days, we have seen the
innocent killed by terrorism as a deliberate act by Hezbollah;
civilians killed in the course of military retaliation by Israel; and
the disintegration of our hopes for stability in this, the most fraught
area of dispute in the
world.</p><p><a name="06071887000155">More than 1,600
rockets and mortars have fallen on northern Israel in an arc from Haifa
to Tiberias, deliberately targeting civilians. In Lebanon, more than
230 people have been killed, the vast majority ofthem
civilians. Houses, roads, essential infrastructure, factories and
Lebanese army facilities have been damaged. Once again, we urge that
account is taken of the humanitarian situation and that military action
by Israel is proportionate. We grieve for the innocent Israelis and
innocent Lebanese civilians who are dead, for their families that mourn
and for their countries that are caught up in the spiral of escalating
confrontation.</p><p><a name="06071887000156">There
are more than 10,000 registered British nationals in Lebanon, and there
are probably many more, including a significant number of dual
Lebanese-British nationals. We are working as hard and as quickly as we
can to ensure that we can evacuate all those who want to leave. Teams
of consular, military and medical officials have been deployed to
Beirut, Cyprus and Damascus. We evacuated 63 of the most vulnerable
British nationals from Beirut by air yesterday, but the safest way to
evacuate large numbers of civilians is by sea. We have six ships in the
region or heading for the region&#151;the York and the Gloucester are
now offshore, and the Illustrious, Bulwark,St. Albans and RFA
Victoria Fort are heading there. The first evacuation by ship is taking
place today, and further evacuations will follow. The advice to British
nationals is to stay put and remain in contact with the British
embassy.</p><p><a name="06071887000157">We should be
in no doubt about the immediate cause of this situation. It started
with the kidnap of an Israeli soldier in Gaza and then action by Israel
targeting Hamas on the Palestinian side. Then, without provocation,
Hezbollah crossed the blue line established by United Nations
resolutions, killed eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two more.
Israel then again retaliated with air strikes against targets in
Beirut. This situation therefore began with acts of extremism by
militant groups that were, as the G8 said unanimously, without any
justification and were, of course, designed to provoke the very
response that followed.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 152</b><br><p><a name="06071887000158">In the communiqu&#233; issued
by the G8, we refer to and condemn the activities of the extremist
groups and, more elliptically, as we say, &#147;those that support
them&#148;. For most of us at the G8, we can be less elliptical.
Hezbollah is supported by Iran and Syria: by the former in weapons,
which incidentally are very similar, if not identical, to those used
against British troops in Basra; by the latter, in many different ways;
and by both of them financially.</p><p><a name="06071887000159">What is at stake therefore
could not be more stark. On the one side, there is Lebanon, a
remarkable democratic achievement from the days when Lebanon was a
by-word for instability and conflict. I have once again given Prime
Minister Siniora my solidarity and support in the immense difficulties
he now faces. There are also of course those in Israel and in Palestine
desperate to see progress towards the only solution that will ever work
there, namely, two states&#151;Israel and Palestine, both democratic,
both independent and both at peace. But on the other side are those who
want no compromise and who cannot see that terrorism is not the route
to a solution, but a malign, fundamental obstacle to it. They persist
in terrorism, knowing that its impact there is the same the world
over&#151;to divide, to create hatred and to drive out negotiation.
That is the purpose of
it.</p><p><a name="06071887000160">So what can be
done? I know that many wanted the G8 to call for an immediate ceasefire
by Israel. Of course, we all want all violence to stop, and to stop
immediately, but we recognise that the only realistic way to achieve
such a ceasefire is to address the underlying reasons why this violence
has broken out.</p><p><a name="06071887000161">In
respect of Lebanon, the G8 proposed rapid work on inserting an
international security presence in southern Lebanon to stabilise the
situation, to ensure that the terrorism from the Lebanese side ends
and, most importantly, to provide conditions in which the Lebanese
armed forces can take control and assist them in doing so. Meanwhile,
the United Nations Secretary-General&#146;s special envoys are in the
region and will report to the Security Council later this week. We
welcome these and other efforts to calm the situation.</p><p><a name="06071887000162">We also encouraged dialogue
between the Lebanese and Israeli Governments, and we pledged at the G8
further economic support to Lebanon. And, of course, we demanded the
return of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Only in that way can United
Nations Security resolutions 1559 and 1680 in respect of Lebanon be
implemented.</p><p><a name="06071887000163">On Gaza,
we made it clear that our goal was an immediate end to the violence,
and again we put forward the measures necessary&#151;release of the
Israeli soldiers and of the Palestinian Ministers and parliamentarians;
an end to attacks on Israel; resumption of security co-operation
between Israel and Palestine; restarting political contacts between
Israeli and Palestinian officials; and an end to Israeli military
operations and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.</p><p><a name="06071887000164">However, let us be plain. We
can and must stabilise the existing situation in Lebanon and in Gaza.
We must then use such stabilisation to help Lebanon rebuild and
eventually to re-begin negotiations between Israeland
Palestine. But at root, we need to recognise the fundamental nature of
the struggle in this region, which has far-reaching
consequence&#151;consequences far beyond that region and consequences
even in countries 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 153</b><br>such as our own. All over the middle east, there are those who want to
modernise their nations and who believe, as we do, in democracy and
liberty and tolerance, but ranged against them are extremists who
believe the opposite&#151;who believe in fundamentalist states and
are at war not against Israel&#146;s actions, but against its
existence. In virtually every country of the region, including on the
streets of Baghdad, such a struggle is being played out. When this
current crisis abates, that is the issue to which we must return, in
the way that the G8 outlined two years ago but has not so far put fully
into effect.</p><p><a name="06071887000165">Let me
turn to the other issues that were raised atthe G8. On Africa,
we made modest but important progress in taking forward the commitments
of last year, including: scaling up action on HIV/AIDS through
replenishing the global fund in 2006 and 2007; new initiatives on
vaccines for malaria and pneumococcus; and fully funding the education
fast-track initiative. We agreed to review progress on Africa again at
the G8 summit in 2007. I have asked the International Development
Secretary to set out the key milestones for the coming 12 months in his
next report to Parliament. Those will include, for us,
supporting10 African countries, developing long-term education
plans and getting the debts cancelled for five more African countries.
Kofi Annan will also convene the Africa progress panel to monitor
progress on the commitments
given.</p><p><a name="06071887000166">I also
discussed Sudan with several G8 leaders and Kofi Annan. We agreed that
the situation in Darfur continues to be unacceptable and that we need a
quick deployment of the UN
force.</p><p><a name="06071887000167">On trade, at
the final session it was at last agreed by all to empower their
negotiators to go further. The cost of the failure of that trade round
for the world&#146;s poor, global growth and multilateralism would be
high. Presidents Bush, Barroso, Lula and Mbeki, Chancellor Merkel and
Prime Minister Singh of India all agreedto show flexibility.
Pascal Lamy has been tasked immediately with convening trade
negotiators to turn that clear commitment into action, which must
deliver real cuts in agricultural tariffs and subsidies and progress on
non-agricultural market access. I do not minimise the substantial
obstacles that remain, but at least the renewed commitment from the
United States, the European Union and the G20 countries was immensely
welcome. We also agreed a strong package for poor countries, including
$4 billion a year aid for trade and action on rules of origin. We
remain fully committed to ensuring that, in any event, it would be
utterly wrong for there to be no agreement in this round on a full
development package for the poorest nations.</p><p><a name="06071887000168">There was also a fascinating
debate on energy&#151;of direct relevance to this country&#151;at
the summit. There was virtual consensus, in fact, on the following
matters: first, energy prices will continue to rise, with a predicted
increase of about 50 per cent. in energy demand by 2030. Secondly,
climate change is now universally accepted, as happening, including by
the United States, and there is therefore an urgent necessity to make
future economic growth sustainable. Thirdly, countries will need to
have balanced energy policies, in which clean coal technology, carbon
sequestration, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 154</b><br>renewables and nuclear power have to play a part. Our energy review was
therefore absolutely in line with that consensus.</p><p><a name="06071887000169">On nuclear, it was interesting
to note the statement by China that it intends to develop nuclear
power, by India that it regarded it as indispensable, and by many of
the main oil producers, including Kazakhstan, that they would balance
their reliance on their oil and gas with nuclear. That was also the
conclusion of the J8&#151;the young people from around the world who
debated the issue.</p><p><a name="06071887000170">The G8 also agreed on the need
to accelerate discussions on an inclusive dialogue for a post-2012
climate change framework and, importantly, that that framework should
include the United States, China and India. The G8 supported the need
for a goalto stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations. The
Gleneagles dialogue meeting in Mexico will be the next step in taking
that work forward. Finally, we agreed several other texts, which have
been placed in the Library.</p><p><a name="06071887000171">The summit was held in
circumstances that none of us could have foreseen. It was obviously
dominated by the middle east. However, its conclusions on Africa, trade
and energy will, I hope, stand the test of time. I commend the
conclusions to the
House.</p><p><a name="06071887000172"><b><a name="06071887000586">Mr.
David Cameron (Witney) (Con):</b> I thank the Prime Minister
for his statement. It is a deeply troubling time. The citizens of
Israel and Lebanon are suffering, many British citizens are caught up
in the conflict and there is a real danger that the conflict will
escalate. Everyone has been watching as the world&#146;s most
powerful leaders met in St. Petersburg while a vital region descended
into war. They want and expect concerted action.</p><p><a name="06071887000173">The Prime Minister spoke in his
statement about creating the conditions for implementing a ceasefire.
He is right that they must include the release of Israeli hostages, the
end of rocket attacks on Israel and a future for Lebanon without armed
militias. Is not it the case that we will achieve lasting peace only by
addressing the underlying causes of the crisis? I have some questions
about the immediate crisis and the longer-term issues, and wider
questions about progress on the Gleneagles agenda.</p><p><a name="06071887000174">The Prime Minister spoke about
the differing emphasis in the G8 and the varying degrees of
ellipticality, if I may put it like that. Despite that, will there be
an intense, co-ordinated and powerful effort to bring about a
resolution to the crisis in the coming days? We know that the Prime
Minister is considering visiting the middle east. What part will he
play in the process and how will it fit in with the role of other
countries? He mentioned a UN force to act as a security presence. Can
he tell us what its mandate would be, which countries have, so far,
shown willingness to contribute and, given John Bolton&#146;s
remarks, does it have the full support of the United States?</p><p><a name="06071887000175">Stability requires the Lebanese
Government to exercise full control over their country and to disband
the militias. Does not that mean that United Nations Security Council
resolution 1559 needs to be implemented in full? As the Prime Minister
said, it is 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 155</b><br>now clear for all to see that the involvement of Iran and Syria in Hamas
and Hezbollah is deeply destructive and needs to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06071887000176">The whole
House will be concerned about the safety of British citizens in the
middle east. The Minister for the Middle East, the hon. Member for
Pontypridd(Dr. Howells), said yesterday that this was
potentially the biggest British evacuation since Dunkirk. What clear
advice is being given to British citizens? Will the Prime Minister tell
us what arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the Ministry
of Defenceand the Foreign Office work together as one in a
co-ordinated way? The Prime Minister mentionedthe warships
that have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean. Is he confident that
there is sufficient capacity to evacuate everyone for whom we are
responsible and to accommodate them in Cyprus?</p><p><a name="06071887000177">Tackling the long-term causes
will involve restarting the road map, tackling Iran&#146;s nuclear
ambitions and ending Syrian involvement in Lebanon. The US has offered
to have direct talks with Iran, should enrichment activity be fully
suspended. Does the Prime Minister agree that there is no longer any
excuse for Iranian intransigence? With these significant developments
in this strategically vital part of the world, and with so many British
citizens&#151;constituents of ours&#151;caught up in the crisis,
does the Prime Minister agree that we need a full-scale foreign affairs
debate before Parliament rises for the summer
recess?</p><p><a name="06071887000178">On Gleneagles,
I welcome what the Prime Minister said about the progress that has been
made over the past year. On the target for HIV treatments by 2010, it
is vital that interim targets be set, as we suggested. Were those
targets backed specifically by the G8? A successful trade round will do
more than anything to alleviate poverty. The Prime Minister said that,
at the end of the G8, leaders were empowered to show flexibility.
Should we be concerned that the list of leaders that he read out did
not include President Chirac of France?</p><p><a name="06071887000179">Time is running out. Is not
this one of those moments that represents a genuine test for the G8,
for the short and long term? There is a vital need for a trade deal,
and today, as hundreds of innocent civilians are dying in Israel and
Lebanon and thousands of British citizens remain trapped in the
conflict, is there not an urgent need for concerted action to deal with
the
crisis?</p><p><a name="06071887000180"><b><a name="06071887000587">The

hon. Gentleman has said. Let me just respond to some of the points that
he raised. First, there will of course be an intense effort at
Thursday&#146;s meeting of the United Nations Security Council to
talk about this issue. The question of a stabilisation force or a
security presence will be debated there. That proposal was supported by
all the G8 countries. Of course, it will take time to build up such a
force, and we will need the circumstances to be conducive to its going
into southern Lebanon. I have said constantly over the past few days
that even if we manage to stabilise the existing situation and to calm
it down, there will still be a risk of a recrudescence of what has
happened recently unless a force is put in there. If we are able to
stabilise 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 156</b><br>the situation, it will be important that we put in place mechanisms that
will allow Lebanon to take more control of its own future.</p><a name="06071887000433"><p>That leads me to the
important point that the United Nations Security Council resolution
1559 in respect of Lebanon was passed 20 months ago. People sometimes
forget that. It called for the disbanding of all the militias in
southern Lebanon and for an end to allthe support being given
to them. It also called for the Lebanese forces to be able to take
control of the whole country. So it is not as though we have never been
able to predict the possibility of such circumstances arising. It is
therefore important to recognise that we will have to ensure that that
resolution is implemented. It will be very difficult to do that,
however, given the state ofthe Lebanese Government and the
Lebanese nation at the present
time.</p><p><a name="06071887000181">That leads
me on to the next point, which has todo with Iran and Syria as
they effectively support Hezbollah, financially and with weapons. That
is why we will of course keep up the diplomatic pressure on Iran to
comply with its international obligations, and we urge Syria to take
the action that it could take in relation to Hezbollah if it wanted to
do so.</p><p><a name="06071887000182">We believe that
by the end of the week, as the Minister of State at the Ministry of
Defence said, we can evacuate about 5,000 British citizens and dual
nationals. The first ship is docking today; another ship will take even
more people tomorrow, and we are making progress on that as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p><a name="06071887000183">We did agree
again with the G8 targets on Africa and, yes, I did choose reasonably
carefully those people I listed as being in favour of flexibility at
the World Trade Organisation. It is important to recognise that each of
the main actors has to determine their position by reference to
somebody else: President Bush makes reference to Congress; the G20
nations meet as a collective; Brazil and India cannot simply take the
decision on their own; and, of course, the European Union has its own
procedures and has to agree a position. What was good was the virtually
unanimous view around the table that we need to make progress at the
WTO, and a very strong statement from the UN Secretary-General to that
effect. It was very much as a result of what was said by us and other
countries that Pascal Lamy was able to attend the summit. I hope that
the talks will make progress. If they do not, it will be a very great
failure, and the right hon. Gentleman is right to imply that such a
failure is the last thing we need at this moment. We need to show
multilateral institutions succeeding, and it is for that reason, among
many others, that I hope that the WTO talks
succeed.</p><p><a name="06071887000184"><b><a name="06071887000588">Sir
Menzies Campbell (North-East Fife) (LD):</b> It is clear that
there was much constructive work done at the G8 in relation to Africa,
the Doha round and energy, but it was inevitable, as today has already
demonstrated, that the concentration would be on the middle east. We
can agree that the recent events constitute a threat to the stability
of the whole region. We can also agree that we will be able to rely on
the professionalism of our armed forces to effect the necessary
evacuation of British citizens. However, will the Government, on
Thursday in New York, press for the Security Council to call for an
unconditional and immediate ceasefire? How will it be possible to
insert 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 157</b><br>an international force unless there is a ceasefire? Such a force could
hardly fight its way
in.</p><p><a name="06071887000185">We must all accept
that the indiscriminate firing of rockets and missiles into Israel by
Hezbollah is unacceptable, but so too is the targeted and systematic
destruction of the infrastructure of Lebanon. What would happen if the
Lebanese Government, already weakened, were to fall? What, indeed, will
happen if the prediction of the Israeli Chief of Staff&#151;that
Lebanon will go back to what it was 20 years ago&#151;comes about?
Who will fill the vacuum that will be caused as a result? How will that
be in the interests of long-term stability and peace in the
region?</p><p><a name="06071887000186">We must all
accept that Israel has a moral and a legal right to live in peace
within recognised and secure borders, but does the Prime Minister
accept that that right does not legitimise action that is
disproportionate and amounts to collective punishment, both in Lebanon
and in
Gaza?</p><a name="06071887000434"><p><b><a name="06071887000589">The
Prime Minister:</b> I agree that we want a ceasefire and an
end to hostilities, but that will happen only if it happens on all
sides. As I said in my statement, it is important that action by Israel
is proportionate, but we have to understand how this began and the
underlying reasons for its beginning. Those reasons are that there are
groups that have decided to take these steps at this moment. They are
completely disregarding the welfare of Lebanon or, indeed, of
Palestinians in Gaza. They have decided to take action that means that
Israel will, of course, defend itself because, as the right hon. and
learned Gentleman rightly says, it has a moral and legal right to do
so.</p><a name="06071887000435"><p>The
only way that we are going to get a solution&#151;because whatever
our nuances, we are all essentially in the same place&#151;is, first,
to put in place a strategy to calm the situation, and secondly, to deal
with those deep underlying causes. That is why it is important to
discuss the stabilisation force. It cannot, of course, fight its way
in, but if we end up with the conditions negotiated for a cessation of
hostilities, we at least need to consider having some sort of buffer
force between Lebanon and Israel to allow us to create a situation in
which the same problem does not break out again.</p><p><a name="06071887000187">In the end, it depends on what
one believes about why this happened. One can take two views. One can
take the view that it was a spontaneous occurrence as a result of what
was happening in Gaza. Alternatively, one can take the view, as I am
afraid I do, that it was not spontaneous, but was a deliberate act of
strategy to ensure that the conflict was widened. If one
takesthe latter view, that means that those who began the
conflict in Lebanon will not give up easily. Israel will defend itself,
and it is therefore important for the international community to find
the means of enforcing a cessation of hostilities on both sides. We can
rest assured that unless the Israeli soldiers are released and the
rockets&#151;1,500 of which have come over to the Israeli
side&#151;are stopped, Israel will carry on defending itself. A
cessation of hostilities is needed on both sides, and measures need to
be taken to try to prevent this happening again while we work on the
underlying problems in that region, which, increasingly in my view, are
directly connected in an arc from Iran right across the middle
east.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 158</b><br><p><a name="06071887000188"><b><a name="06071887000590">Mike
Gapes (Ilford, South) (Lab/Co-op):</b> My right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister referred to the need for an international security
presence. He knows that there has been an international presence in
Lebanon for many years. Can he clarify the implication of the current
proposal? Will any force be under the United Nations? Will it be under
chapter VI or chapter VII? How will it be deployed, and under what
rules of engagement? Can he also emphasise what is being done to ensure
that the conflict is not widened, which is a great danger? He has
referred to Syria and Iran and their support for Hezbollah. What is
being done by the G8 to ensure that Syria does not get involved and
that the conflagration does not widen throughout the whole
region?</p><p><a name="06071887000189"><b><a name="06071887000591">The
Prime Minister:</b> As my hon. Friend rightly implies, we must
put every pressure on Syria. In a sense, the most important point is
that the conflict has already been widened&#151;that was the purpose
of the incursion into northern Israel. It is therefore important to
ensure that we now back off the situation. He is right that the United
Nations interim force in Lebanon, which is about 1,600 to 1,800 strong,
has been there for many years. If we put in a stabilisation force, it
must be of a different order of magnitude, with a proper chapter VII
resolution and with serious rules of engagement. Those matters will be
discussed over the days and no doubt weeks to come, and if there is a
better idea I would like to hear it. However, I do not see how we get
this stopped and remove the danger of it starting again unless some
objective measure is taken, by way of force, to prevent Hezbollah
beginning such action again when those behind it decide that it is
strategically advantageous to do so.</p><p><a name="06071887000190"><b><a name="06071887000592">Mr.

is support for groups that do not want a peaceful solution to the

President Bush atSt. Petersburg about Syria and sweaters, did
the Prime Minister&#151;after he had switched off the

of the root causes of the spread of chaos in the middle east has been
the failure, over 40 years, of successive American Administrations to
persuade Israel to accept United Nations resolution 242, which requires
it to return to its legal frontiers of 1967? That failure has caused an
inevitable degree of bitterness, which has led to the creation and
sustaining of various guerrilla militias which are now increasingly
regarded as part of an Islamic jihad.</p><p><a name="06071887000195"><b><a name="06071887000597">The

of all this was the failure to abide by resolution 242, which we
support&#151;but there must be a better explanation for the rejection
of the agreement that President Clinton reached with the Israeli Prime
Minister at the time, Prime Minister Barak, and the offer that was made
to the Palestinian Authority then. There must be a better explanation
for what happened with the road map, which provides a perfectly
sensible way through this. We had to battle very hard to get America
and Israel to agree to the road map, but the defaulting in respect of
that was not on the Israeli side. There must be a better explanation as
to why it cannot now be agreed on the Palestinian side that if there is
to be a two-state solution, that means recognising Israel&#146;s
right to exist.</p><p><a name="06071887000196">I do
not say that mistakes have not been made in relation to this, through
America, through ourselves, and through others over the years, but I
think that the issue is now far more fundamental. The fact is that
America would take this forward and deliver a two-state solution for
the Palestinian people&#151;I am sure of that&#151;if we could
secure the simple acceptance that only through non-violent, democratic

surely what is going on now in Lebanon and Gaza goes far beyond any
legitimate self-defence. Must not the world community make it clear
that if it is unacceptable, as it obviously is, for Hezbollah and Hamas
to fire rockets at civilian targets in Israel, it is also unacceptable
for Israel to target civilians and civilian infrastructure in Lebanon?
The world must say that clearly, or it will encourage those in Israel
and those on the other side of the conflict who want to provoke further
action leading to further military conflict on a wider scale throughout
the
region.</p><p><a name="06071887000198"><b><a name="06071887000599">The

difficult situation. We can imagine how it would be in our own
democracy if we

weapon of diplomacy? Did the Prime Minister have time to talk to
President Putin about what is going on in Russia, and about what
Russia&#146;s ambitions are in the &#147;near area&#148;, as he
calls it? That is particularly relevant, given that the need for this
country to invest in nuclear power is partly due to our need for a
sense of assurance about our sources of energy, because of the threat
that Russia may one day use our need for energy against
us.</p><p><a name="06071887000201"><b><a name="06071887000601">The

we drew up and promulgated at the summit. I expressed my view, as I
always do, that the only way to make progress in Russia or elsewhere is
by adherence to democratic principles. To be fair, the Russian
President made it very clear that he understands people&#146;s
anxieties about security of supply, which was the reason why he felt it
right to adopt and agree to the charter that we all signed. The hon.

the Israeli response to the extreme groups within Gaza, Palestine and
Lebanon, which deliberately attempts to inflame the situation? The
unprecedented responseof the Israelis, involving the killing
of children and civilians and the targeting of infrastructure, is an
attempt to weaken the forces of the Palestinian Authority and the
Lebanese army and there is no way that that will support their cause. I

entirely the good sense of the G8 statement on the middle east and both

East so admirably said yesterday, will the Prime Minister tell the

can in the contacts that we have had with the Israeli
Government&#151;myself with the Prime Minister&#151;and obviously
with the other Governments in the region. In respect of Iran, as well,
it is partly, I would say, as a result of the efforts of this country
that we can put before Iran, and in a sense flush out a response, a
very sensible and generous offer by the international
community&#151;plus the offer by the United States of America, for
the first time in 20 years, that it would talk directly to the
Iranians. All that has come about in part because of the efforts of
this country. My belief is that the only ultimate security in that
region is the spread of democracy and liberty. When that happens, we
will find that, as I am sure would happen if the Iranians were given a
proper free election, there would be perfectly sensible people who
would govern their country and who would want to live in peace with
their neighbours.</p><p><a name="06071887000220"><b><a name="06071887000619">Chris

southern Lebanon, but then we failed to provide the policing resources

Syria stopped supplying Hezbollah. We failed to provide an honest
broker in the international community. Is it not time that we put the

very right. I was just looking at resolution 1559, passed almost two
years ago in September 2004, which said that the UN

what would happen if the prediction was right, which must at least be a
possibility. If we actually had a 50 per cent. increase in demand by
2030, people would look askance at the policy makers today, since we
need to provide for the long term, if we failed at least to take the
right precautionary measures to make sure that we had a balanced energy
supply. That is what I am saying. What is different between the
prediction now and that of 30 years ago is that it is now certain that
China and India will consume a far larger part of the world&#146;s
energy supply. What is not certain is the way in which the world might
deal with that. The growth of China and India is driving the current
situation, and it will continue to do

the House&#146;s attention to the fact that Hezbollah is getting
weapons from Iran. He also said that by an amazing coincidence, the
same weapons are being used against our troops in Basra. He needs to
amplify that point. Does he agree that although we recognise the

alarmed by the prospect of a nuclear Iran. I have heard several people

everyone there, including Hezbollah. However the parties come around
the table, it is perfectly obvious that the only solution is to rewind
the things that have happened, including by ensuring that the soldiers
are released and the rocket attacks are stopped. Rocket and mortar

conflict with Iran or Syria. The problem is raised in a very acute way
by the offer that has been made by the European Three&#151;France,
Germany and the UK&#151;and America, Russia and China. We have put
forward an offer to Iran that essentially protects its ability to
develop civil nuclear power but restrains its ability to develop a
nuclear weapon. The offer is on the table. It could talk to America and
the whole of the relationship could be changed. The problem is that I
remember being told time after time, &#147;If only we got America to
talk to us, things would be different,&#148; but it is done, and then
things are not different. At some point one must ask whether there is
sincerity on Iran&#146;s part or not. There is no plan whatever to
take such action against Iran. I am willing to consider any form of
diplomacy that brings about a change, but if there is not some give on

were sure about where this began. That was an important step forward in
itself. As for Iran, time and again, it must be reminded of the fact
that the world has no aggressive intent towards it, but if it exports
aggression, it is very hard for us not to confront that reality.
Underneath it is the wider issue that I have talked about, but the fact

right hon. Friend would agree that if there is to be long-term
stability in the middle east, something that must change is the
position of Lebanon. That state has been enfeebled by its neighbours,
Syria and Israel, for their own misguided purposes which prevent a
long-term solution. What can be done to strengthen the Government in

making is exactly the reason for resolution 1559. The only way, in the
end, in which a state makes sure that it is in charge is for it to be
in charge of force within the country. The problem is that Hezbollah
militias are a constant thorn in the side of Lebanon, preventing that
situation from being realised, which is why the resolution was passed.

in the end is that when the disengagement from Gaza took place, my
idea&#151;and others had it too&#151;was that the international
community would move in behind a Palestinian Authority that was growing
in effectiveness, with increasing control over its own security forces,
thus creating the conditions in which private investment could be made.
Indeed, a series of people were lined up, waiting to go in and invest.
It is not what happened. Once the immediate situation calms, we must go
back and work out with the Palestinian Authority a proper plan that
allows that Authority to take charge of its own destiny. Rather as with
Lebanon but on a much greater scale, there are people who are operating

Department of Health survey for England revealed that incidents of
obesity have more than trebled in the past 20 years. For adults, that
represents a rise of between 14 and 16 per cent., based on body mass
index calculations for obesity. The rising obesity figures for children
revealed by the survey for that period are even more alarming. While
there was little change between 1974 and 1984, between 1984 and 1994
the prevalence of obesity increased to 1.7 per cent. of boys and 2.6
per cent. of girls. By 2002, those figures had risen to the extent that
5.5 per cent. of boys and7.2 per cent. of girls in England
aged two to 15 years were categorised as
obese.</p><p><a name="06071887000271">Projecting
these figures forward 15 years&#151;assuming that incidents of
obesity continue to increase steadily&#151;it is shockingly estimated
that one third of adults in England will be obese by 2020. A Royal
College of Physicians report estimates that, if the rapid acceleration
in childhood obesity that we have witnessed continues, incidents of
obesity in children could rise above 50 per cent. by
2020.</p><p><a name="06071887000272">I could go on
with these statistics, but bemoaning the state that we have got
ourselves into will not bring about change and reverse the damage
already done. That is why I am presenting this Bill, which seeks to
provide just one measure that might help consumers in Britain to make
healthier choices about the foods that they buy in a market flooded
with pre-packaged, mass-produced foods with long lists of complex
ingredients. A single format for simplified front-of-package nutrition
information&#151;giving the amounts of salt, sugar and fat contained
in the product, combined with an interpretive element such as colour
coding&#151;would certainly bring about a positive change in the way
that we shop and eat. Moreover, if such a scheme is not taken up
voluntarily by the food manufacturing and retail industries, the
Government ought to make provision to ensure that standards are
enforceable.</p><p><a name="06071887000273">As the
hon. Member for Lewisham, West(Jim Dowd) said in his splendid
Adjournment debate last week, the Health Select Committee&#146;s
inquiry into obesity, which reported in May 2004, is indeed its
&#147;magnum opus&#148;. The report highlighted the growing
prevalence of obesity in the UK and its effect on people&#146;s
health, and the consequent impact on the health service of increasing
incidents of weight-related illnesses such as heart disease and type-2
diabetes. The Committee estimated that the associated costs are between
&#163;3.3 billion and &#163;3.7 billion a year, and this figure
will continue to rise unless urgent steps are
taken.</p><p><a name="06071887000274">Nutrition-based
advice pertaining to the calorie or fat content in foods can often be
misleading. For example, a product advertised as 90 per cent. fat-free
still contains 10 per cent. fat and could still be highin
calories and salt. Such promotional information 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 174</b><br>prevents consumers from making the informed decisions that I know the
Minister with responsibility for these matters wants them to be able to
make. A more transparent and yet still simplified system of nutrition
labelling would allow busy shoppers to make quick and informed
decisions about the foods that they buy, and enable them to make
comparisons with other products and
brands.</p><p><a name="06071887000275">The FSA action
plan on food promotions and children&#146;s diets and the public
health White Paper &#147;Choosing Health&#148; endorse the
voluntary scheme for giving simplified nutrition information on the
front of packaged foods. More than 2,600 consumers were surveyed in
June 2005 in one-to-one interviews to test responses to and the general
understanding of possible nutrition information formats. The two models
that emerged on top were the multiple traffic-light system and
colour-coded guideline daily amounts. It appears that the success of
those two formats lies in the combination of colour coding and
numerical information that makes them both accessible and informative
to the busy consumer. It appears that96 per cent. of the
people surveyed thought that simplified packaging would enable them to
have better health choices. Ninety per cent. were able correctly to use
the traffic-light format to identify the levels of sugar, fat and salt
in the products. That is compared with only 69 per cent. for colour
coded guideline daily amounts.</p><p><a name="06071887000276">In support of those findings,
in the National Consumer Council snap-shot survey consumers sighted
front-of-pack signpost labelling as one of the top three easy methods,
alongside healthier school meals, that would help people eat more
healthily and would help companies to cut down on salt, sugar and fat
in processed foods.</p><p><a name="06071887000277">Furthermore, there is research
such as that undertaken by the consumer magazine, <i> Which?,</i> which
I applaud. It shows that a multiple traffic-light labelling format was
the preferred option for the majority of consumers and the most easily
accessible system for low-income people and those from minority ethnic
backgrounds.</p><p><a name="06071887000278">There is
an inherent danger in labelling some foods as being healthy, with other
foods in contrast being regarded as unhealthy. That gives a wrong
impression. Recommendation 23 of the Health Select Committee&#146;s
report stated that the Government must accept that some foods that are
extremely energy dense should be eaten in moderation by most people. It
therefore recommends that legislation should be introduced to introduce
a traffic-light system for labelling foods either red for high energy
density, amber for medium energy density or green for low energy
density, according to criteria devised by the FSA.</p><p><a name="06071887000279">Recommendation 24 says that
although several interventions for better food nutrition labelling have
been made, the traffic-light system stands up to objective assessment,
and if accepted widely across the industry would be a good measure of
the impact of shifts in consumption across supermarkets and brands from
relatively unhealthy to healthier food products.</p><p><a name="06071887000280">I regret that a number of
companies seem not to support that recommendation, in contrast to
leading supermarkets such as Sainsbury&#146;s and Waitrose. All
Members have received a letter from Danone, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 175</b><br>Kellogg&#146;s, Kraft, Nestl&#233; and PepsiCo, which want to go for
the guideline daily amounts information labelling. I think that they
are wrong in that regard and I wonder why they are taking that stance.
Their approach is in contrast to the Health Select Committee report,
the Government&#146;s recommendation and the FSA&#146;s report. The
FSA believes that a consistent approach to food labelling will make it
easier for consumers to eat more healthily and encourage consumers to
look for and demand healthier food products, and incentivise businesses
to produce foods that are lower in salt, sugar and fat content. I
regret, for instance, that Tesco has gone ahead and done its own thing,
which I believe is not in the public interest. I applaud the way in
which Sainsbury&#146;s supermarkets have introduced their own
multiple traffic-light scheme, or wheel of health , which works on the
principle of the FSA guidelines. Those symbols are now printed on the
front packaging of more than 2,100 Sainsbury products, including and
expanding on the recommendation list of items included by the FSA.
Research that has been undertaken by Sainsbury&#146;s found that the
wheel of health had influenced the purchasing decisions of
consumers.</p><p><a name="06071887000281">Regulations
on food labelling standards are currently set at a European level. The
proliferation of different formats of simplified nutrition labels is a
concern for consumers and the food manufacturers and retail industries
alike. On 12 July the European consumers&#146; organisation presented
the European Commission with the conclusions of a multi-stakeholder
discussion group that included representatives from national
Governments, industry, retailers and academics. I certainly support
those conclusions.</p><p><a name="06071887000282">The
FSA, supported by the NCC, <i> Which?</i> and the Health Committee,
recommends that industry-wide adoption of the single front-of-pack
signposting scheme should be voluntary, but it would be in favour of
mandatory take-up should this initial approach fail. Should a voluntary
scheme fail to find unanimity among retailers and manufacturers, I urge
the Government to step in to ensure an end to consumer confusion over
nutrition labelling. I commend the Bill to the

back on the exact date in the autumn. We are working on that at the

possible. We are also having discussions about a range of other issues,
including enforcement, and the Bill provides for the need to finance
and support local enforcement. It has been incredibly encouraging to
learn from both the Irish and Scottish experiences and from my recent
visit to New York, that on one level little punitive enforcement has
been necessary, although there will clearly be issues for those working
in this area, and that will be part of our discussions in the months

amendments includes all the changes to the smoke-free provisions made
in the other place. Amendments Nos. 1, 5 and 10 are all minor drafting
amendments. Amendment No. 1 corrects a minor drafting
inaccuracy&#151;strictly speaking, licensees do not authorise the
consumption of alcohol; they authorise the sale of alcohol for
consumption. Amendments Nos. 5 and 10 were introduced by Earl Howe, who
felt that the clarity of the drafting could be improved. We 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 179</b><br>saw no reason to object to his suggested wording in the other place, and
we are equally happy to support it
here.</p><p><a name="06071887000305">Amendments Nos.
2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 11 relate to exemptions in regulations for those
participating as performers in a performance in which artistic
integrity makes it appropriate for performers to smoke. In Committee, I
provided reassurances that the Government were minded to make an
exemption for artistic performances, but the detail, as with all
proposed exemptions, is a matter for the regulations.</p><p><a name="06071887000306">During the Bill&#146;s
passage through the other place,we realised that it would not
be possible to rely onthe general power in clause 3(1) to make
such an exemption in all circumstances. The prohibition on making any
exemptions for licensed premises in clause 3(3), which was introduced
following a free vote on Report, would have prevented any exemptions
for artistic performances in licensed premises. As we are aware, many
theatres and other performance spaces carry out their activities under
only one licence, which is likely to cover not only the whole of the
premises, but alcohol sales and theatrical performances. In those
circumstances, we realised that the prohibition in subsection (3) came
into play&#151;in other words, it would be unlawful to make an
exemption.</p><p><a name="06071887000307">We
introduced amendment No. 2 in the other place in order to relax that
prohibition so far as is necessary to allow certain performers to smoke
during a performance in all possible venues. The amendment also ensures
that the exemption can be applied only to the relevant performer or
performers. Of course, the detail of the exemption will still be a
matter for regulations. The consultation on the draft regulations that
was launched yesterday specifically asked for views on the exemption
proposed for performers, particularly concerning whether the
arrangements are adequate to prevent the development of
loopholes.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071887000473">5

Taylor:</b> This morning, the all-party groupon
smoking and health, which I have the privilege of chairing, discussed
this aspect of the regulations and sought assurances on whether the
exclusion would refer to rehearsals of the performance as opposed to
the performance itself. Can the Minister reassure us on that particular
point?</p><p><a name="06071887000309"><b><a name="06071887000675">Caroline
Flint:</b> Through amendment No. 3, we have left the door open
on exempting rehearsals, as we are still yet to be persuaded. We must
not forget that any exemption is for the performer, not the premises,
and that the smoker will be facilitated only when it is integral to the
plot or storyline. We must be clear that this exemption is not about
allowing certain people to smoke freely. From a purely practical point
of view, we must ask whether it would be sensible or practical to light
up and stub out cigarettes each time the rehearsal of a performance
stops and starts. We will seek to clarify that through the
consultation. As I said, I have taken note of the experience not only
of Ireland and Scotland but of New York and California, which have
exemptions in these artistic areas.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 180</b><br><p><a name="06071887000310"><b><a name="06071887000676">Mr.

Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 11 are consequential amendments.</p><p><a name="06071887000313">On amendment No. 4, there was
some concern inthe other place that the power in clause 4 to
make additional places smoke free was rather broad and could be used to
make all sorts of places smoke free even where there was no significant
risk of exposure to second-hand smoke. Given that we have consistently
made it clear that we will use this power only to protect people where
there is a significant risk of exposureto second-hand smoke,
we had no objections to amendment No. 4, which raised the threshold for
its use under the Bill. The amendment means that it would only be
possible to make an additional place smoke free where &#147;in the
authority&#146;s opinion&#148;&#151;that of the Secretary of
State in England and the National Assembly in
Wales&#151;</p><a name="06071887000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is a
significant risk that, without a designation, persons present there
would be exposed to significant quantities of
smoke.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000314">That wording
makes it clear that the power cannot be used in cases where exposure to
second-hand smoke is unlikely or very
limited.</p><p><a name="06071887000315">Amendment No.
36 makes any regulations to make vehicles smoke free under clause 5
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That issue was raised
in Committee, where I said that I would be inclined to think about it.
The Government tabled the amendment following the recommendation made
by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which noted
that the power in clause 5 could potentially be used to make private
vehicles smoke free. Although we have absolutely no intention of using
the power in that way, the amendment provides further reassurance, as
no regulations under the clause can now be made without the prior
agreement of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071887000316">On
amendment No. 12, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for
Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) for championing this cause
and to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George
Young) for doing likewise. Hon. Members may recall that clause 30 was
introduced on Report in the Commons, with cross-party support. It gives
the Secretary of State the power to raise the minimum age for sales of
tobacco products through secondary legislation by the affirmative
resolution procedure. When introduced, it specified that the age limit
could be changed only to an age not lower than 16 but did not specify
an upper age
limit.</p><p><a name="06071887000317">Concern was
expressed in the other place that the clause could allow the minimum
legal age for sales of tobacco products to be raised to 21. Although
that has never been our intention, we were happy to table 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 181</b><br>amendment No. 12, which specifies that the minimum age for sales of

occasionally been rocky, but I am happy to say that the rocks have been
mostly on the Government side. We recall the Home Secretary&#146;s
seminal contribution to the public health debate when he identified
smoking as one of the few working-class pleasures, the subsequent
discomfiture of the Secretary of State for Health and her handbrake

yesterday&#146;s publication of the draft regulations for smoke-free
premises and vehicles, in the nick of time for today&#146;s debate,
and the incorporation of much good sense, which emerged during the
Bill&#146;s passage. Much of the latter relates to small matters,
such as provision for specialist tobacconists and research and testing
facilities. They may be small but they are significant for those who
will be affected by the Bill, and we welcome the provision for
them.</p><p><a name="06071887000321">However, we
remain concerned about the lack of attention paid earlier to
enforcement costs, as evidenced by the invitation in the draft
regulations to comment on likely costs to enforcement authorities. That
has already been mentioned. To work, the Bill needs enforcement, not
simply encouragement. Clearly, little provision has been made for how
that might be done. That is regrettable.</p><p><a name="06071887000322">The licensed trade has asked
for as much noticeas possible of the definitive regulations.
That is fairand reasonable. I note that the consultation ends
on9 October and hope to revert to what may follow when we
discuss amendment No. 37.</p><p><a name="06071887000323">The British Beer and Pub
Association has asked for regulations that are easy to understand and
simple to apply. The draft regulations are perhaps less monstrous than
many but, as ever, the detail contains the potential trip wires. I note
the section on signage in the regulations and wonder how we can make
such a simple matter&#151;which surely requires little more than the
international no-smoking symbol&#151;so
complicated.</p><p><a name="06071887000324">Amendments
Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 deal with smoking and the performing arts.
They could properly be called the &#147;Howe amendments&#148;
because my noble Friend Earl Howe is largely responsible for them. I
hope that they will ensure that &#147;Carmen&#148;, the plays of
Noel Coward, Simon Gray, John Osborne and most of Ibsen do not have to
be rescripted. They are
welcome.</p><p><a name="06071887000325">Amendment No.
4 would introduce the test of significant exposure to second-hand
smoke. The Minister spoke a little about that but I believe that it is
an important amendment. Without it, appropriate national authorities
could ban smoking in public in almost any circumstances. I therefore
welcome the amendment. It is self-evidently wrong to ban an activity if
the relevant substance is not significant. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 182</b><br>With a sensible understanding of &#147;enclosed&#148; and
&#147;substantially enclosed&#148;&#151;which, we hope, will
emerge from the draft regulations&#151;the amendment should resolve,
for example, the bus stop dilemma that we discussed in Standing
Committee.</p><p><a name="06071887000326">We should
note that our understanding of &#147;significant&#148; may alter
with time as our appreciationof the health effects of
second-hand smoke evolves.Sir Richard Peto&#146;s evidence
to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee is germane to
that.</p><p><a name="06071887000327">We are indebted
to my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George
Young) and the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and
Mexborough(Jeff Ennis) for amendment No. 12, which deals with
raising the age for the sale of tobacco. In Committee, they were
trenchant supporters of the sensible proposal to raise the age to 18.
We await the outcome of the consultation on that with great interest.
We cannot raise the age beyond 21 as such a move is proscribed by
existing legislation, but I was reassured to hear that the Minister
would not wish to do so in any case. That we might have the potential
to do so is something of an historical anomaly. We are pleased that the
amendment would enable us to raise the age to 18 and no further. That
is clearly the correct provision for the 21st century.</p><p><a name="06071887000328">Amendment No. 36 will have the
effect of ensuring that regulations applying to smoke-free vehicles
must be made under the affirmative resolution procedure. Given the
scope for confusion implicit in clause 5, that seems very wise. We
still face the conundrum of the long-distance lorry driver, for
example. He might use his cab to sleep in at night, but the lorry might
occasionally be used by someone else. There is an element of confusion
about whether he would be able to smoke in the vehicle, and that needs
to be clarified. Bringing the measure before the House under the
affirmative resolution procedure will give us the opportunity to
explore the issue further.</p><p><a name="06071887000329">Another example that is
relevant at this time of year involves farmers in their tractors. Most
people would regard a tractor as a fairly well-ventilated vehicle, but
under the measure, the farmer would not be able to smoke in it because
of the possibility that someone else might use it subsequently. That
seems to cut acrossthe sensible notion of significance
introduced in amendment No. 4, which we very much welcome. I would be
interested to hear how the Minister reconciles the two
approaches.</p><p><a name="060718100000007"><b><a name="060718100000565">Steve
Webb:</b> The principal amendments in this group that I want
to discuss are amendment No. 2 and the related ones that deal with
smoking in performances and rehearsals. I was astonished to learn that
their lordships were attempting to table amendments to cover theatrical
performances and rehearsals. My initial reaction was to ask why the
actors could not just act. That would surely be a better response.
There would be no problem with someone holding a cigarette or having a
pipe in their mouth&#151;that is not prohibited by the Bill&#151;as
long as there was no smoke coming out of them.</p><p><a name="060718100000008">There was a suggestion in the
other place that Churchill could no longer be depicted on stage because
he would not be able to have a cigar between his fingers, which would
be nonsense, or that Harold 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 183</b><br>Wilson could not be shown because his pipe would be banned. That would
be nonsense as well. Surely the whole point of acting is to create an
illusion. We do not actually need to see smoke physically coming out of
the pipes or cigars. There was also a discussion about whether
non-carcinogenic herbal cigarettes could be used instead, as they
produce smoke that would not be so bad for people. However, that
possibility appears to have been ruled out as well.</p><p><a name="060718100000009">I cannot see why we need this
exemption at all. I notice that amendment No. 2 talks about
&#147;artistic integrity&#148;. If I were to go to see a play, and
I saw an actor smoking in circumstances that I did not deem necessary
to the plot, could I go to the licensing authority or the relevant
local authority to protest? Would that authority have a panel of people
who had been trained to judge whether the artistic integrity of the
play would have been impeded by the presence or absence of a cigarette?
It is nonsense to set people up in bureaucratic structures to judge
whether in a particular case it was, as young actresses say, necessary
to the plot.</p><p><a name="060718100000010">I am
reassured that the Minister seems minded not to allow an exemption for
rehearsals; otherwise, we could end up in the extraordinary situation
in which smoking was permitted&#151;although only by those characters
for whom the integrity of the plot required it&#151;until the moment
at which the director shouted, &#147;Cut!&#148; At that point, all
the cigarettes would quickly have to be stamped out. No one working on
the set would be allowed to smoke, but they would be allowed to inhale
the smoke from the actor who had just been performing. No one would be
able to smoke during the break, but they would be able to breathe in
the actor&#146;s smoke once the rehearsal started again. Those
working on the set would be able to breathe in smoke, but only if it
was someone else&#146;s.</p><p><a name="060718100000011">One of the beauties of the
legislation is that, in most cases, there is no room for doubt. It is
clear cut. We are not going to talk about the distance from the bar or
about rooms with ventilation. The Minister&#146;s argument throughout
was for a comprehensive ban with as few exemptions as possible so that
people would know where they stood and self-enforcement would be
easier. Yet here we are with this peculiar luvvies&#146; amendment. I
wonder what is behind
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060718100000560">5.15

pretty fair stab at a set of regulations. Does the hon. Gentleman
agree, however, that there are areas that might be further improved,
not least those relating to sports stadiums and railway stations, many
of which are not yet within the remit of the regulations, even though
substantial numbers of people have a significant risk of being exposed

we need above all is clarity. People need to know where they stand, and

3 would allow the regulations to include rehearsals. Perhaps the
Minister will regard this as a formal response to her formal
consultation on the regulations: please do not include rehearsals.
Whereas performances are a limited number of occurrences, allowing
smoking during a long run of rehearsals would be potentially much more
detrimental to the people who support the rehearsal
process.</p><p><a name="060718100000017">Amendment
No. 12 deals with not raising beyond 18 the age of sale for cigarettes.
We welcome that. Going beyond 18 would raise a much wider set of issues
because there are many other things for which 18 is a trigger age, and
it would not be satisfactory to try to change that by
regulation.</p><p><a name="060718100000018">The House
is, as you can see, Mr. Deputy Speaker, gripped by this set of
amendments. It is tempting to test the view of the House on them, but I
do not sense that we would get very far, so I probably will not pursue
the matter. However, I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s comment on enforcement. Amendment No. 2 refers to
&#147;artistic integrity&#148;. Who will judge that, and how will
they be trained to do
so?</p><p><a name="060718100000019"><b><a name="060718100000570">Caroline
Flint:</b> In considering the exemption, which can be very
tightly drawn, I had to consider what was sensible and how to act in
proportion to the risk involved. Different places have approached the
matter in different ways. Our exemption mirrors that in
California&#146;s smoke-free legislation, which has been held up as a
shining example many times during our discussions. I also touched on
the matter when I was in New York recently, as it concerns theatres
there.</p><p><a name="060718100000020">Hon. Members
have asked who will decide what is integral to the plot or storyline.
It will be for the performers and the management of the theatre or
premises to satisfy themselves that smoking is an integral part of the
artistic performance. Objections can be made to the enforcement
authority, which will then investigate the matter and decide whether it
wants to press the case. Ultimately, it is for the courts to decide
whether smoking can rightly be considered an integral part of the
artistic performance. We must not forget that the management of a
theatre will want to be convinced that smoking is integral. They are,
after all, responsible, by virtue of clause 8, for ensuring that
smoking does not take place inappropriately. Other jurisdictions have
found that they are able to enforce 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 185</b><br>such legislation, but the consultation process will give us an

further.</p><p><a name="060718100000021"><b><a name="060718100000571">Sandra
Gidley (Romsey) (LD):</b> I am a little unsure as to whether
the amendment would cover school plays. Would they be covered by the

under 16 to smoke?</p><p><a name="060718100000022"><b><a name="060718100000572">Caroline
Flint:</b> In relation to that tortuous description, I shall
look at the <i> Hansard. </i>Clearly, children under 16 are not allowed
to smoke, so a potential offence would be committed in encouraging them
to smoke. We have to grow up a bit about this. We must be realistic,
and not forget that the few exemptions in the legislation sit alongside
a real culture change in England, which is to be welcomed. Therefore,
we must consider where we can have most effect, and the Bill amply
provides for that.</p><p><a name="060718100000023"><b><a name="060718100000573">David

Flint:</b> My hon. Friend makes a helpful point, and I should
correct myself, because it is not an offence to smoke under the age of
16, but to sell cigarettes to those under 16. Given the number of
schools that have healthy schools policies, however, I do not think
that a single head teacher in the land would encourage
smoking&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>As the hon. Member for Northavon

driver. I remind the House that, in response to the consultation last
summer, the Road Haulage Association advised that most of its members
have smoking policies that prohibit smoking in shared vehicles and had
no objections to the main aim of the policy. I have listened to the

15 are technical drafting amendments, they are important nevertheless,
as they alter the definition of health care associated infection in the
Bill and relate to the scope of the code of practice. It has always
been the policy intention that the code can include requirements
concerning infections that are caused or exacerbated by organisms
already present on or in a patient&#146;s body at the time of their
entry into the health care environment. An example would be bacteria
that are already present on a patient&#146;s skin at the time of
their admission to hospital and that infect a patient during or after
surgery.</p><p><a name="060718100000033">We had
thought that the definition used by the Health Bill included such
infections, so that the Secretary of State would have been able to
include requirements relating to them in the code of practice. However,
on further reflection in the other place, we realised that the
definition used was capable of another interpretation that excluded
infections caused by bacteria present on the patient&#146;s skin
which subsequently infected the patient as a result of the provision of
health care. Such an interpretation would have meant that requirements
relating to the prevention and control of those infections would have
been outside the scope of the code of practice.</p>

<p><a name="060718100000034">We therefore brought forward
Lords amendments Nos. 13 to 15 to make sure that infections arising
from micro-organisms present on or in the patient&#146;s body prior
to the person&#146;s entry into the health care system are included

important. I believe that Lords amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 were
inspired by the Royal College of Nursing. They rightly recognise that
organisms already present on a person but not doing any harm can become
opportunistic pathogens in a health-care environment.</p><p><a name="060718100000036">We await the electronic code
of practice on the control of health care-associated infections. It
would be interesting if at some point the Minister could update us on

Flint:</b> I am happy to update the hon. Gentleman on where
the code of practice is, but first let me respond to what he said about
Lords amendment No 37. The amendment commences all regulation-making
powers on Royal Assent, and speeds up our ability to lay the
regulations by removing any need for us to lay separate commencement
orders switching on the powers. That does not allow us to do anything
that we could not already do via an alternative route. The alternative
route was laying individual commencement orders to switch on
regulation-making powers. We felt that that was too bureaucratic, and
that commencing the orders automatically on Royal Assent was much more
sensible.</p><p><a name="060718100000038">We have

amendment No. 23 limits when an &#147;authorised person&#148; for
the purposes of clause 19 can enter relevant premises which are or form
part of a private dwelling. It ensures that an authorised person may
only enter such premises if he or she is accompanied by a constable, or
in such other circumstances as may be prescribed by regulations. Lords
amendment No. 25 is purely
consequential.</p><p><a name="060718100000046">Lords
amendment No. 23 contains a power to prescribe circumstances in
regulations in which an authorised person will not need to be
accompanied by a constable. That is simply to ensure that if, for
example, a medical practitioner&#146;s surgery is separate from his
or her private dwelling but access has to be through the private
dwelling&#151;for instance, it may be on the ground floor of a block
of flats with a shared hallway, in which case it will be a private
space&#151;it will be possible not to require the presence of a
constable.</p><p><a name="060718100000047">It will
also be appropriate to use the power to exclude care homes from the

Hain):</b> I assume that the programme motion has been moved,
Mr. Deputy
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06071887000390"><b><a name="06071887000704">Mr.

Hain:</b> I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the
Lords in the said amendment.</p><p><a name="06071887000392">I believe that the package of
amendments that we present today forms the basis of a cross-party
consensus to achieve Royal Assent before the summer. The Government
have listened to debates in this House and particularly in the House of
Lords, where some major amendments were tabled. We have sought
agreement and I believe that we now have that on the composition of
Assembly Committees. The d&#146;Hondt formula is now, instead of
being up front, very much a fall-back option and on the backburner. It
is there if needed, but we hope that it will not be needed. We have
also made concessions on the name of the audit committee and,
importantly for all Oppositionparties and&#151;frankly
speaking&#151;for ourselves, on the membership of the Assembly
commission.</p><p><a name="06071887000393">The
debate on the details of the Bill has now been had and I hope that the
Conservatives will now join the other parties in Wales to make the new
powers work, and not pursue old arguments. I thought that it was very
apt of the former Plaid Cymru leader, Dafydd Wigley, to have told the
<i> Western Mail</i>
yesterday:</p><a name="06071887000456"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
hope both sides can give and take. To prepare for what happens after
next May, it is extremely important that the Bill gets through before
the recess.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000394">That is
indeed important. There are important preparations to be made for the
election and many orders to be laid in respect of the new internal
architecture of the Assembly. The Assembly officials and others want to
get on with that and, therefore, Royal Assent by next Tuesday is very
important.</p><p><a name="06071887000395">After that
brief introduction, I shall now address the amendments specifically. I
realise that the ban on dual candidacy is contentious with all
Opposition parties, but it is a manifesto commitment. Our 2005 general
election manifesto stated that we
would</p><a name="06071887000457"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;prevent candidates
from standing on both the list and in a constituency in order to make
all candidates genuinely accountable to the electorate and to end
Assembly Members being elected via the backdoor even when they have
already been rejected by
voters.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000396">That is a clear
commitment from a manifesto that we took to the country in May last
year and on the basis of which we won a resounding victory, certainly
in Wales and also in the rest of the country. It is a measure that this
House considered at length and supported by a considerable majority
earlier this year.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 192</b><br><p><a name="06071887000397">The proposals in clause 7 of the
Bill, as originally drafted, will strengthen the integrity of the
Assembly&#146;s electoral system and the legitimacy of regional
Assembly Members. They will put the voters in charge by enabling them
to reject a candidate who can currently get in through the back door
despite being rejected by the voters in a
constituency.</p><p><a name="06071887000398">I
appreciate that this issue has aroused strong feelings on both sides of
the House and concerns have been expressed, but I wish to draw the
attention of the House to the views of Lord Elis-Thomas on this matter,
the Presiding Officer of the Assembly since its establishment in 1999
and Plaid Cymru&#146;s former parliamentary leader. When asked
recently by the BBC about his views on the dual candidacy ban, he
said:</p><a name="06071887000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;every party has
selected under the system which is in the Bill and that, to me, signals
a bit of an hypocrisy to carry on fighting old battles, I find that
quite boring. So my main battle now is to try and get the structure of
the National Assembly under the new constitution and new bill in place
for 2007 because I don&#146;t want people wasting time, whoever the
Government is after 2007, by not being able to get things
done.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000399">He added
that</p><a name="06071887000459"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the debate and the
arguments have been
lost.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000400">That is a
significant statement. He
continued:</p><a name="06071887000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The politics
has been lost. What I&#146;m saying is that the big picture now is to
get the Assembly established, and a new constitution, because what we
have to do is to make it clear to the people of Wales that we have a
new democratic opportunity. That is the most important way to challenge
the Labour Party or any other
party.&#148;</p></ul><a name="06071887000436"><p>I
would be the first to admit that I have not always agreed with the
views of Lord Elis-Thomas in the past&#151;and I do not necessarily
agree with every word of that quotation&#151; but I believe that on
this occasion he was speaking with the best interests of the National
Assembly and of Wales at heart. He was speaking in a non-partisan way.
I know that he was not a supporter of the ban on dual candidacy, but he
has moved on and it is important that the House also moves
on.</p><p><a name="06071887000401"><b><a name="06071887000706">Albert
Owen (Ynys M&#244;n) (Lab):</b> I agree entirely with what
the Secretary of State said about the manifesto commitment and the fact
that we are talking about something that the House of Commons has
passed on numerous occasions. Does he agree that Lord Elis-Thomas is,
of course, a member of the House of Lords and that he accepts, and his
party accepts, in the House of Lords, that the supremacy remains in
this Chamber and in the House of
Commons?</p><p><a name="06071887000402"><b><a name="06071887000707">Mr.
Hain:</b> Indeed, although I am not seeking to deny that there
have been real improvements to the Bill as a result of debates and
arguments in the Lords and the amendments that have been moved there.
There has been a constructive exchange, which has partly resulted in
some of the important compromises that we have offered&#151;not on
dual candidacy, because that is a manifesto commitment. In line with
the Salisbury convention, I hope that the House of Lords will respect
that, because it is fundamental to the Bill and to the integrity of a
new electoral system for the Assembly.</p><p><a name="06071887000403">Lord Elis-Thomas knows better
than many the work and the preparation that needs to be done to enable
the Assembly to make a smooth transition next May to the new
arrangements, with a separate Executive and legislature. He does not
want that essential work to be 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 193</b><br>delayed by arguments over what his fellow Assembly Member, the Liberal
Democrat Peter Black, has described as a</p><a name="06071887000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;distraction from the real issues
in the Bill.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000404">The real
issues in the Bill are, of course, primarily concerned with giving
extra powers to the Assembly and also with making sure that it acts as
a proper legislature with an Executive who are accountable to that
legislature&#151;rather than a rather amorphous corporate body that
has not really stood the test of time.</p><p><a name="06071887000405">Royal Assent before the recess
is vital and I am grateful that the hon. Member for Chesham and
Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit
&#214;pik) have recognised the importance of that. The key immovable
deadline that we face is the Assembly elections next May. Considerable
consequential work is needed following Royal Assent and before the
purdah period before the elections. That includes elections and
disqualification orders, which need to be made in good time to set out
clearly the basis on which all parties and candidates need to organise
themselves and to allow adequate time for proper consultation with the
Electoral Commission. The Bill includes a power for the Assembly to
promote participation in and awareness of the elections&#151;meeting
an Electoral Commission recommendation. Clearly, there has got to be
sufficient time for that.</p><p><a name="06071887000406">Schedule 7 outlines the
Assembly&#146;s ability to make primary legislation if there were to
be a successful referendum. A key commitment is to fine tune that and
to bring forward an amendment order to ensure that it is complete and
accurate before the elections next May so that everybody is clear what
the new footing is on which the Assembly will start. A considerable
number of further orders are required&#151;about 14&#151;many of
which are fundamental to the separation and include provisions for
financing and staffing arrangements. They are critical when it comes to
delivering the policy in the Bill and have to be completed in good time
before the next elections.</p><p><a name="06071887000407">I hope that I have not taken
too many liberties in explaining to the House the importance of getting
Royal Assent by next Tuesday. If devolution is to continue to be a
success, and the Assembly to help to improve the quality of
people&#146;s lives in Wales, we need to move on&#151;to go
forward, not back. I urge Members to reject the Lords amendment and to
disagree with the Lords on this matter.</p><p><a name="06071887000408"><b><a name="06071887000708">Mrs.
Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</b> First, may I
welcome the Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box? It may be the
hottest day of the year both here and in Wales, but he always looks as
though he has been out in the sun rather a lot when he comes to the
House to grace us with his presence, so it is obviously weather that he
enjoys.</p><p><a name="06071887000409"><b><a name="06071887000709">Mr.

Gillan:</b> The Secretary of State took the words out of my
mouth. He appears to be suffering. I am sorry that he is having so much
aggravation with his legislation, both here and in another place. Of
course, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 194</b><br>it is not just this Bill that he is having a little local difficulty
with. I understand that there are negotiations on the Northern Ireland
legislation, which must be preoccupying him a great deal. We all
sympathised with him earlier in the year when he had to pull the
Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill. It must always cause a great deal of
difficulty in the office of the Secretaryof State when
legislation has to be withdrawn. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>
It was a pleasure to withdraw that piece of legislation&#151;good, I
am glad to hear that. We might be able to agree on that, but there is
no doubt that we are not going to reach an agreement on dual candidacy.
Notwithstanding any backroom deals that might have been done with other
parties, we will continue to register our objections by opposing the
provisions in principle. I think neither that the matter is boring, nor
that it is something that we can just
ignore.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071887000477">5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071887000411">It was always
apparent from the way in which this aspect of the Bill was approached
that a deal had been done&#151;it was a deal between Cardiff and
Whitehall&#151;to keep Labour Assembly Members happy and dilute what
they perceived to be real competition. In truth, it is competition that
Labour Assembly Members cannot stand. The Secretary of State is quite
right that various justificatory arguments for changing the electoral
arrangements in Wales have been laid out by him, the Under-Secretary
and Lord Davies of Oldham. However, it is worth having a look at them
because I would not want to admit for one moment that the argument is
lost. I think rather that the argument has been won, but that the
Government have rolled on
regardless.</p><p><a name="06071887000412">First, we
were told that the provision was a manifesto commitment. A manifesto
commitment is a statement of intent, or even a wish. A party that was
faced with the need to cling on to power by forming an alliance with
another party&#151;the Liberal Democrats, for example&#151;would
need to compromise on its manifesto commitments. Indeed, I believe that
that has happened in
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06071887000413">The Labour
party in Wales does not even need to enter into a coalition to give up
on its manifesto commitments. Page 5 of its 2003 manifesto,
&#147;Working together for Wales&#148;, said that in the next Welsh
Assembly term Labour
would</p><a name="06071887000462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Scrap
Home Care charges for disabled
people&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000414">However, on 15
February 2006, Dr. Gibbons, the Labour Minister for Health and Social
Services, said:</p><a name="06071887000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in view
of all that we now know, it is clear that we cannot put in place our
original plans equitably and
affordably.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000415">There we
have a manifesto commitment that was easily put
aside.</p><p><a name="06071887000416">That was not
even a one-off. &#147;Ambitions for Wales&#148;, the Labour
party&#146;s 2001 manifesto document,
said:</p><a name="06071887000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will
not introduce &#145;top-up&#146; fees and have legislated to
prevent them.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000417">Of course,
Labour broke that manifesto promise. It was only the Conservatives who
forced the Labour party to remove those charges from Welsh students
attending Welsh universities. The claim that manifesto pledges cannot
be broken really does not hold water as a cohesive argument. Such
pledges can be broken when it suits the Labour party.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 195</b><br><p><a name="06071887000418">Secondly, we are told that the
system is confusing to the electorate and that we do not want losers to
become winners. What nonsense is that? If the Labour party does not
want losers to become winners, why has it admitted Baroness Jones of
Whitchurch to the House of Lords today? If I remember correctly, she
was the losing candidate in the Blaenau Gwent constituency in the
general election. Labour Members say that they want losers to be losers
and not to become winners, but I am afraid that that rings pretty
hollow today. If the Labour party did not want losers to become
winners, why did it introduce a list system at all? On the death or
resignation of a sitting Member, the next person on the
list&#151;most arguably a loser&#151;automatically moves into an
elected position. The claim is paramount
nonsense.</p><p><a name="06071887000419">The
electorate are confused not about dual candidacy provisions, but the
multiplicity of the voting systems that the Labour Government have
introduced since 1997. We have the supplementary vote system for the
London mayoral election, the proportional representation list system
for European elections&#151;except in Northern Ireland, where there
is a different system&#151;and indeed the single transferable vote
system in Northern Ireland. I do not think that I need to go on. The
multiplicity of the systems is confusing voters who have been used to
first past the post. However, another change is proposed for Wales
after only a short
time.</p><p><a name="06071887000420">What is the
basis for the change? If it were based on fact, investigation,
consultation or popular demand, I could understand it, but that is not
the case. The only research that has been prayed in aid of the change
is that of the Bevan Foundation. Despite the foundation&#146;s
excellent credentials, that work was hardly its finest piece of
research. Such a small, isolated, Labour-purchased report should hardly
form the basis for electoral change. I have to tell the Secretary of
State that I have received no letters from people demanding a change. I
have heard no public outcry and have received no letters supporting the
changes that he wants to make.</p><p><a name="06071887000421"><b><a name="06071887000711">Mr.

Gillan:</b> I was not casting aspersions on the Bevan
Foundation&#151;I was just saying that I doubt that it is happy,
either with that small, imperfect piece of research or for it to be
cited as the sole support for electoral change in Wales. The foundation
has some excellent credentials, but that research is slightly lacking
in my view and, I believe, in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view, given
his admission.</p><p><a name="06071887000425">To
justify the changes, the Secretary of State said that there is
widespread, systematic abuse by regional Assembly Members. I have
challenged him to produce evidence, as has Nick Bourne, the leader of
the Conservative group in the Assembly. In a debate on this 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 196</b><br>subject on 27 February, I asked the Secretary of State whether he had
replied to letters that Nick Bourne had sent him on 4 November and 27
January. Since then, another letter was sent on 20 March. Of course,
there is no evidence of abuse, which is why, I assume, the Secretary of
State has not had the courtesy to respond to those letters. I am happy
to give way to him if he would like to explain why he has not done so.
Those letters are perfectly polite&#151;if he would like to look at
them, I have copies with me. It appears, however, that the allegations
of abuse are another fabrication to try to justify the self-serving
provision in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071887000426">There is a great deal of
opinion against the introduction of such a system, which operates
successfully only in Ukraine. The Electoral Commission was not
convinced of the need for change. In its submission to the Welsh
Affairs Committee, it
concluded:</p><a name="06071887000465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
light of the need to encourage voter participation at the Assembly
election in 2007, we would caution against any change that is perceived
to be partisan and could add to a prevailing distrust of
politicians.</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000427">On the
evidence available to the Commission...we do not believe that the
case for change has been made
out.&#148;</p><p><a name="06071887000428">The Electoral
Society Reform
said:</p><a name="06071887000466"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We urge
the Government to reconsider their proposal to ban dual candidacy, a
controversial and divisive argument for which the case has not been
adequately
made.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000429">During
the Bill&#146;s passage through the House, we heard from the
Arbuthnott Commission which, after 18 months of deliberation and
discussion, following the submission of evidence, including verbal
evidence, from a range of bodies and elected representatives at all
levels, concluded that there was no evidence that dual candidacy was
problematic for voters. Professor Sir John Arbuthnott
said:</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060718/debtext/60718-0996.htm"/>


<a name="06071887000467"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Banning
dual candidacy would, if you think about it, actually restrict voter
choice and potentially diminish the quality of constituency
contests.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000430">The commission
concluded that there was no case for change in Scotland, and there are
no plans to introduce the system there. If it is not good enough for
Scotland, why is it good enough for Wales? The Government have neither
consulted on, nor examined, the changes in a responsible or thorough
fashion. Indeed, in the 2006 annual report by the Wales Office, the
Secretary of State
said:</p><a name="06071887000468"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
third commitment was to prevent candidates from standing on both the
list and in a constituency in order to make all candidates genuinely
accountable to the electorate. The Government believes that following
two Assembly elections and experience of the Additional Members System
there was a need to modify the system to prevent candidates from
standing simultaneously in a constituency and on the regional
list.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071887000431">I assume that the
reference to making &#147;all candidates genuinely
accountable&#148; means that serving Assembly Members are not
genuinely accountable. It means, too, that none of the list Members in
Scotland, either before or after the next election for the Scottish
Parliament, are genuinely accountable.</p><p><a name="06071887000432">The Secretary of State is
suggesting that there are two classes of Assembly Member. That is
absolute rubbish, and it is not worth the paper it is written on. As I
said, the Government have not consulted or examined the changes to the
electoral system, or 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 197</b><br>sought consensus. They have not respected the principles of the original
devolution settlement in Wales but, as usual, they do things in Wales
that suit Labour party politics. I will not support that course of

elections will be held in about 10 months&#146; time. The Assembly
has done many good things for the people of Wales, but I believe that
turnout will be low, which is unfortunate for Wales and for democracy.
One problem is that voting in elections is affected by the enormous
publicity created by the media. Even at the general election, turnout
was reduced. The great bulk of the Bill that we have discussed in
recent months will not excite the people of Wales to increase turnout.
People vote when their lives are directly affected by an issue, whether
it is the health service, schools or local government. Constitutional
issues are interesting for politicians, but I am not convinced that the
people who elected me are as excited about them as we are in the
Chamber.</p><p><a name="06071897000005">I do not
understand for one second the reasoning of the hon. Member for Chesham

cited an Assembly manifesto commitment, but it wasnot an
Assembly commitment: it was a manifesto commitment made by Welsh
Members who stood for parliamentary election to the House of Commons.
She said that we should not break our manifesto commitments, and reeled
off a list of accusations, but she went on to suggest that we should
break that commitment. That is
nonsense.</p><p><a name="06071897000006"><b><a name="06071897000686">David

that argument, during the 18 years in which the Conservatives held
sway, he would not have dared to question anything that we included in
our manifesto. If we did not question things in manifestos there would
not be much point in our coming to the
House.</p><p><a name="06071897000007"><b><a name="06071897000687">Mr.

should debate the manifesto of the winning party, but there comes a
time when the upper House has to acknowledge that manifesto. My right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to the Salisbury
convention, and our manifesto could not have made the position clearer.
We wanted to change the rules on the Assembly, and people voted
onthat change. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham raised
the issue of consultation&#151;of course, those matters were
discussed at the general election, and were extremely prominent in the
run-up to that election. There was a party conference in Wales and
those matters were discussed by newspapers and television
companies&#151;whatever their views on them.</p><p><a name="06071897000008">The hon. Lady represents an
English constituency, so she would not know about these things.

those commitments, one of which was on the need to prevent the daft
nonsense of dual candidacy. I

electoral system in Wales, but that is an issue for another day. The
hon. Lady is entirely right that the daft system for electing people to
the European Parliament ought to be changed. The link between a Member
of Parliament and the constituents whom they represent in the House of
Commons is a jewel in the crown of our democracy. The added list needs
to be looked at, but for all sorts of reasons we are not in a position
to do that yet. At present weare abiding by that significant,
obvious manifesto commitment to change the rules on dual

it was utterly unacceptable for the Government to break their highly

relevant is that the House of Lords debated the matter, made the
arguments clear and voted accordingly. The matter has come back to the

understand that a deal has been done with the Liberal Democrats whereby
they will not challenge the House&#146;s decision in the other place,
so they will not stand alongside us on a point of principle. Quoting
the Salisbury convention is therefore almost pointless. Once a deal

that he thinks his Government should see through. He is quite willing
to see the utter abandonment&#151;the U-turn&#151;on other
manifesto commitments, such as on student top-up fees, when that suits
him. Let us remember that the Government could not have been any
clearer in 2001 about their opposition to introducing student top-up
fees and went on to blatantly break that commitment. When the right

will understand when I say that 35 per cent. support suggests to me
that 65 per cent. of people voted against their proposition. Even in
Wales, a majority of voters voted against the Government&#146;s
manifesto, so they cannot realistically cite in defence of their

Liberal Democrats have always maintained that the dual candidacy
debate, which has attracted the most attention in the media of all the
issues relating to the Bill, is not the single most important issue. It
is, in a sense, a secondary procedural issue which has attracted a
disproportionate amount of attention. The Bill is fundamentally about
devolution and the extent and quality of the powers handed down to the
Assembly. Nevertheless, since we are debating it and the Secretary of
State is inviting us to rehearse the arguments again, let us recall
briefly why there has been opposition to what he and the Labour
Government seek to
do.</p><p><a name="06071897000022">The Clwyd, West

stated that the current arrangement for dual candidacy</p><a name="06071897000664"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;devalues the integrity of the
electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive
to vote in constituency

because candidates who lose constituency elections can become Assembly
Members via the list. However, the Electoral Reform Society

Affairs Committee, Kay Jenkins, Head of Office at the Electoral
Commission,
said:</p><a name="06071897000666"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is
no evidence that the Clwyd West so-called problem has had any impact on

issue we could say has ever been raised with
us.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071897000026">In their evidence to

of course we know that that will not happen; we know that in the
competition of British politics, parties will attempt to gain seats
from each other, because that is how politics in this country works.
When the Secretary of State used in defence of the change the argument
that it would make it more difficult to do that, he was ignoring one
political reality above another. The argument on this entire matter has
not been persuasively made, and I hope that, even at this late stage,

much wailing and gnashing of teeth from Opposition parties about
winners and losers; looking around this Chamber, it is clear that we

Opposition parties&#146; arguments, it is surely unfair that a
person&#151;such as the leader of the Tories or the Liberal Democrats
in the Assembly&#151;who has been rejected by the electorate in a
constituency in the direct election can then gain a place at the top of
the top-up list and find themselves in the National Assembly. Indeed, I

top-up at the last Assembly elections&#151;is denied any seats as a
result of that. My own view, for what it is worth, is that we should
separate the first-past-the-post system from the top-up system so that
the results truly reflect the wishes of the electorate.</p><p><a name="06071897000053">It is a matter of some regret
to me that the Bill does not do that. However, I accept that my
Front-Bench colleagues have to gain the broadest possible consensus on
a constitutional Bill of this nature, and although I believe that my
proposals are right, they certainly would not produce a
consensus&#151;but then I have never been a consensus politician. The
fundamental issue is how we can make this system more effective and
more just. I believe that the amendment that my right hon. Friend the

deal of sympathy with that view. I do not believe in the PR system. I
happen to agree with him that a Member&#146;s representing first and
foremost the people who vote for him, rather than the political party
that put him there, is indeed the jewel in the crown of our electoral

that, they propose a subtle change to an electoral system that will
allow the overall principle to continue, instead of having the

would be an intellectually honest approach for Members who do not like
the PR system to take. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am quite happy to take
interventions. But instead, those Members propose a change so subtle
that very few people will understand it. This is where I begin to
diverge from the right hon. Member for Torfaen, because the reality is
that virtually nobody will complain that they wanted not this PR
system, but another one. We are used to receiving hundreds of letters
from our constituents about a variety of things&#151;from the
situation in the middle east to whether bears should be used in
circuses&#151;but I can honestly say that in my one year as a Member
of this place, and in seven as a Member of the Welsh Assembly, I have
not received a single letter suggesting that the current PR system is
wrong and should be amended. Nobody has ever come up to me in the
street and suggested that the system should be changed. I have heard
many people, including from my own association, say, &#147;Scrap PR
altogether&#148;, but I have never heard anyone suggest that this
subtle change to the system will make any difference to voter turnout
or anything else.</p><p><a name="06071897000057">So
one has to ask why the Government are going ahead with this proposal,
and the answer is that, yes, they are going to derive a straightforward
political advantage from doing so. They know perfectly well that the
minority parties benefit from the PR top-up system, so it is those
parties&#151;the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Conservative
party&#151;that will be most disadvantaged by the change that the
Government are pushing through, and which they know very few people
will understand. I am afraid that some of the reasons that they have
come up with for the change&#151;I tried to make a note of some of
them&#151;are absolutely pathetic. I have heard it said that AMs do
not like regional Assembly Members competing with them in their
constituencies, but those 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 205</b><br>who say that seem not to have grasped the simple fact that, even if this
change is made, regional Assembly Members will still be able to open an
office in, and put up a sign in, the constituencies of existing Labour
AMs, and some will still do so. If Labour AMs are doing their job
properly, they will have absolutely nothing to fear from regional
AMs.</p><p><a name="06071897000058">The regional AM
for South Wales East&#151;the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the
Welsh Assembly, no less&#151;has often tried to portray himself as
the AM for Monmouth. That never bothered me in the slightest, and do
you know why, Madam Deputy Speaker? Because everyone would scratch
their heads on reading his leaflets and wonder who the hell this bloke
was who was pretending to be the AM for Monmouth, when they all thought
that it was me. Such behaviour reflected rather badly on those people.
If directly elected AMs are doing their job properly, they have nothing
to fear from regional AMs who would like to think that they represent a
constituency.</p><p><a name="06071897000059">We have
heard it said that it is unfair that a directly elected AM should have
to contest an election against somebody who has already been doing the
job for a couple of years, and who has been pretending to be the AM for
the area. What this amounts to is that the Labour party, which has
enjoyed a political monopoly in Wales for decades, is just a little
upset at the fact that it is losing the advantage of incumbency.
Instead of fighting against candidates who do not have all the
advantages of sitting AMs or MPs, they are fighting against those who,
to some extent, have the same opportunities and the same access to
offices and leaflets, and they do not like it. They do not like
competition on an equal basis.</p><p><a name="06071897000060">The Government are pushing
through a change that they know will mean that regional AMs will be in
direct competition with members of their own party who are standing for
the constituency seat. That is why this change will undermine the
minority parties. The Government know the game and they do not want us
to explain it, but we all know that the reality is that a regional AM
will suddenly find themselves in direct competition with a colleague
from their own party who is standing for the constituency in question.
That is why the Government are pushing through this change. They can
smile and laugh, because they know that most people will be lost when
the change is explained to them. They know that the man on the
Pontypool omnibus&#151;if there are such things any more; that is
perhaps a debate for another time, but thanks to the cuts, many such
services are

This is a very serious issue, and on page 108 of the manifesto, there

giving way. The first
says:</p><a name="06071897000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In a
third term we will legislate for a stronger Assembly with enhanced
legislative powers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071897000070">Some
Opposition Members disagreed with that idea during our debates and that
is fine, but that is what our manifesto states. The second statement
is:</p><a name="06071897000672"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will

are going to do, and we have the support of this House. These days, I
am far more diplomatic than the Secretary of State on such issues. I
understand that we have these debates, and I am not really worried
about this legislation, but I am proud that we are standing by our
manifesto commitments. One cannot get much clearer than the third
statement:</p><a name="06071897000673"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Alongside

hon. Gentleman really expecting us to believe that the Labour party
voted for the proposed change, while all the other parties voted
against, because it wanted to help all the other parties and thought of
no particular benefit whatsoever for the Labour

have the opportunity in this Parliament to vote for a democratic
Chamber in the other place. That is where I stand on the House of
Lords. As I have said, the hon. Gentleman leads with his chin because
one of his colleagues is sitting in the Gallery, someone who has been
rejected on several occasions by the electorate of north Wales. I do
not think that that person or any others should be in the House of

what we were going to do and I am proud that we have adhered to that.
However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is perhaps too
diplomatic with regard to the status of the House of Lords. We know the
position. We have had great debates on Second Reading and Third
Reading, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 208</b><br>and we have carried the measure through with a huge majority. Now, the
House of Lords&#151;no one has elected its members&#151;feels that
it can overturn our decisions. This is a constitutional issue. I
believe that the Salisbury convention should be adhered to and that
Opposition Members should not support the other place. Instead, they
should vote for democracy. They should vote in accordance with the
Labour party manifesto, Labour being the largest party in this place.
We are entitled to govern on our

Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> The right hon.
Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) did not on this occasion pray in aid
the piece of research from Splott market. We had an exchange on that
during previous proceedings. The right hon. Gentleman said that he had
discussed the matter in a few pubs in his constituency. He was asked
questions about time and so on, but we will not go into that now.
Suffice it to say that, on any objective view, I do not believe that
there is any evidence upon which the change can seriously be put to us.
Opposition Members know that, despite the sterling efforts of the hon.
Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and the fantastic ground-breaking
piece of research that he commissioned&#151;it was not persuasive,
but ground-breaking nevertheless&#151;we have not been presented with
very much.</p><p><a name="06071897000081">The right
hon. Member for Torfaen said that he never did deals. For someone who
has been in high office in the north of Ireland, that is difficult to
understand. However, I am sure that, as always, he is telling the
truth. However, a deal was struck for the proposal to go through
between the anti-devolution Labour party and the pro-devolutionists.
That is what it is all about. It is a piece of red meat to keep those
who are against further devolution happy. That may or may not be
relevant to the debate.</p><p><a name="06071897000082">We had a sterling speech, if a
little ex-cathedra, from the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig). It
was interesting in that he showed that he does not want to see anybody
else getting elected in Wales other than Labour candidates. I believe
that that is his true position. At least he is honest enough to say it,
and I respect that.</p><p><a name="06071897000083">I
will not go through the evidence again because time is short and there
are other important issues that we must discuss. However, I will touch
briefly on one or two matters now. When the Secretary of State opened
the debate he said that the Queen must give Royal Assent to the Bill at
some time between now and Tuesday. The right hon. Gentleman detailed
why that must be so, and I am sure that everything he said was right.
He said that over the coming weeks and months there will need to be
several references to the Electoral Commission for discussions and, if
necessary, to vary regulations. On two occasions during his opening
speech he prayed in aid the Electoral Commission. Why then was the
electoral commissioner, Glyn Mathias, roundly ignored when he said that
he thought that the proposal would be a partisan move and that there
was no evidence to support it? Glyn Mathias commented on the research
that the commission had undertaken. He
said:</p><a name="06071897000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
issue did not figure in that research. We asked a whole series of

we came to the conclusion that we think that the case for change has
not been made.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071897000084">This is

hand&#151;the Arbuthnot report. It reached the same conclusion and
found that there was no evidence to suggest that this was an issue for
the public. In fact, Arbuthnot went further and suggested that dual
candidacy was anti-democratic. Perhaps the difference between Arbuthnot
and the Richard commission was that Arbuthnot was a cross-party
document and was consensual, whereas the Richard commission was a
Labour party inspiration which was there only to serve the Labour
party.</p><p><a name="06071897000086"><b><a name="06071897000730">Mr.
Llwyd:</b> I differ slightly from what the hon. Gentleman says
about Lord Richard. I think that Lord Richard did a sterling piece of
work and I would not level partisanship at him. However, I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The Arbuthnot conclusions were quite
different.</p><p><a name="06071897000087">I will not
refer to the various academics who have been referred to at length in
previous discussions, including Dr. Richard Wyn Jones and readers from
the Napier university. As far as is known, the only other system that
embodies the system that we are talking about introducing in Wales was
in pre-revolution Ukraine. If we want to adhere to standards such as
that, all well and good, but I ask must ask again where one might find
the evidence for this change in the law? I cannot see it. Other hon.
Members have referred to the Electoral Reform Society. There is a
welter of evidence against the proposed change. The only thing in
favour of it is the rather scant piece of research commissioned by the
hon. Member for Caerphilly. The Government have brought the proposal
before the House and have found that the only evidence to support it
was commissioned by a Back-Bench Member of Parliament halfway through
the proceedings. That is not persuasive.</p><p><a name="06071897000088"><b><a name="06071897000731">Mark

it? But others in different parties, others of no political affiliation
and other academics throughout Britain and beyond have looked at this
and come to the same conclusion. It is a partisan way of proceeding,
and that is what we are arguing about. I do not say that it would
necessarily benefit my party unduly, or indeed anybody else&#146;s,
but it will benefit the Labour party, and that is why I am concerned
about it. It is all very well referring to the Salisbury convention,

my belief is that it will benefit the Labour party. It is not me saying
so, it isDr. Scully, Dr. Wyn Jones and Dr. Weinstrob. I could
go on&#151;Sir John Arbuthnot. There are plenty of people to whom we
could refer. Those people are entirely without political connection,

this evening by the Opposition&#146;s contributions. The hon. Member
for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) seems to question the Salisbury
convention. She seems to pay no attention to that convention, under
which, for generations, the unelected House of Lords defers to a
manifesto commitment of the governing party in the elected House of
Commons&#151;a point ably made bymy right hon. Friend the
Member for Torfaen(Mr. Murphy). She seems to dismiss this. I
do not know whether it is a new Conservative party policy&#151;a
party that had just 30 per cent. of the vote&#151;that the House of
Lords should be able to trample over all the manifesto commitments of
the governing party, elected by the people to form the Government of

ago.</p><p><a name="06071897000098">Mention has been
made of Ukraine. The truth is that this issue has become controversial
right across the globe, from Canada to New Zealand, not simply Ukraine.
That evidence has been given at length in earlier debates in the House.
I am asked for evidence. In the interests of brevity, I did not quote
the evidence because it has all been quoted before, but I have a
fistful of quotes and evidence, from Lord Carlile of Burriew, the
former leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, speaking in the House of
Lords on15 June, and from Lord Richard, the chair of the
Richard commission, in testimony to the Welsh Affairs Committee on 25
October. This is about Wales, but mention has been made of Scotland, so
let us look at Scotland. The former Liberal Democrat presiding officer
of the Scottish Assembly castigated the abuse of the system, saying
that it had been thoroughly abused, and that was despite the code of
conduct in Scotland, which we do not have in Wales. I could carry on
providing all the evidence: there is the evidence of the chief of staff
of the Scottish Liberal Democrats andof the leader of the
Assembly Conservative group, on 14 June and again on 15 June. I could
also quote some academic
evidence.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071897000682">6.45

in some regions of Germany, double candidacy is expressly required, and
candidates have been permitted to run in both constituencies and lists
in Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Hungary and Russia, all of which have
had mixed Member systems running since the 1990s. Therefore the

in Wales the concern has arisen. I will tell her. I and my hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary, and my right hon. and hon. Friends, have had
meetings up and down the country. At those meetings there was more
burning anger among the public on this issue than on anything else.
There was 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 212</b><br>strong feeling on the need to put the voters in charge. That is the
fundamental democratic principle at stake
here.</p><p><a name="06071897000104"><b><a name="06071897000744">David
T.C. Davies</b><i>  rose&#151;</i></p><p><a name="06071897000105"><b><a name="06071897000745">Mr.
Hain:</b> I will give way in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06071897000106">The voters
should be in charge. If the voters kick somebody out in the
constituency, why should that person pop up on the list elected? That
is not the voters in charge; that is the party manipulating the system.
In almost every case, those whom voters rejected in the constituencies
in 1999 and 2003 popped up on the regional lists. That is why we are
asserting the basic principle of parliamentary democracy that the
voters are boss. If the voters reject somebody, they should not be
elected by the back door. People do not understand how on earth that
can happen and that is why we are correcting this widespread abuse. I
say abuse, because it is not just a matter of principle, it is the fact
that time and again we have seen regional list Members abusing the
system by coming into constituencies claiming to be the elected Members
for those constituencies when they are not. A Plaid Cymru Assembly
Member has presented a dossier on how to manipulate the situation in
the interests of her party, and that has been referred to at length in
the House. I could go on and on, so I will allow the hon. Member for
Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) to intervene to provoke me
further.</p><p><a name="06071897000107"><b><a name="06071897000746">David
T.C. Davies:</b> Many of us here are astounded that at these
many meetings that he attended there was so much anger about a
proportional representation voting system and yet nobody mentioned the
health service, the council tax or the lack of dentists. He said that
there was more anger about this matter than anything else. Is he living
on the same planet as the rest of
us?</p><p><a name="06071897000108"><b><a name="06071897000747">Mr.
Hain:</b> The hon. Gentleman is a vocal butjunior
Member of the House. I was talking about consultation on the devolution
Bill, on what should go into it, on the policy that should fulfil our
party commitments following the Richard commission&#146;s report. At
those meetings, people wanted to discuss the detail of what might
transpire in a Bill to follow the recommendation of the Richard
commission, which would command support across the House. That issue
was one of the most strongly felt&#151;indeed, there was bitter anger
up and down Wales. Look at the situation in Clwyd, West, where the
sitting Labour Member defeated all the candidates, who all got elected
nevertheless.</p><p><a name="06071897000109">As my
hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n has said, the Labour party
will be equally hit by the provision, which will not benefit any party
in particular. When we asked for evidence of how it could possibly
benefit the Labour party, the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C.
Davies) and others changed their tune and began to talk about
perception. We want evidence: where is the evidence that the Labour
party could benefit by putting the voters in
charge?</p><p><a name="06071897000110">I am grateful
for the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig),
despite the fact that he has never pretended to be an enthusiast for
more and more powers for the Assembly. He has worked with 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 213</b><br>me honourably and with great influence in framing the Bill, for which I
am grateful. I secretly sympathise with his advocacy of a
first-past-the-post system, but if we were to introduce one in this
Bill, we would hear even louder complaints of
abuse.</p><p><a name="06071897000111"><b><a name="06071897000748">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> If the Secretary of State and the Government
are so concerned about giving voters a choice, will they consider
creating open lists? That would allow the electorate to vote for an
individual rather than a party that then appoints an individual.
Without being party political, that would be a rational and reasonable
step forward, although I accept that it is not included in the
legislation that we are discussing
today.</p><p><a name="06071897000112"><b><a name="06071897000749">Mr.
Hain:</b> No; I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman and do
not propose to introduce such a provision at this late stage,
especially given the consultation across
Wales.</p><p><a name="06071897000113">In conclusion,
the basic point of the Government&#146;s position is that the voters
should be in charge, not the parties, and that losers should not become
winners. Why are the Opposition parties so scared of having to make a
choice between standing in a constituency or standing on a regional
list? The voters expect candidates to make that choice, and the
integrity of the system will be increased by it, especially because at
least six sitting Labour Members will be
&#147;penalised&#148;&#151;if that is the word&#151;along with
other party members. In my view, however, no one will be penalised;
indeed, I think that the voters will win.</p><p><a name="06071897000114">I welcome the point made by
Lord Ellis-Thomas, the presiding officer of the Assembly, who has said
thatthe argument has been won&#151;he has recognised the
reality&#151;and both former leaders of Plaid Cymru have made the
same point. We need Royal Assent for the Bill before the end of the
Session, and I hope that nobody will seek to frustrate that ambition
and that the Government&#146;s position will be carried
tonight.</p><p><a name="06071897000115"><i> Question

Lords amendments Nos. 21 and 22 and the Government motions to disagree
thereto.</p><p><a name="06071897000635"><b><a name="06071897001263">Nick
Ainger:</b> The amendments would limit the effect of the
powers to make retrospective provision in Orders in Council under
clauses 94 and 150, or in an order under clause
149.</p><p><a name="06071897000636">The
power in clause 94 is necessary to correct legislative competence
retrospectively when that would give proper effect to the intention of
Parliament and the Assembly, when not to do so could leave the law in
an unclear state, or when it could be detrimental to third parties if
that was not done. If the provision is used, it is likely to be to
correct a technical defect.</p><p><a name="06071897000637">Clause 150(4) follows the model
of sections 107 and 114 of the Scotland Act 1998. As Lord Evans of
Temple Guiting pointed out on Third Reading in another place, it was
necessary to make provision under those sections of the Scotland Act
when it transpired that a provision of the Regulation of Care
(Scotland) Act 2001 was considered to be beyond the legislative
competence of the Scottish
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071897000638">The Bill
provides that any provision of a measure that is outside the
legislative competence of the Assembly is not law. If another Act made
provision referring to that measure, it might be necessary to 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 218</b><br>amend that other Act as if it had never referred to the ultra vires
provision of the Assembly measure. As the Scottish example shows, that
will happen rarely, but the provision may well be needed.</p><p><a name="06071897000639">The relevant provision in
clause 149 relates purely to consequential amendments. For example, the
Secretary of State might need to amend a corresponding reference in
Northern Ireland legislation, which the Assembly could not
do.</p><p><a name="06071897000640">The Lords
amendments intend to ensure that such provision can be made only if it
is not to the detriment of those who have either benefited from or
acted in reliance on the law before such an order was made. The
Opposition case for that is based on an argument that the power could
be used to reverse the effect of court decisions and infringe
individuals&#146; rights. That concern is clearly important&#151;no
one in the House wants the rights of individuals to be arbitrarily
abridged. However, I cannot envisage circumstances in which that would
be allowed to happen. The safeguards that the Bill already includes
would prevent it.</p><p><a name="06071897000641">First, the Secretary of State
would have to act consistently with the Human Rights Act 1998.
Secondly, such provision cannot be made at the whim of the Executive.
If any attempt were ever made to abuse such a provision and use it in a
way that was detrimental to the rights of individuals, Parliament could
block it. All Orders in Council under clauses 94 and 150 and orders
under clause 149 that amend primary legislation will be subject to full
parliamentary oversight.</p><p><a name="06071897000642">The power to make retrospective
provision exists primarily to allow technical points to be tackled. Let
me make it clear that the Government would not make an order that
retrospectively altered a court&#146;s decision. If a future
Government were to try to do that, Parliament would block
it.</p><p><a name="06071897000643"><b><a name="06071897001264">Mr.
Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> What the
Under-Secretary said is not the same as the comments of Lord Evans of
Temple Guiting in his letter to Lord Kingsland. The letter stated that
he would not move goalposts by seeking to change retrospectively the
law on which a case was based while it was before the court and without
the leave of the court. That is not what the Under-Secretary said. He
went much further a moment ago. He said that, if a court decision were
to go against the Assembly or the Government, there would be no
question of changing it retrospectively. Those are two different
things. It is important for hon. Members to understand which we
mean.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071897000683">7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06071897000644"><b><a name="06071897001265">Nick
Ainger:</b> Let me continue with my argument. Such a provision
would never be used retrospectively to amend a court order, although it
could be used, depending on the circumstances, to deal with the results
flowing from a court&#146;s decision. I hope that that deals with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</p><p><a name="06071897000645">The Government
do not envisage the power tomake retrospective provision being
exercised exceptin very rare cases. While I understand the
thrust ofthe amendments, there are sound reasons why the
Government cannot accept them. There could be public interest
considerations in favour of making 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 219</b><br>retrospective provision. It is not right that the Government should be
prevented from taking the public interest into account in making
legislation. Furthermore, the amendments are technically defective and
would render the provisions that relate to retrospective provisions
inoperable.</p><p><a name="06071897000646"><b><a name="06071897001266">Mr.
John Gummer (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> As a Minister, I
always found that, when civil servants said, &#147;Minister, you have
to do this because there is a public interest requirement&#148;, it
was usually because they could not think of anything else. Will the
Under-Secretary give us a practical example of when the public interest
was so important that it necessitated what appears to many of us to be
an unacceptable
change?</p><p><a name="06071897000647"><b><a name="06071897001267">Nick
Ainger:</b> Yes, I can give an example. Let us imagine that
both Houses of Parliament agreed a measure that related to a position
following a public inquiry into the construction of a bypass. If, after
compulsory purchase orders and payments had been made, a defect was
found in the legislative competence, it would be in the public interest
retrospectively to set the record straight in legal terms to allow the
payments that had already been made to be retained, and no claims to be
made against the individuals who had received the money from the
compulsory purchase. That would enable the bypass to go ahead in the
public interest, and not to the detriment of the individual who had
received funds from the Government in exchange for the land. That is an
example of the public good benefiting from retrospective legislation
such as that for which clauses 94 and 150 provide.</p><p><a name="06071897000648">It is impossible to identify
with certainty all persons who could be in any way detrimentally
affected as a consequence of such an order before it was made. It would
therefore never be clear whether an order could lawfully be made, even
if there were an overwhelming public interest to do so. I therefore
invite hon. Members to reject the
amendments.</p><p><a name="06071897000649"><b><a name="06071897001268">Mr.
Grieve:</b> I am grateful that the Under-Secretary
acknowledged that the clause, which was amended in the other place,
raises serious problems. It is not common practice for the House to
pass measures that can apply retrospectively. Retrospective powers
enable the Government to interfere with private rights in a way that is
contrary to the principles of the rule of law in this country. For the
Under-Secretary to claim that the provision is simply a balancing
exercise under the Human Rights Act 1998 is an inadequate
response.</p><p><a name="06071897000650">The Human
Rights Act might be a basic safety net to deal with certain Governments
who do not have democratic practices or who have had them only for a
short period and do not enjoy the principles of the rule of law, but it
does not replace the rule of law. Private legal rights operate because
the rule of law says that they do, and because the judges say that they
do. Sometimes, we have had to face the fact that the people who benefit
from those rights appear to be remarkably undeserving of them. We have,
for example, had debates about lords of the manor who have enforced a
form of blackmail in respect of rights of way over common land until a
court judgment removed them. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 220</b><br>However, no one in their right mind ever suggested that that entitled
Members of Parliament to remove those people&#146;s rights
retrospectively, thereby depriving them of a financial
advantage.</p><p><a name="06071897000651">The
Government are contemplating a measure that is being introduced with a
desire to rectify technical omissions&#151;I fully accept that that
is their intention&#151;but that could have the unintended
consequence of depriving someone of a private legal advantage, because
it will be applied retrospectively. There is no suggestion in the
proposals that any compensation would be made to a person who was thus
adversely affected.</p><p><a name="06071897000652">This matter was raised in the
other place, and Lord Kingsland, who was speaking for the official
Opposition, suggested that these clauses should be removed altogether.
However, he was mindful of what the Government were trying to achieve.
The amendments that were eventually passed therefore sought not to
remove the retrospective power but to limit it by saying that such an
order could be made, provided that it was</p><a name="06071897000677"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not to the detriment of those who
have either benefited from or acted in reliance upon the state of the
law before the retrospective Order is
made&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071897000653">As an
issue of principle, the Minister cannot possibly contend that that is
an unfair provision. He might, however, say that the proposal would
have the consequence of making it impossible to pass such a
retrospective order. I can see his point. If that is his problem,
however, he is going to have to find a way of solving it, either by
specifying that anyone adversely affected would be entitled to full
compensation or by some other method. It is not good enough simply to
say that there will be a balancing exercise and that the measure would
be used only in cases where the public benefit appeared overwhelmingly
to outweigh the private advantage.</p><p><a name="06071897000654">Private law and people&#146;s
rights under the law are not about the balancing of public rights with
private advantage. Private advantage has complete supremacy. The
principle under which we operate in this country in maintaining the
rule of law is that if we interfere with someone&#146;s private
rights, as specified in the Human Rights Act and the European
convention on human rights, we must pay them compensation for doing
so.</p><p><a name="06071897000655">I am really
troubled to read the Government&#146;s approach to this matter. In
the letter that Lord Evans of Temple Guiting wrote to my noble Friend
Lord Kingsland, he said, with reference to the point at which the
provision would kick
in:</p><a name="06071897000678"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Secretary of State would have to consider any action carefully for its
compatibility with human rights. He would not move the goalposts by
seeking to change retrospectively the law on which a case was based
while that case was before the court and without the leave of the
court.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071897000656">That is why I
picked up the Minister&#146;s comment that the Government would not
seek retrospectively to alter a court judgment. When I challenged the
Minister on that, he started to back off a little. He left me with the
distinct impression that the Government might choose to act
retrospectively, before a case came to court, to prevent a person from
exercising his legal rights and to challenge an order that had been
made. He also left me with the distinct impression that there might be 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 221</b><br>circumstances in which, notwithstanding a court judgment, the Government
would still seek to apply the provision
retrospectively.</p><p><a name="06071897000657"><b><a name="06071897001269">Mr.
Gummer:</b> Did not my hon. Friend hear the explanation that
the Minister gave as an example of when it would be suitable to use
this power? When he gave that example, he showed that the Government
would be judge and jury in their own case. It would be for the
Government to decide whether the use of the power would interfere with
a person&#146;s private rights, and they would make that decision on
the basis of their own convenience. The Minister tried to dignify the
measure by talking about public value, but what he meant was the
convenience of the Executive.</p><p><a name="06071897000658"><b><a name="06071897001270">Mr.
Grieve:</b> My right hon. Friend is exactly right. This is
what troubles me so much about the measure. Lord Evans of Temple
Guiting&#146;s officials had clearly advised him very carefully when
he wrote that letter. He expressed himself in terms so precise that,
when Lord Kingsland looked at it, he said that he was wholly
dissatisfied with the answer. The Minister has gone slightly further,
but my right hon. Friend is correct. What the Minister is actually
saying is that the Government will decide, when balancing the
considerations involved, whether a private right would be interfered
with. That must raise the possibility that, as long as the Government
did not think that the private right in question did not involve too
serious a matter&#151;so that it might slip outside the ambit of the
European convention on human rights&#151;they would still feel
justified in going ahead and applying the provision retrospectively. I
am very happy with the ECHR, but it is simply a safety net in this
context. Our practice in this country is not to allow such things to
happen. Indeed, it would be quite contrary to every legal principle to
let this occur.</p><p><a name="06071897000659">I am
fairly unsympathetic to the principle behind all this. I have to be
honest about that. I believe that government by statutory instrument is
riddled with problems such as these, and an Order in Council is no
different from a statutory instrument; it just involves different
wording. The reality is that Wales is going to be governed by Order in
Council, a practice that I regard as absolutely abominable and an
offence to every principle that we have in the House.</p><p><a name="06071897000660">If the Government go ahead with
this measure, I foresee that they might need to address certain
problems. May I suggest to the Secretary of State and the Minister,
both of whom are in the Chamber, that if they want to get this
provision on the statute book but do not like the form of words that
the Lords have come up with, they should make a clarifying statement to
make it absolutely clear that if it is established that private legal
rights are affected retrospectively in any way, the person affected
will be entitled to redress. Without that assurance, I will remain
profoundly unhappy about this proposal.</p><p><a name="06071897000661">This is a classic example of
administrative convenience triumphing over private rights, all dressed
up, in good new Labour style, in the assertion that it is for the
public benefit. I do not accept that. What is more, the Government know
that they are on pretty shaky ground here. I urge the Minister to go
away and think again.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 222</b><br><p><a name="06071897000662">In the other place, the Liberal
Democrats appeared to support us on this issue, and I hope that that
will remain the case. It was unclear, however, when the vote was
called, whether they were really going to provide proper support in
that important Division. Some of them said they would support us but
did not. I have no idea why that happened. I hope that it is not part
of the Lib-Lab pact on this issue, by which the Liberal Democrats have
demeaned themselves in the course of the discussions on this important
constitutional measure.</p><p><a name="06071897000663">We will certainly resist the
motion to disagree with the Lords amendment, although I have no doubt
that the Government will carry the day. If the Secretary of State and
the Minister do not like the form of words that the Lords have used,
they should go back and provide proper reassurance when the Bill
returns to the other place that the provision will not be left in the
form to which they now wish to return
it.</p><p><a name="060718100000061"><b><a name="060718100000589">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> I am interested to hear talk of a Lib-Lab
pact. I presume that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is
referring to two parties working together in the common interest, just
as the Conservatives and the Labour party did when they voted together
to take us to war in Iraq. What is going on here, however, is a genuine
commitment to furthering democracy and devolution in Wales. I almost
said Northern Ireland then, because I saw the Secretary of State
leaving the Chamber, no doubt to deal with other important
matters.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060718100000562">7.30
pm</h5><p><a name="060718100000062">Our concern
is, to an extent, the same as that described by the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield, namely, that retrospective legislation is open to attack
on the basis that it can be abused. Something achieved by an individual
or an organisation acting in good faith, on the assumption that the law
is there to protect them, can be modified by the institutions of
Government to favour themselves. That point was made by Lord Thomas of
Gresford in the upper House. He
said:</p><a name="060718100000556"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
person may engage in litigation and say, &#145;I&#146;ve
won.&#146; Then the Assembly may pass a measure that says,
&#145;No, you haven&#146;t, you&#146;ve lost&#148;, because
they have retrospectively changed the provision on which his claim
rested.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718100000063">That has been
my concern, too, and it may be why the hon. Member for Beaconsfield
could see an uneasiness among Liberal Democrat peers during that
debate.</p><p><a name="060718100000064">No doubt the
hon. Gentleman will also have read the further debate in the upper
House on this matter and the dialogue between Lord Thomas of Gresford
and Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, in which Lord Thomas challenged the
Government to clarify two things. I hope that the Minister, by way of
intervention or in his concluding comments, will respond explicitly to
these points. Lord Thomas&#146;s concern was that it had to be
underlined that the power would be used only to correct situations in
which a measure had been made that was ultra vires through no fault of
people acting in good faith and, presumably, within the law. I note
that Lord Evans responded that that was correct.</p><p><a name="060718100000065">I would like the Minister
explicitly and for the record&#151;we know that the record can be
used in a court of law&#151;to underline that that is his
understanding of 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 223</b><br>the Government&#146;s intention, and that it would be utterly
unacceptable for the legislation to be used for any self-seeking
purposes by an Administration&#151;not Labour, Conservative or
Liberal Democrat, but any Administration in the Welsh
Assembly.</p><p><a name="060718100000066">The second
specific concern expressed by Lord Thomas of Gresford related to the
question whether the Assembly could use the legislation to remove from
a litigant a victory achieved in litigation. Once again, Lord Evans of
Temple Guiting underlined the point that it would not be acceptable
under any circumstances for the Welsh Assembly Government to reverse
successful actions by litigants by using the Bill as a blocking
mechanism to change legislation retrospectively. I seek the
Minister&#146;s assurance&#151;once again, for the sake of the
record&#151;that that is explicitly the Bill&#146;s
intention.</p><p><a name="060718100000067">I
recognise that however hard we try to close these loopholes, there is a
danger of abuse of any legislation. Despite the assurances given to
Lord Thomas of Gresford on those two points in the upper House, and in
anticipation of the Minister underlining them today, I acknowledge that
we are still vulnerable to the abuse of power by individuals in
government or whole Governments, should they be so minded. We are
talking about a limited insurance policy here, but it is probably the
most that we can ever expect when we are discussing
legislation.</p><p><a name="060718100000068">The hon.
Member for Beaconsfield usefully requested that the Minister put on the
record some form of words to encapsulate the assurances that we seek. I
suggest that one of the best forms of words is offered by Lord
Kingsland, who tabled an amendment debated in great detail in another
place. It would have inserted the
words:</p><a name="060718100000557"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;provided that
such an Order is not to the detriment of those who have either
benefited from or acted in reliance upon the state of the law before
the retrospective Order is made&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 13 July 2006; Vol. 684, c.
840-41.]</p></ul><p><a name="060718100000069">It strikes me that a
small modification to that amendment, expressed by the Minister, could
be helpful without in any way being detrimental to what the Government
are seeking to do.</p><p><a name="060718100000070">It would be helpful if the
Minister confirmed that the Government want to modify the legislation
as they have set out, but also explicitly to require such an order not
to be to the detriment of those who have benefited from, or acted in
reliance upon, the state of the law before the retrospective order was
made. That would be a very helpful clarification. I can see no
contradiction between the Bill as it has been put forward by the
Government and the intentions as they have been reasonably expressed by
the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield.</p><p><a name="060718100000071"><b><a name="060718100000590">Mr.
Grieve:</b> May I point out&#151;the hon. Gentleman may
already be aware&#151;that that is exactly what the amendments passed
in the House of Lords say? They do not seek to knock out the power to
make the retrospective legislation; they seek to insert that very form
of words. The Minister says that that presents difficulties. The hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) may agree with me that
in those circumstances the solution is for the Minister to find a form
of words that meets the spirit of what has been said, but does not have
those difficulties attached to it.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 224</b><br><p><a name="060718100000072"><b><a name="060718100000591">Lembit

the amendment tabled by Lord Kingsland, so the hon. Gentleman and I
violently agree that that is the source of my recommendation.</p><p><a name="060718100000073">Although I see the force of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument about the amendment, I have, on
reflection, accepted the Government&#146;s point that this
retrospective latitude is probably, in limited circumstances, desirable
and that it could be compromised were the Lord Kingsland amendment
included in the Bill. However, I believe that its wording, as a
statement of clarification, would be both helpful and consistent with
the intent of the amendment. It would not in any way detract from the
applicability of the retrospective facility in those areas where it
could legitimately be used.</p><p><a name="060718100000074">I ask the Minister those three
questions&#151;including the two from Lord Thomas&#146;s inquiry in
another place, which I have recited&#151;and ask whether he is
willing to reiterate the words in Lord Kingsland&#146;s amendment by
way of clarification and reassurance on this reasonable and very
specific point, to protect the interests of those who might otherwise
be concerned that they would be harmed unfairly by the application of
this retrospective
facility.</p><p><a name="060718100000075"><b><a name="060718100000592">Mr.
Gummer:</b> The whole House should be grateful to the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) for explaining to the
world the Liberal Democrat approach to a complicated matter. It is to
discuss it in as many ways as possible and to give no hint whatsoever
as to how one should proceed
thereafter.</p><p><a name="060718100000076">There is
a real problem in debating whether to disagree with the Lords amendment
in that we are debating a virtual Bill. Many of us, although perhaps
not all Members on this side of the House, believe that an extension of
the powers of the Welsh Assembly is a good thing, but we would wish it
to be presented to the people of Wales so that they could make up their
mind. All this is a mechanism for trying to avoid asking the people of
Wales whether they want what is in the Bill, in case they say that they
do not want it. We get to this point and that becomes even clearer
because the Government have now discovered that directing the affairs
of a nation by Orders in Council has a number of disadvantages, and
there may be occasions when overlapping jurisdictions and particular
facts mean that a bit of tidying up is necessary.</p><a name="060718100000554"><p>I am always worried when
Governments present their proposals as modest. I am always worried when
they seek to suggest that there really is not very much in the
measure&#151;it is a matter of convenience that may be for the
national good and those of us who are concerned about the principle of
retrospection really should not worry about
it.</p><a name="060718100000555"><p>There
seems to me to be three reasons why we should worry very much. First,
there is the Government&#146;s historic attitude towards
retrospection. In two successive Finance Bills, they have introduced
retrospection while pretending that it was not retrospection. That
leads me to be suspicious when the word &#147;retrospection&#148;
comes from this Government&#146;s mouth. Secondly, when the
Government explained what they meant by the occasions on which they
might use the provision, they produced an argument that seemed to
nullify their own case. Let me turn to what the Minister said about the
road that might have been 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 225</b><br>built and the compensation that might have been paid. It seems to me
that the Minister would decide not according to what was in the public
interest, but according to what was convenient for the Government. It
would be very inconvenient for the Government to have to go through the
whole process again, but it might be very good for them because it
might stop them getting into that kind of mess again. That is what
legislation is about&#151;setting the rules. If one breaks the rules,
one should not have a nice little backdoor mechanism of letting off the
Government. The Government should have to fight their end, like anyone
else, and in the course of doing so find that there were matters that
were detrimental to private interest, and issues that ought to be taken
up. All that would be hidden by this nice little trick, which is used
by Government to make their life easier.</p><p><a name="060718100000077">Thirdly, if the words of my
noble Friend Lord Kingsland are not accepted, that means that the
Government will not stand by the content of that amendment. The
Government are therefore sayingthat they might use
retrospection when it overpassed the private rights of an individual,
as defined in the Kingsland amendment. The Government must deal with
that problem. On the one hand, the Government say that they would only
use such powers on occasions when that would not affect individuals who
would otherwise have been in a different position had the law as they
thought it was continued. On the other, they are not prepared to
include that provision in the Bill, as that is what refusing to accept
the amendment means.</p><p><a name="060718100000078">With cunning ingenuity, the
Liberal Democrat spokesman has discovered a way through. If the
Government say that they believe that the amendment is right, he says
that he will be happy. Well, if the Government can say that the
amendment is right while at the same time advising the House to vote
against it, that seems a peculiar position. I would not advise the
Minister to take that line. Only a Liberal Democrat could get himself
into that position. Only the party that on one doorstep tells people
that it believes in one thing, and on the next doorstep
that&#151;</p><p><a name="060718100000079"><b><a name="060718100000593">Madam

right hon. Gentleman. He and I usually agree in the Chamber. Did he not
hear my point about the difference of opinion between us? I suggested
that I was persuaded that the amendment, were it adopted, would make
the legislation difficult to apply. Therefore, while I am enjoying his
contribution&#151;and were we on &#147;Just a Minute&#148; I
would give him a point&#151;does he accept that it is a judgment bout
what works as legislation that causes me to make this suggestion

Gummer:</b> I am still bemused because the hon. Gentleman is
now saying that were the amendment carried, the clause would be
difficult to use. He therefore wants the Minister to say on the record
that he accepts the amendment, so that, in his language, it could be
used in court, but he does not want the Minister to include it in the
Bill. If including it in the Bill would make the legislation difficult
to use, how would such a statement by the Minister make it any easier
to use, or have I missed his point?</p><p><a name="060718100000084"><b><a name="060718100000597">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Yes, the right hon. Gentleman has missed it.
There is no point in pursuing a dialogue with him any further, as it is
for the Minister to explain. In my judgment, however, while
Kingsland&#146;s amendment was a good descriptor of the intent of the
legislation, it was not a well phrased
amendment.</p><p><a name="060718100000085"><b><a name="060718100000598">Mr.
Gummer:</b> I would therefore advise the hon. Gentleman
to suggest something different. I suggest that he says to the Minister
that he will vote against the Government upholding the amendment unless
the Minister comes forward with a promise that he will find another
form of words that enables the sense of my noble Friend Lord
Kingsland&#146;s proposition to be maintained, but without the
disadvantages that he asserts are there, and to which the hon.
Gentleman happens to agree. That would be a convenient way
forward.</p><p><a name="060718100000086">I have one
further comment to make. I do not believe that we should have any
possibility of retrospective legislation. Certainly, retrospective
legislation by Order in Council and Government fiat is never
acceptable, even if it might be convenient. I wish the Government to
consider the history of this House and our constitutional arrangements,
and I point out that the strength of our defence against retrospective
legislation distinguishes us from other countries. For that precise
reason, we can say that the rule of law is more firmly rooted here than
anywhere else.</p><p><a name="060718100000087">The
Minister may think that this is a small matter, but it is in fact a
most important principle. It would help him and us if he were to
promise to produce a better form of Lord Kingsland&#146;s proposal so
that this issue does not hold up the Bill. I am sorry that the
Government produced the Bill and that they did not offer the choices
publicly to the people of Wales. Instead, he and others have had
furtive back-of-the-room discussions. He promised to do it in that way,
however, and I would prefer to have the Bill in those circumstances
than not to have it at all. In my view, however, he cannot have the
Bill if he wants retrospectivity without protections, as he does at
this
moment.</p>

Ainger:</b> I note that the right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal (Mr. Gummer) is fundamentally opposed to any retrospection in
legislation. He also said, however, that the use of Orders in Council
was a back-door method, a trick and so on. Let us consider how the
process would work in principle.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 227</b><br><p><a name="060718100000089">Were a measure identified as
defective, or being used in a way that was ultra vires, the Assembly
would have to propose an order that would come to this place for
pre-legislative scrutiny. Once the measure had been
scrutinised&#151;I am sure that at that stage any individuals who
might be affected by it would make their views known&#151;it would
have to return to the Assembly with any suggested amendments. The
Assembly would have to abide by the European convention on human
rights; it could then send the House of Commons a draft measure which
would be debated in both
Houses.</p><p><a name="060718100000090">Given all
those checks and balances, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that
the proposal is intended only to correct any technical defects and deal
with any issues that are ultra vires. I can also assure him, as did my
noble Friend Lord Evans, that the Orders in Council and the ultimate
Assembly measure could not overturn a court decision. I hope he
appreciates
that.</p><p><a name="060718100000091">What concerns
everyone&#151;I understand the concern&#151;is the possibility
that, in principle, an individual&#146;s rights could be affected.
Let us consider what has happened in Scotland. Since 1998 this
provision has been used once to deal with an ultra vires issue, a
technical defect in legislation passed in the Scottish Parliament. That
is why we want the clauses to remain as they
are.</p><p><a name="060718100000092">I hope I have
been able to reassure the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit
&#214;pik) that the proposal is intended to deal with technical
defects and issues that may turn out to be ultra vires, that there is
no intention of using the procedure to overturn any court decision, and
that the rights of the individual will be
protected.</p><p><a name="060718100000093"><b><a name="060718100000600">Lembit

have either benefited from or acted in reliance upon the state of the

Ainger:</b> I cannot use those terms, because it is not
possible to use them. I can only tell the hon. Gentleman that the
rights of the individual, about which everyone is concerned, will be
protected by the very process of the Orders in Council. People are
rightly concerned, but as I have said, the provision has been used only
once in Scotland since 1998, and it is intended to deal with technical
defects.</p><p><a name="060718100000095">I think that
we have got hung up on the example given by Lord Kingsland. I do not
know whether it is such a good example. I have responded to what he
said about a bypass and compulsory purchase. There is no way in which
an individual&#146;s rights would be overturned, and a demand be made
that he pay back the money. The Government and the Assembly will
certainly take the individual&#146;s rights into account, although
there may well be rare occasions on which action must be taken for the
sake of the wider public
good.</p><p><a name="060718100000096"><b><a name="060718100000602">Lembit

Lords in the said amendment.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 232</b><br><p><a name="060718123000007">This amendment removes the
Secretary of State&#146;s discretion over how and when to lay a draft
referendum Order in Council before Parliament if the Assembly passed
such a request on a two-thirds vote. The purpose of clause 103 is to
ensure that the Secretary of State responds to a request from the
Assembly within a proper timescale. It is right that such a request
cannot be simply sat
upon.</p><p><a name="060718123000008">The effect of
this amendment, however, would be to compel the Secretary of State to
lay a draft order before Parliament within 120 days. I recognise the
concern that the Secretary of State&#151;perhaps one less charitable
towards devolution than I&#151;should not be able to obstruct the
will of the democratically elected Assembly and that for the Liberal
Democrats, that is a particular point of principle. I understand that
fully. The commitment of the Liberal Democrats to devolution and to
primary powers for Wales is long established, and I fully understand
the concern that a move to primary powers should not be frustrated by a
hostile Secretary of State. I would not support that myself, but of
course I am sympathetic to primary powers and always have been.
However, if any Government were bent on frustrating the will of the
Assembly, this amendment would not be enough to stop them.</p><p><a name="060718123000009">A hostile UK Government could
always resort to primary legislation. After all, Parliament is
sovereign. The real safeguard&#151;I know that the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) has real concerns about this
point&#151;is political. Any governing party in London that sought,
arbitrarily or on some point of dogma, to block a decision by two
thirds of Assembly Members in Cardiff would pay a heavy political
penalty. They would be run out of town, just as the Conservatives were
in 1997 for similar
behaviour.</p><p><a name="060718123000010">I respect
the intentions of the Liberal Democrats and others who proposed the
change, but I do not believe that this amendment will achieve the
desired outcome as effectively as the Bill as it currently stands does.
If a Secretary of State were wilfully to attempt to thwart the clear
will of the elected representatives of the people of Wales, after a
referendum request had been given full and detailed consideration by
the Assembly, and approved by at least two thirds of Assembly Members,
the consequences would be grave, both politically and constitutionally.
There would be a real crisis and the Secretary of State would clearly
be in the wrong.</p><p><a name="060718123000012">The
Government&#146;s objection to this amendment is not because we wish
to aggrandise the role of the Secretary of State. Nor do we wish to put
in place some kind of mechanism for thwarting a two-thirds majority of
the National Assembly. Indeed, I do not see a real difference of
principle between the concerns expressed in the House of Lords and by
the hon. Gentleman and other Liberal Democrats, and the
Government&#146;s position. It is a question of how to achieve the
same end, and we do not think that the amendment is constitutionally
appropriate. I shall explain
why.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060718123000711">8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="060718123000013">If an order is
to be laid before Parliament, that is properly a matter for a Minister
of the Crown. It would not be constitutionally appropriate for the
Assembly to be able to</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 233</b><br><p><a name="060718123000014">force the Secretary of State to lay a
draft order before Parliament, regardless of whether the Secretary of
State was even ready to do so. The Secretary of State, as a member of
Her Majesty&#146;s Government, cannot be accountable both to
Parliament and to the Assembly. The Secretary of State&#151;for that
matter, any Minister of the Crown&#151;is accountable to this House
and to Parliament. He cannot at the same time be accountable to an
Assembly. That is the clear issue at stake. However, the intention of
this provision is not to create a new roadblock. As I have said, the
Secretary of State would be likely to face irresistible pressure to lay
the Order in Council. Nonetheless, the Government believe that it is
important to maintain proper lines of constitutional
accountability.</p><p><a name="060718123000015">There are also genuine
practical reasons why the Secretary of State should not be constrained
to lay a draft order within 120 days. He or she would still have to
comply with the requirements of clause 102 before doing so, including
the preparation of the draft order itself and a statutory
consultation&#151;a point made very persuasively by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). The draft order would have
to be laid before the Assembly before it was laid before Parliament.
The amendment would leave no scope whatsoever to alter that timescale,
should it not prove possible to complete all those steps within 120
days. The amendment does not take account of those practical
considerations, of the requirements of clause 102 or of the obvious
point about parliamentary sovereignty and accountability. I repeat that
the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament, not to the
Assembly, although I would certainly want to act in keeping with the
wishes of a two-thirds majority of the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="060718123000016"><b><a name="060718123000719">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> I have listened to the Secretary of
State&#146;s comments with great interest and I acknowledge that he
is genuinely attempting to acknowledge the concerns as highlighted by
my Liberal Democrat colleagues in the other place and others. To an
extent, his remarks have been reassuring and helpful. However, he has
not answered the underlying question. Why not give the full authority
to call and plan a referendum to the Welsh Assembly? Why does the
Secretary of State need to have any role in that procedure? I
understand that this Secretary of State thinks that that is necessary,
but I would be interested to know his
rationale.</p><p><a name="060718123000017"><b><a name="060718123000720">Mr.
Hain:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention and I appreciate the open-minded and constructive way that
he has sought a resolution to this and other outstanding points in a
way that will allow the Bill to receive Royal Assent by the end of next
Tuesday. If primary powers were to be granted, it would be by decision
of this Parliament. The Assembly cannot grab the initiative. It is for
Parliament to decide whether it is right for the Assembly to have
primary powers. I hope that all parties will help the Bill to receive
Royal Assent through their response in the House of Lords next Monday
and that they accept the principle that Parliament cannot accept the
decision on calling a referendum to trigger the primary powers&#151;a
fundamental step&#151;being taken by anyone other than this House and
the House of Lords.</p><p><a name="060718123000018">I
am trying to be as helpful as I can be to the hon. Gentleman, because
he has sought to improve the Bill, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 234</b><br>not to block it or wreck it, in great distinction to the behaviour of
the Conservative party throughout its progress.</p><p><a name="060718123000019">Frankly, it would be an act of
utter folly for anyone in the Secretary of State&#146;s position to
attempt to obstruct the will of the people of Wales. Welsh voters
simply would not tolerate it. Even a sceptical Secretary of
State&#151;we had plenty of those before 1997&#151;would find it
impossible to ignore such a request from the Assembly. The Government
of the day would have to give the request the most sympathetic and
serious consideration and ultimately, in my view, support.But
it cannot be a rubber-stamp decision for the constitutional reasons
that I have explained.</p><p><a name="060718123000020"><b><a name="060718123000721">Mr.
Touhig:</b> I am following my right
hon.Friend&#146;s argument. Will he confirm that, under our
constitutional arrangements, the Assembly cannot require this House to
pass legislation? The Assembly may request that, but, at the end of the
day, this Parliament of the United Kingdom holds the ultimate
responsibility for law making in this land and only this Parliament can
grant full powers to the Assembly.</p><p><a name="060718123000021"><b><a name="060718123000722">Mr.
Hain:</b> That is absolutely the case. I agree with my hon.
Friend. I could not have put that better myself. That is the point that
I have been seeking to make.</p><p><a name="060718123000022">I want to make a secondary
point. Let us also remember that it will still be for the Secretary of
State to consult on the draft order before the Assembly can vote on it.
That is the sequence in which things happen. After an Assembly request,
a draft order would be drawn up, and then the Assembly would consider
the draft order and vote on it. It could be highly significant if it
turns out that the Assembly itself is not happy with the content of the
order. It will have started the clock ticking under the
amendment&#151;120 days&#151;and be unable to stop it, even if
there was a process of interaction between the Assembly and Westminster
on the detail of the order. The way in which we have framed things at
least offers a sensible consultation process that could prove crucial
in the final forming of the referendum, its wording and the process of
the vote.</p><p><a name="060718123000023"><b><a name="060718123000723">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> The Secretary of State is right to say that,
throughout, the Liberal Democrats have sought to improve the Bill,
rather than to block it, and it is in that context that we have had the
dialogue. In the context of what he is saying now, will he accept and
register the fact that we still feel unease because we cannot be
guaranteed that any future Secretary of States for Wales will
necessarily be sympathetic to the referendum? How can he feel confident
that the arrangement that he has constructively laid out will
nevertheless not offer an opportunity for, for example, an
anti-devolutionary Conservative Secretary of State for Wales to prevent
the referendum from taking place, given that he is not giving us a
time-limited period by which the Secretary of State must necessarily
have laid the referendum before the House?</p><p><a name="060718123000024"><b><a name="060718123000724">Mr.
Hain:</b> The resolution of that problem does not lie in the
Lords amendment, because even if the Lords amendment were carried, the
Assembly could not compel Parliament to do anything. In the event of,
as 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 235</b><br>the hon. Gentleman puts it, an anti-devolution Conservative Secretary of
State&#151;I suppose that there might be one of those creatures
around in the future&#151;wanting to do that, there would be an
almighty constitutional bust-up. It would not be in
Westminster&#146;s interests and I do not even think that it would be
in the interests of anti-devolution Conservative Secretary of State to
behave in that way. It would cause a real conflict. If a Conservative
Government were determined not to grant primary powers despite the
Bill, and not to call a referendum, that would be a political battle
that had to be had. That relates to the point made by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Torfaen. Despite the clear route map that the
Bill lays out&#151;when it gets Royal Assent, that will be on the
statute book&#151;towards primary powers via a referendum, if a
hostile Conservative Government, who were never going to give Wales or
the Welsh Assembly what they wanted in those circumstances, were
determined to stop that, Parliament would be sovereign. However, that
would create not just the constitutional crisis that I described, but a
political crisis for the Conservative party that would be extremely
damaging to its future prospects in Wales.</p><p><a name="060718123000025"><b><a name="060718123000725">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I grateful to the Secretary of State for giving
way, because he is having his love-in and his little backroom deal
between those on the Liberal Democrat Front
Bench<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am certainly not
jealous; I do not want to be catching the Secretaryof
State&#146;s germs by getting that close to
him&#151;[Hon. Members:
&#147;Oh!&#148;] Well, I feel sorry for him. He is not feeling
well, you know. Notwithstanding all those silver-tongued words and the
ridiculous picture that is being painted of an anti-devolution
Conservative Secretary of State for Wales&#151;I am glad that he
acknowledges that there is going to be a Conservative Secretary of
State for Wales&#151;the issue with the amendment is all about his
having pro-consular powers so that he can control the timing of any
referendum that is given to the people of Wales. Is that not the fact
of the matter? If we do not allow the Lords amendment to go through, it
means that he can act as the lord and master of Wales, calling the
referendum whenever he wishes. That is the truth of the matter,
because, of course, he and the First Minister and the Welsh Labour
party are not in the business of calling a referendum that they may
lose.</p><p><a name="060718123000026"><b><a name="060718123000726">Mr.
Hain:</b> I find that the most extraordinary of the
contributions that the hon. Lady has made duringthe debate.
She is somehow setting herself up as the defender of the Assembly
against a reactionary Secretary of State&#151;if we were talking
about a Conservative Secretary of State for Wales, we would have a
reactionary Secretary of State by definition. To set herself up somehow
as a champion of the Assembly against the rights and necessities of
parliamentary sovereignty defies reason. I will not even attempt to
respond any more, because she is smiling away&#151;she does not
really believe what she said, any more than anybody else does. The way
that she has behaved, which I regret, right the way through the course
of the Bill is to seek to frustrate it at every point and to seek to
oppose the greater devolution of power to the Welsh 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 236</b><br>Assembly. I am proud of what the Bill does in relation to the greater
devolution of power. I am also proud that it offers the prospect of
primary powers for the Welsh Assembly if a referendum triggers that. If
a referendum does so, there will be primary
powers.</p><p><a name="060718123000027"><b><a name="060718123000727">Mr.
Paul Murphy:</b> The Secretary of State has made the
constitutional points extremely well and I agree with him. But does he
agree that there is a political element to this matter, too? Any
decision to go ahead with the referendum to seek primary powers for the
Assembly would have to be the result of political consensus between the
Government, Parliament, and the Welsh Assembly Government. That is
important, as is any vote in the Assembly. The Assembly on its own does
not reflect completely the views of the people of Wales, because we
have a role in that as well as Members of the House of Commons. The
political reality would be that there would have to be an agreement and
a consensus between Parliament, Government and the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="060718123000028"><b><a name="060718123000728">Mr.
Hain:</b> Again, I could not agree with my
right hon. Friend more. He is absolutely spot on. The proposal in the
Bill&#151;but certainly not the amendment&#151;would require active
partnership between the Assembly Government and the United Kingdom
Government. In a sense, it requires that&#151;rather than an Assembly
elected at a different stage in the electoral cycle ending up, as it
were, being able to instruct this Parliament, which is elected at
another stage in the electoral cycle.</p><p><a name="060718123000029">I think that we are seeing
much fuss about nothing. Given the clear assurances that I have given
to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, I hope that the House will not
divide on this matter and will accept the principles of the Bill and
see it as a tremendous advance for Wales that will settle the whole
issue for generations to come. Then, instead of constitutional matters,
we can get on with debating better housing, better jobs, better health
services, better education and all the other things that concern the
people of Wales in their daily lives.</p><p><a name="060718123000030"><b><a name="060718123000729">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> If there is a commitment to devolution, it is
necessary to ask why the Secretary of State would want to exert a power
of refusal that would put him on a collision course with the Assembly
of the day about the very powers that his Government have brought
forward. The Government&#146;s spokesman in the Lords, Lord Davies of
Oldham, said that this was not an issue of seeking to aggrandise the
Secretary of State, but that is the effect of the power and everyone in
the House knows
it.</p><p><a name="060718123000031">The power allows
the Secretary of State both to delay and obstruct the Assembly&#146;s
wishes and process and to remove or delay the ability of both Houses of
Parliament to have a say in the matter. After two thirds of the
democratically elected Assembly had voted in favour of holding a
referendum on part 4 powers, why would the Secretary of State wish to
act as a road block to such a provision receiving consideration in the
House?</p><p><a name="060718123000032">The whole
process is fairly tortuous, but as I understand it, if a requisite two
thirds of Assembly Members voted to pass a resolution in favour of a
referendum, the First Minister would have to give 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 237</b><br>notice of the resolution to the Secretary of State. Within 120 days of
that, the Secretary of State must</p><a name="060718123000682"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;lay a draft of a statutory
instrument containing an Order in Council...before each House of
Parliament&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000033">If the
order was passed, a referendum would be held to decide whether the part
4 provisions would come into force. However, if the Lords amendment is
not allowed to stand, the Secretary of State will be able unilaterally
to give notice in writing to the First Minister that he refuses to lay
an order and merely give his reasons. The order simply would not have
to be laid and the Secretary of State could block the process from
reaching
Parliament.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060718123000712">8.30
pm</h5><p><a name="060718123000034">During the
debate in another place, Lord Kingsland&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i>
Hon. Members should listen to this. Lord Kingsland
said:</p><a name="060718123000683"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
real shift in power is from this Parliament to the Executive and the
Secretary of State.&#148;&#151; [<i> Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 28 June 2006; Vol. 683, c.
1237.]</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000035">And a shift of power it
is. The provision places the Secretary of State in a pro-consular
position over Wales&#151;as the lord and master. It interposes a
single member of the Executive between the Assembly&#146;s decision
and the order about that decision reaching Parliament for a vote. The
process certainly does not square with the Government&#146;s response
to the House of Lords Select Committee on the constitution in which
they
said:</p><a name="060718123000684"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government agrees that this is a matter for Parliament to
decide&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000036">because the
Secretary of State is placing himself in the dominant
position.</p><p><a name="060718123000037">The Bill
has been characterised by the ingenuity that has enabled the Secretary
of State to say one thing in Cardiff and another in Westminster. The
provision, like the part 3 powers, gives the Secretary of State the
opportunity to say pompously in Cardiff that he is proudly enshrining
in legislation for the very first time the possibility of full
law-making powers, while saying here that he has put a provision in the
Bill to stop a referendum from being held if that does not suit him, or
if he does not like the timing. In other words, he is saying here that
he will not let the Assembly dictate to
him.</p>

pm</h5><p><a name="060718123000546"><b><a name="060718123001217">Mr.
Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con):</b> I beg to
move,</p><a name="060718123000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this
House takes note of the 4th, the 7th to the 9th, the 12th to the 34th
and the 36th to the 42nd Reports, and the Second Special Report from
the Committee of Public Accounts of Session 2005-06, and of the
Treasury Minutes and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and
Personnel Memoranda on these Reports, Cm 6699, 6728, 6743, 6766, 6775,
6789, 6843, 6863 and
6884.</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000547">It is a
pleasure to welcome Members to the Public Accounts Committee debate,
albeit a bit late. In view of the late hour, we should perhaps question
whether our procedure in years gone by, when we had an annual debate,
was not a better way of generating interest, but we can no doubt pursue
that later through the usual channels. I am sure that the debate will
be interesting. We will potentially be here until a quarter to
midnight&#151;and why not? This is a very important
subject.</p><p><a name="060718123000548">The last
such debate, which took place in January, was considered worth while by
Members in all parts of the House. We examined the Committee&#146;s
work in driving value for money in public services, and the encouraging
assurance was received from the Financial Secretary that the Committee
would make an important contribution to the 2007 comprehensive spending
review. Given its continuing preference for objectivity over
partisanship&#151;not something for which this Chamber is generally
noted&#151;the incisiveness of our investigations and the quality of
our reports, thanks to the help of the National Audit Office, I hope
that today&#146;s debate will act as a powerful engine for both
discussion and change within Whitehall.</p><p><a name="060718123000549">The Financial Secretary
described as a tour de force the paper on delivering efficiency savings
that we published before the last debate, and I understand that it is
now widely used in Whitehall. I will quote widely from a report that we
published only today, entitled &#147;Delivering High Quality Public
Services for all&#148;. I hope that it, like the last generic report,
will be widely used in
Whitehall.</p><p><a name="060718123000550">I am of
course proud to be the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, which
is the oldest Committee in Parliament. Until recently, we thought that
it was set up by Gladstone in the 1860s, but I have done some research
and I found that a Public Accounts Committee met as long ago as the
17th century. For instance, in 1690 the Public Accounts Committee,
which, I am afraid to say, was not friendly to the regime of James
II&#151;I regret that, as a Jacobite&#151;reported that:</p><a name="060718123000686"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The ships built,
rebuilt and repaired by these commissioners were fully and well
performed, and the buildings and other works by them erected and made
during the continuation of the same commission were done with great
exactness, sufficiency and frugality of expense in the managery and
conduct thereof.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000551">I have
searched for a Treasury minute in reply to that excellent report, but I
have not found one. I am sure that that incompetence is entirely due to
the current Treasury team&#151;three and a half centuries later and
we are still waiting for a reply to the PAC report of
1690.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 243</b><br><p><a name="060718123000552"><b><a name="060718123001218">Mr.
Ian Davidson (Glasgow, South-West) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I rise
because the hon. Gentleman mentioned 1690. Is he aware that many of my
constituents demonstrate regularly to celebrate an event that took
place in that year&#151;indeed, many demonstrate against events that
took place in that year&#151;but that none of them demonstrates to
celebrate the anniversary of the
PAC?</p><p><a name="060718123000553"><b><a name="060718123001219">Mr.
Leigh:</b> Well, we have obviously failed to make our mark.
But of course, we live nowadays in times when venality is not an issue
in public life, is it? The Committee to which I referred earlier looked
at the affairs of Pepys&#146;s friend, Richard Cooling, the Lord
Chamberlain&#146;s secretary, no less, who</p><a name="060718123000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;told us his horse was a bribe,
and his boots a bribe; and told us he was made up of bribes...and
that he makes every sort of tradesman to bribe him; and invited me home
to his house to taste of his
bribe-wine.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000554">That is one
of the problems that that Committee dealt
with.</p><p><a name="060718123000555">Given that the
hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) takes an interest in
the Royal family, I shall point out another such debate that I found.
The Committee took place on the Floor of the Whole House and, according
to the journal of the House of Commons,</p><a name="060718123000688"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some expressions were frequently
used which seemed to glance at the licence and disorders and
extravagant expense of that
place&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000556">the
court&#151;</p><a name="060718123000689"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not
without some reflections which, aimed at the
lady&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000557">I do not
know who she
is&#151;</p><a name="060718123000690"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and the
exorbitant power exercised by her and this imperious way of proceeding,
confirmed those in their wariness who had no mind to oppose or
contradict the party that they would and meant should
prevail.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000558">So we think
that the Public Accounts Committee has been holding the court and the
Government to account for the best part of three or four centuries, and
we continue to do
so.</p><p><a name="060718123000559">For instance,
only this year we published 31 reports&#151;at least twice as many as
any other Committee&#151;on a range of vital issues since the last
debate. We found, to take one example, that as of September 2005, one
third of our armed forces were not as ready as they should have been,
and we called on the Ministry of Defence to clarify its plans for
bringing the armed forces back up to required readiness. A plainly
ridiculous situation was also uncovered whereby massive overpayments
were an inherent part of the tax credit system. In short, whoever
designed the scheme&#151;perhaps it was the Treasury, although I do
not know&#151;knew that it would lead to overpayments before they
even introduced it. This created a worrying situation for hundreds of
thousands of vulnerable families who had to find money to finance
repayments. </p><p><a name="060718123000560">It has
to be said that many people have been helped by tax credits, and I
acknowledge that. However, many families have been made sick with worry
about the need to pay back money that they do not have; money that they
have been given and have now spent. With more than &#163;1 billion
lost through claimant error and fraud in 2003-04 alone, money is
leaking from the tax credit system faster than the water from
London&#146;s antiquated pipes.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 244</b><br><p><a name="060718123000561">We have also concluded that
consular service staff have shown tremendous dedication and
determination in helping British nationals in distress, and we pay
tribute to them. That is particularly in relation to the nine major
overseas emergencies of 2005. In the same report we recognise also the
steps that have been taken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to
improve its emergency plans, especially in the light of its experience
during the tsunami, when its call-handling system was
overwhelmed.</p><p><a name="060718123000562">We are
also, I am afraid to say, the Public Accounts Committee for Northern
Ireland while Stormont is suspended. We took evidence from the
Department of the Environment on the problems that had been developing
in implementing a waste-management strategy for Northern Ireland. In
particular, we took the Department to task for failing to show strong
leadership under the greening Government initiative. It responded by
agreeing to establish waste reduction and recycling targets equivalent
to its Westminster counterparts.</p><p><a name="060718123000563">We found again and again that
the quality of governance in Northern Ireland has been below par
compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. It is a hugely
over-governed part of the United Kingdom and perhaps too much emphasis,
understandably, has been placed on peace and security, and not enough
on good governance. I was talking to a Minister in the Northern Ireland
Office this evening, who assures me that that is now changing and that
the Department is trying to achieve the same sort of value-for-money
targets in Northern Ireland that have been the norm in the rest of the
United Kingdom. That is to be welcomed. I hope that the Treasury will
keep a close eye on what is happening there.</p><p><a name="060718123000564">A number of our findings have
reached the very top of the news agenda. Even today, I think that we
might be making the news. April was the Committee&#146;s highest
profile month given the number of articles published. This was largely
the result of revelations regarding foreign national criminals.
According to <i> The Daily
Telegraph,</i></p><a name="060718123000691"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;this
tale of incompetence has come to light only because of the
assiduity&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000565">those
are the words that are written above the door of the Committee&#146;s
Chairman, apparently put there by
Gladstone&#151;</p><a name="060718123000692"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;of
the Commons Public Accounts Committee, one of the few agents of public
accountability we have left in our neutered
democracy.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000566">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk(Mr. Bacon)&#151;I
pay tribute to him&#151;was rightly afforded special praise for his
persistent pressing on this issue, not least by Ministers, who
congratulated him. The former Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for
Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), was a big enough man to acknowledge the
role played by my hon. Friend. When people say that the only route that
is worth while in this place is to be either a Minister or a shadow
spokesman, they should bear in mind my hon. Friend, who has devoted his
parliamentary years to serving on a Select Committee. That shows what
can be achieved on Select Committees. We are grateful to him.</p><p><a name="060718123000567">Other reports that we have
published have received a large amount of publicity. One such report is
the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 245</b><br>cancer plan. Our reports on health are always of great interest. We have
produced reports on our railway stations, the Diana fountain and many
other matters. How instructive it is in our celebrity obsessed society
that we can waste billions on fraud and error in the Department for
Work and Pensions, but if we are lucky our report will reach page 15 of
the <i> Financial Times</i>. If we talk about a paltry &#163;1 million
or &#163;2 million wasted on a concrete memorial in Hyde park, we
have wall-to-wall coverage in all the newspapers. That is something
that we have to live with.</p><p><a name="060718123000568">I have been
especially encouraged by the Government&#146;s acceptance of the
Committee&#146;s recommendations. The Department of Health accepted
the need to provide all cancer patients with a formal assessment of the
support that they need to manage the pain, stress, and anxiety caused
by their cancer. The Department for Education and Skills agreed to
review the curriculum after we recommended that school lessons be made
more relevant to pupils who were reluctant to attend school.</p><p><a name="060718123000569">In all, 94 per cent. of the
Committee&#146;s recommendations were accepted by the Government. I
am delighted to pay tribute to the Treasury and the Treasury minutes in
ensuring such a high strike rate. But we have to ensure that our
recommendations are not just accepted but implemented, and we want to
do more work with the NAO on
that.</p><p><a name="060718123000570">We would not be
influential were it not for the quality and dedication of the
Committee&#146;s members and staff. I pay tribute to Mr. Nick Wright
and his colleagues for all the work that they do. I thank those who
have left the Committee since the last debate&#151;the hon. Members
for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams), for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) and
for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael). I also welcome those who have
since joined&#151;the hon. Members for Islwyn(Mr. Touhig),
for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) and for Southport (Dr.
Pugh). All the other existing members continue to work hard, to hold
the Government to account and they all deserve congratulation, and I
give it.</p><p><a name="060718123000571">I also pass
on the Committee&#146;s regards to all its staff and their continuing
commitment to the Committee&#146;s work, and of course, and not
least, to the NAO, whose professionalism and impartiality make our work
possible. One of my ambitions in the time left to me serving on the
Liaison Committee and chairing this Committee is to see other Select
Committee&#146;s make more use of the NAO. In the past, there has
been a tendency for the PAC to be too possessive about the NAO, and we
should use it more as a resource to help other Committees hold
Government to account, particularly on the estimates and expenditure
account side.</p><p><a name="060718123000572">The
trouble is that the scope of the Committee&#146;s work is so
wide-ranging that I could just go around a series of disjointed issues,
but one issue in particular stands out. As the Government look forward
to the 2007 comprehensive spending review, so the debate on the
effectiveness of increased spending on public services in recent years
gathers pace. This is now central to our democracy, particularly as
apparently the two parties are growing closer in ideology and there is
more and more emphasis on how to deliver more efficient public
services, given the increased resources that are devoted to
that.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 246</b><br><p><a name="060718123000573">To contribute to that debate, I
want to discuss the extent to which increased investment in public
services is meeting what should be the most important test of its
effectiveness: its impact on the end user&#151;such an obvious
remark, but something that may not always be at the forefront of our
minds in political debate. I want to highlight six key ingredients of
user satisfaction with public services. They are all very topical and
they are all contained in the 63rd report that we published only this
morning. Those six key ingredients indicate where public money has been
spent well, and where there is still some way to go. They feed, I
hope&#151;I hope that the Minister will respond to this&#151;the
Government&#146;s fundamental review of public spending
priorities.</p><p><a name="060718123000574">I start
by quoting paragraph 18 of the report. It is a significant paragraph
and I hope that the Government take note of it. Bear in mind that this
is an all-party report, agreed by 15 Members of the House of Commons.
It
states:</p><a name="060718123000693"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Public
bodies also need to consider how the structure of organisations can
affect the planning and delivery of services. The public sector becomes
more complex as it grows in size, as the commissioning of new projects
and services leads to overlap between departments. For example, if a
new agency is created to tackle childhood obesity, headed by a
government-appointed &#145;tsar&#146; and equipped with a small
office staff, its powers and field of responsibility will overlap with
those of other departments, such as the Department of Health, local
education and strategic health authorities. As the agency becomes
embedded within the overall government framework, its interaction with
these other departments will evolve to &#145;iron out&#146;
overlapping provision, but there will nevertheless be a time period in
which less-efficient practices occur. The more rapidly the government
decides to expand the public sector the more likely this is to occur.
Political pressure to establish or expand the public provision of a
service as quickly as possible will increase the likelihood of such
projects being ill-defined and poorly planned, wasting public money in
the process and possibly slowing down
improvements.&#148;</p></ul>

<p><a name="060718123000575">I
particularly recommend that paragraph to the
Minister.</p><p><a name="060718123000576">Let me
quickly go over the tests. First, the most basic requirement of a
public service is that it should be accessible, but too often that is
not the case. The Committee uncovered a wide geographical variation in
the use of National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence-approved cancer drugs across the country&#151;again, there
was a lot of publicity and public interest&#151;including those for
breast cancer. We found that people in some less affluent parts of the
country&#151;typically the north&#151;may lose out when it comes to
cancer care, because cancer networks in some deprived areas lack
comprehensive service
plans.</p><p><a name="060718123000577">Access to
public services can also be affected by complexity in how services are
delivered. For example, complicated processes can deter people from
claiming benefits. Language is another potential barrier preventing
people from accessing public services, but it is an area in which the
Government are making progress, which the Committee has acknowledged.
Our report on adult literacy and numeracy highlighted progress in
reaching those with language needs, thanks in part to the increased
Skills for Life budget. There has been progress, but more can be
done.</p><p><a name="060718123000578">Secondly, once
demanded, public services should be delivered as promptly as possible.
Failure to do so can cause inconvenience, hardship, disruption and, at
its most serious, put lives at risk. Over the years, the Committee has
repeatedly highlighted the importance 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 247</b><br>of getting it right first time in benefit decision making, which means
making decisions quickly and accurately to guard against clogging up
the system with appeals and revised benefit assessments.</p><p><a name="060718123000579">Thirdly, public services
should respond to the needs of users, which is obvious but is not
always done. Failure to take into account what people want can result
in unsuitable services that cause inconvenience, dissatisfaction and,
sometimes, hardship for users. To design services around the needs of
users, providers must first have a thorough understanding of what users
want. Incidentally, all these points are illustrated by practical
examples in the report, but there is no time to go through them
now.</p><p><a name="060718123000580">Fourthly, public
services will ultimately fall shortof expectations, if users
and providers fail to communicate effectively with each other. Call
centres are one increasingly common way for people to communicate with
public bodies, but they are also an increasingly common cause of
frustration and dissatisfaction with public services. Our investigation
of tax assessment found that some staff on telephone helplines lack the
detailed knowledge to respond consistently and accurately to
inquiries.</p><p><a name="060718123000581">Fifthly,
public services need to set and meet high standards. One way to improve
the quality of public services is to introduce appropriate incentives
and targets. For example, the Committee recommended the greater use of
financial penalties to drive up the standard of facilities in
Britain&#146;s railway stations. I was so appalled by the disgusting
state of Market Rasen station in my constituency that I brought my own
incriminating photographs to the hearing, where a panoply of highly
paid members of the railway establishment were in front of the
Committee. My photos of waiting room graffiti captured the squalor
pretty well and, although I do not have the photographic genius of
Robert Capa or the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), they
made a difference and things have changed. Standards in public services
can also be improved by involving public service providers that are
capable of meeting the diverse needs of different groups in
society.</p><p><a name="060718123000582">Finally,
even if standards are world class, people will not be happy if services
cost what they consider to be too much. As a consequence, providers
must publish, publicise and contain costs. And users of services need
to know about the costs that they will incur. People must be told how
much they will pay when, for example, they contact a public service by
telephone. It is also important that money is not wasted. Some money
never makes it to a programme&#146;s front line, because it is
swallowed up in management costs. For example, about one third of Learn
Direct funding went on overheads in 2004-05, and the Committee urged
UFI&#151;the University for Industry&#151;to channel that money
towards learners
instead.</p><p><a name="060718123000583">By outlining
the Committee&#146;s recent findings into users&#146; experiences
of public services&#151;some positive, some negative and some
highlighting areas for improvement&#151;I hope that we have
contributed to the debate on the effectiveness of increased spending on

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 248</b><br>public services, which is helping to inform the Financial
Secretary&#146;s work on the comprehensive spending review.</p><p><a name="060718123000584">In my final few minutes, I
want to move on to explore some important developments in other aspects
of the stewardship of public money. In January, the Comptroller and
Auditor General issued a disclaimer on the Home Office accounts, which
were not only riddled with errors but delivered too late for his staff
to audit in time. Such a disclaimer is virtually unprecedented in
relation to a great Department of State. It is extraordinary, not to
mention deeply concerning, that such an organisation should fail so
spectacularly to render its accounts to Parliament.</p><p><a name="060718123000585">The Home Office invited yet
more accusations of incompetence following the Committee&#146;s
inquiry into returning failed asylum applicants. The sheer perseverance
of the Committee, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for South
Norfolk, brought this to light. We not only highlighted a serious
immediate threat to the well-being of the public but pointed to what
the former Home Secretary was compelled to describe as &#147;a
serious systemic failure&#148; in his Department&#146;s ability to
understand what was happening with foreign national criminals. The
Government aim to address the clear need to improve the performance of
Departments for their departmental capability reviews. I look forward
to assessing those reviews and their implementation in the coming weeks
and months.</p><p><a name="060718123000586">We
welcome the other developments that willgive the Comptroller
and Auditor General more opportunities to ensure the wise spending of
the nation&#146;s money. It is encouraging that HM Treasury has asked
the National Audit Office to review the economy, efficiency, and
effectiveness with which the Financial Services Authority has used its
resources when discharging its statutory functions.</p><p><a name="060718123000587">We note the progress of the
Company Law Reform Bill, which will give the Comptroller and Auditor
General the right to audit non-departmental public bodies that are
companies. We are pleased to see the continuing progress of the
National Lottery Bill, which will finally give the CAG access to the
information that the National Lottery Commission holds for the purpose
of vetting people involved in running the national lottery.</p><p><a name="060718123000588">We always return to the BBC in
these debates&#151;and why not? The Committee would like assurances
regarding the CAG&#146;s access to the BBC and to central Government
money channelled through local government. It is with great interest
that I note the discussions between the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport and the NAO regarding the establishment of a baseline against
which to judgethe BBC&#146;s future efficiency programme. I
welcome the Government&#146;s recognition that the NAO should have an
expanded role in assessing the BBC&#146;s value for money, but I urge
them to do more to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of the BBC. It is
ludicrous that the CAG should not have freedom to select the topics
that he wishes to examine. We cannot have a situation whereby what is
in effect a public body is spending&#163;3 billion-worth of
public money, and the main external auditor on the behalf of the
taxpayer&#151;the CAG&#151;has to go cap in hand to the BBC to
agree a 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 249</b><br>programme of investigation. He should have the right to go where he
wants. As the Government introduce different funding mechanisms for
local government through local area agreements, it is imperative that
proper parliamentary accountability of these funds remains.</p><p><a name="060718123000589">Following the
Committee&#146;s recent visit to Washington DC, where Congressmen
have far more power over appropriation than we do, it is clear that
there is scope to improve parliamentary scrutiny of Government spending
plans. We wrote as a Committee to the Chairman of the Liaison
Committee, the Father of the House, who is also a member of our
Committee&#151;I pay tribute to his work on it&#151;proposing that
departmental Select Committees devote more time to the scrutiny of
expenditure plans. We also drew his attention to the willingness of the
NAO to provide support for that. We discussed this in the Liaison
Committee last week&#151;I hope that I am not giving anything
away&#151;and interest was expressed. The Hansard Society has
published a report on the subject, and we have our own PAC report on
it. I agree that we will never&#151;or not rapidly&#151;move to a
situation whereby we are like Congress, where the President proposes
but ultimately Congress disposes, with line by line control of the
budget.</p><p><a name="060718123000590">Nevertheless, there must be
some progress towards returning to Parliament&#146;s traditional
role. I cited the 17th century, when this sort of debate produced a
civil war. Nowadays there is virtually no line-by-line scrutiny of the
estimates. That is a worrying shortfall in what Parliament&#146;s
work should be about. If we can provide other Select Committees with
more help from the NAO, we will not magically persuade the Government
suddenly to give Select Committees line-by-line procurement powers.
However, if they can at least set up the processes and have the
knowledge, it might be possible for the Government, or a future
Government, to start creating more interest in the appropriation
procedure and business. Parliament is fundamentally about that and was
set up to perform that function.</p><p><a name="060718123000591">I have given a brief outline
of the Committee&#146;s valuable and challenging work in the past six
months. I expect our work in the next six months to be just as
challenging and, I hope, valuable, with investigations into a wide
range of topical issues, including NHS financial
management.</p><p><a name="060718123000592"><b><a name="060718123001220">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon.
Gentleman has led the Public Accounts Committee with distinction, and
some of the reports satisfied Parliament about the economy, efficiency
and effectiveness of public expenditure in five sixths of the United
Kingdom&#151;the country of England. Does he believe that he has
adequate powers to focus on the public expenditure that is funded by
the generous Barnett formula in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland?</p><p><a name="060718123000593"><b><a name="060718123001221">Mr.

express those of the Committee. I am told that there is an adequate
Public Accounts Committee in Scotland and similar mechanisms in
Wales.</p><p><a name="060718123000594"><b><a name="060718123001222">Mr.
Jim Devine (Livingston) (Lab):</b> The Public Accounts
Committee in Scotland is good. When the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 250</b><br>Conservative party was in power, it introduced the internal market into
the Scottish health service. It surprises me that Public Accounts
Committee reports do not mention the public sector&#146;s purchasing
power. There were 32 different prices for cornflakes, and the
Conservative Government extended that to beds, bandages and breakages.
The internal market in the health service gave the private sector a
licence to print money. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the public
sector should standardise its purchasing policies, whether in local
government or the health service, for chairs, beds, pens, tables and so
on?</p><p><a name="060718123000595"><b><a name="060718123001223">Mr.
Leigh:</b> Of course I agree. I give the Government credit for
setting up the Office of Government Commerce. There has not been time
to deal with that vital issue in my few remarks but we all agree
withthe hon. Gentleman that what he outlines is an
extraordinarily important part of saving public money, and that a great
deal of progress remains to be made.</p><p><a name="060718123000596">In the next six months, we
shall consider NHS financial management, the Rural Payments Agency,
including the single payment scheme, which had all sorts of problems,
and the Child Support Agency. Our distinguished Committee has been a
force in ensuring that taxpayers&#146; money is spent wisely and
effectively. I commend its work to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060718123000714">9.17
pm</h5><p><a name="060718123000597"><b><a name="060718123001224">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry (Portsmouth, North) (Lab/Co-op):</b> One of the
frustrating aspects of the Committee&#146;s work is the time lag
between our hearing, the subsequent reports and the Treasury&#146;s
response. In January, when Public Accounts Committee reports were
previously debated on the Floor of the House, I found myself, as a new
member of the Committee, in an interesting position because I had not
participated in any of the hearings of the reports that we were
discussing.</p><p><a name="060718123000598">Today,
however, I have seen the process through with many of the reports, from
the initial National Audit Office report, through the PAC evidence
sessions, to the publication of the report and the Treasury response.
It helps when we see the whole picture. However, it requires an
efficient filing system because it is impossible to retain in
one&#146;s head the burning issues that we discuss at hearings. If
one does not keep a good record in notes, the issues can get lost in
the mists of time, because we meet twice a week to consider
amost diverse range of subjects&#151;unlike other Select
Committees, which, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)
said, home in on a specific aspect of a particular Department and spend
several weeks delving into minute
detail.</p><p><a name="060718123000599">We, on the
other hand, fly at 30,000 ft, twice a week diving down and swooping
back up to move to the next Department and the next subject. Although
that approach means that we cover much ground, it sometimes feels a bit
superficial. I am pleased that, in the past year, we have spent some
deliberative time outside hearings, trying to pull together some common
themes. I should like us to do more of that.</p><p><a name="060718123000600">Our most recent session, when
we reviewed the work programme of the National Audit Office for the
next couple of years with Sir John Bourn, was most 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 251</b><br>valuable. Our work is a partnership with the NAO.I particularly
welcome the new appendix to that report, which looked at the risk
factors involved in the various areas that the NAO was
considering.</p><p><a name="060718123000601">It is
easy for us to get on our hobby horses when deciding what issues we
shall hold hearings on. We all have our pet projects and our pet
Departments. However, our time is limited, and we should prioritise our
hearings to cover the areas of highest risk. Time and again, we
criticise Departments for not taking a risk-based approach, so it is
only right that we too should take such an approach to our
work.</p><p><a name="060718123000602">While
reviewing our work over the past six months, I should like to pay
tribute to the Chair of our Committee, the hon. Member for
Gainsborough, who has, as ever, been assiduous, courteous and charming
in his chairmanship. I would also like to thank Nick Wright for his
invaluable help as our Committee Clerk, and all the staff at the
NAO.</p><p><a name="060718123000603">We have a
wealth of reports before us today demonstrating the sheer scope of our
work, which reaches into every Department, enabling us to fulfil our
function of ensuring that the taxpayer is getting value for money,
exposing weaknesses and recommending improvements in the
process&#151;but of course not the policy&#151;of government. As a
member of the party that is in government, I see my role as that of a
critical friend. I of course believe that the policy is right; I
therefore have a vested interest in making sure that it is delivered
effectively. Because of that, I want to focus on two reports today. The
first is the 17th report, &#147;Achieving value for money in the
delivery of public services&#148;, from which I want to pick up on
the theme of complexity and move on to the 36th report, entitled
&#147;Tackling the complexity of the benefits
system&#148;.</p><p><a name="060718123000604">Before I home in on those
reports, however, I want to say a few words about the
Committee&#146;s visit to Washington and Boston earlier this year.
Once again, I must thank the Committee staff, particularly Nick Wright
and Christine Randall, who accompanied us and made sure that we were
all in the right place at the right time, even the hon. Member for
South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), who usually managed to be last. It was
interesting to see the different approach taken to financial oversight
there. In many ways, that reflected the different structure of a
separately elected President and his Executive, who can be in conflict
with the separately elected Congress. That is all very different from
our parliamentary system, in which the Executive derive their power
from their majority in Parliament.</p><p><a name="060718123000605">It would not be easy to
replicate the financial scrutiny and overview of the American system,
but like the hon. Member for Gainsborough, I certainly came away
thinking that there could be improvements in the way in which
Parliament undertakes financial scrutiny of future expenditure plans. I
am looking forward to the responses from the Liaison Committee, the
Modernisation Committee and the Public Accounts Commission to the
proposals put forward by our Chair for departmental Select Committees
to devote more time to the scrutiny of expenditure plans.</p><p><a name="060718123000606">I shall move on to the two
reports on which I want to focus today. The 17th report,
&#147;Achieving value for money in the delivery of public
services&#148;, is 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 252</b><br>fundamental to our work in the Public Accounts Committee. Incidentally,
I believe that the report that was published today is also fundamental,
but I understand that it is outside the scope of the motion, so I shall
not refer to it. The 17th report is an example of how we have
consciously stepped outside our role of diving in from 30,000 ft and
tried to draw together wider themes over a 10-year period. We
deliberately chose a 10-year period so that the report would straddle
different Governments and phases of government.</p><p><a name="060718123000607">One of the encouraging things
to come out of the report is that the great majority of the
Committee&#146;s recommendations over the years have been acted on.
Despite that, however, it is disappointing to note that lessons do not
seem to have been learned across other Departments, as the same themes
come through in different reports. Seven factors have been
identifiedas needing to make greater progress, but I shall
concentrate on just three: the lack of adequate project management; the
fact that there are not enough pilot schemes prior to implementation;
and the need to reduce complexity and bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="060718123000608">In our last debate in January,
I draw attention to the importance of project management, particularly
in regard to Ministry of Defence major projects. That is reinforced in
this report, which highlights the MOD support vehicle projects, in
which the Department decided to proceed without a formal assessment
phase, resulting in a slippage of 19 months. This was not because the
Department lacked a proper procedure. The smart acquisition procedures
were in place; they were simply not acted on.</p><p><a name="060718123000609">There is an example in the
report from my own constituency. The Home Office had allocated funding
to the Portsmouth Partnership for a CCTV and automatic number plate
recognition system in December 2002, but required the funds to be spent
by the year&#146;s end. The subsequent rushed procurement and lack of
testing meant that the new systems were not operational until August
2003. There needs to be recognition at departmental level of the
practicalities involved in implementing recommendations on the
ground.</p><p><a name="060718123000610">When we look
at pilot projects we see in many reports that either they have not been
used or, if they have been used, lessons have not been learned from
them. Pilot schemes are crucial for picking up practical issues that
may not be apparent in the design stage, but they are of no use if the
results are
ignored.</p><p><a name="060718123000611"><b><a name="060718123001225">Dr.
John Pugh (Southport) (LD):</b> The hon. Lady is being a
little unkind to the Government. Why, only today, they have decided on
a pilot scheme for home information packs, rather than going ahead with
the real thing! Is that not learning a
lesson?</p><p><a name="060718123000612"><b><a name="060718123001226">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I quite agree that there are instances of
pilot projects working well. There is an example in one of our reports
of good practice in the Treasury building project, demonstrating how
advance planning can reduce risk. I am saying that there have been
instances where pilot projects have not worked very well or where
lessons have not been learned. If we look at the potential schemes for
individual learning accounts in the Department for Education and
Skills, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 253</b><br>we see that during the pilot stage none of the schemes worked, so a
completely different scheme was implemented which had no testing at all
and was rushed through, resulting in a system prone to fraud which cost
the taxpayer about &#163;67
million.</p><p><a name="060718123000613">Moving on to
reducing complexity and bureaucracy, we come up against an inevitable
tension between the Government policy of targeting public money at
those most in need and the inevitable complexity that that brings.
Sometimes the complexity and bureaucracy go beyond that tension, and
our report highlights the South East England Development Agency in my
region, where there were more than 40 different funding streams, each
with separate monitoring and evaluation criteria. That led to SEEDA
having to set up a brand new initiative just to help applicants wade
through the
process.</p><p><a name="060718123000614">Our 36th
report focused on complexity in the benefits system. As I said,
complexity is inevitable when one targets benefits as well as
preventing fraud and abuse and making sure that public money goes where
it is most needed. The immediate response is, &#147;We must simplify
things&#148;, but as our report points out, simplification is not an
easy option, and it means a trade-off with affordability, fairness and
targeting. That is not to say that there is not much more than can be
done.</p><p><a name="060718123000615">Let us
consider the letters sent out by the DWP. Our report highlighted the
difficulties that people have had with written communications, as well
as the fact that nothing has improved much over the past six years. I
am sure that I am not alone in having constituents at my advice centre
who have struggled through the complexity of applying for the benefits
to which they are entitled, only, when they get those benefits, to
receive letters that they simply do not
understand.</p><p><a name="060718123000616"><b><a name="060718123001227">Mr.
Sadiq Khan (Tooting) (Lab):</b> Was my hon. Friend surprised
by the evidence that we receivedthat potential recipients of
benefits which other Departments were implementing would not
receivethat advice because it was a DWP project, rather than
taking a holistic approach, with people attending advice sessions at
which they could receive advice from different Departments, which seems
the obvious thing to
do?</p><p><a name="060718123000617"><b><a name="060718123001228">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I entirely agree, and that need for a
holistic approach came through in the briefings that we received from
Citizens Advice and the Child Poverty Action
Group.</p><p><a name="060718123000618"><b><a name="060718123001229">Greg
Clark (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> I agree with the hon. Lady
that the complexity of the benefits system is to a certain extent
inevitable if there is targeting, but one of the consequences is that
organisations such as Citizens Advice have a great increase in their
work load. Does she agree that it would be reasonable, in introducing
changes to the benefits system, to give some resource to the Citizens
Advice to enable it to cope with the inevitable increase in its work
load?</p><p><a name="060718123000619"><b><a name="060718123001230">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I know from when I was a councillor that
citizens advice bureaux get considerable resources through
service-level agreements with local authorities. They do a tremendous
amount of work. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 254</b><br>We should take note when Citizens Advice tells us of the problems that
it has. In 2003-04, citizens advice bureaux dealt with 1.3 million
cases relating to benefits and tax credits. Citizens Advice
acknowledges that some progress has been made, but says that it is
still seeing too many people who are missing out on the money to which
they are
entitled.</p><p><a name="060718123000620">Similarly,
the Child Poverty Action Group acknowledges the inherent complexity in
targeting benefits, but points out that it is made worse by poor
delivery, which the Department can do something about. In our report we
highlight the importance of highly skilled, trained staff, and at our
hearing I asked the Permanent Secretary why a human being could not
review the computer-generated letters that went out and, if necessary,
write an explanation on the bottom in plain English. If a letter lists
all the benefits to which one could be entitled, but it actually means
that one is not going to get any money, it would be a lot easier to
understand if that were written on the bottom.</p><p><a name="060718123000621">Of course, the use of IT,
telephone and other communication technologies will aid simplification.
We must be aware, however, that some people will always need
face-to-face advice, and we must make sure that our staff have adequate
training to do that.</p><p><a name="060718123000622"><b><a name="060718123001231">Greg
Clark:</b> Given the importance of preserving that human face,
does the hon. Lady share my concern that the savings proposed from
front-line staff at the Benefits Agency should not go too far too
quickly? We should not throw people on the mercy of a complex computer
system without a sufficient number of staff to guide them through that
complexity.</p><p><a name="060718123000623"><b><a name="060718123001232">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is important that we make sure that the
IT systems are in place first, but I would be the last to say that we
should not make savings and process benefits more efficiently. We must,
however, put the user at the forefront. Efficiency savings and
simplification must be delivered for the benefit of the user, and not
necessarily for the benefit of the Department. The user must come
first. Claimants and applicants must get the benefits of the
simplification.</p><p><a name="060718123000624">The
most important outcome of the inquiry intothe complexity of
benefits is the setting up of the simplification team, which will
develop the simplification strategy and then be able to challenge all
new policy proposals on the grounds of complexity. At our hearing, I
was encouraged when the permanent secretary said that he hoped to come
back in one year and show a demonstrable difference in the level of
complexity. I was dubious, however, about how that would be possible,
when a clear set of performance indicators had not yet been devised. I
was not quite sure how that improvement would be demonstrated. Sadly
that was borne out in the Treasury response:</p><a name="060718123000694"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Because of the
difficulties with developing such a measure, the Department cannot
commit at this stage to producing one by 2007&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="060718123000625">However, I am pleased that the
Department nevertheless undertakes to keep the Committee informed of
progress.</p><p><a name="060718123000626">Measurement of progress brings
me back to our visit to the USA. For me, one of the highlights of the
trip was our visit to Harvard Business School and our opportunity to
debate with four of its professors. It was 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 255</b><br>a huge privilege to listen to them. I was especially interested in the
concept of the value chain in delivering public services and how, all
too often, we are focused just on inputs, activities and outputs, and
we forget the next two items in the value chain&#151;outcomes and
impacts. I have no problem with targets. I come from an industry
background where total quality management was the norm, and one of the
first lessons in any quality system, whether Six Sigma, TQM or whatever
is fashionable at the time, is that one must be able to
measure.</p><p><a name="060718123000627">One must
have a mechanism to show whether one is meeting one&#146;s defined
standards. Delivering public services, however, is not the same as
manufacturing widgets, and our standard must be more than just the
measuring of inputs, activities and outputs. We must also have a means
of assessing outcomes and impacts. The difficulty arises because those
are often long-term outcomes and impacts, and the Government are under
pressure to find ways in which to demonstrate progress
quickly.</p><p><a name="060718123000628">Yesterday,
I visited my out-of-hours GP service, which had failed on a measurement
criterion to get overnight reports to the relevant GP by 8 am the next
day. One might say that that was fair enough, but the fact that it had
extended its service until 8 am and could not get reports to GPs by 8
am because patients were still being treated at that time had not been
taken into account. Yes, it had failed on the raw output target, but it
was delivering a better outcome.</p>

not propose to say anything about that in this debate, but merely to
make one comment about the former Home Secretary, the right hon. Member
for Norwich, South(Mr. Clarke). I consciously and deliberately
did not call for his resignation over that matter, and I was sorry to
see him go. Some may say that his departure became inevitable, but I
continue to have a high regard for him and I think that what has
happened in the Home Office since then demonstrates that the problems
go much deeper than the issue of one Cabinet Minister. I pay tribute to
the right hon. Gentleman for the work that he did during his time at

a high regard for the right hon. Gentleman, and I hope that he will
continue to make a contribution in this
place.</p><p><a name="0607196000002">Nevertheless,
as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, there
is a serious problem with the Home Office that goes well beyond one
issue connected with the immigration and nationality directorate. My
hon. Friend said that the Home Office had been unable to present a set
of audited accounts to Parliament. There have been the most serious
problems possible with the Home Office accounts. They were flagged up
in a memorandum from the National Audit Office to the audit committee
of the Home Office, entitled &#147;Home Office Resource Accounts
2004-05 Audit Update from the National Audit Office&#148;.</p><p><a name="0607196000003">I pay tribute to Mr. Darren Box,
financial audit director at the National Audit Office, whose
persistence caused the seriousness of the problems to come to light.
His memorandum to the audit committee
states</p><a name="0607196000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At this
stage we are contemplating a disclaimer opinion on the accounts on the
grounds that fundamental control failures mean that we are unable to

forth.</p><p><a name="0607196000007">The memo
adds:</p><a name="0607196000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Bank
reconciliations are the most fundamental of all accounting controls as
they enable payment, receipts and cash balances to be validated to an
external source and provide assurance about debtor and creditor
balances. Due to difficulties in implementing the Adelphi accounting

position&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000008">That bears
repetition&#151;the Home Office has been unable to reconcile its cash
at bank position.</p><p><a name="0607196000009">Bank
reconciliations are fundamental. They are an essential control over
cash to ensure that income and payments recorded in any
organisation&#146;s bank account match its accounting records.
Matching also provides assurance about debtor and creditor
balances&#151;in other words, amounts owed to and by a
Department&#151;and can help to prevent and detect fraud and error. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 257</b><br>What was worse was that the Home Office had not even realised that
failure to reconcile cash fully could ultimately undermine its ability
to provide Parliament with fully audited accounts.</p><p><a name="0607196000010">The memo goes into further
detail about the Adelphi accounting system,
stating:</p><a name="0607196000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
further cause for concern has arisen from our review of Adelphi
transaction data. It took six months for the Home Office to supply us
with transaction data that we were able to reconcile successfully to
the Adelphi general ledger. However, when the gross transaction value
of debits and credits within this data was totalled, they each amounted
to some &#163;26,527,108,436,994, almost 2,000 times higher than the
Home Office&#146;s gross expenditure for 2004-05 and approximately
one and a half times higher than the estimated GP of the entire planet.
This suggests that something has gone seriously awry...We have yet
to receive an explanation for what has happened... Collectively, these
control weaknesses expose the Home Office to a high risk of fraud,
irregularity, poor value for money and waste in its financial
operations.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000011"><b><a name="0607196000125">David
Taylor:</b> Given that the Home Office is feeling its way
through this incoherent and inaccurate maze of figures that underpin
its performance and direction, can the hon. Gentleman suggest why it is
so certain that savings that are available under contestability and
outsourcing are sufficient to apply those two techniques on a grand
scale to the National Offender Management
Service?</p><p><a name="0607196000012"><b><a name="0607196000126">Mr.
Bacon:</b> I do not think that I can. Many of the so-called
savings to be found under various aspects of Government efficiency
programmes&#151;had we been in office, they would probably have been
found under the James committee savings&#151;are very questionable. A
different example, with which the Financial Secretary will be only too
familiar, is that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is busy
sacking fraud staff, who were bringing in many hundreds of times their
own salary in some cases, in order to meet rather spurious targets.
However, I will not dwell on
that.</p><p><a name="0607196000013">The result of all
that activity was that the Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir John
Bourn, was unable to reach an opinion on the truth and fairness of the
Home Office accounts for 2004-05, so he disclaimed an audit opinion. It
is worth explaining what disclaiming means. A disclaimer is not the
same as a qualified opinion. We are familiar with the idea of qualified
opinions&#151;for example, because of concerns about fraud and error,
there has been a qualified opinion on the Department for Work and
Pensions&#146; accounts since 1988, which specifies the particular
aspects, such as housing benefit fraud, income support fraud or
whatever, that are the subject of concern. The same happens with the
European Court of Auditors in respect of EU accounts. However, that is
not what I am talking about. This is Sir John Bourn, an Officer of the
House, telling Parliament that he has no information at all with which
to form a view. The accounts were presented to Parliament
unaudited.</p><p><a name="0607196000014">Irrespective of whether we are
talking about a public or a private sector organisation, that is an
almost unbelievable state of affairs. It is hard to imagine any private
sector organisation&#151;whether it be a golf club or a multinational
corporation&#151;for which that would fail to lead to enormous
consequences. The Home Office cannot say with any certainty how much it
spent during the year, what debts it was owed and what it 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 258</b><br>owed to others or what assets it owns. There is no assurance that all
expenditure incurred during the year was in line with what Parliament
authorised and financial information provided by the Home Office is
unreliable. Those are the most basic failures of financial stewardship
and control by the accounting officer who is legally responsible to
Parliament to account for how moneys are spent.</p><p><a name="0607196000015">In that case, the accounting
officer failed in his duty to Parliament and one might have thought
that the person responsible would have been hauled over the coals,
exposed and brought to the Bar of the House to explain himself. What
actually happened, however, was that he was promoted to become Deputy
Governor of the Bank of England in charge of financial stability in the
banking system, which, if nothing else, at least shows that the people
who run the country still have a sense of humour.</p><p><a name="0607196000016">What I would like to know is
where the Treasury is in all that. The NAO memo goes on to state
that</p><a name="0607196000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;late qualified
accounts are extremely damaging to the Home Office&#146;s reputation,
particularly with the Treasury who are likely to exercise closer
scrutiny over the unaudited resource budget outturn submitted to them
each summer.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000017">What
assurances can the Financial Secretary give us about the Home
Office&#146;s use of public money? Is the Treasury now keeping a
close eye on what happens? What supervision regime is now in place? Is
there now a Treasury hit squad inside the Home Office helping to sort
things out? How often does the Home Office have to report in and tell
the Treasury what it is doing? It has been a disgraceful episode and I
hope that it is soon sorted
out.</p><p><a name="0607196000018">I come to the
national programme for information technology in the health service. I
do so with some trepidation because I see that the hon. Member for
Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) is in his place. The last time I
made a speech on this subject&#151;it was some years ago, I can
reassure him&#151;he said that he was glad that there were anoraks in
this place who were prepared to devote so much attention to such areas
and that he was very glad that he was not one of them. I have to say
that the problems have not gone away; if anything, they have become
worse. The scale of the national programme is simply huge. As the NAO
described
it:</p><a name="0607196000108"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The scope,
vision, scale and complexity of the Programme is wider and more
extensive than any ongoing or planned healthcare IT development
programme in the
world.&#148;</p></ul><a name="0607196000096"><p>It started
with the beguiling idea that information technology offered enormous
potential benefits for the NHS. Above all, patient records could follow
the patient smoothly and quickly around the system, bookings could be
made online, and doctors could consult records easily in their
surgeries and during their rounds. Managers and clinicians could track
and report on the work of hospitals and trusts, on the prevalence of
clinical conditions and on the success of the health service in
treating them. IT in the NHS seemed to offer nothing short of a
revolution. However, the problem was that the revolution appeared to be
outside the Government&#146;s control. System standards were being
set at the centre, as they should be, but system procurement was
happening at a local and trust level.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 259</b><br><p><a name="0607196000019"><b><a name="0607196000127">Kitty
Ussher (Burnley) (Lab):</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned
procurement. Will he join me in congratulating the Department of Health
on having secured the cheapest ever deal with Microsoft across the
whole
world?</p><p><a name="0607196000020"><b><a name="0607196000128">Mr.
Bacon:</b> The hon. Lady may recall that Sir Peter Gershon,
when he was at the Office of Government Commerce, negotiated a deal
with Microsoft that saved the taxpayer &#163;120 million. As the hon.
Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine) said earlier, there have been
serious problems with the public sector failing to exercise the
procurement power that it has, and I welcome any steps towards
improving procurement and using the purchasing power that is
available.</p><p><a name="0607196000021">In relation
to the national programme&#151;in which Microsoft is not involved, by
the way&#151;the system standards have been set at the centre, but
procurement has happened locally. The whole process must have seemed
terribly slow to those who wanted to make things happen more quickly.
That was why, some years ago, the Prime Minister called to a seminar
the heads of some of the world&#146;s largest IT companies. They told
him that there was no problem and that they could design, deliver and
install national systems across the entire NHS that would do everything
that the most optimistic advocate of health IT could want. Of course,
they said it would not be cheap and they quoted a figure of &#163;2.3
billion, but, as the Prime Minister said, up to 600 million pieces of
paper would be saved a
year.</p><p><a name="0607196000022">Thus the national
programme for IT in the health service was born and with it a new
bureaucracy, Connecting for Health. Promises were made, headlines
garnered and giant regional contracts were duly let. However, five
years on, where are we? For one thing, the cost of the whole programme
has inflated enormously. By 2003-04, &#163;6.2 billion worth of
contracts had been placed and, in evidence to the PAC, the director
general of IT in the health service, Mr. Richard Granger, told us that
the figure is now &#163;12.4 billion. The Minister of State for
Health has said that the figure is closer to &#163;20 billion,
although there is some dispute about what he is including in that. In
any event, those are huge numbers.</p><p><a name="0607196000023"><b><a name="0607196000129">David
Taylor:</b> Even taking the mean of those projected figures,
it suggests an overspend of &#163;12.5 billion, which would fund in
total the trust deficits that the NHS is experiencing for more than 20
years, which would take us moderately close to the next Conservative
Government.</p><p><a name="0607196000024"><b><a name="0607196000130">Mr.
Bacon:</b> The hon. Gentleman ends on a very optimistic note,
and I join him in that. The fact is that the numbers, as well as being
very large, have been very varied. We have heard &#163;2.3 billion;
&#163;6.2 billion; &#163;6.8 billion; &#163;1.9 billion of
central costs, making a total of &#163;8.7 billion; &#163;3.4
billion of central costs making &#163;12.4 billion; &#163;20
billion; and three to five times central contract costs, which could
push the figure to more than &#163;30 billion. The fact that the
figures are so vague and varied is part of the problem. The potential
opportunity cost is also enormous, as the hon. Gentleman points
out.</p><p><a name="0607196000025"><b><a name="0607196000131">Dr.
Pugh:</b> Apart from the central cost, there is the serious
issue of what the programme will cost individual trusts and PCTs. No
one will put a figure on that.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 260</b><br><p><a name="0607196000026"><b><a name="0607196000132">Mr.
Bacon:</b> The National Audit Office put a figure of
&#163;3.4 billion on it, although how much that takes into account
the full costs is a moot point. One has only to read the board papers
of trusts around the country to see IT directors saying that they are
incurring costs that they cannot recover, in many cases including costs
that they incurred through the old information for health programme
that was stopped when the national programme for IT in the health
service was started and costs incurred on legacy systems. No matter
exactly what the sum is, it is definitely big. One could say that cost
overruns are nothing new; they are regrettable and to be avoided, but
they happen. However, surely in return for that vast forecast
expenditure we would now expect to be on the way towards a
world-beating IT system.</p><p><a name="0607196000027"><b><a name="0607196000133">Kitty
Ussher:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain where, within the
scope of the motion that we debating this evening, the report on IT in
the NHS
lies?</p><p><a name="0607196000028"><b><a name="0607196000134">Mr.
Bacon:</b> As the hon. Lady will know, we have looked at the
national programme for IT in the health service a number of times
during the last few years and I dare say that there will be future
reports. In fact, the National Audit Office has said there will be
other reports on it further down the line. It is a matter of enormous
importance to taxpayers and, I am sure, to all members of the
Committee.</p><p><a name="0607196000029">One of the
suggestions that has been made by Connecting for Health is that 750,000
prescriptions have been issued by using the electronic prescribing
service. One of the slightly alarming facts is that only 1.5 per cent.
of those were received electronically by pharmacies and hence
dispensed. The rest of them&#151;some of 740,000&#151;simply
vanished into the ether, never to be seen or heard of again. The
thought of thousands of NHS staff typing pointlessly away is a
combination of industry and futility that I find rather depressing to
contemplate. The reason for that state of affairs is that, where
systems were put in place in GP surgeries, the corresponding systems
were not put in place in pharmacies, and sometimes vice versa. That is
a relatively small example of some of the problems. There are many
others.</p><p><a name="0607196000030">Perhaps the
most important and difficult component of the national programme is the
delivery of patient administration and clinical systems into acute
hospital trusts. We should by now have 110 acute hospitals with patient
administration and clinical systems in place. The actual number is just
12. Of those 12, how many are clinical systems? The answer is none. Not
a single hospital-wide clinical system has been delivered under the
national programme.</p><p><a name="0607196000031">The choose and book system
should allow patients to book appointments with doctors electronically.
Almost half of all GP referrals&#151;some 8.5 million a
year&#151;are supposed to be made under that system by September
2007, but so far we have only 300,000 bookings. The number of bookings
can found on the Connecting for Health website. What is not on the
website, but is true, is that by the Department of Health&#146;s own
estimate, only about one quarter of the bookings that have been
achieved were made truly electronically; the remaining three quarters
were made by telephone.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 261</b><br><p><a name="0607196000032">One redeeming feature in this
rather grim scene is that most of the forecast cost of the national
programme has yet to be spent. So far, total expenditure is about
&#163;1.5 billion. That figure of actual expenditure so far was
confirmed to the Committee by the director general of IT in the health
service. Although &#163;1.5 billion is admittedly rather more than
the &#163;654 million referred to in the National Audit Office
report, it leaves us wondering what sort of organisation can run up
almost &#163;850 million of central administration costs before it
has even achieved its main aims. However, it remains true that many
billions of pounds have yet to be spent, so it may not be too late to
turn back from the road that we are currently on.</p><p><a name="0607196000033">That is a crucial point. It is
easy to think of NHS IT as a complex and enormously expensive
abstraction&#151;as a subject for techies and computer journalists,
but not for politicians or the national media. In fact, good IT systems
offer enormous benefits to patients and bad ones cause them direct
harm. The national programme is therefore an issue of great importance.
The US firm Cerner, and its partner Fujitsu, have the regional
contracts covering the south of England under the programme. It has
recently been reported that Cerner is also to enter into a contract
with BT to deliver systems in London after problems with another US
software supplier, IDX. The Nuffield orthopaedic centre in Oxford is
the only trust under the national programme now using the patient
administration system offered by Cerner. I have been shown a board
paper from the trust, which shows that the trust failed to meet its
waiting list targets because IT system problems meant that it could not
identify which patients were waiting for what treatment. The paper, by
the director of nursing and operations for the trust,
states:</p><a name="0607196000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the scale of the
difficulties and the duration of time that the problems persisted meant
that operationally it was impossible to maintain assurance that all
patients could be identified to be treated within appropriate
timescales.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000034">In fact, the
standard of the patient information produced by the software system was
so low that all the information had to be checked and corrected
manually. In other words, the trust and its patients would have been
better off with no electronic system at
all.</p><p><a name="0607196000035">In Birmingham
children&#146;s hospital, the patient administration system was
provided by the troubled UK firm iSOFT. A series of problems in
Birmingham culminated in the trust losing 800 children&#146;s records
in a fortnight. Some of those children turned up for appointments
entirely unexpectedly because their records could not be found, while
others were presumably not summoned for appointments that they
required. To give one more example, the child health system deployed by
BT in London lost so many children&#146;s records that the number of
vaccinations given to children in the primary care trusts that were
even in a position to report any statistics went down by 18 per
cent.</p><p><a name="0607196000036">Volume 16, No. 25
of &#147;CDR Weekly&#148;, the Health Protection Agency&#146;s
journal,
stated:</p><a name="0607196000110"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is
the third quarterly report in which national trends could not be
reported due to problems with new child health systems being
implemented in London. Comparing the year 2005/6 to 2004/5, the number
of children in London who are missing from the COVER programme is
nearly 18,000 for 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 262</b><br>children turning 12 months, over 14,500 for children turning 24 months
and nearly 19,000 for children turning 5 years of
age.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000037">The number
of children getting vital vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella,
polio and so on fell by a fifth. The Health Protection Agency
commented:</p><a name="0607196000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If
new child systems fail to deliver ... then children risk missing out on
vaccination. Thus, they remain unprotected and eventually will catch
measles, mumps, and rubella
infections.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000038">The HPA
report
continued:</p><a name="0607196000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Falls
in coverage of this magnitude not only indicate that individual
children may be at risk, but also represent a potential major public
health threat to the control of the diseases in the
community.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000039">Those are
chilling words. It is extraordinary that no clinical systems have been
deployed under the national programme. However, on reflection, given
the damage that patient administration systems now seem to be doing,
perhaps that is just as well. The implications of similar failures in
clinical systems hardly bear thinking
about.</p><p><a name="0607196000040">Finally, I want
to deal briefly with the consequences of the crisis in the national
programme for IT contractors. Mr. Granger, the programme&#146;s
director general, is fond of using blood-curdling metaphors when
speaking about IT contractors. He intends, he says, to treat them like
huskies&#151;when one goes lame, it is shot, cut up and fed to the
rest&#151;apparently, that keeps them keen. However, managing a
massive IT programme is not like running a dog sled. I believe that
that brand of macho management threatens to bring yet more chaos to an
already tottering
system.</p><p><a name="0607196000041">By the end of
March this year, the four major contractors&#151;BT, Accenture,
Fujitsu and CSC&#151;had received only &#163;250 million
in payments on&#163;5 billion-worth of
contracts.</p><p><a name="0607196000042">However, their
spending in what I believe to be a doomed effort to make the
fundamentally flawed system work has been massive. Accenture has wisely
already set aside &#163;260 million as provisions against losses on
the contract, but the remaining three companies have remained strangely
silent. By the end of March this year&#151;two and a half years
in&#151;BThad received just &#163;1.3 million on its
contract of&#163;996 million. My best advice indicates that
BT has spent more than &#163;200 million trying to get systems up and
running. That amount does not yet figure in its annual accounts. I
understand that BT intends to replace its existing software supplier
with Cerner, fresh from that company&#146;s poor performance at
Nuffield. However, that means that most, or perhaps all, of BT&#146;s
work in progress on the existing contract will need to be written off.
We have already seen what happened to the software supplier iSOFT, when
shareholders&#151;</p><p><a name="0607196000043"><b><a name="0607196000135">Mr.

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 263</b><br>several occasions, as I am sure it will be in the future. It is the
largest civilian IT programme in the world and a matter of great
importance. I hope that it is also of great importance to the Treasury
and that the Financial Secretary will find time in his winding-up
speech to refer to the interest that the Treasury has in the matter,
because the amounts involved are so enormous that they could have huge
consequences for the Exchequer, fiscal policy and, indeed, the rest of
the country.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607196000121">9.59
pm</h5><p><a name="0607196000045"><b><a name="0607196000137">Helen
Goodman (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> It is a pleasure to take
part in this debate and, indeed, to serve on the PAC under the benign
and good-humoured chairmanship of the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr.
Leigh). Like him and my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North
(Sarah McCarthy-Fry), I have looked at the 17th report,
&#147;Achieving value for money in the delivery of public
services&#148;, because every member of the PAC wants the Committee
to be effective. We want its work to be used and useful; we want to be
sure that lessons are learned and are taken into account in decision
making.</p><p><a name="0607196000046">The 17th
report identified seven key aspects of public service delivery that
Departments must target to achieve better value for money: planning
carefully prior to implementation; strengthening project management;
reducing complexity and bureaucracy; raising public service
productivity; being more commercially astute; tackling fraud; and
better and more timely implementation of policies and programmes. An
example of good planning is the benefit payment card, which is
successful as 97 per cent. of benefits are paid direct into
people&#146;s accounts and claimants are pleased with it. Another
good example is the turnaround at the passport agency.</p><p><a name="0607196000047">Turning to project management,
there have been many complex IT schemes. Like the hon. Member for South
Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), I am generally not a fan of IT schemes, but we
have become better at running them. As for the need to reduce
complexity and bureaucracy, the Committee has returned to the benefits
system as we need to reduce tiers of bureaucracy and the number of
institutions delivering public services. Public service productivity
improvements include a better use of accommodation in the NHS and the
higher education sector. The role of the Office of Government Commerce
is vital if we are to achieve the goal of being more commercially
astute, and after the reports were produced we looked at the issue
again. There is a great deal to be done to tackle fraud in tax
payments, and in its examination of policies that need to be
implemented better and in a more timely manner the 17th report looked
at the Eurofighter and the Apache helicopter.</p><p><a name="0607196000048">In considering whether the
reports are used and are useful, I looked at the document that the
Treasury published last Thursday entitled, &#147;Releasing the
resources to meet the challenges ahead: value for money in the 2007
Comprehensive Spending Review&#148;. I wished to make a judgment
about whether or not the proposal to save 2.5 per cent. and achieve
better administration is credible, because last week there was 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 264</b><br>a great deal of scepticism about that objective and many aspersions were
cast on it. The Gershon efficiency programme identified five measures
to improve efficiency. Inevitably, they are not the same as the
measures identified by the NAO, although there is considerable overlap.
For example, the NAO and the PAC said that it was important to be more
commercially astute, but the Treasury document looked at procurement
practices in general. The NAO discussed productivity, but the Treasury
document looked at the importance of increasing the ratio of productive
time to total time in the public services. The NAO discussed the need
to reduce complexity and bureaucracy, but the Treasury document looked
at transactional services policy, funding and regulation. In addition,
it urged the importance of reducing spending in corporate services. It
reported that in recent years, there have been &#163;8 billion-worth
of savings as a result of those five measures. However, I am sure that
everybody would be more interested in looking forward, so I wanted to
see whether examples of the type given in the document issued last week
are likely to produce the sort of savings that would result in a 2.5
per cent. saving year on year
overall.</p><p><a name="0607193000002">On procurement, the examples
given are pulling together procurement for several Government
Departments and public bodies. For example, the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development
are to collocate many offices. The Department for Transport will
promote collaboration between highways authorities on new build and
maintenance. The Department for Education and Skills is piloting
e-procurement for schools. Lord Carter&#146;s review of legal aid
will provide a market-based approach which should produce savings of 20
per cent. over the next four years. In addition to these value for
money considerations, procurement will need to take account of the
decisions set out in the energy review and the need for procurement to
be compliant with our climate change objectives in the
future.</p><p><a name="0607193000003">Turning to
productive time, the sort of possibilities spelled out are the major
changes in the Department for Constitutional Affairs with regard to the
running of the court system, and in the Ministry of Defence the merging
of the Defence Logistics Organisation with the Defence Procurement
Agency. The Lyons review made recommendations on the use of assets,
from which should flow significant asset disposals projected to be
&#163;30 billion in the period up to 2010. The Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Treasury are to improve the
release of land for house building. So there are a large number of
chunky examples.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060718/debtext/60718-1004.htm"/>


<p><a name="0607193000004">The
PAC also considered the reduction of complexity and bureaucracy. It is
important to see how that is to be carried forward. Examples include
reducing the number of funding streams for improving the social housing
stock, and rationalising the number of contact centres and local
offices in order to share provision across the public sector and reduce
duplication through better data sharing.</p><p><a name="0607193000005">The PAC concentrated a great
deal on the need to reduce fraud. Improvements are being made to the
operation of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to cut evasion of
vehicle excise duty. That is projected 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 265</b><br>to save &#163;140 million a year. The court system is changing the
administration of fixed penalty notices, which will reduce the scope
for defrauding the public
purse.</p><p><a name="0607193000006">On
implementation, which is another of the overlapping themes, the
Department of Health is reviewing systemic delivery issues to improve
treatment pathways. That will cut the length of patients&#146;
hospital stays, which should benefit not just the public purse, but
patients.</p><p><a name="0607193000007">On the two
other factors identified by the PAC in its 17th report, improving
planning and improving project management, there is no explicit
read-across to the plans for the comprehensive spending review.
However, the NAO commented on the importance of strengthening
Government Departments&#146; capabilities. That means upskilling
staff to raise their capacity to plan and manage complex projects. That
is being done partly by upskilling within Departments and partly by
strengthening central support and collaboration. For example, the work
of the Office of Government Commerce and the introduction of the
gateway system, which we have discussed, will no doubt turn out to be
important. It could also be said that the process of cross-cutting
reviews and zero-based budgeting is part of improving planning and
management.</p><p><a name="0607193000008">To
summarise, when the 17th report by the PAC was published, the Chairman
said:</p><a name="0607193000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the
scale of Government spending just a 2 per cent. improvement in the use
of resources could generate savings of&#163;8 billion a
year.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000009">In the forthcoming
comprehensive spending review, the Government have gone further,
identifying scope for saving 2.5 per cent. a year. Looking at the range
of measures and policies, that appears to be completely credible. We
have come a long way from the Gladstonian approach&#151;or even the
17th century, candle-ends approach. To achieve that, it will be
necessary to re-engineer processes and utilise the procurement scope of
the &#163;125 billion that the Government already spend. But I am
sure that that will turn out to be possible, and that as the PAC goes
on to do further work we will find further possibilities that the
Government will be able to make use
of.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607193000095">10.10

David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> May I start by
returning to a point that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)
made in introducing the debate? This is no time of the evening for a
debate of such importance on matters that are so crucial to the
efficient governance of the country. The Public Accounts Committee does
a very important job. It produces reports that are of enormous value,
and they ought to be given proper and timely scrutiny by the House.
That is not achieved by a debate such as this in which, with very few
exceptions, the participants are Committee members. I notice that
Members present include the hon. Members for South Norfolk(Mr.

debate is only to be an expanded Committee meeting, it fails its
primary purpose. I hope that the Government&#146;s business managers
take note of that and ensure that in future we have a more appropriate

it is in the best interests of taxpayers that we do so. But has the
hon. Gentleman noticed that the Government&#146;s business
managers&#151;the Whips&#151;are also Treasury Ministers, and if
Ministers on the Treasury Bench are required to stay late this evening,
it can only be because of actions of the Treasury itself, and they
might think of that in future, before timing a debate in this
way?</p><p><a name="0607193000012"><b><a name="0607193000100">Mr.
Heath:</b> Let us hope so, but I am not entirely sure that the
usual channels work in that way.</p><p><a name="0607193000013">Let me pay tribute again to the
work of the PAC. Its Chairman used the word &#147;assiduity&#148;
in terms of his office. Assiduity is one of those words that nowadays
have almost solely a parliamentary usage: no one other than
parliamentarians talks of being assiduous, justas no one else
talks about being churlish. But it is a relevant word: this Committee
is assiduous in its approach to its work, for which we are
grateful.</p><p><a name="0607193000014">I have never
had the pleasure of serving on the PAC, but I did serve on what is
perhaps an analogous body before I entered the House. I was an audit
commissioner, and I know about the important work that was done by the
Audit Commission&#151;the sister body of the National Audit
Office&#151;and the importance of our reports in improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of local government and the national
health service.</p><p><a name="0607193000015">The
other important point to make is that the PAC&#146;s reports are not
all about disasters; they are not all about things going wrong. We need
to put it on the record that they often point to good practice, and
sometimes even excellence, in public services. If we do not recognise
that, we give a false perspective of the Committee&#146;s
work.</p><p><a name="0607193000016">Having said
that, it is inevitable that we concentrate on those areas where the
Government are performing less well. We have heard mention of areas
that I do not intend to pursue. The hon. Member for Portsmouth, North
mentioned Ministry of Defence procurement; that has been a long-term
concern of mine and I still do not think that we get it right. However
hard the MOD tries to improve its procurement, it does not get it
right, and too often there are some absurdities in procurement
procedures, which we can ill afford. Not only do they cost money; they
reduce our armed forces&#146; effectiveness and sometimes put them at
risks that they should not face, simply because of the lack of
correctness in procurement procedure.</p><p><a name="0607193000017">Nor am I going to go into
national health service IT procurement. I assume that the hon. Member
for South Norfolk was discussing earlier the 17th report&#146;s
reference to NHS IT, and that that was why his entire speech was in
order. I want to echo some of the concerns that he expressed by
pointing out that whenI met my local medical committee of
general practitioners in Somerset last week, top of their agenda 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 267</b><br>was their concern about the NHS IT contract&#146;s effect on their
practices. We in this House should be aware of that
issue.</p><p><a name="0607193000018">I do want to
mention the Home Office, and I share many of the concerns that have
already been expressed. The 34th report, on returning failed asylum
applicants, was the first crack that caused the entire edifice to
collapse, and not before time. The Home Office has been underperforming
in management, service delivery and, as we have already heard,
accountancy procedures for far too long. The hon. Member for
Portsmouth, North mentioned how often pilot schemes were progressed
without assessing the results. No Department is more guilty of that
than the Home Office, which is for ever starting pilot schemes and
rolling out the relevant programmes across the country&#151;sometimes
with disastrous results&#151;before the schemes have even run their
course, let alone before the evidence has been assessed. We see that in
legislation, as well; sometimes, legislation is amended before it has
even come into force. That is not the right way to run a Department of
such importance to the country, and I do hope that the new Home
Secretary is getting to grips with it, but I fear that the early signs
are not good. We must wait to see what happens in the days and months
to come.</p><p><a name="0607193000019">I turn to a
perhaps less obvious report&#151;the 40th, on efficiency in water
resource management in the Environment Agency. I have a particular and
personal interest in water resource management, as I live in a village
where we have been given notice of discontinuation of our water supply
by the Duke of Somerset. I want to stress the huge strains that are
being put on the Environment Agency, a body for which I have a great
deal of time, and which does absolutely essential work. My contention
is that the increasing costs of flood management are preventing it from
doing a lot of the other work in mitigation of environmental damage
that it ought to be doing. In particular, it is unable to provide the
level of resources for environmental protection that it should. I hope
that the Committee will return to that issue and the question of the
distribution of resources. It madethe point in the 40th report
that there was a blurring of the resources applied to water resource
management and to flood defence. In fact, that is a wider problem
within the Environment Agency, and, because I want it to do the best
possible job, and because I know the demands being put on its limited
resources, it is worth exploring further.</p><p><a name="0607193000020">I turn to one other use of the
Environment Agency&#146;s resources that came to my notice a few days
ago. A couple of websites belonging to the agency&#151;or, more
accurately, to the &#147;Asiantaeth yr Amgylchedd Cymru&#148;,

that is the Mells stream in Whatley and Nunney and the River Frome in

three villages do we have a monoglot Welsh speaker, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 268</b><br>and I am not entirely sure that it is a proper use of resources to use
translating facilities to provide individual websites for flood defence
and flood protection information in Welsh for my Somerset
villages.</p><p><a name="0607193000023">I know that
we are quite near to Wales. I suppose that we are a Marcher county. I
strongly support the view that there should be Welsh information for
Welsh people in Wales. However, I do not believe that it is a sensible
use of resources to provide information in Welsh about flood levels in
villages in Somerset, because we find it difficult to assimilate that
information. The Committee might like to consider that. Perhaps the
issue should have been incorporated in the report &#147;Lost in
translation?&#148; which was actually on an entirely different
subject.</p><p><a name="0607193000024">Lastly, I will
deal with tax credit fraud. It is an inevitable area of concern.
Exactly a year ago today, when the Committee issued its fourth report,
it was slightly optimistic about fraud. It reported:</p><a name="0607193000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Department has made
good progress in reducing losses from fraud and
error&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000025">Unfortunately,
the Department in question was the Department for Work and Pensions;
the tax credit system is operated by the Treasury through Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. We have the thirty-seventh report
on the Inland Revenue and I see within it a great deal of concern
expressed.</p><p><a name="0607193000026">We had the
original estimate of &#163;460 million of fraud in the tax credit
system. We know that that has now increased to about &#163;1.28
billion in the first year. We know also that the signs are that in the
second year of operation the figure will be as high again. Further, we
know that &#163;131 million of taxpayers&#146; money has been lost
to organised fraud&#151;to gangs working in collaboration, it would
appear, with civil servants, although that is yet to be established, to
defraud the Exchequer. In addition, we know that in the third year of
operation the overpayment of tax credits&#151;a point made by the
Chairman of the Committee&#151;is likely to be about &#163;1.8
billion. So many unhappy people have been given money which they
unwittingly received, not knowing that they were not entitled to it,
and have suffered the consequences of having that clawed back.
Sometimes that has caused great hardship to families because the money
was inevitably spent on children&#146;s clothes, Christmas presents
or whatever was required in the
household.</p><p><a name="0607193000027">In the first
three years of tax credits, &#163;5.8 billion has been overspent and
&#163;2.4 billion has been lost in fraud. There is at least a strong
suspicion that this was known to the Department back in 2004, and yet
the ePortal, which is thought to be the main occasion for fraud, was
not closed until December 2005.</p><p><a name="0607193000028">There is still a sense of denial
on the part of the Treasury about these facts. There is concern that it
has not come to grips with its under-performance in dealing with the
matter. Yet &#163;1 in every &#163;10 in this system is lost
through error and fraud. That being so, I think that we are entitled to
ask why better and more stringent action was not taken at any early
stage. When the Comptroller and Auditor General has to qualify the
accounts of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs year after year,
of all the Departments in the panoply of state, there are serious
questions to be asked.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 269</b><br><p><a name="0607193000029">I close by taking up a point that
the Chairman of the Committee may have raised slightly out of order in
that it was referred to in a report that was published only today and
is not part of our consideration. I will follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s lead by at least mentioning what he said. He used
the phrase, &#147;Getting it right the first time&#148;. That is a
key part of delivering good public services. Time and again in our
constituencies we as individual Members see examples of the inability
of public services to get it right first time, occasioning people to
come to our advice surgeries or write us letters that require us to
write letters on House of Commons notepaper, and miraculously what was
not right the first time is then sorted, because a Member of Parliament
has written to the chief executive of the agency concerned and that
then descends through the bureaucracy like a brick until it hits some
poor unfortunate who then has to recalculate the figures and get it
right. It should not be like that. People should have the expectation
and right that Government Departments will make the calculation to get
it right first time. Until we have systems that make sure that that is
the case, we are failing our citizens.</p><p><a name="0607193000030">Yet again I congratulate the
Public Accounts Committee on all its work in highlighting cases where
the Government Departments do not get it right, in the hope and
expectation that improvement will come. I hope that I am as optimistic
as the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman). I am not sure
that I am. She sees a bright new future for Government as a result of
the reports. I hope that that is the case because it is in all our
interests that it is the case, but I express a little cynicism and a
little pessimism, but let us hope that there is at least some
incremental improvement, and that the PAC has helped that
process.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607193000096">10.26
pm</h5><p><a name="0607193000031"><b><a name="0607193000101">Mr.
Sadiq Khan (Tooting) (Lab):</b> I begin as other colleagues
have ended, by paying tribute to Nick Wright, Chris Randall, Emma
Sawyer and Ronnie Jefferson who run the Committee&#146;s office so
efficiently, and also to the Comptroller and Auditor
General,Sir John Bourn, and his team at the NAO, who really
are top drawer. I note the time, so I will focus primarily on two
particular reports in the motion, the 22nd and the 37th reports, that
may not otherwise receive the attention that I believe they
deserve.</p><p><a name="0607193000032">Last time we
discussed a PAC report in January 2006, the Financial Secretary
described our work as a tour de force. However, it is not just the
Financial Secretary or the Treasury who take an interest in our
reports. It is not even the &#147;Today&#148; programme, which
cherry-picks and selects the most outrageously critical comments of the
Chairman against the Government, which has an interest in the work that
we do. What is remarkable is how non-governmental organisations,
pressure groups, constituents and other Departments take an interest in
our work, and the work that we do provides an opening or a springboard
for things that they can
do.</p><p><a name="0607193000033">The 22nd report was
one such report. The Chairman in his comments talked about the impact
on the end user, and the 22nd report is a good example. That report was
on the subject of maintaining and improving Britain&#146;s railway
stations. As all constituents 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 270</b><br>in Tooting will know, I have been campaigning for improvements in
Earlsfield station in my constituency for some time now. At the
beginning of this month, a help point was installed, which enables
disabled passengers to utilise a free taxi service that
willtake them to an accessible station. This followed
confirmation that I received at the Committee meeting on 12 October
that the Association of Train Operating Companies would be investing
&#163;600,000 to improve such facilities across the network, and
train operating companies such as South West Trains have followed that
lead.</p><p><a name="0607193000034">However, in its
report the Committee highlighted the fact that more than half of the
country&#146;s stations are not fully accessible to the disabled.
That led me to table early-day motion 911, which 141 colleagues have
signed, although one or two Committee members still have not done so,
and I highly recommend them to do so. The situation highlighted by our
Committee and by the early-day motion is clearly unacceptable.
Therefore, as I said earlier, I welcome the Department for
Transport&#146;s commitment to invest &#163;370 million over the
next decade to address the issues that we raised, which are in breach
of the Disability Discrimination Act
1995.</p><p><a name="0607193000035">I was
disappointed that Earlsfield was not included in the 47 stations
initially chosen for the study, but I am pleased about the objectives
outlined in the railways for all strategy. Once again, I would like the
Committee to take some of the credit for the conclusions that that
strategy reached. It called for improvements to be made in a shorter
time frame, and our report highlighted that insufficient attention had
been paid to the quality of stations. Now that the Department for
Transport is responsible for stations strategy, I hope that it will
respond accordingly to that
recommendation.</p><p><a name="0607193000036">Station
security is another important area that the Committee investigated, and
I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler) will
hand in a petition tomorrow highlighting concerns that we first raised
in our Committee. Balham station in my constituency particularly
concerned me, and I raised the matter in Committee, because there
appeared to be complacency about passenger security. Our Committee
highlighted the point that few train operating companies had joined
national schemes to improve security and reduce
crime.</p><p><a name="0607193000037">The report cited
the three most reassuring facilities for passengers&#151;the presence
of staff, effective lighting and closed circuit television. I
acknowledge that the Treasury has contended that improvements to
personal safety will only increase train usage by
approximately2 per cent., as opposed to the 11 per cent.
figure quoted in the report, but that does not reduce the significance
of safer stations, and I am sure that I speak for hon. Members on both
sides of the House when I say that the safety and security of our
constituents is of paramount
importance.</p><p><a name="0607193000038">The report
also confirmed that the original franchise agreements failed to place
suitable emphasis on the improvement of facilities. I therefore welcome
the Government&#146;s increased expectations regarding station
security within future franchise agreements. Investment in British
Transport police increased by 24 per cent. in the past year, as the
issue began to receive the necessary recognition.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 271</b><br><p><a name="0607193000039">The Committee also highlighted
the complicated and inflexible procedures employed by Network Rail,
which many see as an obstacle in the path of improvement to station
services. The majority of our stations around the country are more than
100 years old, and approximately 15 per cent. of them are listed
buildings. Moreover, as I learned at first hand, too many organisations
are responsible for station maintenance. I understand that work is
under way on a new stations&#146; code to establish more effective
contractual arrangements, and I believe that that is essential if
stations are to make progress on maintenance, security and
facilities.</p><p><a name="0607193000040">The hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr. Heath) has mentioned the
Committee&#146;s 37th report, &#147;Inland Revenue Standard Report:
New Tax Credits&#148;, and my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth,
North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) has mentioned the 36th report, which is
connected to it. When we questioned the chairman of HM Revenue and
Customs on 14 December in Committee, I established that tax credits had
the highest take-up of any benefit delivered through a credit system.
Tax credits benefit at least 3,600 families in my constituency and a
total of 6.1 million families nationwide, which include 10 million
children. I understand from the evidence that we heard and from the
excellent questions that I
asked&#151;</p><p><a name="0607193000041"><b><a name="0607193000102">Mr.
Davidson:</b> You did.</p><p><a name="0607193000042"><b><a name="0607193000103">Mr.
Khan:</b> From a sedentary position, my hon. Friend has
complimented my questioning, and I thank him for the
compliment.</p><p><a name="0607193000043"><b><a name="0607193000104">Kitty
Ussher:</b> So do I.</p><p><a name="0607193000044"><b><a name="0607193000105">Mr.
Khan:</b> Another hon. Friend has also complimented
me.</p><p><a name="0607193000045">I understand that
the take-up rate is particularly high among low-income families at 93
per cent. compared with only 47 per cent. for the old working families
tax credit. I welcome the commitment by the Government, the Treasury
and HMRC to improve the efficiency of tax credit administration. The
problems associated with overpayments highlighted in the report have
prevented that laudable scheme from receiving the praise that it
certainly deserves. Overpayments are inherent in the system, because of
the provisional nature of the awards. I have been assured that HMRC is
confident that the changes implemented by the Government, which are
outlined in the report, will ensure that overpayments are significantly
reduced. The disregard for income increases has been raised from
&#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000, and claimants must advise HMRC of
changes in their circumstances within one
month.</p><p><a name="0607193000046">The report also
raised concerns about error and fraud. The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome has touched on those concerns, and I will not rehearse his
points.</p><p><a name="0607193000047"><b><a name="0607193000106">Mr.
Heath:</b> I sincerely hope that HMRC is coming to terms with
improving the system to prevent fraud. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 272</b><br>However, some constituents have told it several times about changes of
circumstance, but nothing has happened&#151;it is as though the
letters have disappeared into the ether&#151;which means that they
are still overpaid, despite having done everything that they can to
notify it. Is that not a cause for some
concern?</p><p><a name="0607193000048"><b><a name="0607193000107">Mr.
Khan:</b> Absolutely. The permanent secretary who gave
evidence to our Committee took that on the chin and said that the
Department will not seek to recover whatever payments are made through
no fault of the claimant. That is some comfort to the distressed
constituents mentioned by the hon.
Gentleman.</p><p><a name="0607193000049">As we heard
in our evidence, increased attempts at tax credit fraud resulted in the
website being closed down. I welcome the Government&#146;s decision
to double the number of pre-payment checks before issuing a tax credit
award. The Committee was reassured that the majority of attempts to
commit identity fraud through the tax credit system were prevented.
Nevertheless, I am pleased that HMRC will now be more proactive in
contacting certain claimants. The Financial Secretary has taken this
issue very seriously, as has his Department. Nevertheless, it is
important to maintain the right balance between keeping the system
user-friendly, thereby maintaining a high take-up and helping the most
vulnerable in our communities, and preventing fraud and
overpayments.</p><p><a name="0607193000050"><b><a name="0607193000108">Mr.
Davidson:</b> May I say that the excellence of my hon.
Friend&#146;s questions is matched only by the magnificence of his
speeches? Does he agree that the PAC offers the only forum where it is
possible to have a non-partisan discussion about a scheme such as tax
credits, which provides an enormous amount of benefits to a large
number of people yet has some clear difficulties and problems? In the
Chamber, we often end up with yah-boo politics that generate a great
deal of heat but very little light as regards clarifying the
difficulties.</p><p><a name="0607193000051"><b><a name="0607193000109">Mr.
Khan:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and would recommend
three sources that confirm what he says. First, the report prepared by
the NAO was based on facts and figures rather than dogma. Secondly, the
transcript of our evidence, including the questions asked by the
Chairman and other hon. Members on both sides of the House, concerned
the process and implementation of the scheme rather than the party
politics. Thirdly, the PAC report was very balanced and dealt with the
facts, problems and challenges while recognising the benefits in a
non-party political way. It is a shame that, the day after our report
was published, the &#147;Today&#148; programme decided to
cherry-pick the criticisms, not the excellent and balanced parts that
were of a non-party political
nature.</p><p><a name="0607193000052">I should like
to end with a couple of words of caution. First, an issue raised in
January this year has still not been dealt with&#151;namely, that
very good reports are being produced but they are produced too long
after the initial NAO reports. When our Chairman wound up the previous
debate, he said that he would look into that. I think that a huge
amount of progress still needs to be
made.</p><p><a name="0607193000053">Secondly, the
purpose of the PAC is to provide parliamentary scrutiny of the
Executive, but that does 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 273</b><br>not mean that it always needs to be critical. The hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome&#151;I think that I have quoted him three times in
my speech, which must be a record, and always with a generous
interpretation of his words&#151;highlighted good practice, best
practice and excellent practice that appear to have been lost. I am
concerned that in providing parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive,
the PAC may be seen merely to be critical when it will sometimes be
complimentary. That may lead to our Committee being perceived in a way
that is unhelpful to those who give evidence, and those of us who are
members may become cynical in that regard. Witnesses, who often want to
come and be open and get to the root of the problems, may become wary
of doing so because of our reputation.</p><p><a name="0607193000054">I hope that the experience of
the past 300 years will continue in terms of the spirit of our
Committee in providing scrutiny, some good and some not so
good.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607193000097">10.39
pm</h5><p><a name="0607193000055"><b><a name="0607193000110">Greg
Clark (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> At this stage of the
debate, everything that ought to be said has been said, but not
everybody has said it. I shall therefore follow suit and praise the
chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh).
He is an indulgent Chairman to Committee members but a fearsome
Chairman in the eyes of witnesses. I remember, with a mixture of horror
and admiration, his intervening on one witness, whose answer was full
of circumlocution, to tell him that he was speaking drivel and that, if
he did not do better in the next half hour, he should not go further.
It will take me many years to reach that admirable level of intolerance
of waffle. I have greatly enjoyed serving under my hon. Friend&#146;s
chairmanship.</p><p><a name="0607193000056">I pay
tribute to the National Audit Office underSir John Bourn. It,
too, chooses its words carefully and I often marvel at the
understatement with whichit delivers withering judgments.
Using the word &#147;disclaim&#148;, which my hon. Friend the
Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) mentioned, is a modest way in
which to pronounce a devastating verdict on a set of accounts. Perhaps
that serves as a totem forSir John&#146;s approach. We all
know what he means, but he expresses it diplomatically.</p><p><a name="0607193000057">May I also put on record my
appreciation of the work of the Committee staff and the Treasury
representatives, who respond to questions that are often naive, at
least on my part, with enthusiasm and helpfulness, which often goes
beyond the call of duty?I am grateful for
that.</p><p><a name="0607193000058">I intended to
praise the speech of the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan), but in the
light of his comments, perhaps I should give way so that he can praise
his own contribution. However, he always makes a lively contribution in
the Committee and he has done that again
tonight.</p><p><a name="0607193000059">Given the
lateness of the hour, I want to comment on only three subjects that we
have considered: the BBC; our report on competition, which was directed
at the Office of Fair Trading, and the report, which several hon.
Members mentioned, on tax credits.</p><p><a name="0607193000060">The Chairman referred to our
perennial plea to be given oversight of the BBC, or least to allow the
National Audit Office access. I want to reinforce that. I 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 274</b><br>should perhaps declare an interest because I worked for the BBC in a
previous existence. One of my duties was being the point man who
haggled with the NAO about what went into its report on the World
Service, which is the one part of the BBC to which the NAO has
unfettered access. I know from that experience that there is no
question that the NAO&#146;s scrutiny of that part of the BBC
compromised its editorial or political integrity. It was entirely
proper that the use of public money be scrutinised in that way. The
contention that NAO involvement exposes the BBC to excessive political
interference is frankly nonsense.</p><p><a name="0607193000061">It is disappointing that the
Green Paper, which became a White Paper and is shortly to become a BBC
charter has given way in almost every respect to the BBC&#146;s
demands but not to those of Parliament. I do not know what insight that
provides into the Government&#146;s thinking, but it is
regrettable.</p><p><a name="0607193000062">Our report
on the BBC had a worthy subject&#151;the expansion of White
City&#151;but it is not one of the more central subjects. I hope
that, if the NAO has unfettered access, we might consider issues such
as the BBC&#146;s investment in digital and online services and its
commercial services in our debate next year or the subsequent year.
Such matters go to the heart of the appetite for proper public scrutiny
of the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="0607193000063">Let me give
an example of things going well. The hon. Members for Tooting and for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said that we should praise and
encourage. Our robust hearing on the important subject of the Office of
Fair Trading has already had a remarkably salutary effect. Under the
Competition Act 1998, the Office of Fair Trading acquired far-reaching
new powers, including the power to compel witnesses to give evidence
and to fine up to 10 per cent. of turnover. It has also had a huge
increase in its staff and budget levels.</p><p><a name="0607193000064">When representatives of the OFT
appeared before the Committee, however, we found that it had failed to
make use of those powers in almost every respect. Inquiries that were
meant to take between six months and a year were taking three years to
complete. Not one of the standards that the OFT had set itself, as
outlined on its website, had been met. Not once had the power to compel
witnesses to give evidence been used. The situation was unravelling to
such an extent that it gave the impression of being what I described as
a meek organisation.</p><p><a name="0607193000065">The chief executive of the OFT,
John Fingleton, was only six weeks into his term of office when he
appeared before the Committee. To his credit, however, he did not do
what he might reasonably have been expected to do, namely to claim that
he had not been there at the time. That would perhaps have been
understandable, but instead he took our criticisms on the chin and,
since that hearing, there has been a remarkable flurry of activity at
the OFT. It has launched inquiries into supermarkets, school uniform
suppliers and credit services, and there has been a real increase in
the pace and relevance of its inquiries. It is too early to say whether
all that will be matched by a sustained focus on quality, although I
obviously hope that it will be. I commend the OFT&#146;s positive
reaction to the NAO report and to the rather robust exchanges with all
hon. Members on the Committee.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 275</b><br><p><a name="0607193000066">The third subject that I want to
talk about is tax credits. Many hon. Members have mentioned this
already. Like the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), I
believe that this is an extremely important area of public policy. I
believe that to be the case for two reasons. First, as the hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome mentioned, the tax credits policy has caused the
report and accounts of the Inland Revenue to be qualified four times in
a row. Given that that is the flagship financial Department of the
Government, responsible directly to Treasury Ministers, this is a
matter of profound concern that should rightly be the concern of the
Committee.</p><p><a name="0607193000067">Secondly,
the new tax credits system cost &#163;16 billion, which is a huge sum
that requires proper scrutiny. As the hon. Member for Glasgow,
South-West said, the Committee is the only forum in which this amount
of Government spending can be scrutinised&#151;dare I say
professionally?&#151;without the partisan knockabout that we get
here. I should like to place on record my disappointment in the degree
of scrutiny of the tax credit system that we have been able to
exercise. In the pre-Budget report, the Government changed an important
part of the tax credit policy&#151;rightly, so far as one can tell on
paper. They increased the disregard for people&#146;s changes in
income from &#163;2,500 a year to &#163;25,000 a year. That is a
huge increase that will have huge financial consequences. It is
therefore important that the Committee should be able properly to
interrogate the reasons for that decision, to test whether the change
in policy offers value for money, and that is what we tried to
do.</p><p><a name="0607193000068">Committee members
from both sides of the House asked some very relevant questions.
Perhaps I should follow the example of the hon. Member for Tooting and
praise my own questions, as he did. I asked the questions that were on
everyone&#146;s mind. I asked the deputy chairman of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs the following
question:</p><a name="0607193000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Part
of the
assessment&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000069">in the
pre-Budget
report&#151;</p><a name="0607193000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;must have
been to have an idea of what the pure fiscal effect was of increasing

that?&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000070">Mr. Gray

&#147;Yes.&#148;</p><p><a name="0607193000074">That
information has not been provided. In the Committee&#146;s report,
the evidence that HMRC submitted said, in complete contrast to what was
told to us in the hearing:</p><a name="0607193000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is not possible to
produce reliable estimates of the cost of the individual elements on
their own&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000075">When we
discussed our draft report as a Committee, we noticed that the
information had not been provided, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 276</b><br>and we said that if it had been overlooked, we ought to draw attention
to it. I know that Labour Members participated in that discussion. We
therefore placed in the report recommendation 3, which
said:</p><a name="0607193000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Before
the Pre-Budget Report the Department estimated the cost of this element
of the package. The Department should provide details of the estimate
it made&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000076">In the
Treasury minute responding to the Committee&#146;s recommendations,
as Treasury minutes are required to do, we have yet again an answer
that is waffle to the point of being gobbledegook. It
says:</p><a name="0607193000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
figure refers to a change in what claimants would be entitled to. This
does not translate into a cost to the
Exchequer&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000077">That flies in
the face of the reasonable evidence that HMRC gave to the
Committee.</p><p><a name="0607193000078">Just to
emphasise the point that this information exists and is not being
provided to the Committee, I can tell the House that the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, which no one can accuse of being politically partisan,
put in a freedom of information request to obtain that information. In
a letter refusing to disclose it, HMRC wrote to Mike Brewer of the
IFS:</p><a name="0607193000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You have
requested information that HMRC holds about the likely cost in 2006/7,
2007/8 and 2008/9 of increasing the earnings disregard in tax credits
from &#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000...In this case we have
concluded that the public interest in withholding the information
outweighs the public interest in disclosing
it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0607193000079">I am very willing to
give way to the Financial Secretary if he can give us the
Treasury&#146;s calculation of the increase in the disregard or
explain just what is the public interest in withholding from the Public
Accounts Committee this crucial piece of evidence that witnesses before
the Committee said existed, that they promised to provide to the
Committee and that they have admitted to the IFS exists but have not
provided.</p><p><a name="0607193000080">We work quite
hard as a Committee, meeting twice a week. We take our responsibilities
seriously. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West mentioned, for
the most part we do not have party politics before our eyes when we are
scrutinising Government value for money. We all seriously want to get
to grips with the question of tax credits. My view, like that of many
Labour Members, is that tax credits have many virtues and it is
important to get them right and solve some of the overpayments that
cause such distress to many of our constituents. We can judge whether
that is the right reform only if the Government provide us with the
information to make that assessment.</p><p><a name="0607193000081">I hope that the Financial
Secretary will reflect on the contributions that have been made and,
perhaps, trust the Committee and Parliament a little more to do our job
in helping to scrutinise these measures. Even if it proves a little
embarrassing for Ministers, the function of the Public Accounts
Committee, going back into the mists of time, as the Chairman reported,
is sometimes to ask difficult questions. It does not give confidence,
and it is not an impressive performance by the Government, if
information is withheld, impeding us in our
duty.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607196000122">10.53

Ian Davidson (Glasgow, South-West) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I begin my
remarks with a tribute to the Chairman of the Committee. I am often
asked by my colleagues and, indeed, by Opposition Members what it is
like 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 277</b><br>serving under the hon. Member for Gainsborough(Mr. Leigh). They
ask with some trepidation, as though they expect him to behave in a
somewhat wild manner. I indicate that indeed he is the very essence of
a good Chairman. Despite his views, which when expressed in this
Chamber I regard as extreme in the extreme, he has chaired the
Committee with impartiality and fairness on all sides. Indeed, he has
defended the position of the Committee against assaults from outside.
For example, Nicholas Soames, the Member for Prince Charles, has on
several occasions berated him for allowing the
Committee&#151;</p><p><a name="0607196000050"><b><a name="0607196000139">Madam
Deputy Speaker (Sylvia Heal):</b> Order. I remind the hon.
Gentleman of the custom of the House of referring to other hon. Members
not by their names, but by the constituency that they
represent.</p><p><a name="0607196000051"><b><a name="0607196000140">Mr.
Davidson:</b> May I refer to the hon. Gentleman to whom I
referred earlier as representing a constituency somewhere in England? I
am afraid that I am not aware of his constituency. He gives the
impression of seeking to represent a particular individual who, I
understand, is not a voter. He regards any inquisition or discussion by
the Public Accounts Committee of the financial circumstances of that
individual as almost a personal affront. While I anticipate that the
Chairman might have some sympathy with that point of view, he has
nevertheless defended the Committee&#146;s right to conduct those
investigations over a long period, for which we are grateful. Given his
encouragement, we will continue to do so.</p><p><a name="0607196000052">That is a mark of the political
impartiality of the Committee, which has been and continues to be one
of our strengths. We meet as a group of partisan politicians in an
environment that is almost entirely removed from the cockpit of
partisan conflict. There are the occasional Whips&#146; narks from
one side or the other who wish to intrude in our debates in the manner
for which they have been wound up. However, the vast majority of
members of the Committee spot that right away, and more sensible voices
prevail.</p><p><a name="0607196000053"><b><a name="0607196000141">Madam

wide, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now address his remarks to
one of the numerous reports listed in it.</p><p><a name="0607196000054"><b><a name="0607196000142">Mr.

hours, but it certainly felt like it.
</p><p><a name="0607196000057"><b><a name="0607196000145">Madam

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 278</b><br>than four hours, although I did find myself losing the will to live
after two and a half.</p><p><a name="0607196000059">May I turn to the way in which
our debates are conducted? Ever the assiduous member of the Committee,
I think that I am the only one who has brought the complete box of
reports to the Chamber. Following the hon. Member for Tunbridge
Wells(Greg Clark), I am tempted to read the edited highlights
of my contributions to the Committee, but I shall refrain from doing
so.</p><p><a name="0607196000060">One of the values
of the Committee is the way in which we are, in many ways, about the
only genuine counterbalance to the permanent Government. Often, when
issues such as tax credits become the subject of partisan debate, there
is a knockabout involving a group of Government or Opposition Members
who feel obliged to defend what is being done, eventhough it
is indefensible. Only in a relatively impartial environment are we able
to have a genuine interrogation of what is being done in our name by
the civil service and bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="0607196000061">If people are not entirely
convinced that that happens in the United Kingdom, they should have a
look at the reports dealing with Northern Ireland, of which I have a
number here. They reveal the stultifying effects of permanent
government without serious parliamentary challenge. I think we would
all accept that, because of the unique circumstances in Northern
Ireland, we do not have the degree of scrutiny of the civil service and
bureaucracy that would be possible elsewhere.</p><p><a name="0607196000062">What has happened in Northern
Ireland is not that governance has been improved, but that governance
has been allowed to decay and decline. Despite the excellent efforts of
the Northern Ireland Audit Office, we see a quality of governance in
Northern Ireland that would not be acceptable if there were reasonable
scrutiny in any of the other three nations that make up the United
Kingdom. We have played a particularly valuable role in that regard. I
hope that that the standards that we have tried to introduce in
Northern Ireland will be maintained by the Assembly once it is
re-established.</p><p><a name="0607196000063">I want
to say something about the relationship between the Committee and the
National Audit Office. Undoubtedly, many National Audit Office staff
members are cleverer than all the members of the Committee put
together, although there are occasions when I wish that they did not
draw that to our attention so forcefully. Our role is distinct from
theirs, and we must recognise that our action in championing their
access, standards and criteria is valuable. We need not be experts in
every subject that they investigate; in many instances, it is
sufficient for us to put our weight behind their
efforts.</p><p><a name="0607196000064">If I have a
criticism of the National Audit Office, it is one that I have voiced
repeatedly when it has produced reports. I do not think that it pays
enough attention to the social class impact of Government policies.
Itdoes not carry out a &#147;social class health
check&#148; of policies and their implementation. I am continually
disappointed by the way in which it allows many Departments not to make
any assessment of the different impacts that their policies have on
people of different social classes, and the lack of take-up among 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 279</b><br>those with lower incomes and the like. I feel that we should try to
incorporate
that.</p><p><a name="0607196000065"><b><a name="0607196000147">Helen
Goodman:</b> Was my hon. Friend particularly reminded of that
recently when we took evidence from the Duke of Westminster, who had
broken through every barrier to become the first major-general in the
Territorial Army since
1945?</p><p><a name="0607196000066"><b><a name="0607196000148">Mr.
Davidson:</b> That is a useful point. It proves that we are an
open society. Any old jerk can become the first major-general in the
Territorial Army. To be fair to him, he did very much resent any
suggestion that he had got there other than on merit. The subtext was
that any member of the aristocracy could have become one of the
Territorial Army&#146;s high heid
yins.</p><p><a name="0607196000067">It was
interesting that when I asked whether any proles or plebs had reached
such a level in the TA, not only was I told that the TA did not keep
the figures; the witnesses resented the suggestion that anything of
that sort should be monitored. I think the National Audit Office often
overlooks the unconscious assumption that we live in an open society,
and that there are no barriers. If I have the Chairman&#146;s
support, I want to continue to be able to impress such points on the
NAO, and to raise them in Committee reports. I think it is up to us, as
well as pursuing questions of value for money, to try to ensure that
those citizens who are in the least fortunate positions in our society
have just as much access to the resources provided by taxation as the
Duke of Westminster.</p><p><a name="0607196000068">I
particularly want to make another point. I have brought my box of
reports along with me, but colleagues will be pleased to hear that I am
not going to read out the highlights of speeches. Rather, I want to
demonstrate the scale of work that we undertake. I wonder whether the
time has come for us to consider splitting the Committee in some way in
order to allow Members to specialise rather more. It is impossible for
us all to make meaningful contributions based on personal experience on
every matter that comesbefore us.</p><p><a name="0607196000069">We all want to discuss issues
with the witnesses in front of us, but in my experience, some of the
most constructive and positive contributions to questioning have come
from those who can cast some light based on their personal experience,
their constituency activities, or some expertise that they have gained
elsewhere. It is not possible to have that degree of specialisation
across the whole range of governmental activities. If we were to split
the Committee to allow a degree of specialisation, it would reduce the
burden on individual Members. None of us could adequately prepare for
every Committee that goes on every week. We have to pick and choose, so
some are missed out. We might be able to make better contributions if
we were to revise our methods of operation.</p><p><a name="0607196000070">Finally, Madam
Deputy Speaker&#151;you will be aware that when an MP says
&#147;finally&#148;, it usually means that he or she is only about
40 per cent. of the way through, but wants to give the audience some
hope; on this occasion, however, I mean finally&#151;I view serving
on the Public Accounts Committee as one of the most constructive roles
that an MP can have. I am in the fortunate of 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 280</b><br>position of having spent almost all my time in the PAC under a
Conservative Chairman. I say that because it means that Conservative
Members are in opposition and we are in government, which has been a
pleasure and long may it continue. I look forward to serving,
hopefully, under several other Conservatives. I am conscious that each
member of a Select Committee can serve for only eight years. When one
of my colleagues said that change might come in 12.5 years, I thought
that it was going to be much longer than that before the Conservatives
get into power. I look forward further to serving on the Committee and
hope that, under the inspired chairmanship of the hon. Member for
Gainsborough&#151;or perhapsthe hon. Member for Tunbridge
Wells (Greg Clark) or the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) in
due course&#151;we will continue to hold the Government to account,
as we have up to now.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0607196000123">11.7
pm</h5><p><a name="0607196000071"><b><a name="0607196000149">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con):</b> The hon. Member
for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) is always a tough act to follow.
In winding up what has been a very interesting debate this evening, I
would like to pay tribute to the work done by the Public Accounts
Committee and its Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough
(Mr. Leigh). I would also like to congratulate and thank Sir John Bourn
and his staff at the NAO on the vital work that they
do.</p><p><a name="0607196000072">The PAC and the
National Audit Office carry out vital work in safeguarding
taxpayers&#146; money and rooting out inefficiency, incompetence and
waste in the administration of government and the public services.
Their work has been, as we have heard this evening, wide ranging and
uncompromising over recent months. In his wide-ranging speech, my hon.
Friend the Member for Gainsborough covered the Committee&#146;s work,
going back as far as 1690. He covered military readiness, consular
services, adult literacy&#151;and I was particularly pleased that he
highlighted the Committee&#146;s important work on cancer
treatment.</p><p><a name="0607196000073">On cancer,
we have an example of both good and bad news. The PAC took note of the
work of the cancer networks and improvements in cancer care, but it
also felt that better co-ordination between those networks and the
primary care trusts that actually spend the money was desirable. It
signalled that simpler, clearer and more easily accessible guidance on
how to detect the early-stage symptoms of cancer could do much to help
remedy the deeply worrying disparities between cancer outcomes in
affluent and more deprived communities. I have no doubt that the
Government will act on that wise advice of the PAC.</p><p><a name="0607196000074">The hon. Members for Portsmouth,
North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) and for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) both
focused on the Committee&#146;s excellent report on value for money
in the public services and on enhancing better project management. They
also mentioned the vital importance of pilot projects and of ensuring
that lessons learned in one Department can be spread across other
Departments as well. They both looked at tackling complexity,
especially in the benefits system, and acknowledged the challenge of
the difficult tasks of simplification and of reconciling and balancing
the needs of flexibility and simplification.</p><p><a name="0607196000075">My hon. Friend the Member for
South Norfolk(Mr. Bacon) expressed grave concern that the Home

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 281</b><br>Office&#146;s accounts were published with a complete disclaimer by
the Comptroller and Auditor General. In effect, they were presented to
Parliament unaudited, which is unprecedented for a major spending
Department. My hon. Friend also outlined ways to prevent the NHS
Connecting for Health scheme from turning into the sort of IT disaster
that the PAC has all too often encountered. My hon. Friend the Member
for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) again had some good news and some bad
news. He praised the impact of the PAC&#146;s report on the Office of
Fair Trading and noted the constructive response to the PAC&#146;s
criticisms and the increase in activity that they triggered, but
he&#151;like the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome(Mr. Heath) and others&#151;expressed concern about the
crisis in the tax credits system. He noted the Committee&#146;s
hard-hitting report on that subject, which was also mentioned by the
hon. Member for Tooting (Mr.
Khan).</p><p><a name="0607196000076">As the Chief
Secretary acknowledged in the debate on 7 June, there is now a
consensus across the House in support of the principle of tax credits,
but the PAC&#146;s April report is just one of a succession setting
outthe continuing and severe difficulties in their
administration. It highlighted the fact that HMRC overpaid &#163;2.2
billion in tax credits to 1.9 million families in 2003-04, much of it
due to the design of the scheme, which bases provisional awards on
income and circumstances from the previous year. The House has of
course heard countless examples of the hardship overpayment causes to
millions of families landed with bills for repayment that they find it
hard to meet. The latest figures show that of the 6 million families
who receive tax credits, around 2 million were overpaid and 1 million
underpaid, meaning that nearly half the payments in the system were
incorrect.</p><p><a name="0607196000077">The
Committee noted that by March 2005, HMRC had set aside some &#163;1
billion to cover debts that it was not confident that it could recover.
And the loss to the taxpayer does not end there. Increasing the level
of income disregarded for the purposes of calculating the final award
has a significant cost. It has the same effect as formally writing off
overpayments that cannot be recovered. The increase in the disregard is
a key part of the package in the pre-Budget report designed to tackle
problems in the tax credits systems, but&#151;as my hon. Friend the
Member for Tunbridge Wells said&#151;when officials were challenged
by the PAC about the cost of that change, they were unable to provide a
figure. Paul Gray of HMRC indicated that such a figure could be
supplied, but, regrettably, none has yet been disclosed to the
Committee or the
House.</p><p><a name="0607196000078">The report
revealed the continuing and grave problems with the tax credit computer
system which was responsible for at least &#163;184 million in
overpayments in 2003-04 and 2004-05. Amazingly, of the &#163;71.25
million of compensation that the Government agreed with EDS, which
supplied the defective computer systems, some &#163;26.5 million
depended on EDS winning further work from the Government. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) put it, in his
characteristically forthright way:</p><a name="0607196000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the company which ministers
believe is guilty of messing up the tax credit computer system will pay
full compensation only if it is given a chance to mess up another
government computer system.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 282</b><br><p><a name="0607196000079">The Committee concluded that HMRC
did not have reliable or up-to-date information on levels of claimant
error and fraud in tax credits, and that was seriously impairing its
management of the scheme and its ability to safeguard taxpayers&#146;
money. As we have heard, an organised assault on the tax credits
website led to its closure in December 2004. We also know that at least
&#163;1.2 billion was lost to fraud and error in 2003-04, and
possibly a great deal more. Again, the Treasury faces the acute
embarrassment that the Comptroller and Auditor General has qualified
his opinion of the Inland Revenue&#146;s trust statement because of
fraud and error in the tax credit
system.</p><p><a name="0607196000080">The significant
sums lost to the Exchequer as a result of tax credit overpayments need
to be viewed alongside the PAC&#146;s reports on &#163;3 billion
lost in benefit fraud and error and nearly &#163;13 billion lost in
fuel duty and VAT fraud, the latter now so large as to undermine the
accuracy of Britain&#146;s trade
figures.</p><p><a name="0607196000081">A continuing
challenge for the Public Accounts Committee is to ensure that the
public sector acts in a commercially hard-headed manner when
negotiating to buy goods and services from the private sector. That is
one of the key factors highlighted in the Committee&#146;s report on
&#147;Achieving value for money in the delivery of public
services&#148;, about which we have heard much this evening. Too
often, the Committee has seen examples of where there is a manifest
failure to achieve a good deal for the taxpayer.</p><p><a name="0607196000082">For example, two years after the
new Norfolk and Norwich university hospital opened, Octagon, the
private finance initiative company that built it, refinanced the
transaction, trebling the rate of return that it had predicted for its
investors, from 19 per cent. to a staggering 60 per cent. The hospital
trust received only 29 per cent. of the refinancing gains, despite
taking on new risks and increasing the duration of the contract.
Octagon kept &#163;82 million. The Committee concluded that that
refinancing produced, in its
words,</p><a name="0607196000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a balance of risks
and rewards between the public and private sectors that, even for an
early PFI deal, is unacceptable.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000083">The gross imbalance resulted from a
failure to include a clause in the original contract to allow the
benefits of refinancing to be shared between the public and private
sectors. The Committee condemned that failing and noted that such
clauses are now expected to be included in PFI contracts. The Committee
famously described the deal as
the</p><a name="0607196000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the unacceptable face
of capitalism&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000084">but the
report highlights failings in government aswell. That is a
bipartisan point, because the start ofthe negotiations took
place under a Conservative Government, although the negotiations were
concluded under Labour.</p><p><a name="0607196000085">The evidence given to the
Committee indicates that the Treasury and the Department of Health
actively discouraged the trust from seeking a better deal. George
Monbiot put the point with devastating clarity in <i> The
Guardian</i>:</p><a name="0607196000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
deal...was an Easter Egg hunt. In order to persuade the corporations to
participate, the government left an extra &#163;95m in the contract
for them to find. This money represents the difference between the
financial risk the government said they would carry and the far smaller
risk...to which they were actually
exposed.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 283</b><br><p><a name="0607196000086"><b><a name="0607196000150">Mr.

continues:</p><a name="0607196000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If
the department believes that letting private companies walk off with
&#163;95m of free money represents good value, it's not surprising
the NHS is in
crisis.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000089">The PAC
is, of course, presented year in year out with examples of projects
that go over budget and out of control. For example, the Diana,
Princess of Wales memorial fountain had to be closed for major
alterations three weeks after it opened owing to design flaws which
caused repeated accidents and flooding. The cost rose from &#163;3
million to &#163;5.2 million as a result of what the Committee
described as &#147;basic project management failures&#148;. It
wisely advocated that lessons be learned in planning the memorial for
the Queen Mother and suggested that water-based features were probably
best avoided.</p><p><a name="0607196000090">Another
project that caught the Committee&#146;s attention was the
BBC&#146;s White City 2 development. The BBC made 300 variations to
the contract and had to pay an extra &#163;60.9 million above the
price originally authorised by its governors. However, as we have
heard, perhaps the key point to take away from that report is that it
forms part of a voluntary agreement with the BBC governors to allow the
NAO to undertake certain limited studies of BBC activity. The voluntary
agreement ends in 2006 and the BBC wishes to retain the final say over
what subjects the NAO can and cannot investigate in relation to the
BBC&#146;s activities. The BBC spends very significant sums of
taxpayers&#146; money. In the coming years, as we have heard from my
hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells, we will face many difficult
decisions on matters such as the interrelationship of the BBC&#146;s
commercial and public sector activities, its role in new digital
services and its internet presence, not to mention its significant taxi
and hospitality bills. As the Chairman of the Committee said in his
appeal, surely it is now time for the BBC to receive the same scrutiny
as Departments that are also entrusted with taxpayers&#146; money. I
urge the Government to give the Comptroller and Auditor General full
access and scrutiny powers over the
BBC.</p><p><a name="0607196000091">As the time gets
ever later, I turn lastly to the PAC&#146;s damning report on the
deportation of failed asylum applicants, to which several hon. Members
referred. In its report of March this year, the PAC concluded that the
UK&#146;s asylum policy had been undermined by the inability of the
immigration and nationality directorate to deal promptly with asylum
applicants whose request to stay in the UK had failed. The IND admitted
that it did not know how many failed asylum applicants remained in the
UK. The Committee concluded that it would take a staggering 10 to 18
years to clear the ever-increasing backlog of removals. The IND also
admitted that more than 400 foreign criminals had 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 284</b><br>been released from prison into the community. We now know, of course,
that the numbers released were actually considerably higher and that
many of those people had committed serious
crimes.</p>

<p><a name="0607196000092">In its
understated way, the PAC dealt a devastating blow by
concluding:</p><a name="0607196000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is
difficult to conclude that the taxpayer is obtaining value for money in
the efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate&#146;s
operations.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0607196000093">Its report
set in train a series of events that led to the admission by successive
Home Secretaries that their Department was
&#147;dysfunctional&#148; and &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;,
and to the sacking of one of the most senior members of the Cabinet.
That is a classic example of the hugely important work performed by the
Committee.</p><p><a name="0607196000094">I commend
the pivotal role that the Committee played in revealing the true extent
of the crisis in the Home Office. I also commend the vital work that it
does to safeguard taxpayers&#146; money and protect and cement our
democracy. I commend its reports to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071915000118">11.21
pm</h5><p><a name="06071915000008"><b><a name="06071915000125">The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> It is a
privilege to respond to the debate, and to the Chairman of the Public
Accounts Committee and his colleagues. We have had a good and
wide-ranging debate, which was led in an exemplary way by the hon.
Member for Gainsborough(Mr. Leigh), who chairs the Committee.
I was interested by the research that he had clearly done on the
institution of the Public Accounts Committee. He traces the Committee
back to the 17th century, which means that the Committee is not of a
dissimilar ageto the post of Financial Secretary to the
Treasury,which I am privileged to occupy at present. The hon.
Gentleman said that the characteristic of the Committee and its work
was rightly objectivity over partisanship. Our debate has been
conducted in such a
tone.</p><p><a name="06071915000009">Although this
might not be obvious to some, the Government share many common aims
with the Public Accounts Committee. They also appreciate the way in
which the Committee helps them to deliver better value for money in
public services, even if the Committee quite rightly makes the process
rather uncomfortable at times for those
involved.</p><p><a name="06071915000010">I pay
tribute to the work of the Committee and the Chairman of the Committee.
The work load of the Committee is such that it meets twice a week and
addresses a different issue each time. Anyone whohas served on
a Select Committee knows that that represents a formidable undertaking,
and the Committee members carry out their work with great diligence and
assiduousness.</p><p><a name="06071915000011">I also
formally recognise and pay tribute to the work of the Comptroller and
Auditor General and the National Audit Office. They play an important
role in supporting the work of the Public Accounts Committee, which,
crucially for us all, is the principal way in which Parliament holds
the Executive to account. The Committee is Parliament&#146;s leading
voice in the cross-examination of the Executive.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 285</b><br><p><a name="06071915000012">In that respect, I am pleased to
report the progress that has been made on the Company Law Reform Bill
since we last debated the PAC in January. Subject to the approval of
the House, the new legislation should enable the Comptroller and
Auditor General to audit companies in central Government, hopefully
from April next year. That will be a significant further step towards
implementing the recommendations of Lord Sharman&#146;s report,
&#147;Holding to Account&#148;. One mark of the Treasury&#146;s
respect for the NAO is the fact that my hon. Friend the Economic
Secretary recently decided to ask it to conduct an independent review
of the Financial Services Authority. That underlines the value that the
Treasury places on the work of the NAO and especially the special
commissions that it undertakes for us and other parts of the
Government.</p><p><a name="06071915000013"><b><a name="06071915000126">Mr.
Bacon:</b> I was pleased to hear the Economic
Secretary&#146;s announcement that the Government had invited the NAO
to look at the FSA, as that is a welcome development. However, on the
subject of wider scrutiny, the PAC went to the United States, where the
Government Accountability Office can follow the public dollar to state
level. Indeed, we visited the GAO regional branch in Boston. Yesterday,
I met the Auditor General for Wales, together with his staff in
Cardiff, who can follow the public pound from the highest to the lowest
level, which suggests that our arrangements, particularly for block
grants via the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to local government,
leave a great deal to be desired. Obviously, the Audit Commission has
separate responsibilities, but there is a case for increasing the
NAO&#146;s capacity to dig deeper should it wish to do
so.</p><p><a name="06071915000014"><b><a name="06071915000127">John
Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman has been a PAC member long
enough to know that the NAO&#146;s capacity is essentially a matter
for the House rather than the Treasury. However, there may well be a
case for following the pound through, as he put it. I shall come on to
the scrutiny of public spending, on which a number of hon. Members
commented, but it is important to make a clearer link between
budgeting, accounting and reporting in the
House.</p><p><a name="06071915000015">First, however,
may I respond to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for
Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)? Like the hon. Member for South
Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), she mentioned the PAC&#146;s Washington visit,
which clearly had a significant impact on the Committee. In discussing
the Committee&#146;s 36th report, she rightly said that the
simplification unit and other programmes that had been put in place
were a direct result of the PAC inquiry and report. That underlines the
point made by the Chairman that 94 per cent. of the Committee&#146;s
recommendations have been accepted by Government. The hon. Member for
South Norfolk dwelt at length on NHS information systems and
development. The subject was not a formal part of our debate, as
theMr. Speaker reminded him, but I am sure that the PAC will
return to it again and again. I am sure, too, that we will have a
chance to debate it properly.</p><p><a name="06071915000016">Like the hon. Member for
Gainsborough, the hon. Member for South Norfolk spoke strongly about
the problem with the Home Office accounts. The Treasury shares those
serious concerns. To put it bluntly, the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 286</b><br>Home Office failed to achieve the professional standards expected of
it&#151;the introduction of new accounting software is a routine
challenge that Departments should be able to meet. With the support and
active involvement of the NAO and the Treasury, the Home Office is
working to remedy those shortcomings and to deal with weaknesses under
the guidance of its audit committee and accounting officer, who are
striving to do as thorough a job as possible, given the limited quality
of the available data and the position at the beginning of the year. As
for wider financial skills across Government, more than 70 per cent. of
Departments, including the Home Office, now have professionally
qualified finance directors. A further improvement is evident in their
capacity to lay their resource accounts before Parliament before the
recess. Some 86 per cent. of departmental accounts are expected to be
laid before the summer recess, compared with 51 per cent. last
year.</p><p><a name="06071915000017">My hon. Friend
the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) spoke about the 17th
report of the Committee&#151;an extremely important report that draws
on the experience of the Public Accounts Committee over recent years
and which, like my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, draws on good
examples as well as bad in public service and project delivery. She
cited the benefit modernisation programme, where order books were
replaced by 2.5 million direct payments into bank accounts on time and
on budget. My hon. Friend might have cited some of the other subjects
that have been covered by PAC hearings of a similar nature&#151;for
example, NHS emergency care. Thirty-nine out of40 of those
using accident and emergency departments are now seen within four
hours, even though since 1997 the numbers attending A and E are up by
39 per cent.</p><p><a name="06071915000018">As the
hon. Member for Gainsborough reminded us, the importance of public
services is ultimately in the impact that they have on users. The PAC
held a hearing on cancer mortality and confirmed that between 1996 and
2003 that is down 14 per cent. for those over 75. In relation to the
Treasury&#146;s more direct responsibilities, the online filing of
self-assessment returns in 2006 meant that nearly 2 million taxpayers
filed online. The system coped with enormous peak demands&#151;more
than 150 returns a minute at one point&#151;a very significant and
successful implementation of a major
programme.</p><p><a name="06071915000019">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland also spoke about the importance
of efficiency and the interim report on the comprehensive spending
review that my hon. Friend the Chief Secretary published last week.
Although it was published only last week, my hon. Friend the Member for
Bishop Auckland has obviously taken a preliminary look at some of the
ways that we can deliver savings of at least 2.5 per cent. a year in
the CSR 2007 period. I know that my hon. Friend the Chief Secretary is
working with the Public Accounts Committee to try and establish ways in
which the Committee can be as closely involved as possible in the
efficiency programme, so that members of the Committee can be confident
that they understand the efficiency gains being made without
encouraging Departments to concentrate on getting good public reports,
rather than achieving the efficiencies
required.</p><p><a name="06071915000020">The hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr. Heath) stressed that the
PAC&#146;s reports and its 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 287</b><br>work are not all about bad practice, and that they contain some examples
of excellent practice, as he put it. He is not a member of the
Committee. I think he is the only Member contributing tonight who is
not a member of the Public Accounts Committee, apart from the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), who speaks from the
Conservative Front Bench. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
demonstrated the breadth of his interests by dealing with concerns in
the Home Office, the Environment Agency, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs, and even his Somerset villages, which are, rather
surprisingly, well served by the Environment Agency Wales for flood
protection
measures.</p><p><a name="06071915000021">My hon.
Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) picked an interesting report
as the focus of his speech&#151;the 22nd report, which looked at
maintaining and improving Britain&#146;s railway stations. That
inquiry by the PAC highlighted the poor state of many stations,
particularly in respect of access for disabled people and security. In
responding to the report, the Government made it clear that Network
Rail is fully funded to maintain the fabric of its stations, and train
operators should have priced station upkeep into their bids.</p><p><a name="06071915000022">My hon. Friend&#146;s remarks
demonstrated how the National Audit Office can shine a forensic light
on an overlooked part of public service and public spending and study
that. The PAC can then hold its inquiryand report. It is part
of building up parliamentary and public pressure to bring about reform,
change and improvement. I pay tribute to the way my hon. Friend is
clearly following up the PAC&#146;s work on the subject and will not
let the issue
go.</p><a name="06071915000101"><p><b><a name="06071915000128">Mr.
Bacon:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary, who is
being very generous. With reference to the contribution of the hon.
Member for Tooting(Mr. Khan), I had a chance to go to the
Table Office and look at early-day motion 911, which I commend to all
hon. Members. I have just signed it.</p><p><a name="06071915000023"><b><a name="06071915000129">John
Healey:</b> I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman is
continuing the bipartisan tradition ofthe PAC.</p><p><a name="06071915000024">When my hon. Friend the Member
for Tooting dealt with the 37th report, he gave the other side of the
tax credit story to the one given by the hon. Members for Somerton and
Frome, for Chipping Barnet and for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark). My
hon. Friend was right to say that end-of-year adjustments are
inevitable in a system that is designed to be flexible in responding to
the changing circumstances of families. The policy and operational
changes that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has announced
are designed to ease some of the problems inherent in that
approach.</p><p><a name="06071915000025">The hon.
Member for Tunbridge Wells discussed tax credits, the report on the
Office of Fair Trading and audit access to the BBC, as did the hon.
Member for Chipping Barnet. NAO access to the BBC was considered as
part of the charter review. Current arrangements involve the
BBC&#146;s audit committee holding discussions with the Comptroller
and Auditor General, with the aim of framing a programme of reviews
that the NAO can carry out. That is an 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 288</b><br>important step forward. I should point out that the BBC is not part of
government&#151;an important principle and fact to
remember&#151;and that it is not, as the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet argued, directly comparable with a Government Department. The
importance of its independence is part of the reason why the current
arrangements are the right next step to be
taken.</p><p><a name="06071915000026"><b><a name="06071915000130">Greg
Clark:</b> In that case, how does the Financial Secretary
account for the fact that the NAO hasaccess to the World
Service, to which questions of independence apply in just the same
way?</p><p><a name="06071915000027"><b><a name="06071915000131">John
Healey:</b> As an independent corporation, the BBC is
determining&#151;now in close in consultation, and then with the NAO
carrying out much of this audit work&#151;the appropriate audit
programme for its activities. That seems to me the right way to
proceed.</p><p><a name="06071915000028">My hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) brought an
element of entertainment, as well as enlightenment, late on in our
proceedings, but he also brought to bear his long experience on the
Committee and made two particularly serious points. First, he pointed
out that the PAC is perhaps the one body that can be consistently and
forensically critical of the Executive&#146;s operation without being
partisan. It is therefore not only fulfilling a very special role in
the scrutiny of government in England and Wales; it is clearly playing
an important part during the period of the Northern Ireland
Assembly&#146;s suspension.</p><p><a name="06071915000029">My hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, South-West also argued, importantly, for the assessment of
social class being a more regular feature of the way that the NAO
studies the pattern of provision of, and the impact of, public
services. He is right to stress that, because it is an important
element in securing the equity in public service delivery that the hon.
Member for Gainsborough identified as one of his six key ingredients in
the report published
today.</p><p><a name="06071915000030">Although there
have been no specific PAC hearings this year on the private finance
initiative, the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet talked about the
Norfolk and Norwich PFI hospital. I remind her that that PFI project
opened early and on budget; the problems that the NAO and the PAC
examined were to do with the refinancing of that deal. Lessons have
therefore subsequently been learned, and all refinancing gains from
September 2002 are now shared 50:50 between the public and private
sectors. The Treasury has set up a task force to assist with
refinancing deals in the public sector, as they become a more relevant
feature of the conduct of PFI contracts.</p><p><a name="06071915000031">In the short time left, I want
to touch on three points that the hon. Member for Gainsborough
stressed: the comprehensive spending review, this House&#146;s
scrutiny of public expenditure, and the report that his Committee
published this morning. The CSR 2007 provides us with an opportunity
for a fundamental review of the balance and pattern of public
expenditure. We will take account of what investments and reforms have
been delivered to date. We will identify what more needs to be done to
meet the challenges and the opportunities that are ahead in the next
decade and beyond.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 289</b><br><p><a name="06071915000032">The interim report that was
published by the Treasury last Thursday is an important part of that
process. However, in all the assessments that we make as part of the
comprehensive review process we will use the lessons that can be
learned from the work of the PAC. The seriousness and the rigour with
which we are determined to approach the comprehensive spending review
is demonstrated by the early settlements that were made and announced
in the Budget, where for the Department for Work and Pensions, the
Cabinet Office, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the
Treasury the expenditure limits will fall by 5 per cent. a year in cash
terms over the CSR period. The reason for doing this is that it will
release almost &#163;2 billion that we can redeploy to our priorities
and to front-line
services.</p><p><a name="06071915000033">I move on to
the parliamentary scrutiny of expenditure while I am on the theme of
departmental expenditure. I am interested to note that this month the
PAC is inviting the Chairman of the Liaison Committee to encourage the
departmental Select Committees to devote more time to the scrutiny of
expenditure plans. That is an important role for the PAC. The rights
and privileges of the elected Houseof Commons to scrutinise
public expenditure are a fundamental part of our democracy and an
essential part of our parliamentary system. I welcome, therefore, the
PAC&#146;s paper, which was published earlier this month. I welcome
also the report that was published recently by the Hansard Society
called &#147;The Fiscal Maze&#148;. It, too, looks at the challenge
of how Parliament can scrutinise more effectively the expenditure of
the Executive. It is clear from the arguments set out in the Hansard
Society&#146;s report&#151;it is also the view of the
PAC&#151;that we need to introduce a more systematic and challenging
parliamentary scrutiny of spending plans. I believe that we need to be
able to link more directly the process and scrutiny of estimates,
budgets and accounts. In large part, that is a challenge for
Parliament. However, the Treasury stands ready to work with Parliament
on establishing workable arrangements for improving parliamentary
scrutiny of planned
spending.</p><p><a name="06071915000034">Today, there
was published the 63rd report this Session of the PAC, which I welcome.
It builds on the 17th report, which was the major focus of our
debatein January. It provides a good framework that
Departments and public bodies could use when designing and delivering
high quality public services. The 10 steps that it sets out to achieve
successful and high quality services probably provide a sound basis for
the development of better public services. The six key ingredients that
the hon. Member for Gainsborough identified and stressed are also a
useful perspective. I am confident that the Government will be able to
respond positively to the report within a couple of
months.</p><p><a name="06071915000035">The PAC, with
the National Audit Office, bring an intense inquiry and analysis to the
shortcomings of Government. I am reminded of the words of Edward
Phelps, who in the 19th century was the Second Comptroller of the US
Treasury. I am prompted to say by the comments of several Members in
the debate that it is the examples of good as well as of bad that need
to be considered. If we concentrate on the bad, there are risks. Edward
Phelps
said:</p><a name="06071915000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The man
who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 290</b><br><p><a name="06071915000036">The most important thing to do when things
go wrong is to learn from the event. Undoubtedly, the work of the PAC
helps us to do just that. As Cicero said,</p><a name="06071915000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any man may make a
mistake but none but a fool will continue in
it.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071915000119">I commend the work
of the PAC. I commend the63 reports produced by the PAC this
Session. The Committee carries out important work on behalf of the
House and also on behalf of the taxpayer and public service
users.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071915000120">11.44
pm</h5><p><a name="06071915000037"><b><a name="06071915000132">Mr.
Leigh: </b>With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall
briefly sum up and, in particular, thank the Financial Secretary, who
has just given a model summing up for a debate. He made an effort to go
through every speech and ended with an important point about increasing
financial scrutiny by the House of the whole budget process. When I
started this process, I think that there was some scepticism about
whether other Select Committees would be sufficiently interested in
these issues, because in recent years they have tended to concentrate
on policy. Following what the Financial Secretary said today, we have
had an extremely important pointer now that the Treasury in a sense is
giving a green light to the process upon which the Liaison Committee is
embarking. Our meeting in October or November will be very important. I
am particularly grateful for what the Financial Secretary
said.</p><p><a name="06071915000038">I apologise for
the fact that I cannot at this late hour indulge in Ciceronian poetry
and prose&#151;I wish that I could. All I can do is briefly thank
those hon. Members who have taken part. However, I should say to the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that he made an
important point. We are talking about the scrutiny of &#163;500
billion-worth of expenditure. The main part of parliamentary scrutiny
lies in this Committee, and it is unfortunate that this debate has lost
some of its zest in recent years and is dominated only by members of
the Committee. I wish that we could find some way of getting other hon.
Members to take more of an interest in these debates, but I say to the
business managers that we will certainly not do that if we are still
debating these issues at a quarter to midnight. We must pursue this,
and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he
said.</p><p><a name="06071915000039">The hon. Member
for Tooting (Mr. Khan) made a fundamental point, and the Financial
Secretary made this point too, when he said that this is the one
Committee that can be a critical friend of Government without being
partisan. We take enormous care to try to ensure that our reports are
balanced, that we encourage risk taking&#151;the Financial Secretary
quoted Edward Phelps on risk taking&#151;and enormous care is taken
with the press releases. The trouble is that whether it is the
&#147;Today&#148; programme or newspapers, they are not generally
interested in good news. I apologise for that, but as politicians we
recognise that that is the nature of our business, so we try to be a
critical friend.</p><p><a name="06071915000040">I
thank also the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry);
my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), who reminded

Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> We have been
told that the two main drivers for the proposed reorganisation of
police forces were the inability of smaller forces to deal with, first,
terrorism and secondly, organised crime, but I venture to suggest that
neither argument is sustainable.</p><p><a name="06071915000056">I base my view on the fact that
there are several avenues of good co-operation between Welsh forces and
those over the border in West Mercia, Avon and Somerset, West Midlands,
Cheshire and so on. We have been told that the size of those forces
means that they cannot deal with the worst organised crime. I pray in
aid the recent operation between South Wales police, Gwent police and
the Avon and Somerset constabulary, which netted some of the most
dangerous criminals in the UK, who were hell bent on bringing crack
cocaine into south Wales, having already flooded the market in the
Bristol area. They were heavily armed and very dangerous people. In
large part, they are behind bars, which is directly because of the
excellent understanding between the Avon and Somerset constabulary,
Gwent police and South Wales police.</p><p><a name="06071915000057">We are meant to rely on the Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary report, &#147;Closing
the gap&#148;. Many people have criticised that report, and I shall
quote its author, Denis
O&#146;Connor:</p><a name="06071915000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Being
bigger is not enough to guarantee strong protective services. The
environment (situation) also matters. For example, the presence of
cities, ports or events (ie. repeated exposure to risks and challenges)
also enhance the repertoire of protective services that forces offer
the public. Able leadership can also be influential in allowing smaller
forces to punch above their weight on these
issues.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071915000058">He goes
on,</p><a name="06071915000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are outliers:
some smaller forces were almost as successful as the majority of larger
forces, whilst two relatively larger forces...received
surprisingly low
scores&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071915000059">In
December 2005, Anthony Lawrance, professorof statistics at the
university of Warwick, was commissioned by West Mercia police authority
to scrutinise the report. He said that the HMIC report bases its
amalgamation recommendation on the crucial statistical finding that in
level 2 crime policing, bigger equals better. He questions the
reliability of the scoring method used for each force, the statistical
soundness of the claimed connection between size and effectiveness, and
HMIC&#146;s misleading presentation of its data. He goes on to say
that the conclusions are not sound and that the graphs were not
properly drawn and were hardly representative of anything. He says that
one graph was uninformative and
meaningless&#151;</p><a name="06071915000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an
almost perfect example of how not to present a graph&#151;no scales
on either axis, no data plotted to justify the lines drawn. It is
almost impossible to obtain any critical understanding from
it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071915000060">That is a pretty
damning critique of the
report.</p><p><a name="06071915000061">I pay tribute
to the Minister, who is new in the job and comes to this with an open
mind, which is to the good. There is excellent day-to-day co-operation
between the south Wales forces and over the border. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 294</b><br>Dyfed Powys and West Mercia liaise frequently. From my experience of
dealing with legal matters, I have seen daily liaison between the North
Wales police, Cheshire and
Merseyside.</p><p><a name="06071915000062"><b><a name="06071915000137">Mark
Tami (Alyn and Deeside) (Lab):</b> I, too, have major concerns
about an all-Wales force. Equally, however, does the hon. Gentleman
accept that we should not lose sight of the fact that there must be
considerable savings to be made? Four separate forces means four
separate IT systems, four separate personnel systems and so on. That is
surely madness, and a lot of the money saved could be returned to
front-line
services.</p><p><a name="06071915000063"><b><a name="06071915000138">Mr.
Llwyd:</b> That is probably right, but the figures that we
have received from the Home Office suggest start-up costs of anything
between &#163;35 million and&#163;50 million, and given
the deficits projected, for example, by North Wales police it would
take a devil of a long time to recover any
savings.</p><p><a name="06071915000064">There is
concern about the way in which the consultation was rushed through.
That is not this Minister&#146;s responsibility, and I do not allege
that it is. Many of the crucial questions, including those of
financing, have never been properly answered. There may now be a
partial reprieve, perhaps because of the Cleveland case in the High
Court or because the Minister has taken stock of the situation. I am
sure that he recognises that there are substantial debates to be had on
this subject.</p><p><a name="06071915000065">Only a
few months ago, HMIC gave all four Welsh forces a glowing report. They
have improved in many ways, and they were good previously. During the
past 15 years, Dyfed Powys and North Wales in particular have
consistently been in the upper quartile for semi-rural forces in
England and Wales.</p><p><a name="06071915000066">North Wales police has
undertaken a consultation and received 90 letters from community
councils in north Wales. They made different points but all were
against any forced amalgamation. There has been an overwhelming
response in the North Wales police area and in every other
area&#151;Gwent, South Wales and Dyfed Powys. I venture to suggest
that those are important submissions that need to be taken on board.
</p><p><a name="06071915000067">Earlier this month, a
submission was made by the clerk to the North Wales police authority.
One of the points that he made was that the travelling distance between
Holyhead and Cardiff is slightly longer than that between central
London and Preston. That gives some idea of the likely problems that
might occur. He also refers to the council tax equalisation problem and
the likely capping criterion of 5 per cent., which would undoubtedly
result in a black hole. He refers to future funding, the annual deficit
of &#163;29.9 million rising to just over &#163;50 million in 2012
and the funding formula. The other week, an amendment was passed in
another place that made agreement a precondition of amalgamation and
provided that it should not be forced through.</p><p><a name="06071915000068">I am sure that the Minister
will deal with some of those points when he responds. However, I do not
believe that any rigorous analysis has been carried out, especially of
financing, which must be a crucial factor in policing nowadays. When
senior police officers, police authorities and many people who know
about 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 295</b><br>policing in Wales speak with one voice, it is time to listen. I am sure
that the Minister will take that on board.</p><p><a name="06071915000069">I hope that the dialogue that
takes place in the coming months will not be one-sided&#151;I
appreciate that that may be a misnomer. However, there is genuine
concern that there should be proper dialogue about the matter. Nigel
Thomas, the treasurer of NorthWales police, has referred to
the recurring deficit of&#163;51 million. I understand that
the Home Office had earmarked &#163;120 million towards the merger
plans, but that leaves a shortfall of hundreds of millions of pounds in
creating the regime that the Home Office tried to impose. The North
Wales share would goa long way towards achieving the necessary
improvements in protective
services.</p><p><a name="06071915000070">Everybody
realises that policing changes as time passes because crime changes.
Crime is becoming far more difficult to detect, criminals are becoming
more adept at IT and so on. That is beyond argument. However, the
arguments for an all-Wales police force have not been persuasive from
the
beginning.</p><p><a name="06071915000071"><b><a name="06071915000139">Hywel
Williams (Caernarfon) (PC):</b> Is it not strange that the
motivation for reorganisation that the Government present is to do with
operational matters&#151;a response perhaps to triple murders in
Holyhead or terrorist outrages&#151;but that the arguments of the
hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) were essentially
financial? They have some force, but they are not the arguments that
the Government
present.</p><p><a name="06071915000072"><b><a name="06071915000140">Mr.
Llwyd:</b> Yes. The other disappointing point is that the
National Assembly for Wales was not brought into the debate, although
it contributes &#163;144 million per annum to the Welsh policing
budget.</p><p><a name="06071915000073">Last week, on
the day that the Minister announced the Government&#146;s latest
position in Millbank tower, I raised a point of order to suggest that
it might be better to make that statement in the House. That is the
reason for the debate. The Home Secretary responded by saying that
there was no policy change but that police authorities would no longer
be forced to merge. If only two of the 41 current police authorities
have volunteered to amalgamate, how is it possible to proceed with
wholesale amalgamation in the face of such relentless opposition? The
announcement amounts to a policy
change.</p><p><a name="06071915000074">I ask the
Minister to tackle one or two points in his response. Doubtless he will
confirm whether forced amalgamations have been ditched. If the planned
mergers have not been shelved, where are we on the
&#147;destination&#148; to which the Home Secretary refers so
often? We deserve to know.</p><p><a name="06071915000075">A huge amount of time, energy
and cost has been expended in Wales on trying to make sense of the
merger. It was made far more expensive by the fact that all the
authorities remained largely in the dark about cost, council tax
precepts, set-up costs, revenue and continuing costs. Those fundamental
matters had to be guessed. That is no way to run a modern police
force.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 296</b><br><p><a name="06071915000076">I welcome the statement that
there will be no forced mergers, if indeed that was the purport of the
statement. Forced mergers could end up being the worst possible
option&#151;a shotgun marriage, to use an old and rather outmoded
term. If the Minister cannot confirm that forced mergers are a dead
duck, can he confirm that the Home Office will have a completely open
mind on the issues of federation? I would not like this matter to arise
again in 12 months&#146; time. The four authorities are working hard
to produce a plan for federation, and it must not be dismissed out of
hand.</p><p><a name="06071915000077">Will the
Minister deal with those points in his response? First, can he confirm
that forced amalgamations are no longer the destination referred to by
the Home Secretary? Secondly, if there is to be further change on a
voluntary basis, will the Home Office keep an open mind on the question
of plans for federation? Those are the points that I wanted to raise
this evening, and I am sure that the Minister will deal with
them.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071915000124">12.5
am</h5><p><a name="06071915000078"><b><a name="06071915000141">The
Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Meirionnydd
Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) on securing this debate. I shall deal with each
of the points that he has raised in his usual eloquent fashion, but I
have to tell him that he is a bit behind the times, given the journey
that we have travelled over the past couple of weeks. I shall return to
that point later.</p><p><a name="06071915000079">When my private office received
the joyous news last Thursday that the hon. Gentleman had secured this
debate, I was not in Westminster. I was in Cardiff, meeting the chairs
of the four Welsh police authorities, members of the Social Justice and
Regeneration Committee of the Welsh Assembly and members of the Welsh
Local Government Association, precisely to talk about the future of
policing in Wales, given that restructuring was not on the agenda.
Sadly, following on from those meetings, the only matter of substance
that Plaid Cymru could come up with involved a member of its committee
suggesting that there had been chaos because the meeting with the
committee had been on, then off, then on, then off again. That member
made a rather petty and petulant point that was neither here nor there
in relation to the serious issue of policing in Wales.</p><p><a name="06071915000080">Before that, I had met the
chief constables of the four Welsh police forces and the Minister for
Social Justice and Regeneration in the Welsh Assembly to talk about
these matters. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that a debate on this
matter was initiated recentlyby the hon. Member for Preseli
Pembrokeshire(Mr. Crabb). I also gave oral evidence on this
matter for the best part of an hour to the Welsh Affairs Committee. I
have also liaised closely with the Secretary of State for Wales and the
Under-Secretary of State for Wales on the issue. Welsh interests have
therefore been uppermost in my mind in recent weeks. I have also met
the Welsh group of Labour MPs and had a range of
meetings&#151;individual and otherwise&#151;with Labour MPs from
north Wales. I have been in my present post only for six weeks, but I
have not had any requests for a meeting with members of Plaid
Cymru.</p><p><a name="06071915000081"><b><a name="06071915000142">Mr.
Llwyd:</b> The Minister seems to be finding opportunities to
make political points, despite the fact 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 297</b><br>that I went out of my way to say that the way in which he was dealing
with this matter was not unreasonable. I am just asking for clarity. I
spoke earlier to right hon. and hon. Members of his own party, who,
like me, are in the dark as to what is going on. I am simply asking for
clarification.</p><p><a name="06071915000082"><b><a name="06071915000143">Mr.
McNulty:</b> That is what I am seeking to give the House, but
it was important for me to put the context on record. I had very
fruitful meetings with each of those bodies last week, and I shall tell
the House precisely what I said to them in a moment.</p><p><a name="06071915000083">I cannot agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s opening statement&#151;in which he prayed in aid a
statistician&#151;that the essence of &#147;Closing the Gap&#148;
in regard to the difficulties that we face, principally outside London
throughout England and Wales, in terms of level 2 services,
counter-terrorism provision and serious and organised crime, is somehow
traduced by a statistician trying to demolish the substance of
O&#146;Connor&#146;s report. Almost to a man and a woman, those
with whom I have engaged on this matter, regardless of their position
on mergers, accept as the starting premise that there are serious gaps
at level 2, in counter-terrorism provision, which must be
filled.</p><p><a name="06071915000084">I turn briefly
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about my speech to the Local
Government Association at Millbank. It was not a change in policy. It
could not have been a change in policy given that some two weeks
beforehand my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary had made it very
clear to the House that we were not going to lay the orders for
enforced mergers as outlined in the timetable, which, as the hon.
Gentleman will know, had Wales in the first tier. My right hon. Friend
said on 19
June:</p><a name="06071915000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have
already made it plain that there is no need for anyone to panic over
time, because I will not lay orders on enforced
change.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 19 June 2006; Vol. 447,
c. 1059.]</p></ul><p><a name="06071915000085">That was our position
then, and it remains so. Enforced mergers are not on the cards, and we
will not, as my right hon. Friend indicated, be laying those orders.
Indeed, as a natural consequence of that announcement during Home
Office questions, the notices of intention to lay orders to merge that
were issued to the four Welsh police authorities and forces on 3 March
were withdrawn on 13 July. That is a legal technicality, but those
orders, on that timetable, are no longer on the agenda.</p><p><a name="06071915000086">That has nothing to do with
Cleveland and nothing to do with any amendment passed in the House of
Lords. It is simply a sign of a reflective, listening Government who
have taken into account objections. Any number of forces, in England as
well as in Wales, have said, &#147;Yes, we agree with the starting
premise on level 2 protective services, but we think that there are
other ways to achieve those ends.&#148; In response, we have afforded
police authorities and forces the time to establish whether they can
achieve those ends.</p><p><a name="06071915000087">I
accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point&#151;I said this in
Cardiff&#151;that apart from level 2 protective services, this is not
about there being anything wrong in substance with any of the four
Welsh forces. As he said, they have made huge advances over the last 10
or 15 years. None the less, a gap remains. We were trying to seek, in
the Police and Justice Bill, any number of accommodations for the
peculiarities of the Welsh situation&#151;that is now 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 298</b><br>history, albeit recent&#151;not least because of pressure from my
Welsh colleagues. We tried to reflect concerns of geography by having
an additional deputy chief constable in Wales should the merger
proceed. We tried to reflect geographic disparity by providing scope
for area committees.</p><p><a name="06071915000088">I
want to make two points about our starting premise now. First, for the
sake of absolute clarity and accuracy about statute, forced mergers
remain on the books. I will be urging the House, in October or
November, to overturn the Lords amendment to which the hon. Gentleman
referred which effectively says there will be no enforced mergers by
the Home Secretary and that mergers must now start from an agreed
position.</p><p><a name="06071915000089">The
situation is not terribly confusing, I hope. On19 June, the
Home Secretary said that we would withdraw enforced mergers, and we
subsequently took the orders off the table. We are not proceeding with
that timetable. For the foreseeable future there will be no enforced
mergers. What I cannot do, which is why I shall be asking the House to
resist the Lords amendment, is say that in all circumstances, in all
our subsequent open discussions, to which I shall try to return if I
have the time, every single force in the country will give me and the
Home Secretary a 100 per cent. guarantee that they can fill the gaps in
protective services and counter-terrorism by every other route except
merger. There may be some forces that still have to merge. They may not
choose to do so, but it may still be overwhelmingly in the interest of
public safety that they merge. A year or 18 months or so down the line,
if we come to that conclusion for any two, three or four forces, the
Home Secretary will need to have the route of enforced mergers open to
him. That is still on the books, and we will not accept the notion, as
I hope that the House will agree, that there can no longer be enforced
mergers by the Home Secretary.</p><p><a name="06071915000090">In the current context, as I
said clearly in Cardiff last week and have said previously, the
starting premise must be that police forces and authorities in Wales
are the very people who understand the challenges of policing in Wales
and are best placed to set out how we can best improve protective
services. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there has been
significant co-operation between the four forces. That is not a moot or
tangential point. My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark
Tami) had a point in suggesting that there is scope for the four forces
to share services, including many of the back-room ones. Members of the
Welsh Affairs Committee made many points in that regard. I want to
engage with colleagues in Wales as openly as possible to explore all
those options.</p><p><a name="06071915000091">In the
first instance, it must be right that, having listened to the
dissenting voices and those who did not want to merge voluntarily, we
sit down and work out how to take this proposal forward, recognising
the gaps. I promise to come to the discussion with the open mind that
the hon. Gentleman suggests, but I would still prefer an all-Wales
solution. I do not resile from the suggestion in the O&#146;Connor
report that a merged force is possibly the best option. Plenty of other
people, however, have far more experience and expertise than me in
police matters in Wales, and we are giving them the time and scope to
present their case.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 299</b><br><p><a name="06071915000092">To be momentarily
pedantic&#151;I am not usually pedantic&#151;the hon. Gentleman is
entirely wrong to suggest that only two forces sought to merge
voluntarily. Only two forces sought to merge with each other
voluntarily, but invariably, in every other region, at least two out of
three or three out of four forces wanted to merge voluntarily, but a
third or fourth force did not. In the north-east, for instance,
Cleveland sought not to do so, but Durham and Northumbria were
perfectly happy to merge. It is a pedantic point, but I felt that I
should make it none the less.</p><p><a name="06071915000093">I also want to get to the stage
in discussions with Welsh colleagues where we can restore&#151;I
think that that is the right word&#151;the issue about filling the
gap at level 2, counter-terrorism and serious organised crime, in
relation to our overall collective vision for policing in Wales and
everywhere else. We got slightly lost in an overtly structural debate
on process that was devoid of discussion of how filling the gap at
level 2 relates to all the points about area committees, governance,
finance and council tax equalisation that the hon. Gentleman mentioned,
as well as to the relationship betweenthe region, areas, basic
command units and neighbourhood policing.</p><p><a name="06071915000094">In considering strategic forces
in great detail and the preferred solution of mergers, part of the
thrust was precisely to protect neighbourhood policing teams from
abstraction every time that there was a serious event, incident or
investigation. I still think that that is a model that works. I said to
colleagues in Cardifflast week, and I say to the hon.
Gentleman, that no element of the discussions with the four forces
about shared services, collaboration, federation, back-office
rationalisation or merger should preclude thefruitful
cross-border co-operation with Cheshire and Merseyside, West Mercia and
Avon and Somerset, which can be built on.</p><p><a name="06071915000095">If we are considering lead
force models, with one of the four forces leading on terrorism, one on
seriousand organised crime and so on&#151;a sort of evolving

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 300</b><br>Association of Chief Police Officers model for everything short of
merger&#151;even that is better discussed in the context of an
all-Wales solution. That does not preclude cross-border co-operation at
all. With regard to the events mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, I
congratulate forces such as Dyfed Powys and others on their
co-operation. However, much can still be done, short of merger, with
regard to the four forces.</p><p><a name="06071915000096">As the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
colleagues may have told him, a tortuous analogy was going round in my
head when I was down in Cardiff. In the morning, I got off at Newport
and looked at some neighbourhood policing there. I thought
&#147;Imagine a train journey from London. Everyone has told me that
I need not go to Cardiff to enjoy all the richness of Wales: I can get
off at Newport.&#148; If Newport represents what we have been
discussing&#151;co-operation, collaboration and all those other
models&#151;all the gaps in level 2 policing are filled in the way
that I require. I am quite happy not to stay on the train to Cardiff,
which, in my tortuous analogy, represents the full merger
model.</p><p><a name="06071915000097">That did not
work terribly well during my meetings either, so I stopped eventually,
but I think the hon. Gentleman gets the
point.</p><p><a name="06071915000098">I now want,
across all parties and agencies&#151;including the Welsh Assembly
Government, of course, but this remains a non-devolved
matter&#151;serious, fruitful, productive discussion on the way
forward for policing in Wales. I believe that last Thursday started
that process. I am more than happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and his
colleagues, as I have already met Labour colleagues and others. I think
there can be a way forward. I await with interest the plans and
solutions suggested&#151;everything short of merger&#151;to deal
with these important issues over the coming months, and I hope that we
end up at Newport rather than
Cardiff.</p><p><a name="06071915000099"><i> Question
