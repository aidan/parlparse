I cannot guarantee that every voluntary organisation will continue to be funded. What we can seek to do is change the culture in Government so that there is greater stability in funding.</p>

Friend will know of the massive investment in our museums and galleries that has led to millions of new visitors. In the light of that, will he comment on the decision by the London borough of Wandsworth, only nine months after council elections at which it remained silent on the subject, to close the very popular Wandsworth museum and threaten Battersea arts centre with closure? Is that not an example of a Tory council choosing cuts over cultural heritage?</p>

Friend has said by pointing out that we have substantially increased the grant to local government. There is absolutely no cause for the closure of museums and arts centres that perform such a good local role. And of course it is this Government, as a result of our policy of free entry to museums, who have enabled literally millions more visitors, including children, to go to museums. My hon. Friend has given a telling example of the difference between the values of a Labour Government and those of a Tory Government.</p>

Is it not time for a wholesale review of the law to ensure that we provide proper protection for women&#151;and men&#151;who are subjected to this traumatic and violent assault?</p>

For those reasons, it will obviously always be more difficult to secure a conviction. As the most recent report says, however, the way in which the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are working to help victims of rape has improved the position significantly over the past few years.</p>

Victims are treated with far greater care and far greater attention to their trauma than was the case a decade or a couple of decades ago. I want to point out a detail that it is important to recognise. Although the number of convictions has gone up, not down, it is true that the proportion of claims that result in conviction has gone down&#151;but it is only fair to point out that as a large proportion of cases involve people who either are in or have been in a relationship with the alleged assailant or are known to them, it is inevitable that it will be more difficult to secure a conviction. I entirely agree that it is important that we continue to see what more we can do to make sure that this horrendous crime is treated properly.</p>

What hope or support can the Prime Minister offer to those 420 skilled workers, given that unemployment is now at its highest since 1997, inflation is at its highest since 1992, and interest rates are going up as the Chancellor&#146;s policies fail?</p>

I can assure him that the local Jobcentre Plus and the Government will do everything that we can, as we have done in other situations, to put a support mechanism in place to ensure that they get alternative employment. I have to say, however, that Chesterfield&#146;s economy, like that of the rest of the country, is infinitely stronger than it was in 1997: employment is up and unemployment is down. Yes, it is true that there have been a quarter of a per cent. rises in interest rates recently, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents will remember when interest rates were10 per cent. for four years, and 15 per cent. for months at a time.

Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the ombudsman&#146;s report on that collusion dealt only with part of Belfast city and one unit of the loyalist paramilitary organisation, and that much, much more was happening throughout Northern Ireland?

to emphasise&#151;as I think the report itself did&#151;that this concerns a minority of people, who obviously should not have been engaged in the activities that they were engaged in. But that should not take away from most of the work that officers did, in both the police and the Security Service, which was of enormous benefit to the local community.

The hon. Gentleman says that 3,000 new offences have been introduced, but they have one thing in common: his party has voted against them all, even the most serious and violent ones. We know that Liberal Democrat prison policy would mean that no one would go to prison, because there would be no tough laws to make sure that they did. I can tell the hon.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07013188000163">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) who presented a similar Bill and, indeed, inspired the one that I present today. I thank the Association of British Counties, a society dedicated to promoting awareness of the 86 historic counties of Great Britain, which has campaigned tirelessly for their recognition through proper signage denoting historic county boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000164">My Bill extends the principle of giving visible recognition to historic counties by including towns and villages, whose identity is so often lost when a district, borough or county council ignores the correct name of actual places and instead chooses to impose the name of the administrative authority, causing confusion and removing the sense of local identity that is so important to communities up and down our land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000165">Restoring identity to counties, towns and villages, along with pride and local patriotism in an historical context, is immensely important. I believe that we must stop the erosion of true local identities and restore the pride that people naturally feel in belonging to a county, town or village that in so many cases has already been lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07013188000166">My town of Romford is probably one of the best examples. As an historic Essex market town, there are indications of our historical links with Essex all over Romford&#151;together with the constituencies of Hornchurch and Upminster, which today form the administrative authority of the London borough of Havering. That is a typical construct of the local government reforms of the 1960s. As I travel back after a busy week at Westminster to my home town of Romford, which lies within my home county of Essex, I enter the boundaries of Essex and Romford, but nowhere do I see a road sign welcoming me to either place. They have been written off the map by a dreadful local government culture that seems to recognise only the often made-up and artificial names of administrative boroughs or districts. That cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000167">I was born in a place called Rush Green, a community within Romford but divided by a nonsensical local government boundary that splits one side of the area from the other, leaving half of it in Havering and the other in Barking and Dagenham. Only recently new signs were erected to welcome people to the area. You have guessed it, Mr. Speaker, down came the signs that indicated that one was entering Rush Green. They were replaced by signs saying, &#147;Welcome to Havering&#148;. I am aware that hon. Members have many such examples of the traditional boundaries of their counties, towns and villages being ignored by blinkered town hall bureaucrats who seem interested in promoting only the name of their administrative authority, even if it is a totally artificial name with no historic meaning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07013188000168">To see an Essex sign, which should correctly be placed at the River Lea near Stratford in east London, I have to travel many miles, through a host of traditional Essex towns and communities, until I reach the other side of motorway 25, where Essex county council has erected &#147;Essex&#148; signs as one enters Brentwood. I and many of my constituents, who are proud of our Essex heritage and roots, find that deeply offensive. County councils, London boroughs, elected mayors and transport authorities must never be allowed to strip people of their local identities. The law must be changed and that is what my Bill seeks to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000169">The importance of historic villages, towns and counties is much greater than just local government. They are sources of identity and objects of affection for many people and I sincerely hope that this significant part of our British identity can be secured for future generations. However, to achieve that, we must mandate local authorities to install signage indicating actual counties, towns and villages and giving their names precedence over the name ofthe administrative council itself. We must divorce administrative, regional, electoral and ward boundaries from true places that have existed for hundreds of years. I have even seen one local council&#151;a Labour one&#151;erecting a sign that indicates the made-up name of an electoral ward, rather than the actual name of the community, which has existed for centuries. How damaging to our identity such actions can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70131-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000170">I have lived all my life in the community of Marshalls Park, which is where I went to school. That lies within the town of Romford, situated in the county of Essex, which forms part of a country called England. My home, until a future local government review takes place, may lie within the so-called Pettits ward of the London borough of Havering, in the region of Greater London, but those are names with no meaning, designed for administrative and electoral purposes only. We should never allow them to override or replace the true identities and place names of Britain&#146;s historic counties, towns and villages, but sadly that is what is happening.</p>

Before the announcement, many authorities questioned whether they could reach the 16,000 target by April even with an accelerated recruitment pattern, which is one reason why we looked at the issue.

I know that there are frustrations; there is some disquiet, and a debate is needed on the whole issue of police funding. The Lyons report will ensure that the subject is debated, at least in part. The frustrations to which I refer relate to the question of when we will receive that report, and I share those frustrations. If, outwith this debate on the settlement, we can have a mature, reflective and grown-up debate on where we should go with police funding, that would be welcome; we would then not need to talk about floors and ceilings.</p>

For example, a similar authority, West Mercia, should get &#163;4 million less than Derbyshire, but gets &#163;10 million more. When will progress be made on that general problem for Derbyshire? We have reasonable local government settlements, but overall the county is losing &#163;22 million because of the floors. Other authorities that have done much better than us over the years keep bleating about their settlements, while taking money away from us.</p>

We are talking about seeking to reduce the impact of changes in formula across the country. We want to consider the impact of the changes&#151;which are all in the right direction, by the way; all the changes in resources are upward. We want to equalise the impact across the country, as a prelude to ensuring a more level playing field in police finance, as the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire suggests. With the greatest respect to my hon. Friend, it is not enough for any Member to talk about &#147;bleating&#148;, or to give any other such description of counties that benefit&#151;at least for now&#151;from the ceiling, rather than otherwise.</p>

Does he accept that although Surrey has an excellent police force, our grant per head is only &#163;89, which I think is the lowest rate in the country? It is well below the average in the south-east. That is a very low grant for us, and we have had extra expenses in connection with the police merger talks, and as a result of hosting the EU Heads of State meeting. Surrey is under a great deal of pressure, and I hope that the Minister will sympathise and perhaps take that into account.</p>

On his specific point&#151;again, this goes back to the need for a general debate about finance&#151;history plays a strong role in the situation. I take his point about the figure being relatively low, on a per-head basis. However, in terms of precept, Surrey is at the other end of the scale. It has a significant precept, and is ranked higher than many of the 43 authorities in England and Wales, but it has a larger population among whom to spread it. In terms of actual resources, Surrey is not hard done by compared with other forces. It is not ill-served by either the formula or the precept increases. However, the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, in the sense that it cannot be right&#151;this is my point about the general police financing arrangement&#151;for the precept per head to range from &#163;88 to &#163;210. Alongside that, the precept contribution as a percentage of overall police resources varies. It is 18 to 20 per cent. for some forces, but for Surrey, among others, the figure is way up in the high 30s, if not 40-plus per cent.</p>

One of the flaws of the formula is that there is a lag between population growth and the rate at which grant rises. The per capita increases for the rapidly growing population in the east midlands, where the population growth rate is almost twice that of the rest of England, create problems as the years go by. The best example&#151;or worst, depending on one&#146;s point of view&#151;is Lincolnshire, which is growing at a rate of 10 per cent. over 10 years. The population growth rate for England as a whole is less than 2.5 per cent. Will the lags in the system be addressed, so that the formula is more effective in the five east midlands forces, including Leicestershire?</p>

The routine is that when exceptional events take place, whether they be the international events that took place in Surrey, or the murder inquiries in Suffolk before Christmas, constabularies apply to the Department for a special grant, outside of the settlement that we are talking about today.

HMIC recommends to me that it is more than appropriate that the authority itself should cover about &#163;1 million of the &#163;9 million. These are examples, because the issues involved go far above and beyond those that we need to address, but at least some of the cost can be taken on board by the Suffolk police authority.

Elements nightclub has 3,000 visitors, compared with the Holyhead pub in Moordown, which has 30.

If they are not reflected sufficiently in the formula, then let us have a wider debate about police finance. These dimensions are increasingly reflected in the wider local government formula. Many of the comments that hon. Members are making about policing go to wider public service issues that are not specifically the domain of the police authority. We could have a significant debate, I hope on a non-partisan basis, about what we want from our police, what the resource base should be, what the mix between local and national contributions should be, what are&#151;not only for London but elsewhere&#151;discernibly national or regional issues that should be dealt with at that level rather than through local policing, and what the relationship should be between local neighbourhood policing, response policing and some of the wider strategic county-wide or region-wide issues, which is something that every force struggles with constantly.</p>

As regards the Minister&#146;s comments about winners and losers under the floors and ceilings system, it is extraordinary that the losers should have to just bite their lips and get on with it. The Government introduced a new formula in 2006-07 precisely to address the fact that counties such as Derbyshire were historically underfunded over a long period. Under that new formula, the Government have said that Derbyshire should get another &#163;5.7 million a year or so more, but with the next breath they are saying that we cannot have it. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. Derbyshire is currently funding the gap out of the reserves, but it cannot do that for much longer without having to slash policing in the county.</p>

Talking about slashing this and slashing that is not helpful, nor is it true. Neither Derbyshire nor anywhere else will be slashing its way back to pre-1997 levels, and the hon. Gentleman should be careful about what he says. I give him the same exhortation that I gave to the hon. Member for Shipley&#151;he needs to go and talk to his hon. Friend over in Cumbria, who benefits significantly from this. We are not saying, &#147;We&#146;ve got a new formula and we&#146;re putting floors and ceilings in, so if you lose from it, go hang.&#148; We are saying that we need, in all equity, to get to a stage where we can fully implement the new formula, but not in one hit; otherwise, this would be a substantially different debate. Funnily enough, there are few Liberals down in Devon and Cornwall, which also benefits significantly from the floors and ceilings aspect of the formula. I think that there is also the odd one&#151;I mean numerically rather than in terms of the individual&#151;in Norfolk, a very odd one in Sussex, and one in West Mercia too.</p>

Having looked, lived and breathed the figures for so long, I say in all sincerity that there is a need for a substantive debate on where we are going with the local element of police finance and the huge disparity between authorities. I do not say that in any way to cast doubt on how we have got to where we have. As I said to some hon. Members, history is largely responsible for it, but it cannot be right to have such a huge spread between the level of the precept and how much it contributes to the overall budget in what should be, taking account of variations in local circumstances, a national service delivered regionally and locally through constabularies. There will be issues around that.</p>

I think I mean that in the context of the outliers on both ends of the scale. It is even more complex in the sense that those with lower precepts are not necessarily those that have the lower contributions from a local level to overall police budget. It is not as simplistic and linear as that. When I talk about collectively having a look at the finance base and the local contribution, I do not necessarily mean that everyone should gather up to the Surrey level in terms of a contribution, although I know the precept is high. Nor do I mean that everyone should be down at the Durham and Northumbria ends, where we are talking literally of &#163;88 for a precept in one case and just more than &#163;100 and some contributions of 18 and20 per cent. in others.</p>

policing issues&#151;above and beyond things like counter-terrorism, which should be funded from the centre&#151;need to be balanced by an argument about what the local contribution should be. I understand the point. It is specific at that end&#151;in part, the Met, though it has a large population base, and Surrey and Sussex and one or two others&#151;and at the other end historically are some other parts of the Met and some of the northern authorities.</p>

They are the original level of the settlement, capping and council tax policy, continued use of a funding floor, police grant for the next three years&#151;in terms of the comprehensive spending review for 2008-09 to 2010-11&#151;capital provision for restructuring, neighbourhood policing, funding flexibilities, police efficiency and specific grants.

restrain the police authorities by flatlining them. He has made it clear that one of the main concerns of police authorities is that, over the remainder of the comprehensive spending review, it looks as though there will be flatlining.

One of the advantages of two-year&#151;and, hopefully, eventually three-year&#151;settlements is that they can begin to be planned for. I do not accept the notion, which belies experience as well, that throughout those eight or10 years of sustained and relatively high growth, all that police constabularies have done is put the money in their pocket and just carry on as they normally do. There have already been enormous efficiency gains across police authorities. Significant examination of how police authorities and constabularies do what they do has also taken place. To be fair, the picture today,10 years on from 1997, of what they do and how they do it is enormously different. That must continue because things are ever changing.</p>

There is now a genuine multi-agency approach, to use the lingo. The balance and mix throughout the country of police officers, police staff, other specialists and analysts is rightly different from the position 10 years ago. That should continue.</p>

Gentleman is right to draw attention to the cut in the target for PCSOs. In Gloucestershire, that translates into 74 PCSOs that we were expecting and needed, but will not now get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07013188000276">An additional problem is that the one-off funding that is being provided in lieu of the permanent final tranche is heavily skewed towards London and the Metropolitan Police Authority. In Gloucestershire, that means only &#163;167,000 in one-off funding instead of the &#163;1 million in permanent funding that we expected. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o172"><a name="07013188000277"><a name="70131-0006.htm_spnew13"><a name="07013188001010"><b>Nick Herbert:</b> I agree. The Metropolitan Police Authority received the lion&#146;s share of the remaining funding, although the Government withdrew &#163;70 million. The Met received approximately two thirds of what remained, leaving the provincial forces even shorter of resources. That means that they cannot provide the promised number of PCSOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07013188000278">As ACPO&#146;s head of finance pointed out, the settlement is not all that it seems. A range of specific grants, for example, for forensics, supports the general grant. In most cases, they have been frozen. Consequently, as ACPO&#146;s head of finance, Dr. Tim Brain, who is also chief constable of Gloucestershire, said, the overall value of the general grant to forces and authorities has been substantially reduced. That will put further pressure on force budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07013188000279">In my force in Sussex, the special formula grants for rural policing, forensic testing, special priority payments and south-east allowances will remain unchanged and frozen at last year&#146;s levels. That amounts to a cut of2.8 per cent. in real terms and will cause the force and the authority problems.</p>

However, a significant part of police expenditure is on pay. The settlement this year was 3 per cent. and the formula was 3.6 per cent. How does he calculate 5 per cent. inflation for the total budget? I am interested in his reply.</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="07013188000281"><a name="70131-0006.htm_spnew15"><a name="07013188001012"><b>Nick Herbert:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right: more than 80 per cent. of a police force&#146;s budget is spent on pay. Pay increases generally outstrip the rate of inflation because the pay settlement is index linked. Other costs increase as the police&#146;s mission widens. Consequently, as the Minister pointed out, forces have to make efficiency savings year after year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07013188000282">The genuine question is not about this year, when forces are already beginning to face difficulties, but about future years under the comprehensive spending review. The Minister alluded to that, but we need to examine the matter. From next year, which is the first year of the comprehensive spending review settlement, the Home Office budget will be frozen in real terms, and the police have been told to expect an increase of no more than 2.7 per cent. It could be less than that. Consequently, police budgets from next year onwards will be frozen in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07013188000283">The Association of Police Authorities and ACPO estimate that, by 2010-11&#151;the third year of the proposed settlement&#151;the police could face a funding gap of as much as &#163;966 million. To put that in context, the police&#146;s annual national budget is &#163;10 billion, so we are considering a potential funding gap, as set out by the APA and ACPO, of 10 per cent. of the national policing budget. That will pose very serious challenges for the police. In a document called &#147;Sustainable Policing&#148;, the associations point out that the risk posed by under-resourcing is not that policing will suddenly collapse, but that with the contraction of capability the services provided to communities will erode, and particular functions will either be withdrawn entirely or unable to perform to acceptable levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70131-0006.htm_para20"><a name="07013188000284">Concerns are already being expressed up and down the country about the funding that police forces might have in future. The Police Federation has gone so far as to claim that 999 calls could take longer to answer, and that the number of fully trained officers will be reduced. I will refer to that in moment. The Hampshire force is already looking to make a 10 per cent. cut in services in the next financial year, according to the local police federation, and if there is no significant increase in funding, which there will not be, its police authority predicts that it will have to make a cut of20 per cent. the following year. Durham constabulary is axing 100 police officer jobs and in the next financial year plans cuts of &#163;3 million. Surrey has described its budget for the forthcoming year as insufficient. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) has said, Sussex is predicting a budget deficit of&#163;6 million and cutbacks. North Yorkshire police considers the situation sufficiently dire that the police authority predicts that even a 5 per cent. increase&#151;which it will not get&#151;would leave a &#163;3 million deficit next year. West Mercia predicts a &#163;1 million gap in funding, with further more acute financial concerns over the next three years.</p>

The chairman of the police authority finance committee has expressed concern about that. It is a pity that in an area where, for instance, the non-emergency 101 number was piloted and customer satisfaction has increased as a consequence, the other side of the equation is a reduction in the front-line policing promised by the Government, diminishing the service available to the public.</p>

That is why the police have expressed fear that although the indicated 2.7 per cent. annual increases would be at or around the level of inflation, they could be less than that. We should therefore question whether it was sensible for the Chancellor to take the Home Office out of the comprehensive spending review at such an early stage and to freeze its budget. That prompts questions about how seriously the Government are taking the security and policing challenges to which the Minister alluded. As my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor has made clear, there is a case for putting the Home Office back within the comprehensive spending review to allow a proper assessment of the challenges facing the country, rather than assessing the priorities of other Departments but making a presumption that the Home Office budget is frozen, which does not seem to make sense.</p>

In 2006-07, the latest year for which figures are available, the proportion is expected to fall to 60 per cent. The amount of police spending financed through council tax has therefore doubled in real terms between 2001 and 2006-07. Council tax now accounts for more than 21 per cent. of police force expenditure finance, compared with 12 per cent. in 2001-02.

One thing that the Government should do is take a careful look at the costs of their own administration, and the costs of the central direction that they have imposed on police authorities and the police force. I have been investigating something called the police and crime standards directorate. I do not know whether my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70131-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07013188000321">We know, however, that the Government have introduced a very important new form which has reduced the amount of time that police officers are able to spend policing our streets properly. That is the stop form, which takes eight minutes for each officer to complete. In fact, the trend has been not to cut the number of forms and the amount of bureaucracy, but to increase the volume of red tape under which the police are labouring.</p>

Since then those mergers have been abandoned, leaving police forces with a bill that has not been met in its entirety by the Home Office. That is another item of expenditure that police forces up and down the country are having to cover. As the chairman of the Sussex police authority has said:</p>
<a name="70131-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="07013188000760"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have been short-changed by the Government and now the council tax payers of Sussex are being asked to pay for the failure of an unwanted Government initiative. We warned them that an enforced merger would never work and - lo and behold - it didn&#146;t.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70131-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07013188000323">In this context, the Minister has said nothing, albeit I accept that he called for a debate on the future of policing. Perhaps there should have been a debate on how forces are to make arrangements in terms of closing the gap and strengthening their protective services. We will have to return to that issue, because despite the abandonment of mergers, police forces share services not only to reduce costs, but also to make sure that they are able to make significant investments and deal with cross-border crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70131-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07013188000324">I am surprised that the Minister said that forces were already using resources in, to borrow his words, an entirely efficient and productive way, because that is not the view of the Treasury, which published a document last October explaining that resources would be much tighter than in previous years and that there would have to be efficiencies of double the current level.

If we had been having a sensible debate, the Minister could have told us&#151;and police forces&#151;exactly how the Government expect such savings to be made over the next few years so that resources do not have to be cut at the front line. In the absence of the Government offering any explanation of why the figures are justified or how the savings will be achieved, it is inevitable that we pay attention to the fears of those running the forces&#151;the police chiefs and authorities&#151;that those savings will not be achievable, and that as a consequence there will be cuts.</p>

Police resources are tight and police stations have been closed, and a judgment must be made as to whether the savings that the Government  <br>

are now asking the police to make will impact on front-line policing. All Members support efficiencies being made and agree that it is right that any public service that has received a large increase in resources should deliver value for money to the taxpayer. Therefore, in respect of my own force in Sussex, when it proposes measures to save up to &#163;10 million a year by 2010 and some of those measures are a good way to save public money&#151;such as to share the &#163;500,000-a-year police helicopter with Kent and Surrey&#151;I hope that my hon. Friends will take them seriously and agree that they are good measures. However, we would react with concern if police forces were to talk about reducing the opening hours of smaller police stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70131-0007.htm_para24"><a name="07013188000328">The challenge over the next few years will be for forces to deliver savings in a way that improves the service that they give to the public and deals with waste, bureaucracy and inefficiency and does not cut front-line services. The Government have a serious part to play in addressing the bureaucracy that they themselves have created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70131-0007.htm_para25"><a name="07013188000329">The Centre for Crime and Justice Studies has pointed out that the UK now spends proportionately more money on law and order than any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, including the United States of America and major European Union members such as France, Germany and Spain. The largest proportion of that money&#151;almost two thirds&#151;is allocated to the police. That has led to an increase in police numbers. The key question will now be whether those numbers are sustainable and whether those officers will appear on the front line. What the public want to see is police officers out of their police stations and on the beats. They want to see the police being properly locally accountable. They want a criminal justice system that functions properly, and which is joined-up so that when the police make arrests and try to bring offenders to justice there is a court system and a prison system that backs them up. The public also want to see swift justice and firm justice, not soft justice as a consequence of cautions replacing convictions that should properlybe made in court, and not unenforced antisocial behaviour orders or uncollected fixed penalties. As a Member said, the public have paid their taxes and they are entitled to a return on the investment that they have made. Their tax bills have gone up, and their council tax bills have soared; they are entitled to proper levels of policing in return.</p>

Police numbers in Nottinghamshire are at record levels, and the police are backed by valuable police community support officers funded by the Government. The crime statistics came out last week: vehicle crime in Nottinghamshire has decreased by22 per cent. and overall crime has fallen by 4.6 per cent.&#151;the fifth consecutive fall.

reductions in serious crime in the city of Nottingham&#151;homicides and gun crime. Nottingham has an undeserved reputation in that respect in the press. Police and local authorities working together have made genuine improvements. Most importantly, Her Majesty&#146;s inspector of constabulary has been looking at the Nottinghamshire police over a long period, and it has concluded that it is effective and efficient and that it is an improving police force. However, we should be cautious: in relative terms, Nottinghamshire is still a weak performer. Although much has been achieved, there is still much more to be done, and there is no room for complacency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para0"><a name="07013188000332">Let me now turn to the bad news. All across north Nottinghamshire&#151;from Halam to Hucknall and from Rainworth to Ravenshead&#151;nobody believes the figures. The fear of crime continues to increase, and people complain about lack of police presence. There is a strong view abroad that the Nottinghamshire police are underfunded. That has not been helped by the strong campaign run in recent years by the Nottinghamshire police authority, which has involved the chief constable, arguing for &#147;more cops for Notts.&#148; The reality is that grant to Nottinghamshire police has increased significantly&#151;by &#163;36.4 million since 1997 to&#163;145.9 million in the current financial year, which is a 33 per cent. increase in cash terms and a 7.8 per cent. increase in real terms. The indications in respect of next year&#146;s settlement are that Nottinghamshire will receive an additional &#163;4.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000333">However, there are anomalies, and there is room for complaint. The average spending on police per head of population in England in 2005-06 was &#163;174. In the east midlands as a whole&#151;the five police authorities&#151;the figure was &#163;143, and in Nottinghamshire it was &#163;158, so in comparative terms per head of population the police in the east midlands and Nottinghamshire are being underfunded. It is interesting to note that the Nottinghamshire police authority has more crimes per officer than any other police force in the country, save one, and that the spending per offence in Nottinghamshire is the lowest in the country. Therefore, there are real concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000334">Faced with that financial situation, and with the view abroad that the funding formula is not fair to Nottinghamshire and the east midlands, there are real problems. There is a police authority meeting on21 February and difficult decisions will have to be made. It has already been announced that the innovative Drug Abuse Resistance Education programme&#151;known as DARE&#151;looks set to be cut. Adam Cable, who is aged 12 and lives in Hucknall, wrote to me as follows:</p>
<a name="70131-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07013188000762"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am...writing to say that I am terribly upset that Nottinghamshire Police Authority have decided to stop doing the DARE programme...Thanks to the DARE programme I am now more confident about speaking to others.&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000336">There is also speculation about the future of the mounted section. Police horses provide high-profile policing and reassurance to people in the community. The speculation is that in 2008, the mounted police will be cut, thereby saving &#163;200,000. That is an achievable saving, but in the long term the only way to balance the books, as has been acknowledged, is to look at manpower. The figures are fairly straightforward.  <br>

Nottinghamshire police face a budget shortfall of &#163;16.5 million, if nothing changes, by 2010-11. It would be sad if the record levels of police officers that have been achieved were to be reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07013188000337">So what is to be done? There has been much discussion in this debate about floors and ceilings. The floors in the east midlands work against the five police authoritiesto the tune of &#163;14.8 million, and, in the case of Nottinghamshire, the figure is &#163;5.1 million. We cannot change the system immediately&#151;it needs to be stable&#151;but this is an allegedly fair funding formula, and over time, the Minister must give some assurances about how it can be tapered and wound down. He said the following in a letter of 22 January to Nottinghamshire police:</p>
<a name="70131-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="07013188000764"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I recognise that those police authorities that have had their grant scaled back feel they are not getting their full share of the pot.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000338">I would like him to move away from recognition and into action, and to show good faith by reducing the ceilings and tapering the formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000339">Secondly, the Minister is well aware of the important work of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, which brings together the five police authorities and focuses on serious crime. It is jointly funded by the police authorities themselves and by the Government. The grant from the Home Office runs out on 31 March 2008. Ministers are aware of the significance of what has been achieved, and I invite the Minister to look closely at maintaining that grant in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000340">Thirdly and most particularly, the Minister and his officials must look at the work that the five east midlands police authorities are doing in response to Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary&#146;s report &#147;Closing the Gap&#148;. There is a real recognition that protective services in the east midlands are very weak. In fairness to the five authorities, they are trying hard to work together, and the progress that they have made probably puts them ahead of any other region in the country. Let me talk about some of the plans thatare going ahead. A small team of officers, backed by accountants KPMG, is looking at how regional collaboration could make money available for protective services. The police authorities are working up a scheme for a regional information technology network, not least to provide shared information to help tackle back-office costs and to help with business management systems. That costs money up front, but in the long term it could produce significant savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07013188000341">The police are also working hard to recover assets. There is &#163;10 million-worth of unclaimed assets in the east midlands, which does not have an asset recovery body. However, part of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit is trying to recover those assets. There is also a very strong case for setting up a confidential unit in the east midlands, so that material received covertly and secretly can be shared across the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07013188000342">The five east midlands authorities will shortly be setting up a joint sub-committee, involving all five police authorities. That is a sign of their intent. The Minister will soon be writing to police authorities asking them to make bids for collaborative projects in order to bridge the gap. I invite him and his officials to look very carefully at the work going on in the east midlands. What those authorities are trying to achieve is what he wants. Progress is being made. There is more to be done, but when the Minister issues the invitations  <br>

for bids, I hope that he will ask the officials, chief officers and representatives of the east midlands police authorities to meet him, so that their bid can meet the bidding criteria that he is about to set out.</p>

It also forecast that in 2008-09, that gap will reach &#163;582 million or &#163;656 million respectively. As the Association of Police Authorities argues, that gap</p>
<a name="70131-0008.htm_brev3"><a name="07013188000765"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;represents a significant proportion of the overall police budget and poses a very real risk to maintaining current services and capability&#148;.</p>

That is over and above the police authority precepts that residents are already paying.

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70131-0008.htm_para20"><a name="07013188000362">Lack of central funding and a capping of council tax leaves nowhere for police authorities to turn, and cuts are inevitable if the Government refuse to provide a realistic level of funding for local police authorities. Members of Parliament from all parties agree that we need more police out on the streets. A stronger police presence is essential if we are to be serious about fighting crime and resolving the issues of antisocial behaviour which blight the lives of too many of our constituents.</p>

The cuts are already taking place. The Home Office&#146;s announcement yesterday, admitting that police officer numbers nationally have fallen by 173 from the end of March last year to 141,873 at the end of September, comes as no surprise to those of us who have been involved with police funding issues in our constituencies.</p>

Police authorities cannot keep up police officer and CSO numbers if their funding is being cut. In Hampshire, which was mentioned earlier, budget cuts caused the number of CSOs to fall by approximately 40 per cent. The Government are putting the police authorities in a very difficult position. Plans that have been made based on higher levels of funding and high staffing numbers must be re-made, wasting precious time and resources.</p>

By closing so many police stations the Government are creating a situation in which a permanent and personal local police service is a thing of the past for all too many people.</p>

Such people may exist somewhere. The introduction of some flexibility into police funding is welcome, but it does not go far enough. The crime fighting fund and the neighbourhood policing fund have been criticised by the APA and ACPO for placing unnecessary restrictions on police authorities. Both require a particular mix of staff that may not be optimal for the individual local communities concerned. Only the police authorities can know what mix of officers and other staff is needed to provide the best level of local policing. Placing ring-fenced restrictions on funds can lead to distorted budgets and cause highly trained officers to be moved into administrative roles. That causes inefficiency and the poor use of resources.</p>

ring-fenced funding and allowing police authorities to make staffing decisions that are tailored to the needs of their areas. The APA has stated that, to meet its financial needs fully, the police service needs a funding increase of more than 5 per cent. annually just to stand still. Without significant moves in that direction, the accumulated impact of the deficit facing so many police authorities will worsen, police staff and officer numbers will continue to fall and the much needed police presence in our communities will be even less substantial than at present. That will allow levels of crime and antisocial behaviour to soar to completely unacceptable levels.</p>

They will have to make difficult decisions in the coming year about whether to cut services or seek a rise inthe council tax precept to an exceptionally high level. They should not have to make such a choice. The Government must support local policing and increase funding to a level that would allow police authorities to provide the sustainable and improved service that our local communities demand and deserve.</p>

It has dashed the expectations of many local communities. The stop-gap funding provided by the Government shows their inability to keep their promises, and reflects the political short-termism that permeates so much of their policy. Cutting police numbers while wasting money on big Government schemes such as ID cards shows a woeful lack of priorities and the extent to which the Government are out of touch with what the public want.</p>

Now, after a period when people complained that officers were seen only in the centre of Slough and not in their neighbourhoods, we are getting to the point that they complain that they do not see police officers in their roads. That is a reasonable point to have reached. We have got there thanks to the Government&#146;s investment in policing.

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07013188000405">The Minister is obviously a master of the funding formulae, but that does not mean that they are right&#151;only that he understands what they are at the moment. The problem for Surrey is that the formulae are not right. Our county borders on the Metropolitan police area, but we have major road conurbations and supplementary policing responsibilities at Heathrow and, at the other end of the county, extra responsibilities for Gatwick. There are terrorist implications and the police have to respond to that situation and maintain awareness. There are extra pressures when there are special events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07013188000406">In addition, we had the merger considerations with Sussex police. I advocated that the merger should be aborted very early on, but in fact it was aborted very late. The figures are rather interesting. I hope that the Minister will listen to this, because he gave me what Surrey police called an obfuscating answer in the recent oral questions session in the House. The total cost to Surrey of the aborted merger was about &#163;811,000. That included manpower costs; it is higher than the figure that the Minister will have, which is about &#163;560,000. The grant to Surrey police from the Government is about &#163;100,000. There is a shortfall. These things are cumulative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07013188000407">The Minister has already acknowledged to me that the police precept in the county council tax contribution in Surrey is just under 50 per cent. That will soon rise, but over the next three years the underfunding of Surrey police that is estimated by both the police and the police authority is about &#163;18.2 million. There are no ways in which further efficiency gains can be found. Surrey police have already found efficiency gains that exceed  <br>

the Government&#146;s target. The Government wanted a&#163;5 million efficiency gain; the police have achieved about &#163;8 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para26"><a name="07013188000408">The Minister has to understand that there are severe problems in Surrey that are not necessarily evident. It is inexplicable that Surrey does so badly in relation to the other shire counties. The per capita figure is about&#163;89 and the average is about &#163;107. I do not want him to come back to me with the fact that there are 14,000 more officers compared with 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para27"><a name="07013188000409">I am not saying that everything that the Government have done in relation to policing is bad. I am saying that we are dealing with some serious problems now. In my view, those problems derive from the fact that, given its geographical position, a county such as Surrey has stresses and strains that are not recognised by the formula. Surrey has problems in raising further money from local people to fund its police force, not least because council tax increases will be capped at 5 per cent. anyway, even if the people of Surrey wish, in a fit of generosity, to pay more council tax. There areissues in relation to the organisation of the police force, not least its proximity to the Met and that factthat policemen and women make a comparison with people who happen to work for the Met but live near them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70131-0009.htm_para28"><a name="07013188000410">All those things cumulatively can be thrown out of gear by big problems that might emerge, such as the EU heads meeting at Sandown Park, which happens to be in my constituency. We also get big criminal trials. In one case, there is not a trial but a continuing inquiry into the tragic murder of Milly Dowler several years ago. The culprit is yet to be found. There is also the evident problem that a lot of the crime&#151;particularly the more violent crime&#151;in Surrey is carried out by criminals who come across the boundary from London and then go back again. I ask the Minister please to think of Surrey sympathetically and to be constructive in his responses.</p>

Clearly, we would like more. I am sure that every hon. Member wants more for their area. However, the &#163;76.3 million in general grant that North Wales police will receive will be an increase of some 3.6 per cent. or &#163;2.6 million over the previous year. I stress that that is an increase. It is not a cut, a reduction or a decrease. It is not less, but more. The inflation-plus increase this year builds on the extra investment of previous years&#151;investment that has resulted in a dramatic increase in policing and in support staff. At the start of the financial year in 1997, there were a total of 1,367 police officers in North Wales police. By 2006, their numbers were about 1,600. That is an increase of about 18 per cent.&#151;a higher increase than that experienced in many other parts of England and Wales. There has been an even greater increase of nearly 100 per cent. in support staff. Numbers are up from 533 in 1996 to 997 in October 2006, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) pointed out. There are now 58 community support officers. That will rise to more than 240.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07013188000412">Those extra resources have certainly produced results. There has been a fall in crime and, importantly, a greater police presence on the street, which I am sure that hon. Members would agree is what they want and certainly what the general public want. Clearly, we still have a long way to go before we have a police presence on every corner&#151;not that we ever did&#151;but we are making good progress in the right direction. The introduction of community beat managers has been a major success in putting police where they should be: at the heart of local communities. I can certainly testify, as my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) has also said, that the number of people coming to see me to complain about a lack of police presence has gone down compared with when I entered the House, although we have a long way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000413">The investment must be sustainable and long-term. Budgets need to be planned accordingly. That is key. Finance is gathered not only from central Government, but from the council tax payer. The council tax payer has certainly made a sizeable contribution. In 1996, the police precept on a band D house was &#163;46.21 in north Wales. That has now risen to &#163;166.89. The increasein the police share of council tax has been in excess of 273 per cent. The response from the chief constable of North Wales to this year&#146;s increase&#151;I again stress that it is an increase&#151;has been to claim that his budget has been cut and that 120 jobs will go this year, with further job losses in future years. To head off that situation, he wants council tax payers to pay an increase in the precept of some 12 per cent. A point has been made about the inflation rate in the police force, which he claims to be 6 per cent., although, as has been said, I think that that has now fallen to 5 per cent. However, 80 per cent. of police costs are salary costs, which are running at around the 3 per cent. level. The inflation rate of the remaining 20 per cent. of costs must be staggering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000414">I am sure that we could all argue about those issues long into the night. I know that I can speak for other colleagues in north Wales when I say that we feel that we have on many occasions. However, there is a more serious issue that arises and that is at the heart of the whole funding debate. It gets to the heart of the problem in north Wales. The Home Office grant provided this year was delivered at the level that North Wales police expected. It was not less than they expected. If we examine the figures from previous years, a similar picture arises. The figures are produced by North Wales police, not by me or the Home Office. In 2004-05, North Wales police anticipated an increase in the grant of between 2.2 and 3 per cent. They got2.7 per cent, within the expected band. In 2005-06, they anticipated an increase of between 2 and 3 per cent. They got 3.85 per cent., which is considerably above what they were expecting. In 2006-07, they expected an increase of between 2 and 3 per cent. and they got3.1 per cent. One would be hard pressed to argue that the Home Office has failed to meet the expectations of North Wales police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07013188000415">If we look at the council tax precept, however, we see a somewhat different picture. Again, the figures are produced by North Wales police. In 2004-05, North Wales police expected an increase in council tax precept of between 23 and 25 per cent. They received 19.4 per cent., which is still a dramatic increase. In 2005-06, they  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2007">

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>31 Jan 2007 : Column 275</b><br>
expected an increase of between 14 and 16 per cent., but received 4.86 per cent. In 2006-07, they expectedto receive between 10.5 and 12 per cent. and received 5.67 per cent. It is clear to me that their expectations from the council tax precept have been wildly unrealistic, not just this year, but in many years in the past. In addition, the Welsh Assembly Government have made it clear in the last few years that they will cap increases that they think are excessive at around the 5 per cent. figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000416">Why, we must ask, have North Wales police been producing budgets that they know they do not have the funding to meet? Why have they recruited officers and staff in the knowledge that they do not expect to have the funding to meet their ongoing cost? At best, it is brinkmanship to bring about extra funding, or, at worst, it is mismanagement&#151;it is probably both. Even if North Wales police are doing such things with the best of intentions of receiving extra resources, they are playing with employees&#151;officers and support staff&#151;who are doing a good job for the people of north Wales. Worry about the financial management of North Wales police is also caused by the situation involving the general reserves, which are predicted to fall to 1.4 per cent., which is well below the 5 per cent. guideline figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07013188000417">If North Wales police have to examine their expenditure, they will find many areas on which they could cut back. It is important that such cuts do not fall on front-line policing. Cutting support staff is not the answer either, because letting support staff leave only to replace them with front-line officers is neither a sensible nor a cost-effective approach. Again, we are seeing an element of brinkmanship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000418">I will not go into great detail on how North Wales police could cut back, although I am tempted to do so. However, I will give a few illustrations of where cuts could be made. The publication &#147;Y Glas&#148; is sent to every home in north Wales and has included such vital information as a poem in praise of the chief constable. The latest edition informs us that John Nettles will be filming &#147;Midsomer Murders&#148; in north Wales. Although that is very interesting stuff, the money that funds the publication&#151;some &#163;200,000&#151;could probably be better spent on front-line policing. I am pleased that the police authority has acted on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000419">The chief constable wants to take forward mounted police at a cost of about &#163;300,000, although that money could be better spent. The fleet of Mercedes cars has been extended to further grades. The police uniform has been changed to black and now includes a baseball cap. In addition, the force failed to take up the first tranche of money for CSOs, and the chief constable and his colleagues have blogs, which are translated, that have cost more than &#163;4,500 to date. Of course, opinion and research companies have been employed to point out that people are crying out to pay even more council tax than they do at present. There was also a famous inquiry costing &#163;82,000 over a leaked document from the police authority that resulted in members of the police authority being DNA tested. I could go on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000420">Whatever the arguments and counter-arguments about the present difficulties, we need to maintain front-line policing.

not just now, but in the future. North Wales police have received substantial increases in funding from both central and local government. The funding has produced good results and we need to carry on the work. If the situation is sustainable, we will be able to build on the great success that we have already achieved.</p>

There is considerable frustration about the number of police officers who train in the Thames valley, but then transfer to the Met. The hon. Lady did not mention the double whammy that because the Met provides those officers with transport costs, they can continue to live in the Thames valley and travel free to the Met area. There is an additional unfairness for parts of the country such as mine because police officers tend to get drawn from places that are perceived to be quieter, such as north Oxfordshire, to areas of high stress, such as Oxford, Slough and Reading.</p>

<a name="70131-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07013188000772"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the financial outlook is very severe ... ACPO and APA have produced a number of forecasts which make it clear that without additional funding or changes in current policy and priorities there will be a significant and increasing gap in police funding over the CSR period ... Over 80 per cent. of the Police budget is accounted for by officer and staff costs and the real worry is that this gap will only be closed by a loss of officer numbers ... The Thames Valley budget for next year ... as it currently stands with a 4.99 per cent. increase in Band D Council Tax and nearly&#163;7 million cut from support costs ... is balanced. I have been able to do this by taking money from Headquarters functions and have therefore avoided cutting frontline operational officers. I very much doubt that we will be able to do this again next year. Indeed the draft revenue estimates for 2008/9 suggest that there is a &#163;20 million increase in budget needed and only a &#163;5 million increase in revenue support grant&#151;clearly some very hard choices will have to be made next year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07013188000424">The acting chief constable is clearly not alone. It is not like Thames Valley police is somehow out on a limb. Ken Jones, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has said:</p>

I think that it could be even lower than that because all sorts of pressures on the Home Office, such as the need for prison building and to deal with asylum seekers, could well drive the figure down lower.</p>

Ministers must confront the Treasury and make it clear that if they do not receive a year-on-year increase in funding there will be a cut in front-line funding. The Minister said that police forces must become more efficient, but funding has flatlined and police forces have to cope with ever increasing demands. For example, the witness protection provision of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 came into force in April 2006, and administrative support is required to manage the scheme. The nature of major crime is constantly changing, and police forces have to apply the national intelligence model, and are engaged in counter-terrorism initiatives. Alternative criminal tactics require additional resilience and resources. More work is done in organised crime units, and the Thames Valley force requires a new team of appropriately vetted and highly professional intelligence practitioners to set up a confidential unit.</p>

policing and security were not a priority, creating considerable difficulties for the police. This year, there has been an increase in the Thames Valley police budget of 4.62 per cent. If the budget is to stand still, next year a 5.94 per cent. increase is required and 4.3 per cent. increase is required in 2009. Something must therefore give, and I suspect that it will be front-line policing and PCSO provision, on which a promise was made but never quite delivered. The 2005 Labour manifesto pledged to deliver more than 24,000 PCSOs, but no sooner was the print dry than the Home Office reneged on its word, and reduced the national number to 16,000 without adequate explanation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07013188000433">In the Thames Valley, 675 PCSOs were originally promised but, in fact, 417 will be recruited, so there is a shortfall of 258. Even worse, district and parish councils are increasingly told that if they want PCSOs they must provide match funding. In effect, they must pay for PCSOs twice, through the police grant and through the district council or parish precept, even though the amount of funding for the police from council tax has increased substantially. In 1996-97, almost 85 per cent. of police force revenue was financed directly by the Government, but that percentage has fallen substantially, and it is about to go down to 60 per cent. in 2006-07. Council tax accounts for 21 per cent. of police funding&#151;up from 12 per cent. in 2001-02&#151;so a stealth tax has been levied, as more and more burdens are imposed on local people and the amount of money paid by the Treasury and central Government has decreased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07013188000437">PCSOs have made a real difference. North Wales police missed out on the first tranche of funding, because the chief constable suggested PCSOs could not do the job that he wanted them to do. That is certainly not the case, and he has changed his mind, but we have lost out on valuable Home Office money. That money was left unclaimed, but there are complaints now that that there is insufficient money from the Home Office. Good police performance in north-west Wales is the result of the dedication of police officers and, indeed, civilian staff, accompanied by steady increases in Government funding. In north Wales this year, and in 2007-08, there will be a rise in grant of 3.6 per cent., and the area has received a real-terms increase of33 per cent. since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07013188000438">In addition to the increase in central funding, there have been massive increases in the council tax precept: there has been a 53 per cent. increase over the past three years, and a staggering 100 per cent. increase in the past five years. Such increases, as my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) said, are not sustainable and, indeed, are unacceptable. Police numbers in my area have increased by 18 per cent. compared with the UK average of 11 per cent. since 1997, and we have 1,600 police on our streets. In that period, the number of civilian staff doubled to 997. In the comprehensive spending review, as the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) mentioned, the Chancellor made it clear that the Home Office would receive flat-rate increases between 2009 and 2011. It was known well in advance that an average increase of 3.6 per cent. in the general grant would be awarded in 2007-08, yet when it was delivered the police claimed that the Home Office had cut their budget. The general grant increase is worth &#163;2.6 million while total funding is &#163;76.3 million. The police have secured extra revenue from council tax, but resources still do not meet its expectations. Indeed, the police are still considering increasing council tax by between 7 and 10 per cent. per annum. The Welsh Assembly Government have indicated that they would cap increases at 5 per cent. There has been poor budget planning by North Wales police during a period in which there were sufficient funds coming from the Home Office. North Wales police has made some controversial management decisions, some of which were referred to by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07013188000439">In an intervention, the Minister mentioned that he launched the St. Asaph call centre, but I can tell him that the call centre is not working. There are insufficient numbers of front-line staff answering calls, and the centralisation that has taken place in North Wales police has come at the expense of moving experienced and knowledgeable people from different parts of the division to a central call centre. It is a white elephant, and it is sucking front-line staff into it to plug gaps.</p>

is supposed to represent. Council tax payers have paid for extra policing. Indeed, when the police authority proposed the rises, people were told that they were getting a 10p bobby. They have paid for extra local policing, but the chief constable is now making alarmist statements in the press, saying that he will cut the number of front-line staff&#151;staff for whom people have already paid&#151;if he does not get more money from the Home Office. I repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside said: the authority is getting extra money from the Home Office, year on year, and is not facing a cut, as has been suggested.</p>

Does that agree with the views expressed by my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents, and do they feel that the projected increase of 10 to12 per cent. would be way beyond their means?</p>

We all know that in the 2005 general election, council tax was the big issue. The Welsh Assembly Government have asked local authorities and police authorities to bear that in mind, and to consider inflation, which is at some 3 per cent., when setting the precept. I know that that is the case in England, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07013188000444">My hon. Friend the Minister has met me on a number of occasions to discuss a north Wales issue that is specific to my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson)&#151;port security. The arrangement for funding port security is not clear, and the system was changed in 2006-07 to reflect a new method of payment to the police authority. I talked to the police authority spokesman only yesterday, and it is still unclear how much money is dedicated to port security. The Minister will know that port security is high on the agenda, not just in my area but throughout the United Kingdom. Can he say exactly how much money will be allocated and when, so that we can use it properly in the port?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70131-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07013188000445">Failure to secure extra funding for the port will mean one of two things: either we cut the police presence alongside immigration officers, or we take front-line police officers from the street and put them in the port areas. My constituency has the third heaviest port traffic in the United Kingdom. On average, the number of lorries and the amount of heavy freight is increasing by 2 to 3 per cent. a year, so the amount of traffic flow through the port to the Republic of Ireland and back is increasing. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to bear that in mind.</p>

I was strongly opposed to North Wales police force merging with the rest of Wales, because it would result in over-centralisation, but one of the issues identified in the mergers debate&#151;I think that this point was agreed by everybody&#151;was that there was a gap in level 2 funding across the UK. That is certainly the case in my constituency. North Wales police and other police authorities in Wales have submitted plans to the Home Office, and the Minister is considering them in great detail. I urge him to make a decision as soon as possible. In February, the police authority will set its  <br>

precept, and I hope that it will discipline itself this year. If the Minister made it known that additional funding would be available over the next few years for level 2 policing, and for port security, it could balance its budget better, and it would have some flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70131-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000447">To conclude, North Wales police is experiencing pressures, largely of its own making&#151;</p>

Friend concludes, would he consider suggesting to the Minister that police forces with good records for delivery, like the North Wales police, which has the third or fourth best record on crime in the country, should be rewarded for that good practice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70131-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000450">Port security is a priority in my area. I urge the Minister to take it into account, along with level 2 policing. A third factor that the formula does not recognise fully, as I said in an intervention, is the population changes in popular tourist areas such as mine. Small communities with community policing have to deal with double the population and a different type of population in the evening and at night. Will the Minister reflect on that? He said in response to an intervention that tourism was nothing new in the area, but I am proud to tell the House that since 2001 tourism has increased in my area, and the number of people using north-west Wales and other UK destinations has grown significantly over that period. Not everybody is taking advantage of cheap flights abroad. Many are staying in the UK. The formula for police funding does not recognise that fully. I urge the Minister to give extra attention to those three aspects of policing in north Wales&#151;port security, level 2 policing and tourism.</p>

The debate has given Members the opportunity to air local concerns&#151;I accept that, as the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) said, policing is, rightly, a hugely important local issue&#151;and to make more general points about the processes, the formulas and all the other elements of the settlement. In that sense the debate has been good and focused.</p>

Member for Banbury is also right to say&#151;it is jargon now, and I do not remember when the expression was first coined&#151;that the broader issues of finance and policing in our communities are a process, rather than an event. That seems to apply to most things these days. Although many contributions focused on the specifics of the immediate settlement and its consequences for individual communities, many hon. Members, not least the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor), dealt with the broader picture. I do not blame hon. Members for adopting either approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70131-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000453">The debate was constructive and represents the start of a wider debate. I do not say that as an abdication of responsibility for the development of public policy on policing. I say that because the subject is important enough for us to have a proper national debate, as I suggested earlier.</p>

I agree with him about the need for further debate, especially in view of the funding constraints over the next few years. When he announced the police authorities grant back in November, he said that the Government would publish a vision for policing and a reform road map by the end of the year. Plainly, that vision and reform agenda are needed. Can he tell the House when he now plans to publish them?</p>

We had hoped that the Association of Police Authorities, the Association of Chief Police Officers and Government consultation processes would all be aligned and would be completed by the end of the year, but that was not possible. ACPO is taking considerable time to reflect on these matters, which it is important to do, and will not be ready until April. The position of the APA is similar, though it may not need until April. To engender the debate, the Home Office will set out in February the broad vision and way forward in terms of the components of reform&#151;broadly, what we need more of and what we need less of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70131-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000457">I want to get to a stage whereby, on the back of good performance, the Government, while of course still measuring that performance, step back more and more in terms of inspection, bureaucracy and telling people what to do in a very prescriptive way and let local forces concentrate increasingly on that while we concentrate increasingly on output. The Home Office statement in February will engender a wider debate with colleagues in the APA and ACPO. In terms of reform and vision, I agree with much of the joint ACPO-APA document on sustainable policing; I could sign up to that tomorrow. I have some concerns about their comments on finance and resources, which I am happy to discuss with them, but I think that many would agree with the overall thrust of the document.</p>

He echoed a point made by many other Members: whatever we do of substance in terms of reducing crime and getting more and more police officers on the front line, there is real difficulty in trying to shift the public perception of how safe or otherwise their areas are.

hard message to get across to many of his constituents, who still perceive it as relatively dangerous or crime-ridden. For the record, my borough of Harrow invariably stands at anything from 30th to 33rd in the crime rankings in London, including the City of London, yet it is still very hard to shift people&#146;s perceptions&#151;although things are changing with the introduction of the safer neighbourhood teams. That is not for political reasons, but simply because crime is such an important issue.</p>

With the greatest respect, I will not refer to the comments of the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter), not least because we heard them all last week in the Manchester debate. I took the opportunity to have a little comfort break at that point, because I knew that it was the only break that I was going to get. I apologise to him for my absence.

It is a fair point, but I do not have a piece of paper in my pocket to give an immediate response to it. I am not sure whether transfer payments are the answer. As Ian Blair has said, as much traffic goes the other way. I should think that the Met is, at worst, static in terms of imports and exports. Other Members mentioned Greater Manchester and its influence on Lancashire, Cheshire and other forces. However, the incentives offered by metropolitan forces outside London are not of the same nature as the Met can offer. It is worth exploring further the relationship between metropolitan forces with a larger resource base, relatively speaking, than the county forces surrounding them.</p>

historic, geographic and otherwise&#151;of some of the south-east forces, which requires further detailed consideration. I do not have all the figures to hand but when there have been specific international events at Sandown or elsewhere in Surrey, with unique policing dimensions, sooner or later&#151;on balance and to be fair to the Home Office and Surrey&#151;they have been dealt with. I do not think that the point about proximity to London in that regard means that it has been somehow ill served by the special grant regime. Again, some of the broader points about policing, crime markets and wider points that go beyond recruitment and the whole nexus of London and the surrounding counties, including Essex, were well made. I will try to think positively&#151;I urge everyone to do the same&#151;not just about Surrey&#146;s predicament but about everybody&#146;s position as we go forward into what will be, as I have said in all candour, three quite tight years.</p>

Member for Banbury and others who alluded to terrorism that the funding for counter-terrorism has increased fourfold since about 2002&#151;to the best part of &#163;0.5 billion. That is not part of the settlement and does not count as money going directly between forces and the centre. It is a grant put on top, so terrorism should be taken out of the equation. That does not mean that points raised about gaps in protective services at level 2&#151;referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen) and others&#151;do not exist, but they are starting to be addressed. Quite deliberately, counter-terrorism has been put to one side and needs to be dealt with in a regional, local and national configuration. That is being done.</p>

Member for Banbury and others raised another important point, which I tried to write down, about continuing demands being made of our police forces in ever-more sophisticated ways in an ever-changing world. That is absolutely the case. We are trying to address those points in an environment in which growth in resources has slowed down. That is the safest way of saying it, rather than the impression of &#147;cut, cut, cut&#148; that has been created by some hon. Members. There has been significant growth over eight or nine years. Yes, the rate is slowing and yes, it causes difficulties, but if all things remain the same and we go forward to the year after next, we should be able to address the issues collectively in all substance. It is not simply the point that 80 per cent. or more of funding is in people: if it is nothing more than 3 per cent., how can the inflation rate be described as very exorbitant?</p>

It is about, however traduced, doing more on bureaucracy. It is about looking into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and carrying out a full review of the Act, taking into account all the paperwork and paraphernalia surrounding the process of an arrest all the way through to dispatching people to the courts. That is about to commence. It is about the balance between summary justice, fixed penalty notices and who goes through the courts.

I shall try to deal with his point about population figures in a moment. First, let me say that the decision on distribution is on how to allocate a certain pot of money between councils, and what benefits one council will be to the detriment of others. During the consultation, a number of councils argued that they are unique; logically, of course, it is not possible for more than one to be unique.</p>

It is important to recognise that authorities face extra costs as a result of growth in terms of both revenue and capital, and that capital in particular can be lumpy in placing demands on authorities. In the two-year settlement, we changed the method of calculation of population to take account of future projections rather than simply relying on historical trends. A number of authorities had asked us to do that.</p>

The population projections that the Minister is using as a basis for grant distribution reflect previous years of decline rather than the years of growth around 2003-04. As a result, in comparison with the real population of the city, they are out by some 13,000. Those extra 13,000 are a young, transient population who place particular demands on the resources of the city council. Can the Minister not see a way of putting the error right?</p>

She is referring to the allocation of grant following the changes inthe baseline. When any Government allocate grant on a formula basis, they have to do so on the basis of a like-for-like comparison. A number of local authorities, especially in London, made the point in consultation that the allocation appears to be lower in cash grant in some cases, such as when an authority is, so to speak, on the floor at 2.7 per cent.&#151;and I am fairly sure that the hon. Lady&#146;s authority is a floor authority. That appears to be the case because of the like-for-like comparisons year on year. The authorities that have argued that the actual grant is not as much as it appears to be on paper make a point that would be fair if in alternative years, when the like-for-like comparison gives them more than the allocation appears on paper, that sum were returned.

He made it clear that&#151;on looking at the cash increase, by whatever method of analysis&#151;some London boroughs have had less than that. In my case, Kingston had an increase of just 1.9 per cent. The retail prices index&#151;the inflation index&#151;is running at 4.4 per cent.

Sadly, Leicestershire had the lowest grant increase of all 150 upper-tier unitary authorities&#151;&#163;0.6 million, or 0.8 per cent. Why was that so? Well, the Minister talks about like-for-like adjustments, but in our case the transfer of supported capital expenditure was based on 2005-06, when there was a significant spike of almost &#163;13 million in capital expenditure because we were replacing a number of schools, one if which is in my constituency. Can Leicestershire be treated in the same way as Norfolk and Lancashire, both of which had their spikes removed? Norfolk&#146;s figure was reduced to &#163;56 million from &#163;71 million, and Lancashire&#146;s was reduced to &#163;32 million from&#163;36 million. Such an approach does make a difference. We are grateful for what has happened, but our increase remains very low, compared with other unitary and upper-tier authorities.</p>

finances&#151;more important, in my opinion, than tiny differences in marginal grant increases, and more important even, I venture to suggest, than arguing over the minutiae of some of the grant formula. More widely, stability is vital to enable authorities to plan jointly with local service delivery partners, agree objectives for their area, and deliver them. So I am very happy indeed to be able to say something that is so expected and predictable.</p>

The PCTs are one of the major partners, if not the major partner, of local authorities in the delivery of local area agreements. Therefore the alignment of financial periods and spending decisions, both revenue and capital, is very important. It follows that it is essential that the partners work in partnership. I acknowledge the point that in some instances the financial decision-making of the local authority and the primary care trust can be out of kilter, but the local area agreement process that we have introduced allows the council and the PCT to work together, and the previous regime did not. The second and more important point, which the hon. Lady must surely acknowledge, is that it is incumbent on the PCT, as it is on the local authority, to balance their books. There is little point having financial stability and predictability if one is simply building up a deficit in one&#146;s accounts. Against the background of increased resources, it is surely right&#151;it is surprising that the hon. Lady disagrees&#151;that PCTs and councils should balance their books.</p>

All those factors come together at a time when we are trying to put into effect single status, because it was neglected before. That is a massive amount of additional expenditure and I want the Minister to recognise the accumulation of problems that we face.</p>

cent. All of the increases that I have quoted are on a like-for-like basis&#151;this is the important point that the House has just been debating&#151;as they are adjustedfor changes in function and financing. That is an important point, because several of the representations that I received&#151;I suspect that the same applies to hon. Members&#151;were on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000529">I shall expand a little further. A simple cash difference in the amount of grant that an authority receives from one year to the next is no doubt a useful figure, but it is not the whole story. That is because from one year to the next we may ask local government to take on a new task, or drop an old one, or to transfer the financing for an existing function to a different body or a different financing route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000530">To take the most dramatic example of recent years, the introduction of dedicated schools grant from 2006-07 meant a large reduction in cash terms in the formula grant received by education authorities compared with the previous year. However, that would not have been a sensible comparison, because previously they were also receiving DSG, so we adjusted the comparison for formula grant purposes to reflect that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000531">This year, the main adjustment is for something rather less obvious. When we introduced multi-year settlements, we needed also to make changes in the way support for capital expenditure is provided. Any allocations that needed revenue support through the formula grant needed to be made in advance, so that we could calculate two years&#146; worth of formula grant. However, some capital programmes are not so predictable: for example, when expenditure is inherently lumpy with large projects, or funding is based on a bidding process. So those programmes were switched to being supported by the Government with a direct capital grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07013188000532">The effect of that, financially, was to move the burden of borrowing from councils to the Treasury. Resources that were previously included in the local government settlement to help support borrowing were therefore transferred to the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07013188000533">To reflect that financing change, we recalculate the prior year&#151;2006-07 in the case of the settlement that we are debating today&#151;as though the transfer for 2007-08 had already happened. A number of councils objected to the resultant reduction in their base position and, therefore, to the fact that their cash increase from year to year was less than the adjusted, like-for-like increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70131-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07013188000534">I believe however that councils could hardly object to the underlying principle of adjusting since, if funding were transferred into the settlement, it would give authorities on the floor a larger increase. As I toldmy right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley), I am certainly prepared to look again at the way in which the grant floor operates from 2008-09 onwards, but I will not change the basis for 2007-08.</p>

As I said earlier, moving to multi-year settlements means that we must make a special effort to look at all the relevant circumstances, and the consultation timetable is being considered at the moment.

Moreover, that alignment will be reflected in special grant allocation so as to provide a stable framework for public finance. It is too early to give the hon.

A number of authorities opposed in particular the way in which the new formulae for social services for children and younger adults are being phased in at the same time as the overall grant settlement is subject to the floor, which is another point that has been raised in the debate.

As Members know, the ONS is engaged in a programme of work to improve progressively the methodology used in calculating statistics for population and, in particular, for migration. Ahead of the next three-year settlement, the ONS anticipates incorporating in population estimates and projections improvements in data on the geographical location of international migrants.

That sounds an agreeable prospect, but unfortunately it ignores how public finances are managed and planned. The Government provide for an aggregate of funding to be distributed to local government for the three years of the spending plans. That aggregate includes business, or non-domestic, rates and revenue support grant. If the business rates yield decreases, the Government bear the risk and increase the RSG accordingly, but it is not a one-way street; if the business rates yield increases, the Government cannot conjure up another billion pounds from thin air.</p>

Those floors&#151;the minimum percentage grant increase, on a like-for-like basis&#151;are 2.7 per cent. for all authorities, except police authorities, where the floor is 3.6 per cent., which the House debated earlier. For the future, before we decide on proposals for grant allocation from 2008-09, there will be further opportunities for authorities and groups of authorities to make proposals if they want to do so, and there will be a further round of consultation.</p>

In order to cap, the Secretary of State must decide whether an authority&#146;s budget is excessive according to a set of principles. One of the principles must involve a comparison of the authority&#146;s budget requirement over one or more years. To be capped, an authority must therefore have set an excessive budget requirement increase and have exceeded any other principles the Government decide to use, for example: a principle relating to council tax increases.

We have heard the same weary tale for 10 years: increases piled on top of one another. We have seen increases of &#163;59, &#163;51, &#163;48, &#163;55, &#163;74, &#163;126, &#163;65, &#163;47 and &#163;54. There is now an increase this year of &#163;44. There has thus been an increase of &#163;623 for an average home, although that amount is bigger for one of Labour&#146;s millionaire donors. Householders may well wonder if they would achieve better value by clubbing together and using their &#163;623 contribution to buy a life peerage. It is a stark measure of council tax rises under the Government that an increase of 3.5 per cent. above inflation&#151;the Chancellor&#146;s favourite measure&#151;can produce a monetary amount that a decade ago would have required double-digit percentages to achieve. A &#163;44 increase hits someone&#146;s pocket hard, whether it is caused by a 3.5 per cent. increase in council tax or an 11 per cent. increase. It is a big increase if someone is struggling to make ends meet.</p>

Nice neighbourhoods, scenic views and home improvements have all been targeted, as homes with such features will be subject to a hike in taxes. The hounds of the Minister&#146;s paparazzi-like council tax inspectors have dug even deeper into people&#146;s lives. In Wales, the 2005 council tax revaluation resulted in four times as many houses moving up a band as down.</p>

In Scotland, a report by the Liberal Democrat and Labour Executive backs a house price index of 1 per cent. a year. Such a tax is being considered by the Lyons inquiry&#151;we look forward to the publication of that report in March&#151;but if it were introduced in my constituency, a hard-working family living in an average house would have to pay about &#163;2,000 a year. The majority of year-in, year-out council tax increases are the direct result of national pay increases and unfunded burdens imposed by central Government on local authorities. Those arguments are well rehearsed, but I wish to offer the House two new ones.</p>

Everything would be fine if only a few pensioners took up the offer, as funding for the scheme ignored past demand, and assumed a modest increase. Predictably, that assumption was wrong, and demand increased while central Government funding did not. Lord Bruce-Lockhart&#151;the Minister&#146;s favourite Conservative spokesman&#151;said in <i> The Times</i>:</p>

Recently, I had the opportunity to meet some of Hertfordshire&#146;s splendid councillors, and what is true in that county is true across the country. It is a prime example of a proposal that only works if people do not take it up. If people use their pass to travel by bus, the whole thing starts to collapse.</p>

In previous debates, I have raised the worry that licensing authorities would not be fully compensated for the extra costs imposed on them by the Government.

We are clear that, if we were in government&#151;and we soon will be a Government, sitting across the Chamber on the Government Benches&#151;when we decided to impose a scheme on local government, we would be mindful that there should be no transfer of costs on to the council tax.

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000587">The importance of other settlements pales when compared with the importance to local government of next year&#146;s summer spending review, which we touched on earlier. The Local Government Association produced a constructive document outlining the funding crisis facing local government, and it includes the No. 1 problem facing local government, namely the care of the elderly. I have a prejudice on the subject because of my past experience as chairman of a social services department. Like many hon. Members present, I have seen at first hand the effects of a local shortage of dementia beds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000588">The number of people aged 85 and over has been increasing rapidly in recent years by almost 6 per cent. a year, with a growth in dependency and in the complexity of cases. A quarter of over-85s develop dementia, and a third of those need constant care and supervision. Some hon. Members on the Labour Benches seem to find that amusing. If a relative of theirs ever suffers from dementia and they see the deterioration, they may find it in their hearts to be a little more compassionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07013188000589">Further demand is generated as the NHS withdraws from service agreements, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) noted. Nearly half of all councils have experienced a reduction in primary care trust funding for joint projects. To manage rising demands and costs, local authorities have increasingly raised the eligibility criteria. That is the most dramatic change that I have seen since I first became involved with the problem over 30 years ago. We have moved to a world where only those elderly people who are unable to perform most or all personal care or domestic routines receive support. Not surprisingly, the growing number of older people with increasingly complex needs is placing local authorities under pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000590">Local authorities have more than doubled their spending on care for older people in the past 10 years, yet Government funding for social care has not kept pace. The Local Government Association estimates that Government funding has increased by just 14 per cent. in real terms since 1997-98. Of course, if the same group of people qualify for nursing care, there has been a 90 per cent. increase in funding for the NHS. The figure demonstrates that social care is the Cinderella service of the Department of Health, as the Under-Secretary of State for Health so rightly said last year.</p>

occurred in funding and in the elderly population. When I became involved in social services many years ago, the kind of people in elderly persons homes were very different in character. We have moved further away from that. I believe the conventional elderly persons residential home will gradually disappear, to be replaced principally by dementia beds and more severe dementia beds.</p>

There are clearly some differences, particularly in respect of intermediate beds, where people spend some time in order to be assessed. The cost, which would normally be paid by social services, is paid by the state. I accept that there are problems with regard to the definition, which we need to consider seriously. However, we could make significant changes if we were more aggressive on joint commissioning, revisited the regulations on the joint registration of homes as between nursing care and social care, dealt with the training of people working in homes, and tried to find different ways of ensuring that when a care package is put together both sides can stick to it. There are lots of practical things that we could do to make a difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000598">The hon. Member for Richmond Park talked about her local council, Kingston. I should like to give three examples of what the pull-out of funds from local authorities has meant in practice. Devon county council reports facing a &#163;15 million budget shortfall in 2006. By 2026, there will have been a 73 per cent. increase in those aged over 85, with the cost of caring for somebody of 85-plus being twice the average cost of caring for someone aged 75 to 85. That is placing significant pressure on its budget. The London borough of Harrow has been forced to make a &#163;9 million cut to avoid a financial crisis as a result of increased demand for social care and cost-shifting by the local primary care trust. Wiltshire county council has been forced to introduce a &#163;7 million recovery plan to overcome a deficit in its adult and community services department following reductions in NHS funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000599">Care for the elderly is challenging not only financially but emotionally. At times, it can be heart-breaking. Its effects permeate society far beyond the immediate family. The crisis in elderly social care has long been predicted, and its arrival is not in dispute. Any civilised spending review must put it at its very heart the care of the elderly.</p>

In a three-and-a-half hour debate, the Front Benchers have taken up just over an hour. The wind-ups will probably take another 20 minutes, so almost half the debate has gone in Front-Bench contributions. I keep banging on about that every year, because it demeans our debates. We could do with a much longer period to debate local government finance, which is an important subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000601">My first point concerns the second year of damping in relation to social services. The Minister has already said that he is not willing to change his mind on that, but I make no apology for raising it with him again. The SIGOMA group has had several meetings throughout the year with him&#151;I am grateful to him for attending them&#151;and with his colleagues to try to make the point that this represents a substantial amount of money. Year after year, it seems that we cannot get these formulas right. The damping mechanisms or the ceilings and floors mean that some authorities gain and some lose out, while those that really need the money are deprived of it for three or four years until the mechanisms correct the anomalies. I have been in the House for almost 20 years, and every year we have seen some form of adjustment mechanism for the grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07013188000602">The figure of &#163;238 million was mentioned in relation to the SIGOMA group. For an authority such as mine, that would equate to about &#163;10 million&#151;a substantial amount of money that would perhaps enable us to adjust our council tax, if not in the same way as Hammersmith. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter) will no doubt return to the cuts in services in Hammersmith that he mentioned earlier. People in Barnsley are looking at what is happening in Hammersmith, where they see the reduction in council tax and begin to wonder whether we are again in a situation whereby the money is flowing south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07013188000603">As has been pointed out, the revenue grant savings made because of the business grant this year&#151;the &#163;1 billion figure&#151;could have been funded equally easily by removing the damping to the tune of &#163;238 million and giving the money to the local authorities that need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07013188000604">We are not talking about profligate authorities here. Barnsley is a well run authority, as most metropolitan authorities and, indeed, most authorities in the country are. It is always looking to improve its performance. For example, on Monday this week, Barnsley council hosted a seminar for local authorities from all over the country. At that seminar&#151;this is wizard for a former coal-mining authority&#151;it passed a declaration that in future any council-owned premises in the authority will be heated by wood burning. We have been wood burning now for some time and we have won awards for it. Apparently, we have already met&#151;in fact, we have surpassed&#151;our 2060 targets for environmental cleanliness.

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07013188000605">The knock-on effect has already been mentioned by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) when he spoke about care issues. We have joint partnerships with our primary care trusts in Barnsley. Until the recent reconfiguration we had the biggest PCT in the country, though I am not sure that that is still the case. The Minister mentioned that local authorities and PCTs should be striving to balance their books. My PCT would have balanced its books for this financial year end, but it had to pay a &#163;7 million levy to fund authorities in deficit&#151;namely, Sheffield, which had substantial deficits. Thus &#163;7 million has gone out of the PCT and the partnership funding. If the local authority is at the same time being squeezed on funding that should be made available, especially for social services, we face something of a double whammy in that the money is being squeezed at both ends of the partnership. I repeat the point that Barnsley PCT is still not funded at its target. I think that we are now at 97.5 per cent. and we are being funded less and less in relation to the target every year. Those are the two main points.</p>

Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush will make his points, but it is worth mentioning the continual argument between authorities in the north and authorities in London. Quite a number of London authorities have the same needs and assessments as authorities in the north. The requirements are similar, so there is no easy argument about money going into London, depriving the north. We should stop making statements about money that London needs going to northern authorities&#151;or vice versa. That is not the case; it is obvious that there are needs on both sides. I have not always taken that much notice of the issue, but if London authorities can afford to stage the 2012 Olympics, they cannot be doing too badly.</p>

a Government who, on the face of it, are willing to give local authorities greater responsibility in place-shaping an area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07013188000620">There was therefore an opportunity for this year&#146;s local government finance debate to jettison the bombastic references to billions of pounds of Government expenditure, above-inflation increases, the most generous settlement ever and so on in favour of a discussion that confirmed that the Government had loosened the purse strings and been willing to trust local authorities with their own finances. I regret that that opportunity has not been grasped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07013188000621">The Government have adopted the same old tired approach&#151;I was about to say, of spraying the chamber with facts and figures, but that would be uncharitable to the Minister. He has deployed them carefully, with the deviousness of a chess grandmaster, rather than splattering them around the Chamber, disregarding all requests for changes to the formula and using headline figures that mask the reality of what is happening on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70131-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07013188000622">I should like to set out some issues that have not been tackled in the debate. The comprehensive spending review affords the Government an opportunity to make good. Let us consider wage settlements in local authorities. Perhaps the Minister can confirm in his response to the debate that the increase in local authority wages is expected to be 2.5 to 2.7 per cent. What does that mean for local authorities receiving less than that in real terms? Hon. Members, including my hon. Friends, have mentioned local authorities who will be in that situation.</p>

Can the Minister confirm whether ring-fencing has been reduced? Of course, he cannot; instead, he will have to confirm that ring-fencing of council budgets is at record levels, and that local government is still being treated as a delivery arm of central Government rather than a tier of government in its own right. For all their talk of autonomy and greater devolution, the Government are again threatening councils with capping. Where does that leave councils that have a historically low level of taxation? What logic is there in requiring councils to re-bill if they have set a budget over the cap, when the re-billing costs are more than the saving in council tax? The Minister said that he had not yet established the exact principles in relation to capping. I hope that he will at least establish the principle that a requirement to re-bill in such circumstances would not be terribly sensible.</p>

The Minister&#146;s statement shows that once specific ring-fenced grants are taken into account, the increase in total formula grant is 3.7 per cent. Some councils will receive the minimum increase&#151;my council and many others will receive 2.7 per cent.&#151;but the adjusted grant for my local authority and others pushes the increase below that level. For instance, Sutton will receive 1.7 per cent. at a time when, as other Members have mentioned, the retail prices index is running at4.4 per cent. and inflation in local government might be higher still. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Minister expresses desperation about my remarks from a sedentary  <br>

The Minister will know, however, that because education spending is ring-fenced, councils have no flexibility, and if savings are required, those end up being made principally in adult social services. As several Members have mentioned, according to representations made by the special interest group of municipal authorities outside London within the Local Government Association&#151;that explains why it is abbreviated to SIGOMA&#151;the Government&#146;s failure to apply changes to the social services formula means that most metropolitan and large urban authorities will be deprived of about &#163;250 million, putting them under great pressure. In opening the debate, the Minister talked about Members arguing over the minutiae of the formula. I hope that he was not referring to that &#163;250 million, as it is a substantial sum.</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="07013188000626"><a name="70131-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="07013188001157"><b>Mr. Neil Turner: </b>As chairman of the SIGOMA group, I am delighted to hear the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000628">Social services are therefore left reeling from a double whammy. One could argue that it is a triple whammy, as they are also hit by fees in nursing, residential care and home care all increasing by more than 4 per cent. No doubt the Minister will say that local authorities should beat down prices in those homes. But how realistic is that? I suspect that every Member present in the Chamber will have been lobbied recently by care homes in their constituencies stating that they cannot make ends meet with the rates that are currently paid to them; in fact, private individuals are having to make up the difference in many cases. I do not think that it is realistic to ask local authorities to play hardball with care homes, many of which are on the verge of closing&#151;if they have not already done so&#151;because of the amount that they must pay to stay open.</p>

I do not have time to refer to them all in detail, but waste collection and disposal costs are rising at a rate of 9 per cent. per annum. The Minister would have some justification in saying that local authorities should have planned for that, given their awareness of an inbuilt increase in landfill tax. That is true, but authorities have also been hit by a substantial increase in transport costs, which are a key part of the costs of waste collection and disposal.</p>

the cost of an individual care package often runs into six figures. A limited number of children can have a significant impact on a local authority budget.

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000632">Perhaps the most important issue is cost-shunting. There is evidence from all over the country of attempts to shift financial pressures from primary care trusts and acute trusts to local authorities. That is being done either directly or indirectly: for instance, PCTs may cut funds for voluntary associations which then expect local authorities to make up the difference. Open Door is a service that provides counselling for teenagers who are not yet ill enough to need access to acute mental health services, and may not need it if they receive counselling. A PCT has cut funding for that service without, apparently, trying to fill the gap with an alternative service. I am hopeful that it will do a U-turn, but we must wait and see.</p>

I do not wish to make light of those problems, but I had 15 years of setting budgets for a local authority, which is a difficult process, and I would rather have had this settlement than any of those I had between 1990 and 1997. It has the advantages of giving an above-inflation increase in funding from central Government and of being the second year of a two-year settlement, which gives stability&#151;and we are moving towards a three-year settlement. It also has the advantage that all responsible local authorities are now building Gershon, or Gershon-style, efficiencies into what they do and achieving real savings without cutting front-line services.

The council has raided the ample balances left by the previous Labour council, which would account for 2 per cent. of its 3 per cent. rise in any event. It has received a 3.4 per cent.&#151;&#163;3.6 million&#151;increase from central Government, which is equivalent to 6 per cent. on the council tax. It also had the benefit of a very good medium-term financial strategy, delivering above-Gershon savings every year. It has introduced two items of growth. First, it changed its corporate identity, so that everything in the borough is now painted blue&#151;be it notepaper, buildings, signage or notice boards. A huge amount of public money is being spent on branding everything blue.</p>

He did not notify me that he would be talking about Hammersmith and Fulham council, but to be honest, I rather expected it. If he so objects to the council tax cut, can he explain why the Labour group put out a press release, which was then withdrawn, saying that it would have cut the council tax by even more if it was still in office? Most local people found that incredible, after 10 years of Labour council tax hikes.</p>

Hammersmith and Fulham is pledged to cutting &#163;34 million from a budget of &#163;180 million. Anyone who knows anything about local government finance knows that that must mean very deep, almost unimaginable cuts in services. I referred earlier to the cuts in social services. We are talking about every home help being sacked; no assessment staff; cutting &#163;1.5 million by tightening the criteria applying to the old and the vulnerable; &#163;150,000 being cut from occupational therapy; and &#163;500,000 being saved by closing mental health day care facilities. There are also the cuts in the general services that we all thought the Conservatives were going to support. Some &#163;1 million will be cut from the refuse services and street cleaning budget. Under Labour, Hammersmith and Fulham was the fourth cleanest borough in London. What will it be after four years of &#163;1 million-worth of cuts from the Conservatives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07013188000661">The Irish centre, in Hammersmith Broadway, which has a national and not just a London-wide, reputation, has had its budget cut. The Lyric theatre, which also has a national reputation, is having its budget cut. The borough&#146;s play and youth services will not exist, given that &#163;320,000 is being cut from those services. Some &#163;400,000 is also being cut from the library service. These are extraordinary, almost unimaginable cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07013188000662">One might think that education was free from these cuts, given the hypothecation of the budget&#151;but no. Three schools are to close, not on educational grounds but simply so that the sites can be sold off in order that debt charges can be repaid and further cuts made in the council&#146;s budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07013188000663">The affordable housing programme has been completely turned on its head. The minimum of rented housing will be built in the borough. Services for the homeless have been cut to the bone. Even the budget  <br>

that is set aside for storing the possessions of homeless families, so that they can reclaim them when they are rehoused, has been cut. The number of staff who service the homeless at council offices has also been cut. The message is clear: if people are old, poor or vulnerable, the council will no longer provide services for them. In return, it will give people 50p a week.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07013188000665"><a name="70131-0015.htm_spnew14"><a name="07013188001171"><b>Mr. Slaughter:</b> They did not even say that. They said that they would cut the council tax, and they have done so, by 50p a week&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I hear the cheers, but they were somewhat more muted than they have been when the issue has been raised previously, because what is going on in Hammersmith and Fulham is not comparable with what is happening even in other Conservative authorities. It has been described as &#147;Porterite&#148; and as matching the antics of Wandsworth and Westminster councils in the 1980s, when a studious attempt was made to remove council accommodation from the borough, but things have gone even further and we are seeing almost a type of social cleansing. The council is saying that it does not want community schools in the borough: one is being closed and the other threatened by having an academy opened next door. It is saying that it does not want affordable housing in the borough or social service provision&#151;although we heard from the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) that that is a priority for his party. All those cuts will have an impact on the weakest, poorest and most vulnerable people.

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70131-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07013188000666">Nor does the council want the people who serve the community.

The message is clear from the Conservative administration in Hammersmith and Fulham: &#147;If you are old, poor, in need or homeless, we do not want you in the borough. We want to model ourselves on the central London boroughs which have adopted these policies for many years.&#148; It is a cynical and deplorable move, and I believe that when people have another opportunity at the ballot box to consider whether they want 50p a week or decent services&#151;as provided for many years by a Labour council&#151;and the opportunity to live in a mixed community that welcomes everyone, they will not vote Conservative in Hammersmith and Fulham again.</p>

(Mr. Cameron), the hon. Gentleman finds that both those local authorities have had a change of control to the Conservatives. As I understand it, the Conservatives locally stood on a manifesto of reducing the council tax. They won, and they are honouring the commitment that they made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07013188000668">I listened in respectful silence to the Minister as he introduced the debate and described a revenue support grant settlement that seemed more and more remote from the one that I was looking at in Hampshire. I realised that he had lost contact with reality when, in his peroration, he described the settlement as revolutionary and then sat down. It is possible to seek to defend the settlement in the terms that he did, if one looks at it as a snapshot. If, on the other hand, one views it as a movie, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) did, and in perspective, it is much more difficult to defend it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000669">From the point of view of Hampshire, we are in the 2.7 per cent. club, which has several members. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) said, 2.7 per cent. does not begin to cover inflation, let alone the rising costs of, for example, adult social care, about which I shall say more in a moment. That low increase in the formula grant is even more difficult, as it follows a settlement for the current year that amounts to 0.2 per cent. once the one-off grants have been stripped out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000670">In addition, Hampshire county council&#146;s grant for supporting people has been frozen at just below the level for the current year, so it finds itself between a rock and a hard place: if it puts up the council tax by more than 5 per cent., it gets capped; if it continues to make efficiency savings&#151;as it will&#151;there will still be a gap of &#163;10 million, which the council will have to fill by making some very unpalatable decisions. It is unsustainable for the Government to continue to provide grants such as this one while still expecting rises of below 5 per cent. in council tax, with no effect on services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07013188000671">The Minister accused Opposition Members of waving shrouds, but I refer him to the report from the Commission for Social Care Inspection that was published in December. It deals with the very difficult decisions that social services departments already have to make. The report was very balanced: it paid tribute to the Government for some of the things that they have done, but it also identified real cause for concern in a number of areas. It found that a third of homes did not meet the required standards for the management of medication or operate safe working practices, and that a substantial number of home care services are failing standards on the recruitment and supervision of staff. It mentions the juggling that local authorities are having to undertake, and the fact that they are having to tighten eligibility criteria. It also notes that there are question marks about the advice and support available to clients and carers excluded from funded care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000672">The CSCI report highlights five groups of people who give rise for concern: those not using council services but in need of information and support; the carers, relatives and friends who carry the cost of ever tightening eligibility criteria; those who lack choice in respect of services or the people who deliver home care; those whose service standards are unacceptably low,  <br>

and those with special complex needs that are not being met. All the evidence is that the problems are going to get worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07013188000673">Ministers respond by saying that there has been a39 per cent. real increase in funding for local authorities nationally since 1997-98, but expenditure by local authorities has had to rise by 50 per cent. in that period, in direct response to Government spending plans and to service pressures. As a result, the increase is not as generous as we are told.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000674">The Local Government Association says that funding from the Government for services other than schools and specific grant priorities has increased by only 14 per cent. in real terms. That contrasts with the 90 per cent. increase given to the NHS. I welcome increased investment in the public services, but one has to compare the very generous treatment given to a service for which the Government have direct responsibility, with the rather miserly funding of services for which local authorities have responsibility. That is especially important in respect of where the two services overlap, which is in social services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000675">My second point has to do with damping, the mechanism introduced by the Government to prevent sharp adjustments in grant distribution as we move from where we are to where the Government think we ought to be. Is it a floor, or is it quicksand? In Hampshire, &#163;38 million&#151;or 30 per cent.&#151;of our formula grant is at risk as a result of the damping mechanism. The Minister talks about the certainty that multi-year agreements will bring, but that is undermined by the medium-term uncertainty about how the damping mechanism is to unwind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000676">I was not greatly reassured by the exchange at the start of the debate between the Minister and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). It would be helpful if the Minister, when he winds up, will confirm that the grant floor will be a permanent part of the formula grant allocation, and that the &#163;38 million will not be removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07013188000677">A moment ago, I mentioned residential care. There was a very good debate in Westminster Hall on17 January on public funding for residential care, about which hon. Members of all parties expressed their concern. It emerged that the pressure on funding means that social services now intervene only when a client reaches a substantial or critical level of need. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that care homes are underfunded by &#163;1 billion. In the CSCI report, Denise Platt mentioned that primary care trusts and local authorities are increasingly withdrawing from pooled budget arrangements, owing to pressure on funding. Prevention and early intervention are being squeezed out. We need a step change in funding for those services if the quality of care that we all want to see is delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07013188000678">The Minister might care to read what his colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon.

The number of people with learning disabilities is increasing by 2 per cent. a year in Hampshire, and as care packages become more sophisticated their cost is ever higher. The funding formula does not recognise that need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07013188000680">My final point is about the sustainability of the system by which we pay for local government. The council tax is like an old bridge with a weight restriction. It was designed to carry the pressure of council tax bills of three figures, but not of four, so it is creaking. There is something unsustainable about the regime we are being asked to approve this evening. On each occasion, the Government defer a difficult decision, but the time for drift is coming to an end; it is time that the Government took a grip on local government finance and found a sustainable way of funding it which recognises the responsibilities that fall on local government. I hope that in a year&#146;s time we shall have a different debate&#151;one with a greater degree of realism.</p>

The Local Government Association briefing of 31 January notes that most authorities will receive a higher grant increase than in 2006-07 and that there has been a real-terms grant increase of 14 per cent. between 1997 and 2007-08, although I realise that the Government dispute that figure and say that it is actually nearer29 per cent., when education is excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07013188000683">We need to compare the settlement with the years of Conservative Government, when there were cash cuts year on year and the grant was fiddled to ensure that it went to Conservative-controlled local authorities. When the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), the Conservative spokesman, responded to my intervention, it was interesting that he gave no indication whatever that if the Conservatives were in power they would give more money to local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07013188000685">The legacy of Conservative Government remains. Local authorities with measurable needs are not yet receiving the grant agreed under the central Government formula, because the Labour Government have done what the Conservative Government did not do. The right hon.

I do not recall Conservative proposals for a floor on the amount of reduction. The Government have implemented such a floor and I very much support it, because without it local authority finances and services would be destabilised. The floor is an important part of local government.</p>

That is extremely important, particularly in SIGOMA areas. The figure is something like &#163;250 million.

That means&#163;20 million has been taken away from Wigan&#151;largely within social services. That extends right across a range of local authorities that I represent in the SIGOMA group. That means that there will be a postcode lottery for social services provision. Some social services departments will be able to provide services for free. Others will charge and others will not provide the services at all. The Minister has to address that issue when he thinks about the grant for the next three years. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07013188000689">The debate has highlighted one of the difficulties that having a three-year settlement will produce. If we have a three-year settlement and there is something wrong in the figures, local authorities have to deal with that, because it will not be sorted out over the next three years. In a spirit of helpfulness, I put it to the Minister that we should look seriously at perhaps top-slicing part of the grant to local authorities so that there is a pool of money available to central Government. That would mean that, if there were problems&#151;because of non-recognition of the indication&#151;it would be available to him to correct the anomaly. If there were no anomalies and local government was reasonably satisfied with the way in which the formula had been sorted out and with the amount of money that it was getting, that pool of money could be put back into local authorities over the following year. The proposal does not involve taking money off local authorities; it involves putting money into a pool that can be used to sort out problems, if there are any, and given back to local authorities if there are not.</p>

It would try to tackle unfairness that may get built into the system. We are talking about a hugely complex system. Figures are taken from all over. There are queries about the number of people who live in an area or the number of people who require one service or another service. It is difficult to try to project that kind of thing over a three-year period. I am just saying to the Minister that our experience over two years has shown that there is a &#163;250 million impact on SIGOMA authorities. That is greatly reducing their ability to provide social services. I am suggesting that, if that is the case the first time around, the Minister should look at the possibility of putting a pool of money aside from the grant, so that if that occurs again, it can be tackled and if it does not, the money can be put back and given to local authorities properly. That is a perfectly reasonable solution to a difficult situation.</p>

I hope that he will not only consider the future following the next round of the comprehensive spending review, but that he will have constructive dialogue with the people in charge of the PCT allocations in the Department of Health to ensure that there is a system of integration in the amount that is given, so that a local authority and PCT serving a community do not find that the amount that they should receive is reduced because of the formula that has been agreed by local and central Government.</p>

Minister would: as a boxing phrase, not a dancing phrase. The assumed inflation figure of 2.7 per cent. is not the reality for many of those councils for the reasons that we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07013188000696">The stark reality for Surrey county council, which is on the floor&#151;the boxing term&#151;is that only 15 per cent. of its &#163;640 million budget will be met by grant. Given the inflation costs that it expects to face, rather than the 2.7 per cent. figure, it reckons that it will need a tax rise of 8.6 per cent. Fortunately for council tax payers, if not necessarily service recipients, the council will reduce its budget by about &#163;11 million and, I hope, get the increase below the assumed cap of 5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07013188000697">As we have heard, social services, especially residential homes and care contracts, are the real problem. Throughout the area, we have the problem of cost shunting and high-volume output to the community from acute hospitals and primary care trusts. Most London and south-east PCTs are in deficit. Every single Surrey PCT was in deficit, and after they were combined into one PCT, all the deficits were generously combined into one very large one. We have been warned that there will be cuts. One of the difficulties is the difference between the way in which the Ministers&#146; Department and the Department of Health examine the needs indices, especially those for the elderly. Some 13 London councils&#146; PCTs are in financial deficit, so they are facing the same problem, and many councils are facing an enormous struggle. Brent council complains that cost shunting from its PCT will cost it about &#163;9 million, which represents a considerable budget shift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70131-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07013188000698">Although I have hammered on at Ministers about this over the years, the Government have only just started to learn that they should take away the leverage of central controls, targets and bureaucratic demands on local government. That is essential. One of my little councils, Mole Valley district council, has a tiny budget of about &#163;10 million. However, its last comparative performance assessment cost &#163;250,000, which, due to gearing, added &#163;1 million to the council tax. While the Government are starting to move, tricks can be carried out involving smoke and mirrors&#151;there could even be a three-card trick. Ministers talk about reducing the number of indicators from between 600 and 1,200 down to 200.</p>

The original proposal was for a local scheme with little central control, but I hope that the Minister will look at it, because it has become a monstrosity. There are 180 pages of guidance, and statutory duties and ministerial powers of intervention are to be introduced. There are 60 targets, extensive six-monthly reports on the targets to Government officers and a huge raft of bureaucratic procedures for local partners. The Minister looks a little puzzled, so I will not continue with that list, but the problem does not concern his Department alone. The Department for Education and Skills has more than 150 targets for children; the Department of Health another 100 or so for adults; the Department for Transport has its own set of targets, as does the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), who touched on one or two points that I wish to make. I shall therefore try to abbreviate my contribution accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07013188000702">May I begin by praising the work of many local authorities? Whether at parish, town, district or county level, councils often provide crucial services. They educate the young, provide care for the elderly, keep the streets clean and often help to keep our communities safe. I suspect that everyone in the Chamber has criticisms of certain decisions or oversights, but local councils employ thousands of unsung heroes who, day after day, make a real difference to our constituents&#146; lives. Local councils, however, often have to make difficult and unpopular decisions. On waste management, for example, it is local authorities that make the difficult decisions on the ground. Local government therefore deserves a financial settlement that fully reflects changing needs and rising expectations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07013188000703">As we have heard, Ministers claim that local government has received a generously funded settlement since 1997, and they cite a real-terms increase approaching 40 per cent. Once we strip out all the ring-fenced grants, not least for education, the increase is, as we heard earlier, just 14 per cent. in real terms. In other words, there has been a measly 1.5 per cent. per annum in the past nine years or so. In Hertfordshire, our general grant has increased in cash terms by 52 per cent. over the past10 years. Some 46 per cent. of that increase has been required simply to cover inflation and Whitehall-led changes in formula and functions. As a result, our councils have received only a 6 per cent. increase over10 years to cover other cost pressures, including, as we have heard, the rising burden of care for the elderly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07013188000704">At the same time, the Government have piled new statutory responsibilities on to councils, tying them up with targets and red tape. Like my hon. Friend, I looked at some of those targets. Since 1997, Ministers have, between them, generated 1,500 performance targets, 734 objectives, 273 measures, 183 aims, 66 value-for-money targets, and 11 standards of maintenance, so they have been rather busy, as we can see. The problem is that the cost resulting from all that frenetic activity has proved to be hideous, both financially and in terms of lost time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07013188000705">The background to today&#146;s financial statement is one of rising prices. The consumer prices index stands at3 per cent., and the retail prices index at 4.4 per cent., but energy costs, for example, are rising by well in excess of 10 per cent. Despite rising prices and costs, my authorities, Hertfordshire county council and East Herts district council, have been offered just 2.7 per cent. The settlement completely fails to take into account the real costs of their services. Take the county council; inflation alone will mean &#163;19 million in extra costs. A deliberate pattern has been woven into the settlement. The Government either take decisions that result in new duties for councils, or make settlements that increase their costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07013188000706">The county council has experienced a rise in landfill tax, which will cost it another &#163;1.8 million. We heard about NHS cost-shunting earlier, and the NHS is being squeezed in Hertfordshire, too, with many care costs being pushed back on to the county council. Our county hall reckons that that is another &#163;2 million in the coming year. The Government made a proud boast about concessionary fares for the elderly, but the scheme comes without full funding, a fact that we debated earlier. The result is that East Herts district council will have to find more than &#163;730,000 next year for a deal over which it has absolutely no say. Every year, both councils continue to pay for the Chancellor&#146;s decision to raid pensions by scrapping advance corporation tax relief. The result for the county authority is another &#163;1.5 million of expense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07013188000707">Sadly, the current financial settlement is a classic example of the way in which the Government treat our councils. They give them more jobs, but keep back the money. They announce generous settlements, but get council tax payers to pick up the tab. However, it is not just the Government&#146;s actions that cause problems. They have failed to acknowledge and respond to the changing social demands in our communities. On social care, for example, there is a rapid and continuous increase in the size of the elderly population. That group&#146;s needs and expectations are, of course, considerable. In Hertfordshire, the increased number of adults who need essential support is projected to add another &#163;10 million of cost, next year and every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07013188000708">Care costs are projected to increase by as much as6 per cent. per placement, due in part to new Government standards. I do not doubt that, as the Minister will claim, good intentions lie behind those standards, but I am deeply concerned that those intentions are not accompanied with the money that is needed to make them work. The irony is that good, efficient authorities do not seem to be rewarded. According to the Government, Hertfordshire county council is an efficient authority. It has exceeded its Gershon efficiency target and has made cashable savings of &#163;70 million in 10 years, and it intends to keep to the prudent path. However, because Hertfordshire is a floor authority, its ability to borrow in the way that it thinks best is severely limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07013188000709">In Hertford, the Richard Hale school has led an excellent campaign to build a desperately needed sports hall. The scheme has cross-community support and would benefit both the town and the school. Indeed, the county council would like to support it, if it could, but it tells me that because of Government rules on borrowing for floor authorities, it simply cannot help  <br>

the school next year. Its hands are tied. Where is the logic in that? Why tie the hands of good, efficient councils in that way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07013188000710">The financial settlement is part of a broader pattern. My councils have had their duties increased, and their costs have risen. Their wage bills have been increased for them, and their tax bills have been raised. At the same time, the Government have switched funds away or tied up projects in endless red tape. The result is that council tax bills have soared. Since 1997, the average council tax bill for my constituents has risen by 84 per cent., so that is an 84 per cent. increase for what is essentially the same service. This huge increase is especially unfair on those on fixed incomes, such as the elderly. They cannot hope that a pay rise will bail them out. Instead, they feel they have to cut back on other things to pay a tax that they increasingly resent. It might be their heating, or a birthday present for a grandchild. That is the price of the Government&#146;s policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70131-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07013188000711">Ministers should realise that my constituents know exactly where the blame lies. Although all councils must strive to be more efficient, the Government also have a duty to provide a fair settlement which does not switch our funds away without good reason, matches funds with new responsibilities, and does not stop good councils backing projects that are valued in the community. That is what my councils and our taxpayers are seeking, and it is what they deserve. I regret to say that that is not what the Government are delivering.</p>

Visitors, the elderly, parents with children and people with medical conditions cannot go to a public loo to spend a penny.

Solihull is destined to receive a grant allocation this year of &#163;243.79 per head of population. Next door in Birmingham, the allocation is &#163;582. That is 2.4 times as much.</p>

For every &#163;1 per head rise in Solihull, Birmingham gets &#163;17. I do not get it, and I am afraid that my constituents do not either. Can the Minister explain how anyone can work out that a borough with four of the most deprived wards in England, a disproportionate share of elderly people needing care, children to educate, social services to provide, roads to maintain, bins to empty, and so on, can do that on40 per cent. of the grant of the borough next door and only 53 per cent. of the national average?</p>

With&#163;7 million pounds of cuts to find, the days of belt tightening are over. Even by raising council tax by the maximum possible without being capped, there is no surplus fat to cut, so we are talking amputation time. Perhaps the Minister will explain to my constituents and to those who run the council just how we are to maintain our basic services; and, since we clearly cannot, who should lose out&#151;the elderly, the children with special needs, the environment, or what?

abysmal waste and systematic abandonment of vital rural services by a corrupt and failing Labour Government.

In 1996, when East Riding of Yorkshire council was formed, it had the fourth highest council tax in England. In 2006, it had fallen to 245th out of 356. It had a four star rating for benefits in the 2005 English council league, which made a real difference to those with least&#151;as, I am proud to say, Conservative councils so often do around the country. In education, the council is in the top 20 per cent. of performers.

I am delighted to share with the House the fact that this year it has been made top council in the country in terms of financial management. It has delivered the highest possible score in all areas of assessment: financial reporting, financial standing, financial management, internal control, and&#151;the issue with which I am most proud to be associated&#151;value for money. That is what Conservative leadership has delivered in the East Riding of Yorkshire. In Conservative hands, East Riding of Yorkshire council delivers the best value for money in the entire country. I know that when the electorate are given the opportunity in May, they will seek to re-elect those successful councillors and, I sincerely hope, add to them.

We have a sustained assault by Labour on rural NHS beds, with a proposal to close every single one in my constituency. If the primary care trust&#146;s preferred option goes through, the nearest NHS beds for intermediate care of the elderly will be based in Goole and Bridlington&#151;an hour and a half&#146;s drive away from where people live in villages around Withernsea, Hornsea and Beverley. That is just one way, so we are talking about a return trip of three to four hours&#151;if, of course, people have a car in the drive, but Withernsea is one of the poorest areas in the East Riding of Yorkshire and one of the poorest in the country. It is going to lose every NHS bed and I pay tribute to the GP surgery, which has been fighting against the cut imposed by the PCT appointed by the Secretary of State.</p>

not be applied through the local government settlement. In the past, Croydon was slow in lobbying the Government about the area cost adjustment, and the way in which it affected different boroughs in London. Croydon ended up being in the other outer-London group when a west London group was set up. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) is in the Chamber, I pay tribute to the London borough of Sutton, which was rather more adept at lobbying on the issue than Croydon. The cost to Croydon has been &#163;15 million a year in grant over the three-year period. I very much hope that the settlement working group work programme will consider closely the issue of area cost adjustment geography, which has a real impact on the allocation of moneys to a place such as Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para5"><a name="070131106000007">For many London boroughs, certain issues are particularly challenging. In my earlier intervention on concessionary fares, I mentioned that the demands on Croydon are increasing by &#163;862,000 a year, which is an 8.3 per cent. increase. I should have said that that is before the impact of any changes to the national scheme in future years. Because of migration issues, Croydon faces particular problems in relation to asylum and its costs. We face a shortfall of &#163;4 million in that area, as well as a shortfall of &#163;3.8 million in the area of learning disability. We also face challenges in dealing with the issue of single status, as do other local authorities. Following approaches from boroughs, the Minister&#146;s Department has agreed that there should be a capitalisation of many of those costs. Within the limited amount of overall capitalisation allowed across the country, however, it is likely that there will be little real impact on the extra provision and flexibility allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para6"><a name="070131106000008">I am aware that we are tight on time, so I shall speak for just one more minute. I should like to return to the issue of asylum seekers and its effect on the budget of the London borough of Croydon. While strenuous efforts are made by Croydon and other London councils to alleviate the burden placed on them by the cost of asylum, several areas still need to be addressed. Thereis a lack of overall financial provision for post-16 to18 age groups. Even where there is such provision, payments are not made within a reasonable period. That has been addressed by the Home Office for 2006-07, but outstanding issues in prior years remain, going back to 2002-03. I am sure that almost all Members would regard that as an unsatisfactory approach. The funding methodology used by the Department for Education and Skills is even more bizarre. Shortfalls go back to 2004-05, which must make planning very difficult for councils, quite apart from the impact on cash-flow management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para7"><a name="070131106000009">There is also a failure to address the support needs of asylum seekers with special needs&#151;both while they are awaiting determination of their asylum applications and following a negative decision&#151;as well as the support needs of others who are subject to immigration control and have no other recourse to public funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para8"><a name="070131106000010">I have exceeded my minute. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that he is listening to Croydon&#146;s case, which I think has been put in a rational and constructive fashion. The borough faces real challenges: for instance, it receives &#163;40 million less per resident than Ealing.</p>

We ought to be concerned about changes considered during the period of a multi-year settlement that will have an impact on boroughs&#146; finances without any reassessment of the financial effect of that settlement. For example, a 5 per cent. cut in the housing benefit cap for private sector leasing exclusively in London in 2007-08 would have a very negative impact. It has been estimated that it would cost Croydon &#163;73,000 per year, and the effect on several other London boroughs would probably be even more severe. In a year when the Minister is trying to convey the message that stability is what he seeks, that strikes me as a contradictory approach. There is also consternation about the cost of proposals to change the payment profiles of formula grant and national non-domestic rate. That change will probably cost my borough a further &#163;70,000 a year, and it too strikes me as unnecessary in the context of a three-year settlement.</p>

In my opinion it is closely related to south-west London authorities such as Sutton, and should not be isolated in the outer-London group.

The relevant sum for Richmond is &#163;127 per head in 2006-07, which is &#163;57 lower than that for the next lowest borough in London, and it will be &#163;60 lower for 2007-08 because, as I said in an intervention, Richmond&#146;s budget will be cut in the 2007-08 round. In saying &#147;cut&#148; I am using exactly the standard that the Minister asked for: comparing on a like-with-like basis year on year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para14"><a name="070131106000021">The Minister said, &#147;You must look back over a 10-year period&#148;, but 10 years ago the base for Richmond was wrong. What was a small number then has become magnified year on year to a number today which I believe even he and his senior officials would recognise is totally out of kilter. Although Richmond is different from other boroughs in that it is well-to-do, it is not that different from neighbouring boroughs. That number is now completely disproportionate in comparison with those for other boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para15"><a name="070131106000022">For Richmond, only 19 per cent. of local council expenditure comes from grant. It has a very high council tax to deal with that situation, but it is also the lowest spending authority in London&#151;it has the lowest expenditure per head. That demonstrates that it is a borough with no fat to cut, and with the additional burdens that have been described as a result of NHS cost shunting, adult care costs and special needs for young children, the pressures are becoming intolerable.  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para16"><a name="070131106000023">Both Richmond and Kingston, the two boroughs that I know best, have a reputation for doing very well for children with special needs. Obviously, the education budget is picked up within the schools budget, but the care that such children need comes along with that, and the responsibility falls on the local authorities. We have good anecdotal evidence&#151;we do not yet have hard survey evidence&#151;that, because their reputation is so good, people are moving to the borough to take advantage of such care, thereby throwing more and more cost on to the local authorities. In Kingston, the same thing is certainly happening with social care. Frankly, the boroughs&#146; needs are therefore acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para17"><a name="070131106000024">In the last minute that I shall take, I want to make a special plea for the south-west London boroughs as a whole. I ask the Minister to meet them collectively to look at their problems. The amount of revenue support grant that they receive collectively is far lower than that received by others. Only 35 per cent. of their collective expenditure is funded by grant, and they collect over &#163;100 million more in business rates than is returned to them. Kingston, for example, pays far more in business rates&#151;some &#163;67 million a year&#151;than is recovered in various grants collectively, which is about &#163;32 million. The resource allocation has become completely out of kilter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para18"><a name="070131106000025">When I raised this issue in an intervention, the Minister smiled and with a slight snicker mentioned that Richmond upon Thames has developed a car parking charging regime to hit gas guzzlers, thereby implying, as many do, that it is a leafy, wealthy suburb. The elderly in our boroughs need care just as much as the elderly in any other. Children with special needs in our boroughs need care just as much as those in any other. The attitude that such places are leafy suburbs and should therefore only provide&#151;that their needs do not have to be taken into consideration&#151;is generally unacceptable. It has begun to irritate people beyond the point of tolerance to hear those sentiments constantly expressed. I thank the Minister for listening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70131-0018.htm_para19"><a name="070131106000027">I want to begin by painting the bigger picture. Underlying this debate has been the assumption that the Government&#146;s grant settlement should fully fund the inflationary pressures on local government. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) said that the settlement should fully reflect changing needs and demands. Of course, that is a desirable wish list, but the difficulty that the Government would have under any circumstances, were that approach to be accepted, is that it would simply fuel the very inflationary demands that councils face. One cannot possibly base a local government finance system that has distributed more than &#163;60 billion on that premise.</p>

non-schools funding. If one takes into account the full grant allocation, the figure is 29 per cent. in real terms. Of course, one can always make use of statistics, and the LGA acknowledges that this is an above-inflation figure. However, the social care issues that have been raised are of course extremely important.</p>

Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said that the council tax would go up as a result of home improvements, of having a nice view and of living in a nice area. Let me try again to scotch this rumour. Council tax, like the rates before it, is a value-based tax, so it is already inherent within it that, where there is a relative advantage in property value, a higher tax band rate is paid, other things being equal. There are no plans to change that, despite the excellent cost-saving computer that the Valuation Office Agency has. In Northern Ireland, another scaremongering story is put about. The changes there were instigated by the Northern Ireland Executive, not the Government, and are bringing Northern Ireland from a rental-based system of property tax to a capital-based one. It is indeed Northern Ireland that is following England, rather than the other way around.</p>

In fact, it was an independent report that was, on the whole, dismissed by the Executive within minutes of being published, at least as far as the point systems were concerned. He tried&#151;as have others&#151;to paint the picture that the concessionary fares system is unfunded, but he cannot have his cake and eat it, as much as he tries. He cannot say that we should move towards less ring-fencing&#151;a policy that we support&#151;and then argue that specific grants should match pound for pound. It is not the Government who set the bus fare, but the bus company. Local authorities asked for a formula-based distribution of funding and we provided &#163;350 million. None of the councils thatwere positive winners as a result&#151;which included the councils of those hon. Members who mentioned this issue&#151;said at the time that they did not like that distribution. The fact is that the Government have now provided another &#163;250 million for a nationwide scheme.</p>

Previous answers to my parliamentary questions have shown that we keep detailed records about those who served and their length of service, although pay records are destroyed after seven years so it would be difficult to ascertain some of the facts, but we should try to address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para19"><a name="070131106000060">It is true that veterans with nine or more years&#146; service were paid a gratuity in lieu of further entitlements, which would naturally have to be factored into the calculation and would reduce the amount of pension paid. However, to be candid, at a time when we seem determined to build a replacement for the Trident system, with an estimated cost of anything between&#163;16 billion and &#163;70 billion, we should recast our priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para20"><a name="070131106000061">It is often said that the mark of a civilised society is how it treats its elderly. I have never heard it said that the mark of a civilised society is that it should spend huge sums of money on weapons of mass destruction. In the 1970s when the Government spent billions on the Chevaline nuclear upgrade system, many people probably thought that with the cold war in full swing it was money well spent, but now we are faced with a more complex world, and we should behave differently in response to it. The morale of our forces would be boosted tremendously by the knowledge that we were prepared to look favourably on their forebears&#146; claims. Many servicemen and women have older relativeswho could benefit from a service pension; it would be phase 2 of a Labour Government delivering for our armed forces.</p>

Perhaps the most significant is that this Labour Government introduced the pension credit, which has lifted many poor pensioners out of poverty. I bet that many of those to whom the pension credit has been paid are veterans, who because of the parsimony of earlier Governments may have worked for a generation in the forces with nothing to show for it in their later years. If the campaign succeeded, there is no doubt that the structure of the pension credit would mean that veterans who received a service pension on the one hand would lose pension credit on the other. However, I know which I would prefer&#151;not a means-tested benefit that required much form filling, information gathering and perhaps even a loss of pride, but an as-of-right pension in recognition of service rendered.</p>

that that eventuality would come to pass. But when we are told that members of the armed forces are just like any other public sector work force, I seriously question that. Were all public sector workers asked to take an oath to say that they would lay down their lives in the course of duty? No, they were not. The armed forces were treated differently then and they should be treated differently now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para24"><a name="070131106000065">Another excuse that has been thrown back in the faces of veterans in the course of the campaign is that they should have known all along that their terms and conditions did not allow for a pension when their service was less than 22 years. Indeed they did not. However, the terms and conditions were changed beneficially for many of those people by a Labour Government in 1975. Of course, when changes are introduced there is always a publicity campaign, but I suspect that one could easily wonder how effective the campaign was in the forces at that time. It has been alleged to me that many of the veterans who make up the group of people who were coming close to 22 years&#146; service in 1974-75 were shunted out of the forces on all sorts of pretexts so that they would not qualify. They were encouraged to leave, while dissemination of information on personnel issues was not always efficient or accurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para25"><a name="070131106000066">I wonder how many men and women walked away with exemplary certificates of discharge, where the reason for discharge was &#147;premature voluntary release&#148; &#151;after being pressurised to go. Those people may have been led to believe that their service would contribute towards a pension. I have in my possession a copy of a Royal Marines certificate of discharge, dated 6 June 1972, which tells the recipient that he has accumulated </p>
<a name="70131-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="070131106000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;five years and 218 days towards pension.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para26"><a name="070131106000067">That was on the piece of paper that the discharged serviceman left with. It is misleading and inaccurate, as far as it goes. He may not have thought any more of it until he came to collect his pension and found that there was nothing there to collect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para27"><a name="070131106000068">I do not blame the Labour Government for the way in which they handled the matter in 1975. They acted in the better interests of working people, in the way they thought that they could afford to at the time. However, what I am saying now is that we have to revisit the issue, otherwise it will go away only when all the veterans that we are talking about are dead&#151;and many have died already. Let us remember that we are still talking about veterans of the second world war, Korea, Suez, Palestine and many other conflicts around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para28"><a name="070131106000069">What am I asking the Government to do? Revisiting the issue means that the Secretary of State for Defence should meet a representative delegation of those affected. It means the Government should say what they think some kind of recompense would cost. It means acknowledging that these veterans do have a grievance and it means that they will no longer, as they see it themselves, be forgotten heroes. At every Remembrance Sunday service we say,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para29"><a name="070131106000070">and, &#147;We will remember them,&#148; and we do. Now, in the democracy&#151;the wealthy democracy&#151;that those people died for, let us also remember those who have grown old.</p>

Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) has done well to secure a debate on equal pension provision for service personnel, regardless of when they served in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. Although the subject of British armed forces pensions has a long history that stretches back to the time of Elizabeth I, it is better that I start nearer the present day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para32"><a name="070131106000075">In the early 1970s, the Ministry of Defence introduced an armed forces pension scheme following the introduction of the military salary in 1970, which replaced the system of basic pay and allowances. The military salary meant that the MOD could link pensions to pay for the first time, and in April 1972, representative pay rates were introduced on which pensions for members of the armed forces pension scheme were based. That meant that under that scheme, members of the armed forces with the same rank and same number of years&#146; reckonable service were awarded the same pension, regardless of their actual pay on leaving service. Those pension arrangements are actually made up of three separate schemes that were established under a range of prerogative and statutory powers. The current arrangements are found in the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions (Non-Effective Benefits and Family Pensions) Order 2001, the Army Pensions Warrant 1977 and the Queen&#146;s regulations for the Royal Air Force. The enabling legislative powers are to be found respectively in the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions Act 1865, the Pensions and Yeomanry Pay Act 1884 and the Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para33"><a name="070131106000076">In the early 1970s, members of the schemes were awarded a pension only if they had completed at least 16 years&#146; reckonable service as an officer, or 22 years&#146; reckonable service in another rank. Engagements for shorter periods were on non-pensionable terms. However, gratuities were awarded to those who left without qualifying for a pension, but who had completed nine years&#146; reckonable service as an officer, or 12 years&#146; reckonable service in another rank. The definition of reckonable service is all paid service after the age of 21 for officers, or after the age of 18 for other ranks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para34"><a name="070131106000077">Before the introduction of the Social SecurityAct 1973, there were no rights to preserved pensions in any public or private pension schemes. Most schemes had very restricted qualifying criteria for the award of pensions. For instance, to qualify for a pension under  <br>

the civil service arrangements, an individual had to be over 50 and to have served for 10 or more years. Individuals who left voluntarily before meeting both these criteria lost their rights to pensions. The 1973 Act brought about changes by requiring all pension schemes to preserve pension rights for those who left service after 6 April 1975 and had completed at least five years&#146; qualifying service and attained the age of 26. Subsequent Social Security Acts reduced the qualifying period from five years to two years and removed the age qualification requirement. The armed forces pension scheme incorporated those changes from the operative date of 6 April 1975. It is for that reason, and to differentiate that scheme from the new pension scheme introduced in 2005, that we now call the scheme AFPS 75.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para35"><a name="070131106000078">As my hon. Friend said, those changes were not retrospective. It is a legal principle that individuals receive benefits in accordance with the scheme rules that were in place at the time of their retirement. It is a principle of public service pensions policy, and one that has been upheld by successive Governments, that improvements to pension schemes are not made retrospective. If the changes were made retrospective, it would add significantly to the cost to the taxpayer, not least because the issue is common to other public service schemes, not just that for the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para36"><a name="070131106000079">My hon. Friend asks me to differentiate between members of the armed forces and others who serve as public servants, such as teachers and members of the emergency services, but that would be a legally untenable position. He also asked me to estimate the costs involved. We have not made a specific estimate of the cost of backdating armed forces preserved pensions to prior to 1975, and my hon. Friend alluded to some of the difficulties that would prevent us from achieving that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70131-0019.htm_para37"><a name="070131106000080">We have made a general examination, and the numbers affected are very large, so the costs, whether for the armed forces or more widely, would be considerable and would run into billions of pounds.

We value their contribution in many other ways, but I have set out the context in which judgments have to be made. I urge my hon. Friend to accept that his campaign would not apply to the armed forces alone, and it would have to apply to all public sector schemes. The costs for the armed forces would be prohibitive, and the wider costs, too, would be of considerable magnitude and would be simply unaffordable.</p>

Government could afford the many billions of pounds that would need to be found to address the issue. That is an easy statement to make, but the real test is the legal one. The issue has been legally tested, and a claim for pre-1975 pension entitlement for the armed forces failed in the High Court in 2003, in the House of Lords in 2004, and in the European Court of Human Rights in 2006. There are other legacy issues, in addition to the pre-1975 pension entitlement that arose from Government economic policies and other improvements to AFPS 75, which did not cover those who served before the changes were made. Issues such as pension troughs, widows&#146; and widowers&#146; pensions for life, widows&#146; post-retirement entitlement, and widows&#146; third-rate and half-rate pensions are not unique to the armed forces, as there is a read-across to other public sector schemes. As I have said, making retrospective changes to pension schemes would have financial implications across the wider public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70131-0020.htm_para1"><a name="070131106000085">My hon. Friend said that we are proposing to spend money on nuclear defence, and I accept that that is the case. He urged us not to spend that money and to give it to the pensioners instead. Everyone wants a say in how that money is spent but, interestingly, when the public considered the matter, it wanted to retain the country&#146;s nuclear defences. They will have another opportunity to consider the issue as the debate develops in the coming weeks before we make a decision. It is easy for my hon. Friend to make that equation, but he would have to queue up with everyone else who is campaigning for us not to go down that road and who has their own ideas about how that money should be disbursed. He should take into account, too, the public mood on that specific aspect of our national defence. I suspect, however, that we will find ourselves on different sides of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70131-0020.htm_para2"><a name="070131106000086">Since the 1970s there have been a number of improvements to pension provisions. For example, since the mid-1980s, individuals have had to serve for only two years to be entitled to preserved pension benefits and, from 1978, widows&#146; pension provisions were extended to widowers. AFPS 75 incorporated those improvements to the spirit and letter of the legislation that required their introduction. The Government recognise the importance of proper pension provision for the armed forces. Since 2000, attributable death benefits for widows and widowers have continued on remarriage. Since March 2003, pension benefits have been made available to eligible unmarried partners for service deaths related to conflict. In September 2003, the concession was extended to cover deaths attributable to service. Since April 2005, death-in-service lump sums have risen to three or four times pensionable salary, depending on whether the member belonged to AFPS 75 or the newly introduced armed forces pension scheme 2005.</p>

The scheme benefits compare favourably with other public service schemes and with schemes in the private sector. They reflect modern best practice and provide for a significant increase in family benefits. I am confident that our new schemes are designed to meet the needs of the armed forces in the 21st century.</p>

We have to set the arguments that he advances against the major developments that the Government brought about to improve the pensions of those who serve in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, but I set out to explain the reason for the current position and to put it in context. I fully recognise that my hon.

We must consider the considerable progress made in the way in which we look after people. As my hon. Friend generally recognised, there was a change for the better in 1975.
