 May I apologise to the House and to my hon. Friend for having to table that question? For three years many other passengers and I have been trying to get Network Rail and Virgin to take away the netting on the station. At present there are 40 dead birds decomposing on the netting. The starlings and pigeons get in and cannot get out. At this time of year, they are being roasted to death.

 My hon. Friend is a great advocate for the west coast main line development and takes a great interest in all the happenings at Carlisle station, including those involving birds. The situation is clearly unacceptable. Network Rail and Virgin are working together and hope to do something about it later this year. It is possible that something could be done to remove the dead birds and deal with the netting and access in future, but it is a particularly difficult area to deal with because of the nature of the station. Hopefully, action can be taken in August to resolve the problem.</p>

May I press him about the overall principle of his policy? I heard what he said to the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy), but is he still planning a major single pilot project of his proposed national satellite-based road pricing system in an area such as Greater Manchester, the west midlands or Bristol in about 2010?

 I tested the thesis that the hon.

The Manchester authorities are pressing forward on the detail of their proposed bid, which they aim to get to the Department by about next July with a view to the Department having reached a conclusion by the following December. Equally, we are already in close dialogue with the west midlands authorities, and we have made it clear to them that they need to come forward with specific proposals for the west midlands. The pilots will, of course, inform our thinking on national road pricing. We want to see them implemented by the earliest possible time scale, which will probably be four to five years.

 In order to change a route or a timetable, a bus operator must give 56 days&#146; notice to the traffic commissioner and the local authority.

We must acknowledge that the challenge that we now face on the railways is that of success. More people want to use them, with significantly increased passenger usage in recent years. Few solutions to capacity do not involve a sustained commitment of public investment. It is incumbent on parties that raise capacity to commit themselves to the amount of funding to which Labour Members remain committed.</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend has a long history of direct action, although I would not recommend that he engage in such action on the railways now or in the years to come. However, he makes a fair point. Notwithstanding the significant uplift in passenger numbers in recent years, the Transport Committee has identified a genuine problem with the complexity of fares. When one considers, for example, the discount airline carriers, one realises that it is possible to have variable fares and simplicity for the customer. That is why it is important both that the Government reflect on the Transport Committee&#146;s report and, more directly, that the train operating companies recognise that they have a responsibility to tackle the problem, which is a genuine concern for passengers.</p>

 The Government break no promises. We are delivering sustained improvements in the area around the A5 at Hinckley. There are safety problems on that road&#151;that is why such a list of improvements has been made to it. On a major scheme such as dualling the A5, I advise the hon.

 The Minister has rightly given the House a long list of works scheduled to take place on the A5.

 Humility prevented my hon. Friend from mentioning his own role in that campaign. He is absolutely right; it will provide a much-needed improvement. It has been included in the regional funding allocation, and that is because local people made the case locally to ensure that we received the necessary advice about the importance of the scheme. The advice that I would offer to Members on both sides of the House is that, if they want to influence major projects such as these, they should become active in their own region and their own local community to ensure that the regional funding advice that the Government receive reflects the true priorities of the local people.</p>

There is no speed limit; nor is there any proper visible traffic calming. The Highways Agency has refused to contemplate imposing a speed limit or laying a quieter road surface.

 Does not the Minister recognise that the Barker <i> v.</i> Corus case, which she mentions, was brought by the Government and therefore that she is seeking to overturn with that amendment what the Government argued for in court?

Many victims of this crippling disease still cannot trace an employer or an insurer, so they will not be able to make a claim at the moment. Will she examine my new clause 6 to the Compensation Bill and the proposals of the Association of British Insurers and others to consider whether it is feasible to set up an independent body to assess claims and pay out compensation speedily to all those who contracted mesothelioma in the workplace, and then to recover the money from all those who should, in fairness, share liability?</p>

Will my right hon. and learned Friend elaborate on any plans that the Department might have to roll the provision out further and to invest in more facilities throughout the court system?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. In the past, no one was surprised that many domestic violence cases did not stay the course. Abused wives and girlfriends did not give evidence because that meant that they had to sit in the court waiting area, opposite the defendant and all his friends and relatives. The introduction of proper facilities for victims and witnesses is long overdue, especially as they are often intimidated. We are therefore planning to roll out the provision across England and Wales.</p>

 My hon. Friend will know that we are consulting on how to ensure not only that justice is done in family courts, but that it is seen to be done.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if she will make a statement, pursuant to her written statement of 6 July, on the timetable for implementing the national recommendations contained in the joint inquiry into the position of learning disabled services at Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust by the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection.</p>

<p><a name="st_o111"><a name="06071145000155"><a name="60711-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="06071145000478"><b>The Secretary of State for Health (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</b>
 Let me begin by apologising, on behalf of the NHS, to the vulnerable people in east Cornwall who have suffered from individual and institutional abuse, and to their families, who have shared their distress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06071145000156">As I told the House in my written statement on  6 July, the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection recently published a report of their investigation into abuse at the Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust. I fully accept the conclusions and recommendations of their report, and have already agreed to the immediate application of special measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06071145000157">The failings identified by the two commissions are horrifying. People with learning disabilities are entitled to be treated with the same dignity and respect as every other member of the community. Abuse of those particularly vulnerable people is absolutely unacceptable and I am determined both that matters should be put right in Cornwall and that lessons should be learned nationwide, where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06071145000158">In 2001, our White Paper &#147;Valuing People&#148; set out the principles of rights, independence, choice and inclusion for people with learning disabilities. Had those principles been followed in practice in Cornwall, then of course the abuse would never have happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06071145000159">Action has already been taken in Cornwall. An external team was appointed in October 2005 to start improving services. Disciplinary action was initiated against seven members of staff, five of whom have been dismissed. More than 200 community care assessments have now been completed for everyone using the trust&#146;s services. However, more is still required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06071145000160">The special measures now being taken include an external independent review of the board&#146;s membership and workings. They also require the external team to remain in place in the trust for a further 12 months to oversee the necessary transformation of the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06071145000161">It is not only Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust that needs to take action. The North and East Cornwall primary care trust is shortly to be joined with the West of Cornwall and Central Cornwall PCTs to become the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly PCT. Along with Cornwall county council, those PCTs are responsible, as commissioners of the services involved, for ensuring the highest possible standards of care. They signally failed to do that.</p>

The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill is currently going through Parliament, and will assist in responding to the national recommendations for safeguarding vulnerable adults. In particular, it will ensure that unsuitable people are not employed by the NHS in future. We have also issued statutory guidance to directors of adult social services, stressing their responsibility for ensuring that local arrangements for safeguarding vulnerable adults are working effectively. We will have further discussions with the Healthcare Commission and CSCI to ensure that, if necessary, regulatory arrangements are strengthened so that that learning disability services are properly inspected everywhere in future.</p>

While thanking those staff for the services they provide, I underline to the House our determination to take the necessary steps, both locally in Cornwall and nationally, on the basis of the reports that have been presented.</p>

 Has the Secretary of State assessed how many NHS bodies will be affected by the national recommendations contained in the report? How long will they take to implement? What proportion of those providing services for the learning disabled are currently not in compliance with the recommendations?

Despite existing budgetary pressures, both Cornwall county council and the primary care trust are facing additional unanticipated expenditure of roughly &#163;2 million each this financial year.</p>

Does she agree that that points to failings in the inspection system that are not covered in the report&#146;s recommendations? They must be urgently addressed.

 Order. We have to bear it in mind that the House has other business. I agree that this is an important matter&#151; I would not have agreed to the urgent question otherwise. However, if there are any other supplementary questions, the hon. Lady must write to the Secretary of State.</p>

 On the first group of questions that the hon. Lady asked, the Healthcare Commission said that it believed that the situation was unusual&#151;not only in relation to the extent of the outrageous abuse that was taking place, but in the sense that, although the NHS trust claimed to be offering treatment and assessment services, it was actually providing something in the nature of a long-stay residential home that, if it was going to provide services, should have been registered with CSCI. We will not know until we have conducted the national audit whether there are other organisations in that unusual position or others not in compliance with the national recommendations. At this stage, we have no reason whatsoever to think that the situation in Cornwall is replicated in large numbers of organisations in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06071145000179">The hon. Lady asked why the failings were not picked up earlier in inspections by either the Healthcare Commission or CSCI. That matter is addressed, in part, in the report of the two organisations. In part, there is the rather unusual structure of the trust and the fact that, after the earlier merger of the provider trusts, responsibility for learning disability services was not passed to the social services department of the county council, as it was in most other parts of the country. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health will discuss that matter further with the two commissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06071145000180">As for why the management failings went unnoticed and the complaints in 2001 and 2003 were so inadequately dealt with, that comes down to issues about board governance. In line with the Healthcare Commission recommendation, we will now review that matter by means of the external independent review of the board&#146;s operation that we will be commissioning very shortly.</p>

 The police are involved in looking at the cases. The cases of 40 vulnerable adults have now been referred to the team responsible for protecting vulnerable adults. The police are part of that team and therefore they will make the necessary investigations.

 I share the Secretary of State&#146;s sense of concern and outrage at the extent of the abuse disclosed at the Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust, particularly given that in so many places across the country&#151;such as Meldreth Manor in my constituency, where Scope is looking after young people with profound learning disabilities&#151;such considerable care and quality of care is given to those with learning disabilities. She responded to a number of questions. The report made some particular recommendations that bear on the national circumstances and were designed not simply to buttress the process of inspection and the audit that is to come next year, to which she referred, but to try to build some of the principles of valuing people into the care that is given to those with learning disabilities. May I just ask a few questions about those?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06071145000184">First, one of the things that are rather disturbing is quite how far away from home people with learning disabilities live, which is on average 74 miles, but in some cases up to 300 miles. What steps can be taken soon to try to reduce how far people with learning disabilities are from home?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para21"><a name="06071145000185">Secondly, the debate on the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill has disclosed that whereas it was originally intended that the IMPACT computer system to enable the exchange of data between agencies would be in place by 2007, it will not be in place in full until 2010. Will the Secretary of State say whether she, or indeed the Home Office, which leads on this, will be able to improve on that, because the delay might have serious implications?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para22"><a name="06071145000186">Thirdly, one of the important recommendations in &#147;Valuing People&#148; back in March 2001 was that everyone with a learning disability should have received a</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para24"><a name="06071145000188">Finally, a recommendation in the latest report was that the supported living fund should be paid to individuals and managed locally. The Secretary of State said that she accepted all the recommendations, but that had no timetable attached to it. Will she thus attach a timetable to that important recommendation as well?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about the distance that many people with learning disabilities live away from home. That is very much a matter for commissioners. As primary care trusts and social services authorities review services, in accordance with the White Paper principles, they should take that into account. In some cases, there might be good reasons why people are living a considerable distance from home&#151;for instance, so that they can get the services that they need&#151;but clearly being so far away from their home and family is likely to increase their vulnerability to poor services, or even abuse. I would expect commissioners to take that issue into account when considering whether more services need to be provided locally for this particular group of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60711-0004.htm_para25"><a name="06071145000190">The hon. Gentleman asks about the exchange of data between agencies. I am aware that there are various difficulties in ensuring that the barriers to  <br>

I would add to that the work that we are already doing following the January White Paper on extending individual budgets and direct payments, which is already giving many adults with learning disabilities much more choice about, and control over, where they live, what kind of support services they have, and who provides those services. Those features were almost wholly absent from the experiences of the people in Cornwall. All those issues and others will be considered in more detail by the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who will be leading a high-level group in the Department of Health to ensure that the recommendations are implemented and that we follow up to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>

 We must all be concerned when we become aware of widespread institutional abuse. Part of the problem was that the Healthcare Commission realised that it had to involve CSCI. Does the Secretary of State agree that the sooner the two bodies are merged, the better, so that other people will not fall through the gaps in inspection? Does she also agree that it would probably be a good idea to increase the number of unannounced inspections because that could more easily pick up some of these problems? Most importantly, will she ensure that those who are accused of malpractice are not placed in a situation in which they are investigating themselves, because that happens far too frequently?</p>

 We have announced our intention to merge the Healthcare Commission and CSCI by 2008. In the meantime, however, the two organisations are working together much more closely, and we will continue to ensure that they do so in anticipation of the merger and, indeed, even before that takes place. The hon. Lady is quite right about the desirability of unannounced inspections. As the Healthcare Commission and CSCI operate on the principle of better regulation, they have already ensured that their inspections are based on a proper risk assessment, complemented by both random and unannounced inspections to pick up problems.</p>

When they are investigated internally, that should be done by someone who is not implicated in the matters to which the complaint relates. As for ensuring that proper attention is given to complaints even from a single user or family, we have already taken steps to strengthen the NHS complaints procedure. From my own constituency experience, I have been impressed by CSCI&#146;s response to concerns&#151;for example, about the treatment of a vulnerable elderly person&#151;raised by one family, and by the way in which it has looked at the situation in the care home or whatever is the subject of complaint. We certainly need to ensure that the voice of the most vulnerable people in our community is heard by the staff who look after them, by the board responsible for the organisation that employs those staff, by commissioning organisations and by the regulators. As Members of Parliament, we can assist with that process, but we must ensure, too, that the regulatory and complaints system is as it should be, and that is what we are doing.</p>

 People both inside and outside the House will be shocked by those appalling events, none more so than people in Cornwall. While there were terrible shortcomings at a local level, the Minister will accept that the inspection regime, which should have guaranteed that those individuals&#146; interests were well protected, failed. Can she confirm that there will be an immediate step up in unannounced inspections so that that can never happen again for such a long time without it being picked up? Finally, will she reflect on the fact that while appalling events have taken place, nationally and, indeed, in Cornwall, many people caring for individuals with learning disabilities do not treat their patients that way. An enormous amount of good work is done by many people, not least in the NHS in Cornwall, but they may believe that their efforts are unappreciated.</p>

 I have made it clear that the Healthcare Commission and CSCI, in particular, have changed their inspection regime, both to ensure that they look at organisations when there is reason to believe that people may be at risk and to use unannounced inspections. In Cornwall, the problem was not an absence of unannounced inspections but the fact that the inspections did not look at what was happening in learning disability services, partly because of a curious arrangement for services provided in what appeared to be a health service establishment. The regulators are looking at that problem. As for the excellent services provided by many staff and organisations in different parts of the country, I entirely concur with the hon. Gentleman and stressed that point earlier.</p>

 Further to the Secretary of State&#146;s comments on the good work that is being done, many families in Cornwall who have experienced the care provided by the trust are far more positive about smaller establishments.

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. In its report the Healthcare Commission stressed that most of the staff to whom it talked were warm, kind and committed to doing their best for the people in their care, but did not have the training, support and the proper systems in place to enable them to do that. Of course, it is a central principle of good care for vulnerable people that they and their families are fully consulted about any changes that may need to be made in the services that are provided. That is part of the purpose of the care assessments that have already taken place.</p>

<h3 align="center">Energy Review</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="60711-0005.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06071145000352"><h5 align="left">3.55 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o127"><a name="06071145000201"><a name="60711-0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="06071145000494"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 With your permission,  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the energy review which was announced by the Prime Minister last November. Today I am publishing a report setting out the conclusions of that review. Copies will available in the Vote Office in the usual way. The report is extensive, and of necessity my statement has to cover proposals in some detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para1"><a name="06071145000202">We face two major long-term challenges&#151;first, along with other countries, to tackle climate change and the need to cut damaging carbon emissions, and secondly, to deliver secure supplies of cleaner energy at affordable prices. Increasingly, we will come to depend upon imported gas and oil as our own plentiful but harder to exploit North sea oil reserves decline. The proposals that I am announcing set out our approach to meeting our energy needs over the next 30 to 40 years. Many of the proposals contained in the report will need further consultation. Thereafter, the Government intend to publish a White Paper around the turn of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para2"><a name="06071145000203">The starting point for reducing carbon emissions must be to save energy. If we are to meet our goals of a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, we need not just to reduce carbon intensity through low energy sources such as renewables, but also to save energy. We therefore make a number of proposals to encourage greater energy efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06071145000204">For consumers, we need better information about the amount of energy used, smart metering, real-time energy use displays, better and clearer energy bills, and more information for new buyers and tenants on energy efficiency in homes. It is estimated that leaving electric appliances on standby uses about 7 per cent. of all electricity generated in the UK, so we will work with industry and others to improve the efficiency of domestic appliances and to phase out inefficient goods, thus limiting the amount of standby energy wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para4"><a name="06071145000205">We also propose a range of measures to take us towards a long-term goal of carbon-neutral developments. New homes can use around a quarter of the energy to heat, compared with the average home. We aim to make the Government estate carbon- neutral by 2012. We will also provide strong support for the use of on-site electricity generation, such as solar panels. Energy efficiency will help people on low incomes especially. The review sets out our approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para5"><a name="06071145000206">If we are to make a real difference to reducing energy demand, we need a radically different approach. We need a stronger obligation on energy companies to provide energy saving measures and a radical plan to change the way in which they sell their services. Yes, we will encourage Britain&#146;s 27 million homes to become more energy efficient, but it is also essential that we incentivise Britain&#146;s big six energy suppliers to work with homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient. Today, companies have the incentive to sell as much as they can. Instead, we need to give energy producers incentives to make homes more energy efficient and to sell them more insulation products. We are consulting on the most effective way of doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para6"><a name="06071145000207">The European Union emissions trading scheme, which covers 11,000 high intensity users of energy, and the climate change levy are key to encourage businesses such as power stations or steelworks to save energy and to cut emissions, but there are in addition around 5,000 large businesses and public services in the UK that are not covered by the scheme. We want to reduce energy inefficiency for those companies too. One supermarket chain in the UK alone is one of the biggest single users of energy in the country. Those businesses should be incentivised to reduce their emissions, so we shall consult on a proposal for an emissions trading scheme for them, along with other options to cut the amount of carbon produced&#151;something they support. That makes economic and environmental sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para7"><a name="06071145000208">Saving energy in businesses and homes is essential, but so too is the need to cut emissions from road transport. Fuel efficiency in transport continues to improve. We will encourage the use of lower carbon fuels, especially biofuels, and there will be more cost-effective opportunities to save carbon as new technologies are developed. Company car tax and vehicle excise duty have been reformed to encourage energy efficiency, and we will continue to press the European Union to consider the inclusion of surface transport in the emissions trading scheme as well as aviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para8"><a name="06071145000209">Last November, we announced the renewable transport fuel obligation&#151;5 per cent. of all fuels to be from renewable sources by 2010. Today, we propose that that obligation, after consultation, should be extended after 2010, provided that some important conditions are met. That could provide a further carbon reduction of 2 million tonnes, which is equivalent to taking another million cars off the road, once it is fully implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para9"><a name="06071145000210">Providing the right incentives to reduce energy is critical, but we also need to do more to make the energy that we use cleaner. We have a number of proposals. Most of our electricity is generated in large power stations, and around three quarters of our heat comes from gas fed through a national network, which delivers economies of scale, safety and&#151;crucially&#151;reliability. However, the Government believe that we can do more to encourage the generation of electricity on a smaller scale near to where it is used. Today, less than 0.5 per cent. of our electricity comes from microgeneration, while combined heat and power provides about 7 per cent. We need to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para10"><a name="06071145000211">There are technical and other obstacles to overcome, but we want to remove barriers to the development of what is known as distributed generation. We can do more to make microgeneration more attractive and to make it easier to set up combined heat and power schemes. The Government believe that this is a major opportunity for the United Kingdom to invest in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies. The environmental transformation fund, which was announced recently, will provide investment for energy funding services. Details of the scale and scope of that fund will be announced in the spending review in 2008. We will also encourage low carbon alternatives such as biomass, solar and heat pumps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para11"><a name="06071145000212">Over the next two decades, it is likely that we will need substantial new electricity generation capacity as power stations, principally coal and nuclear plants, reach the end of their lives&#151;their output is equivalent  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 July 2006">

to about a third of today&#146;s generating capacity. Power stations are long-term investments, and we need to implement the right framework to incentivise investment decisions to limit carbon emissions. We remain committed to carbon pricing in the UK through the operation of the emissions trading scheme, and it is essential that there is a carbon price to encourage us to use less of it. Today, around 90 per cent. of the UK&#146;s energy needs are met by fossil fuels, so we need to do more to encourage the renewable generation of electricity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para12"><a name="06071145000213">The renewable obligation is key to support the expansion of renewables. It has resulted in major developments, particularly in onshore wind power generation, landfill gas and the use of biomass in coal stations. Far from getting rid of the renewables obligation, as some have proposed, we intend to increase it from 15 to 20 per cent. We also want to give a boost to offshore wind energy generation and other emerging technologies&#151;for example, tidal&#151;to encourage growth. We will consult on banding the obligations to encourage those developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para13"><a name="06071145000214">The Government also see a continuing role for both gas and coal-fired generation. We will convene a coal forum to bring together UK coal producers and suppliers to help them find solutions to some of the long-term problems of UK coal-fired power generation and UK coal production. Coal-fired generation continues to meet around one third of electricity demand, and last winter it met as much as half, which shows the important role that coal can play in UK energy security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para14"><a name="06071145000215">If coal-fired generation is to have a long-term future, however, we need to tackle its heavy carbon emissions. Carbon capture and storage could cut emissions by 80 to 90 per cent., and we have some natural and commercial advantages such as a strong oil industry and old oil fields where CO2 can be stored. The next step is a commercial demonstration, if the technology proves to be cost-effective. We are working with the Norwegian Government and the industry on development, and a further announcement will be made in the pre-Budget report. Carbon capture could lead to our saving several million tonnes of carbon by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para15"><a name="06071145000216">The Government believe that a mix of energy supply remains essential and that we should not be over-dependent on one source, which is especially true if we are to maintain security of supply in the future. We will continue to do everything that we can to promote more open and competitive markets, which is why we are backing the Commission in securing the effective implementation of the energy market. We will also take steps to secure gas supplies, maximising the exploitation of oil and gas from the UK continental shelf. Last month, we saw a record number of applications for further development in the North sea. We also need to facilitate the construction of sufficient storage and import infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para16"><a name="06071145000217">Against a background where Britain&#146;s nuclear power stations are ageing, decisions will have to be taken on their replacement in the next few years. If we do nothing, the proportion of electricity generated by nuclear could fall from just under 20 per cent. today to just 6 per cent. in 15 years&#146; time. Moreover, nuclear has  <br>

provided much of the electricity base load, contributing to consistency of supply as well as security of supply. While some of that capacity can and should be replaced by renewables, it is more likely than not that some of it will be replaced by gas, which would increasingly have to be imported. The Government have concluded that new nuclear power stations could make a significant contribution to meeting our energy policy goals. It will be for the private sector to initiate, fund, construct and operate new nuclear plants and cover the cost of decommissioning and their full share of long-term waste management costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para17"><a name="06071145000218">The review makes a number of proposals to address barriers to new build, and the Health and Safety Executive is developing guidance for providers of new stations. For nuclear new build, considerations of safety and security will be paramount, as they are now. We are setting out a proposed framework for the way in which the relevant issues on nuclear should be handled in the planning process, and we will consult on that before the publication of the White Paper. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management&#151;CoRWM&#151;published its interim recommendations in April, confirming its preference for geological disposal of nuclear waste. The committee is to be congratulated on the open and transparent way in which it has conducted its work and the broad consensus that it has developed for securing the future long-term management of the UK&#146;s nuclear waste. It will publish its final report this month, and the Government will respond thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06071145000219">If we are to see any of these developments, whether they be renewables or conventional power stations, we believe that we need to change the planning laws in this country. We will work with the devolved Administrations to ensure that we have an effective planning regime. We can make some changes now&#151;for example, bringing together the planning process and consents on the Electricity Act 1989&#151;but the Government believe that the current planning regime needs fundamental reform, and we will consult on proposals to do that later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para19"><a name="06071145000220">The proposals that I have set out will result in a reduction of between 19 million and 25 million tonnes of carbon by 2020, over and above the measures already announced in the climate change review programme. We are on course to achieve real progress in cutting emissions by 2020 and on the right path to attaining our goal of cutting the UK&#146;s carbon emissions by 60 per cent. by about 2050. The proposals will help us to meet our twin objectives of tackling climate change and providing security of supply. The scale of the challenge is great. The proposals show how we can overcome them to secure our prosperity and the health of our planet. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="60711-0005.htm_para25"><a name="06071145000229">We proposed a tougher carbon regime to tackle emissions; a capacity payment scheme to build security; a long-term framework to encourage investment, and a change in market structures to encourage decentralised energy and efficiency measures. Those combined proposals will spark a green revolution and guarantee reductions in carbon emissions. Almost everybody, even Stephen Hale, who used to be special adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, welcomed our proposals.</p>

Does not the Secretary of State believe, like us, that political consensus is essential if we are to build the climate for investment in the energy sector that is badly needed?

In particular, he refers to renewable generation in the north of Scotland. Perhaps he will have a word with those Liberal Democrat Members who say that they are in favour of renewable energy and then object to wind farms when they are planned, and object to the power lines to take electricity from wind farms to where it is needed. If the Liberals are serious about those things, they must face up to the difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions, as well as the populist decisions that he set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="60711-0006.htm_para20"><a name="06071145000260">When the hon.

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on delivering a measured statement this afternoon. Will he clarify, however, the point in paragraph 49 of his statement that nuclear generators will be required to pay their full share of long-term waste management costs? Does that mean 100 per cent. of waste management costs, and how can we guarantee that, as we do not yet know what the waste management costs will be?</p>

 I hope that the House will be given an early opportunity to debate the report at great length, as it relates to a very complex subject. In deference to your ruling, Mr. Speaker, I shall concentrate on one issue. Does the Secretary of State understand that while his analysis of valuing carbon is very good, his policy conclusions are, I fear, inadequate? He clings to the climate change levy and complex climate change agreements, which do nothing for the long-term market-based costing of carbon emissions and he invests too much hope in the EU emissions trading scheme. I do not believe that he is creating the stable market for carbon that will bring forward investment in clean-coal technology, renewables or, indeed, new nuclear power stations.</p>

 The EU emissions trading scheme is, at the moment, the only scheme, so I believe that we should invest substantial time and effort on trying to make it work. Given the nature of the problems that we have to deal with, it is important that any action is Europe-wide. I know that the hon. Gentleman has only recently got a copy of our proposals, but the Government have made it clear that they believe that there must be a long-term carbon price; otherwise, investors cannot make a sensible decision about whether to go ahead with proposals for new plant.</p>

Britain can not only benefit itself from this technology, but benefit other parts of the world such as India and China, where they are building coal-fired power stations. Unless we take steps to capture that carbon, those power stations will be extremely damaging to the environment.</p>

 My hon. Friend is quite right that coal has made a substantial contribution. We relied on it very heavily last winter. The model we have in mind is similar to the system set up to bring together the oil industry and the Government, which is known as &#147;pilot&#148; and has been working quite well since 1998. That arrangement allows both sides of industry, suppliers and producers, to talk to each other and to the Government. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy will be happy to meet hon. Members who have coal mines in their constituencies and have further discussions with them. It is important to do whatever we can to encourage the coal industry and the point about carbon capture is equally important if we are to remove the harmful effects of CO2.</p>

 Without that generation it would certainly make it more difficult to meet that commitment, which is why I believe that nuclear should be part of the mix. The Government are not specifying that people should come forward with proposals for nuclear, but we have tried to set a framework&#151;we have started the process today&#151;that will encourage generators to consider that option. Nuclear does mean that we can generate electricity without carbon emissions and it has the further advantage that I mentioned earlier of providing a consistency or base load in electricity that wind power, by its very nature, cannot provide.</p>

Nuclear power is far more expensive and hopelessly uneconomic. Decommissioning costs are enormous. There are mountains of nuclear waste, which we do not know where to put, and it will increase our risk of terrorism&#151;</p>

Generators, looking at what the Government policy is, at the carbon price and at the prospects in relation to fuel and so on, will form a judgment on whether or not it is economic to build a nuclear power station, the life of which might be 20 or 40 years. The generators say to us, &#147;You set out the framework, so that we can make these plans. You tell us what the parameters are.&#148; The Government are not going to build a nuclear power station or, indeed, any other sort of power station.

That will be warmly welcomed in Wrexham and by Sharp, which manufactures solar panels. Some  &#163;50 million was made available by my right hon.

 I noticed that the e-mail from the hon. Member for New Forest, West said that wind power did not get a good review. He obviously had the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) in mind. I am well aware that many people find offshore wind farms visually intrusive and fishermen have expressed concerns. However, it is possible to reach a compromise on all those matters. I visited a wind farm off the north Kent coast this morning. It generates a substantial amount of electricity, enough for about 100,000 houses. The hon. Gentleman perhaps illustrates the problem that, whatever form of generation we decide on, there will always be people prepared to object to it.

<a name="ordayhd_2"><a name="60711-0008.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06071151000115"><h5 align="left">4.57 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o202"><a name="06071151000006"><a name="60711-0008.htm_spmin0"><a name="06071151000119"><b>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
 Tax credits today provide support to 20 million people, including 6 million families and 10.1 million children. Tax credits take-up is at unprecedented levels, with  93 per cent. of families on incomes below &#163;10,000 claiming their entitlement to the child tax credit. That compares with the 57 per cent. take-up in the first year of family credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para0"><a name="06071151000007">Tax credits have improved work incentives, reduced the tax burden on low-to middle-income families, and helped to reduce child poverty dramatically. Tax credits and economic stability have helped to increase the number of people in work by more than 2 million since spring 1997, and since 1997, long-term unemployment has been reduced by 450,000. Tax credits have also ensured that the Government have implemented our commitment to ensure that work pays over welfare. For example, the changes that we are making mean that, from October 2006, a couple with two children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &#163;41 per week better off in work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para1"><a name="06071151000008">The tax credit system has also played a key role in tackling child poverty. Since 1996-97, 700,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, whereas child poverty had doubled in the previous 20 years. In addition, there are now more than 1.8 million fewer children in absolute poverty, before housing costs are taken into account, than was the case in 1996-97.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para2"><a name="06071151000009">A figure of &#163;2.2 billion is often referred to for adjustments leading to overpayments, with the suggestion that that represents the amount lost to the Exchequer. However, that total includes moneys that have been recovered or are still to be recovered. Once error, fraud and adjustments leading to overpayment are taken into account, the net total estimated not to be recovered for 2003-04 is between &#163;1.24 billion and &#163;1.74 billion, as reported to the House in the documents that have been laid before the House today. That figure takes into account Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs estimates of claimant error and fraud through the random inquiry programme, and which are being published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06071151000010">I remind the House that those figures relate to three years ago, when claimants were unfamiliar with the new rules and processes and the Inland Revenue was experiencing initial IT problems. The HMRC is today publishing a detailed account of what it is doing, and will do, to tackle error and fraud in tax credits, setting out the detailed programme of action that is in place to ensure that claimants receive the tax credits to which they are entitled, at the right time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06071151000011">To help reduce claimant error, the HMRC is pursuing a number of measures, such as targeted advertising, including the current campaign to encourage claimants to renew their tax credit claim in good time, an improved claim form to reduce claimant error and redesigned award notices that include a clearer summary of the tax credit award and how it has been calculated. The HMRC is improving the information given with award notices&#151;for example, by providing a ready reckoner&#151;and improving access to contact centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06071151000012">Identity theft is a serious and growing problem for the United Kingdom. It is increasingly linked to organised crime and is the source of significant amounts of financial fraud in both the public and private sectors. The Home Office estimates that the cost of identity fraud is &#163;1.7 billion a year, of which tax credit-related fraud is a small proportion. A separate statement will be issued today announcing that Sir James Crosby is to head a public-private forum on identity to explore issues relating to identity management and associated technologies. Our aim is to do everything that we can, at all levels, to prevent identity fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06071151000013">To tackle fraud, the HMRC is pursuing a range of measures, which include further refining of its risk assessment, putting compliance specialists in contact centres and increasing pre-payment checks on claims where fraud or non-compliance is suspected. In addition, the HMRC will continue to use the information it holds, as well as data held by other Departments and third parties, to support and enhance its compliance operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06071151000016">About 6 million families claim tax credits, at a cost of about &#163;16 billion a year, which is equivalent to 5p in the pound on the standard rate of income tax. As we pointed out in our recent Opposition-inspired debate on the subject, according to the latest available figures about 2 million families were overpaid, while just under 1 million families were underpaid, so nearly half of all payments in the system were wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06071151000017">According to the figures in the statement, more than &#163;1.2 billion a year is going astray in error and fraud. Is not it embarrassing beyond belief that the Treasury&#151;of all Departments&#151;has to have the accounts of one its principal arms qualified by the National Audit Office because it has failed to control fraud and error in a system that the Chancellor personally introduced? Given that situation, I have four specific points to put the Paymaster General. First, when did she realise the true scale of fraud in the tax credits system? She announced last December that she was closing the e-portal because of fraud via the tax credits website, but the amount concerned was miniscule compared with today&#146;s figures. When did she really know how bad the problem was and why has the Treasury not done more actively to combat it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06071151000018">Secondly, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who is in his place, previously warned publicly that the system was open to fraud and recommended additional counter-fraud measures, but, as he knows and has put on the record, they were not adopted. Will the Paymaster General confirm that although the fraud now appears to be much greater than previously admitted, the Government&#146;s recent response has been to reduce the number of qualified  <br>

anti-fraud officers within the anti-fraud compliance organisation and to replace them with less qualified administrative staff? I have here a copy of an internal HMRC plan to do exactly that. It is entitled, &#147;Claimant Compliance Restructuring Project&#148; and it was recently leaked to my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon). It confirms the plan in considerable detail. How on earth does it make sense to let go experienced anti-fraud officers, most of whom recover many times their own salary, when the degree of fraud in the system appears to be spiralling out of control?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06071151000019">Thirdly, will the Paymaster General now concede that the current tax credits system is increasingly discredited and urgently needs to be reformed? When the House debated the problems with the system in our Opposition day debate on 7 June, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is in his place, called for a consensus across the House on the operation of tax credits. We remember it well. As part of that, given the scale of the fraud and error that has been revealed today, will Ministers finally admit that the current system is now discredited and has to be reformed, as we on these Benches have argued for quite some time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06071151000020">Fourthly, although we welcome the presence of the Chancellor this afternoon, why did he not deliver the statement to the House? Tax credits are his personal creation, but for the past year he has not answered a single oral question about them. When will the Chancellor stand at the Dispatch Box and explain why his overcomplicated and increasingly discredited system is now causing so much misery to exactly the low-income families that it was introduced to help in the first place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para13"><a name="06071151000021">Today&#146;s figures relate only to 2003-04 and we are now in financial year 2006-07, so we suspect that the problem of fraud in the tax credits system remains much greater than the Government are currently willing to admit. Indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General says in his accompanying report, which was published today:</p>
<a name="60711-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="06071151000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is currently no evidence to justify a lower estimate for 2005-06. Consequently I have qualified my opinion on the Trust statement.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06071151000022">If it proves to be the case that the fraud and error on this scale continues to persist at these levels, or if it transpires that the right hon. Lady knew about all of this much earlier than she is letting on, her position must surely become untenable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06071151000023">The Prime Minister told the House a few weeks ago at Prime Minister&#146;s questions that the working families tax credit was working well. The Working families tax credit was abolished three years ago. The Chancellor has created a system that is so complicated that even the Prime Minister does not understand it. The Chancellor is the real culprit in this whole fiasco. The Paymaster General mentioned 1997. The Labour manifesto in that year said:</p>
<a name="60711-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="06071151000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we must crack down on dishonesty in the benefit system.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para16"><a name="06071151000024">This is not a crackdown; it is a meltdown&#151;and it is the Chancellor&#146;s personal meltdown. It is he, more than anyone else, who has let down low-income families and it is he who should ultimately be held to account for this fiasco.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman clearly has not read the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s report. I will address each of his points in turn, but I also say to him that there are 6 million families&#151;10 million children&#151;in the tax credits system. Progress is being made on reducing child poverty, which increased and doubled under family credit and his Government. We are helping 6 million families, while his Government helped 600,000&#151;there is no comparison. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away from the fact that his party is not committed to eradicating child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06071151000026">Let us deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. First, I remind him that since 1997, the number of families with children paying no net tax has risen from just fewer than 2.5 million to more than 3 million in 2006-07, which is a result of tax credits and benefits reform. On the point about error and fraud in the system, regrettably, most of the error is on behalf of the claimant&#151;we must remember that this is the first year. The figures on error and fraud in tax credits that were published today show an incident range of 8.8 to 10.6 per cent. The range for the working families tax credit was 10 to 14 per cent., while the figure for jobseeker&#146;s allowance was 13.2 per cent. The figure for income support was 9.2 per cent. Those are based on figures from when the Government first collated data on a comparable basis. The hon. Gentleman is simply not concentrating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para18"><a name="06071151000027">The hon. Gentleman asked about the e-portal. I refer him to paragraphs 2.31 and 2.33 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&#146;s report. That report clearly sets out the period of the attack on the portal and confirms the information that has been repeatedly provided to the House. The hon. Gentleman also said that staff are being cut, but there is absolutely no substantiation of that point. In fact, in paragraph 2.27, the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the fact that more staff are being employed in tax credit compliance, not fewer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="60711-0008.htm_para19"><a name="06071151000028">The hon. Gentleman referred to reform. We know the reform that the official Opposition wish to undertake&#151;they want to undermine tax credits and, if they ever get the chance, to abolish them. That is the message to take out to tens of thousands of families in every constituency in the country. The hon. Gentleman should read the report before he stands up and makes accusations.</p>

Will she break down the causes of overpayment into those that are the responsibility of the HMRC and those that are the responsibility of the claimants?</p>

We now have the base year for figures, and there must be improvement and development on those figures.

 Is not the truth that we have just heard an extraordinarily complacent statement from a Minister in denial about a system that is clearly in a mess? A moment ago, the Paymaster General referred to the National Audit Office report. I am delighted that she has read it, because she did not refer to it or any of the information that it cites in her statement. Can she confirm some facts that were not in her statement? The original estimate for fraud for the first year of operation was &#163;460 million, but it may now be as high as &#163;1.28 billion. Will she confirm that the figure for the second year of the operation of the system is expected to be as high again? She suggested that fraud is falling, but will she confirm that it is likely to rise in the system and that, in the past year alone, &#163;131 million was lost to organised fraud by criminal gangs? Can she confirm that tax credit fraud and error account for more fraud and error than any other benefit and that the error and fraud rates in tax credits are higher than in any other welfare benefit? Can she confirm, too, something that her Department has clearly told the Comptroller and Auditor General, but not the House? For the third year of operation, the Department expects overpayment on tax credits of  &#163;1.8 billion, and it estimates that there will be overpayments of &#163;5.8 billion in the first three years, and &#163;2.4 billion in fraud. Can she confirm those figures, which she left out of her statement?</p>

Members want the system to work rather than abolish it, but the Government&#146;s complacency about fraud, error and overpayment is undermining the very system designed to help people on low incomes, and has affected people on lower incomes in particular.

 The hon. Gentleman never misses an opportunity to try to spread innuendo and undermine the tax credits system. If he read paragraph 2.28 of the report, he would see, far from his accusation that the compliance strategy is not working, that the Comptroller and Auditor General details the amount that was prevented from going to people who made fraudulent attempts to claim tax credits. It shows that the HMRC prevented payments of &#163;447 million, so the majority of attempts were dealt with. The hon.

 The fraud figure is &#163;70 million. That is the figure that is in the report, and the hon. Gentleman will know that because I expect that he has taken the time to read it. He is trying to blur the lines. The fact is that, when compared with the comparable figures for the first year of operation of the working families tax credit, income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance, the fraud and error rates for tax credits are better, although of course they have to be improved. He mentioned the rate of 3.4 per cent., but he knows full well that that was an interim figure that was given with huge health warnings pointing out that the exercise was only 30 per cent. complete and that it would be necessary to wait for the full figures. The full figures are now here, and the facts are before the House.</p>

 Did the Paymaster General by any chance watch &#147;Doctor Who&#148; on Saturday? If she did, she might understand why her statement today reminds me of a cyberman coming, appropriately, through a portal from a parallel universe and insisting that its purpose was to upgrade humanity to achieve perfection. I freely acknowledge that the tax credit system has done much good, but in the universe in which I live, I hear of another case of despair and misery caused by the malfunctions in the system virtually every day.

 I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 24, to debate an important matter that requires specific and urgent consideration, namely,</p>
<a name="60711-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="06071151000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">the extradition treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para0"><a name="06071151000078">The Prime Minister&#146;s defence of this lop-sided treaty in the House last week posed more questions than it answered. The British people simply do not understand why we are stringently enforcing a treaty that has still not been ratified in Washington, why three British citizens will be extradited on Thursday when our own judicial authorities saw no reason to prosecute them here in Britain, and why there appears to be such an imbalance between the minimal information required to extradite a UK citizen to the US and the more substantive justification required to extradite US citizens to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06071151000079">This is an issue of overwhelming public interest, yet it has been a real struggle to get the Government to acknowledge its significance. A letter placed in the Library of the House last month reveals that the extradition treaty was not even raised during the last visit of the US Secretary of State to the UK at the end of March, despite the then Foreign Secretary&#146;s assurances on 21 March that he would write to her prior to her visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06071151000080">This comes at a time when extradition from the US to the UK has dropped from six cases in 2003, before the Extradition Act 2003 came into force, to two last year. Extradition from the UK to the US, however, has more than doubled to 13 cases. The treaty was negotiated in secret and was granted only cursory scrutiny in the House in December 2003, when the only Members who signalled their objections were my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) and my hon. Friends the Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Southport (Dr. Pugh). I am sure that the House will wish to applaud their foresight. There is now a strong feeling on both sides of the House that we should make up for the absence of scrutiny then with a full debate in the House today, not least in view of the controversy surrounding the fate of the three former NatWest employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06071151000081">I understand from contacts with US officials that there is some disagreement over whether the terms of the treaty are reciprocal. Even if there is a debate to be had on those legal details, it is difficult to understand why the Government should enact such important legislation without also exercising the political pressure in Washington, which is only this week belatedly being brought to bear, to encourage the US Congress to enact its side of the bargain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06071151000082">In keeping with Standing Order No. 24, I hope that I have demonstrated that this is a specific and important matter that merits the full and urgent attention of the House.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On behalf of Back Benchers, may I have your support in relation to our next item of business, which is the discussion of the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s annual report? As at 11 o&#146;clock today, the Government&#146;s response to the report was not available in the Vote Office. I do not regard that as dealing from the top of the pack. The notion that we have simultaneously discussed the report and the response is a fiction. It is only by accident that I know of the existence of the response. I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that very few Back Benchers and just a few Opposition Privy Councillors are aware that it was available, yet history will show that, apparently, we took its contents into account this afternoon.

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06071151000091">In introducing the Bill, I seek to remove an inequity that can see, and has seen, blameless people being held liable for damages, following accidents that no person could have prevented. Members will know that there are very few strict liability offences under English law&#151;when an instance occurs, it is overwhelmingly so that people can mitigate the case against them by showing that they took all reasonable steps to avoid an incident taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06071151000092">Further, in English criminal law, a guilty action amounts to an offence only if the person involved has a guilty mind&#151;in legal speak, mens rea&#151;meaning that the person must have had intent to cause the incident or must have been reckless as to its likely occurrence. That, I am sure, is how the House would want the situation to be, under both the civil and criminal law. The alternative&#151;that one can be held liable for an event about which one knew nothing, and, indeed, that one had taken all reasonable steps to prevent&#151;is a chilling scenario, much more suited to the worst totalitarian states than to democracies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06071151000093">On 12 April 2006, the Court of Appeal held that absolute offences, which may subject a person to conviction and punishment in circumstances where he had done nothing wrong, may well be an infringement of his human rights. Yet there are one or two provisions in English law that can lead to that very situation, and it is one of those that my Bill seeks to address today. It exists in section 2 of the Animals Act 1971.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06071151000094">The wording of the Act, as might be expected, is a little tortuous and unclear, but it seems to suggest that the owner of an animal is always liable for damages if that animal is involved in an accident, regardless of the steps taken to avoid such an accident happening. Although the Act is somewhat ambiguous to a layman, it was interpreted in the House of Lords to mean precisely that&#151;that someone can be held liable in all such cases. In the case of Mirvahedy <i> v.</i> Henley in March 2003, the House of Lords held the defendants liable for damages for injuries caused to a motorist, Hossein Mirvahedy, in an accident after their horse had escaped from a field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06071151000095">I do not for one moment make light of the serious injuries sustained by Mr. Mirvahedy, who was a blameless individual whose misfortune it was to be involved in the accident. Nor do I say that, in all circumstances, animal owners should be relieved of all responsibility for their animals&#151;not at all, as there may well be cases where they are liable&#151;but I do question how any reasonable  <br>

person could attach blame to Mr. and Mrs. Henley when they had taken all reasonable steps to avoid such an incident occurring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06071151000096">If that iniquity is not removed, the knock-on effect could be considerable. For example, given the new right to roam, would farmers be responsible for any accident that resulted from one of their sheep escaping on to a road if a rambler had crossed the farmer&#146;s field and left a gate open? Following the House of Lords ruling, presumably they would be held responsible, yet that would be manifestly unfair. What exactly is the farmer expected to do in those circumstances?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06071151000097">Let us take the case of riding schools, which are a source of much enjoyment to people of all ages, especially children. If a horse escapes from a secure field, which horses do, and causes an accident, is the owner to be liable for damages even though there are no steps that he could reasonably have been expected to take to avoid such an occurrence? If a horse bolts when startled by a loud and sudden noise close to it, is the owner of the animal equally held liable for any damage? Again, apparently, yes: the owner of the horse would, following the House of Lords ruling, be liable. We could then reach the situation where riding schools close down, which benefits nobody, unless they can afford the increasingly expensive insurance polices that would cover them against such damage&#151;policies that will surely become even more expensive following the ruling. We could reach a situation whereby farmers, who are struggling financially in any case, decide that it simply is not worth it any more. Where would we be then?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06071151000098">Surely the best way to avoid those undesirable outcomes is to amend the Animals Act in that respect, which is what I seek to do. I should therefore like to insert a new clause into the Act, which states:</p>
<a name="60711-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="06071151000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It shall be a defence to any action brought under this Act for the keeper of the animal to show that he took all reasonable care in the circumstances to avoid any accident or incident occurring, or damage being caused to a Third Party or their property&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06071151000099">I am hopeful of making some progress because the Government are sympathetic to what I am saying. I tabled a parliamentary question in April, and the response from the Minister was as follows:</p>
<a name="60711-0010.htm_brev3"><a name="06071151000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Animals Act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances. This appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allow for a general defence of reasonable care.

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60711-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06071151000101">The Bill has support from Members of four political parties, and I am grateful to Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Democratic Unionist Members for their enthusiastic support.

Our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and their families, and I am sure that I speak on behalf of the whole House when I say that we stand united with India, as the world&#146;s largest democracy, through our shared values and shared determination, to defeat terrorism in all its forms.</p>

It is also fitting to thank, on behalf of the Government, the members of the Intelligence and Security Committee and its Chairman, my right hon.

 I am just about to answer those points. If the second point is true, I certainly would be not only surprised, but deeply disappointed, and I undertake to look into it. I am not quite sure about my hon. Friend&#146;s reference to the utility player, but I play the role of Jamie Carragher. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what I take to be an accolade. I deeply regret it if that material was not available to hon. Members through some fault in the arrangements.

Suffice it to say that the Government very much welcome the Committee&#146;s report and particularly the recognition it pays to the efforts that have been made to build counter-terrorist capacity since 9/11. Each agency has received additional funding and is undergoing expansion and modernisation. We have tried to respond in the document that we issued today&#151;or rather ought to have issued and made available to hon. Members today&#151;to the Committee&#146;s main points and recommendations, including some worries that it has expressed about certain things.</p>

Similarly, we welcome the Committee&#146;s view that, despite the diversion of efforts in the wake of the July bombings, the agencies have continued essential work on all fronts. Although we rightly concentrate on counter-terrorism, we should never forget the importance of the agencies&#146; work on, for example, espionage, counter-proliferation and serious crime. Indeed, the Committee&#146;s report makes it clear that the agencies are being both adaptive and innovative in dealing with the challenges that they face in what the Committee rightly describes as difficult times. In the context of such challenging times, I want to say a few words on the nature of intelligence, rather than to repeat what is in the Government&#146;s document.</p>

said and written about that attack continues to show, at best, a rather over-simplistic understanding of the nature of intelligence. It is absolutely crucial that we understand and convey to others the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the nature of intelligence, so that we can have a more informed dialogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06071165000015">Of course we should expect, and we receive, 100 per cent. commitment and 100 per cent. effort from the men and women in the intelligence and security agencies and from the police. Although there may be 100 per cent. commitment and 100 per cent. professionalism and dedication, there can never be a 100 per cent. guarantee that we can prevent every terrorist attack. Intelligence work is not an exact science; it is an activity that is conducted by human beings and that is concerned with the possible actions of human beings and, however perverted or misguided they may be, with their motivations and actions. Whatever the success in importing technology or scientific methodology, it can never therefore attain the predictability of a physical science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06071165000016">Moreover, whether it comes from agent reporting or the interception of communications or from other types of surveillance, intelligence information is invariably fragmentary and partial, rather than a complete picture. It is information that is generally acquired against the wishes and usually without the knowledge of targets, and a complex combination of analysis, evaluation and validation is invariably required to make sense of it. Those difficulties were highlighted in the Government&#146;s response to the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s report on the London terrorist attacks on 7 July 2005.</p>

One such lesson about intelligence and the communication of intelligence to the public was to do with threat levels; I dealt with that yesterday. Another related to the difficulties and shortcomings in terms of co-ordination across services. That was always the case, but co-ordination is now more imperative than ever because it is increasingly the case that there is a seamless web of terrorism that must be addressed across domestic, foreign and defence policies. Some operational lessons have also been learned. However, although we have learned some lessons, we will continue to learn.

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06071165000020">The hon. Gentleman referred to Mohammad Siddique Khan. On the information that I have as someone who is not an intelligence practitioner but who has some familiarity with that world, my judgment is that at the time when the intelligence service was looking into him as a shaded identity&#151;he was known as a character on the fringes of a specifically directed investigation into others&#151;he was peripheral to the inquiry in question. So far as I am aware, the information that we had on him at the time&#151;without the benefit of hindsight&#151;indicated a wish to participate abroad in some form of unspecified action but did not indicate a wish, a desire, a motivation or a plan to take part in any action in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06071165000021">The judgment was made to pursue the main characters in the operation, and not to pursue a number of contacts who were regarded as peripheral. He was one of them, but there were several others. When the ISC looked into this, it came to the conclusion that the decision taken was&#151;I think that this was the word it used&#151;an understandable judgment. Of course, with hindsight&#151;which all of us are now blessed with&#151;we would have identified among the peripheral characters the two whom we now know were connected with 7/7. But, as I have said, that judgment is reached with the benefit of hindsight.</p>

 As the Home Secretary has just said, hindsight is a wonderful thing. But let me explain one of the problems that the security services&#151;and, indeed, ourselves&#151;have been coping with since 7 July. The so-called responsible press&#151;I am not talking about the red tops&#151;continually speculate and pick up little points, and then move on from that to come to conclusions. We have tried to put them to bed in the report, but the difficulty is that there have been occasions, one of which occurred two or three weeks ago, when the press were actually told that what they were about to print was untrue. But, of course, that spoiled the story, and it concerned Siddique Khan. I hope that the Home Secretary will condemn the press for that, as I do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06071165000023">There are two consequences of that action. The lesser of them is that the security services and the police, who are working very hard to try to solve such situations, get rather downcast about lies coming out in responsible newspapers. But much more important are the families, who get upset, and who believe as a result of what they read that perhaps the tragedy that affected them could have been avoided, when those of us who have spent the whole year looking into the matter know that it could not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06071165000025">As the right hon. Gentleman said, there were two stories about Mohammad Siddique Khan. One was that he had been refused entry to the United States, and that our agencies had been informed of that as far back as 2003. The FBI has denied that categorically. Another was that a tracking device was put on his car before 7/7. That was, I think, specifically denied by the security services, but the newspaper involved&#151;a broadsheet&#151;went ahead and printed. There have been several other such stories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06071165000026">The right hon. Gentleman is right. Our concern should be to reach out to the families involved, and such stories cause them a lot of unnecessary agitation and grieving.</p>

 Before the Home Secretary moves off the question of the lessons learned from last year&#146;s bombings, are there any lessons to be learned about the level of resources that our intelligence services have, both in terms of the finances available to them and the number of staff that they have? Is he satisfied that they are currently working to the right level of resources?</p>

 Yes, I think that there are lessons to be learned. The resources have been increased, fourfold on the policing side of counter-terrorism. They have also doubled in terms of counter-terrorism and resilience from around &#163;900 million to almost &#163;2 billion. In December, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that a further &#163;85 million would be given, and in the past few days an additional &#163;34 million and &#163;5 million have been allocated. The security services have needed more resources and if asked, they would say&#151;I can speak with particular detail only for MI5, but I think this is also the case in terms of other agencies&#151;that in financial terms they have got everything that they have asked for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="60711-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06071165000029">What is more difficult is converting the financial resources into capabilities in terms of manpower, because it takes time to recruit individuals from certain backgrounds, and to train people in languages such as Arabic and in other things. The hon. Gentleman is undoubtedly right that the demands on our intelligence services in terms of numbers and capabilities are greater than ever but, by and large&#151;certainly with MI5, and certainly for other organisations on the figures available, with a fourfold spending increase on policing&#151;requests for resources have been met when asked for.</p>

 Yes, I think that there is a need for co-ordination&#151;and as we have approached that seamless web that I mentioned earlier, there has been closer co-ordination. There is a chain of command. There is now a co-ordinator, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, who is in fact answerable to me&#151;although, of course, also to the Prime Minister. The co-ordinator operates out of the Cabinet Office precisely because he brings together MI5, MI6, GCHQ and defence. The hon. Gentleman asks for co-ordination; that is why we appointed a co-ordinator, and Sir Richard Mottram does that job very well.</p>

 A large number of things have been done on the basis of the Butler report&#146;s recommendations.

My personal opinion is that, the minute that one puts intelligence into the public domain, an associated problem arises. The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) would be the first to demand the intelligence basis for any assertions that I made. I would then put that intelligence into the public domain to encourage him to trust me. If I put it into the public domain in its raw form, that would put at risk the operations and sources from which it came. If, however, I modified it, he would then accuse me of producing dodgy intelligence. If I said, &#147;Better not to do it,&#148; he would then accuse me of covering up.</p>

The ISC is independent of government. Although it is made up of Members of this House, even the most sceptical observer would not refer to everyone on it as an undying friend of the Labour Government, so a degree of independence can be attributed to the ISC. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</p>

As I will say later, I believe that, because of the nature of intelligence, the ISC has a particular role to play. But there is also a particular obligation on us to be more scrutinising and self-critical inside this community than we would be in any other area, precisely because there is not that external validation of what we say. For instance, if the hon. Gentleman listens carefully to what I have to say on 7/7, he will realise that we have scrutinised these matters over the past period, particularly the narrative that we put into the public domain. We did that with one eye to saying that, if we find anything wrong after the public&#146;s questioning and probing of that narrative, we will report that to the House and to the families concerned.

However, do not all the indications&#151;including the latest, obscene video that appeared last week&#151;now clearly show that Khan did have links with the international terrorist network and that the visits to Pakistan were not for holiday purposes?

In the case of intelligence on international terrorism, one example is the CONTEST strategy, which was published yesterday. At both tactical and strategic level, each piece of intelligence has to be constantly re-examined in the light of new information. That process goes on continuously, but normally, as I was saying to the hon. Member for Lewes, within the closed world of intelligence agency business. That is why we value so much the work of the ISC, an external and independent body whose aim is to provide maximum scrutiny, and which concluded that the 7/7 bombings could not have been prevented. But it is also why we&#151;the Government, the agencies involved and those outside, and particularly those within, the intelligence and security community&#151;should be prepared continually to scrutinise our methods, facts and conclusions.</p>

In that context, I tell the House tonight that, at the end of last week, I was told that a discrepancy had indeed come to light. The official account that we provided to the House states that the train on which the bombers travelled left Luton station at 7.40 am. The police have now told us that that is incorrect&#151;the train in fact left Luton station at 7.25 am. It did, however, arrive at Kings Cross at 8.23 am, as recorded in the official account. Although that does not appear to affect anything else in the official account, it is nevertheless an error, which is why I report it to the House. I can understand why this may be of concern to some. I have asked the police, as Members would expect, for a full report on how that discrepancy came about.

That is a fuller description of the process of constructing an assessment of threat and intelligence than would normally be gained from some reports in some of our popular press or from novels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06071165000048">That is the nature of the task that we set the dedicated and talented people who serve in our intelligence services. The most remarkable thing is that, more often than not, they succeed against all the odds in putting together significant parts of the puzzle in a way that makes sense of the bigger picture. That saves lives, for which we ought to be grateful. It has done so many times before the 7 July attacks, and will continue to do so. That is the most important return of all on the investments about which Opposition Members have asked me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06071165000049">All those difficulties have always existed, but they are now more challenging than ever. They have become larger and more difficult with the emergence of global terrorism. For nearly half a century after the end of the second world war, our intelligence agencies focused on fighting the cold war. From the late 1960s onwards, they played an important role in a conflict within the United Kingdom, in Northern Ireland. Nowadays, their primary focus is on the international terrorism of al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda-inspired groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06071165000050">As well as bearing in mind the normal difficulties affecting intelligence, we should recognise how much more challenging today&#146;s actions are than what went before. Today&#146;s enemy is unfettered by any sense of international convention, legality or even morality. Indeed, it is spurred on by a perverse perception of morality to achieve an even greater extent of civilian carnage. It uses methods of which we would not have conceived even a short time ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06071165000051">Moreover, the form of today&#146;s enemy has changed. In the past, we faced a foe with a structure. We knew the structure of the Soviet infantry and we often knew the structure of an active service unit of the Provisional IRA, along with its commander. We either knew the names of those involved, or were aware of an intelligence gap that needed to be filled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06071165000052">Not only did our former foe have a structure, but that structure was fairly static and unchanging. When it comes to al-Qaeda and the like, we face an enemy that is structured only loosely, if at all, and comprises numerous largely autonomous groups acting outside any recognisable chain of command. Nor do those groups have a permanent base from which to operate. All that makes the job of our intelligence services much harder than it was before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06071165000053">Today&#146;s terrorist is also helped by the ease of modern transport and communications. The internet and cheap mass travel have created a global village that is home to the global terrorist. All that makes life easier for the terrorists and harder for those who seek to counter them.</p>

 We have those contacts. Some, of course, are in the European Union. Some are in NATO. Others, such as Russia, are in partnership with NATO through partnership for peace or the NATO-Russian Permanent Joint Council. As well as having those military links, we try&#151;as far as is possible, practical and sensible&#151;to maintain an interchange and co-operation on intelligence matters. There is a reason for that. As I said yesterday, the terrorist threat faces us all. It is not a clash of civilisations, but a clash of evil terrorists against civilisation. Whatever differences we have with most of the great powers of the world, they are overcome by the common threat that we face, and the common awareness that we must face it together. We certainly do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06071165000060">I was explaining all the elements that make the terrorist&#146;s unfettered intention of mass destruction more difficult too cope with than ever before. One essential element of threat is intention. To match that unfettered destructive intent, modern science has, tragically, also offered a potential for almost unlimited destructive capability, the other essential element of threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06071165000061">The means of mass destruction have been around for quite a while, but when they are linked with unfettered intention, unconstrained by conventional legality and morality, and with unlimited destructive capacity, we begin to see the size of the new threat that we face. We do not face that threat alone, of course: attacks in places as far apart as Bali, New York, Egypt, east Africa, Madrid and&#151;only this afternoon&#151;Mumbai show, if any illustration is needed, that no community or city is immune. The director general of the Security Service, speaking to her counterparts in the Netherlands last year, pointed out that, as the threat is global, protecting our friends is also a way of protecting ourselves. That is, I think, the point made by the hon. Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06071165000062">We must, and do, work closely with other countries, and with their intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in combating the terrorist threat. It is essential for us to think globally as well as acting locally. The plain fact is that a snippet of intelligence, whether it is gathered in Kirkuk or Kabul, can lead directly to action here on our streets to prevent an atrocity. That is the nature and extent of global terrorism, and that is the global response that we need.  <br>

 It is extremely important, because of our ties in history and Commonwealth, because of the number of people with a Pakistani background in this country and because of Pakistan&#146;s proximity to some of the most difficult parts of the world in which international terrorists are operating. Afghanistan sits next to the western and north-western territories of Pakistan. All that means that we must work internationally in Afghanistan. We must work closely with President Musharraf and his services there, and we must also deal with domestic problems here, or indeed in Pakistan. We have received a great deal of support from President Musharraf. I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting him last year to discuss a range of issues, and I cannot overestimate the importance of our relationship with Pakistan when it comes to these matters.</p>

Just as the intelligence and security agencies work on behalf of the whole community, the whole community must be involved in defeating terrorism. Given the unity and endurance that have seen our people through so many difficult times in the past, I believe that terrorism will ultimately be defeated. But the struggle will be long and hard and wide and deep, and in the midst of that we will rely more than ever on the men and women who work so hard and in such a dedicated fashion in our intelligence and security services.</p>

It is a fair reflection of the objective and serious manner in which the Committee, led by the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), approached its scrutiny of the intelligence and security communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06071176000014">The House knows that I have some trenchant views&#151;although I am probably in a minority in the Chamber&#151;on the structure and powers of the Committee, and I shall say more about that later.

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06071176000015">I also join the Home Secretary in paying tribute to the work of the intelligence and security agencies. As the Committee&#146;s report highlights, the threat from international terrorism remains serious and sustained. It comes not only from al-Qaeda, as the Home Secretary pointed out, but from its associated networks, dissident groups in Northern Ireland, Iranian state-sponsored terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and foreign espionage. We are all too familiar with the events of July last year&#151;but it is thanks to the efforts of the security and intelligence services, as the Home Secretary said, in combating those diverse and complex threats that there have not been similar attacks both before and since then.</p>

The report was agreed between the Home Secretary&#146;s predecessor and the Opposition in response to our call for the use of intercepts. As the tragic events just over a year ago demonstrated, terrorists will stop at nothing to inflict death and destruction on their enemies and innocent members of the public alike in the name of their cause. In combating that threat, we must consider all possible measures to detect terrorist suspects and to bring them to justice.</p>

It is vital that our courts system has the tools to convict and lock up terrorists. Intercept evidence could also alleviate the need to lock up terror suspects arbitrarily or to impose control orders, by bringing them into the justice system on an evidence-based basis.</p>

I have come to the conclusion that every problem can be overcome. The Government&#146;s own terrorism adviser, Lord Carlile, says that intercept evidence would be &#147;very useful&#148;.

 The right hon. Gentleman raises an important point. My predecessor told the House on  2 February that the Government are committed to finding a possible legal model by which we could provide the necessary safeguards to allow intercept material to be used in evidence, and I have some sympathy with that point of view. The Home Office is carrying out work on two possible legal models. The right hon. Gentleman said that he understood that that work had been completed, but that is not my information. The two models are the so-called public immunity plus model and the examining magistrates model. My understanding is that the work is due to be reported to Ministers in November&#151;I asked about the matter before I came to the House today&#151;so it is too early to say whether a workable legal model can be devised. I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that this is an important issue, but it is also very risky if we get it wrong. Although it sounds as though it is a lot of time to spend on the matter and even if we were disposed to look on it with an open mind, we would have to be certain that we were not opening up the service and its operations to risk.</p>

 I thank the Home Secretary for that extremely useful intervention. The examining magistrates model was proposed in the first instance by the Newton committee and we supported that argument as it appeared to be the most robust. I agree entirely that we should not take risks in that area, but on the basis of legal advice from outside the Government&#151;as well as the Government&#146;s commentary&#151;it appears to be achievable. People as eminent and knowledgeable about the issue as Lord Lloyd, for example, think that it is a tenable and achievable aim. I look forward to the Home Secretary returning to the House at some time soon with a conclusive answer on the issue.</p>

One of the aspects of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 that many criticised at the time of its passage was the absence of a single UK border police force. What Lord Stevens referred to as our &#147;porous&#148; borders have an impact on all the targets dealt with by the agencies covered by the Committee&#151;organised crime, espionage and terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para35"><a name="06071176000030">For almost a century, foreign intelligence services have used large movements of people, especially refugees, as cover for inserting their agents. There is also the now well understood threat of foreign terrorists entering the country illegally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para36"><a name="06071176000031">The failure of the Government to get a grip on illegal immigration, the now famous admission by the immigration and nationality directorate head of removals that he does not have the faintest idea how many illegal immigrants are in this country and the Home Secretary&#146;s description of the IND as &#147;not fit for purpose&#148; demonstrate a serious weakness in the Government&#146;s strategy to keep out those who would do this country harm. As the example of one of the suspects wanted in connection with the attempted bombing on 21 July last year showed, there are also problems monitoring people leaving the country. Despite his photograph being distributed to ports and airports, he was able to escape to Paris and then to Rome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="60711-0012.htm_para37"><a name="06071176000032">If the Home Secretary is really serious about protecting our borders, he will look again at introducing a single border police force. The Metropolitan police have called for one, the former head of the Association of Chief Police Officers has called for one and the Home Affairs Committee called for one more than five years ago&#151;but just a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister rejected those calls. If there were a single force, combining the expertise of existing agencies to prevent foreign terrorists entering the country or to detect suspects leaving the country, the burden on the security services would be lower in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06071176000034">By virtue of his wide range of responsibilities, the Home Secretary always has a lot on his plate, and he has admitted as much himself. Much of that work is urgent, as the recent crises over foreign prisoners and other matters have shown. It is impossible for him, or for anyone in his position, to focus entirely on security issues. That is perfectly reasonable, and it is why we have long proposed that a single, Cabinet-level Minister should focus solely on counter-terrorism and national security. I understand that that proposal now has the support of the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06071176000035">The Prime Minister has rejected our proposals again, saying that the present arrangements work well, yet the simple truth is that they do not work well, or not well enough. The speed of progress in the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks is slower than we would like. That is not a reflection on the Home Secretary or his predecessors; it is more a reflection on the system that is in place. Until we have a single Minister whose sole focus is defeating the terrorist threat, improvements to the security services and to our resilience arrangements will not be as rapid as they could and should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06071176000036">I have paid tribute already to the excellent work of the ISC, under the leadership of the right hon. Member for Torfaen. With limited resources, it performs its task admirably, but no one could imagine that its report on the events of 7/7 could match the 550-page report produced by the 9/11 commission. The time has come for the powers and remit of the ISC to be expanded, to match its task&#146;s heightened profile and difficulty. By increasing the ISC&#146;s powers, Parliament could ensure full scrutiny of the work of the intelligence and security services while maintaining the necessary secrecy that surrounds their operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06071176000037">I last asked the Home Secretary about these matters in May, when he responded that the ISC&#146;s scope, remit and statute were defined by the previous Conservative Government. That is correct, and I am touched that the right hon. Gentleman values that Government&#146;s actions so highly that he wants to maintain the status quo. However, I think that the Government accept that we now face a new and more sophisticated threat. It is only right that the ISC&#146;s role should develop to ensure that that threat is met in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06071176000038">The ISC was created in the mid-1990s. It was envisaged then that, as the Committee acquired the confidence of the intelligence and security communities, it would evolve towards being a Select Committee of this House, rather than an appointed Committee of the Prime Minister. I urge the Home Secretary to consider those proposals, to ensure that our security services perform their vital role to the best of their ability and under the best possible scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06071176000040">The shadow Home Secretary is suggesting that the ISC&#146;s role should be extended, and no doubt the Government will wish to consider that, but would not that require greater parliamentary accountability than we have at present? Obviously, ongoing operations could not be considered, either in private or in public, by any Committee, but does he agree that there should be more parliamentary accountability than exists at the moment?</p>

 I do agree, and I shall offer a model of how I think the Committee should be set up. The hon. Gentleman may remember that I was one of the Ministers on the Bill to which he referred. I recall that I said at the time that the then Government expected the Committee, and its relationship with Parliament, to evolve. I am sure that he can look that up if he wants to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06071176000042">Prior to the ISC&#146;s existence and, indeed, for the past decade or so, a great deal of oversight had been provided to the secret arm of Government by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee sitting as a Committee of one. From memory, that arrangement applied to various aspects of the operations undertaken by MI6, MI5 and GCHQ. If he casts his mind back, the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) will recall the publication of the report on the &#163;150 million overrun on the cost of the buildings for MI5 and MI6. My predecessor in those days was Robert Sheldon, now Lord Sheldon. He tried to get that report published, but the agencies told him that the information was so secret that it could not be put in the public domain. Tom King, now Lord King, was the ISC Chairman at the time, and he also said that he would like to see the information in the public domain, but he, too, was told that it was too secret. In the end, all three of us ganged up on the Government&#151;this Government&#151;who were persuaded that information such as that could be put in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06071176000043">A redaction process then started, as I wanted to make the final report as accountable as possible. I received two documents&#151;one each from MI5 and MI6&#151;containing all their proposed deletions. The chapters that they wanted to redact looked almost identical, but the proposed redactions were different. I therefore wrote to the agencies. I asked MI5, &#147;If MI6 allows us in, why can&#146;t MI5?&#148; I also asked MI6, &#147;If MI5 allows us in, why can&#146;t MI6?&#148; The agencies&#146; opposition to the report collapsed and it was published almost in its entirety. I do not think that any aspect of our security and intelligence operation was damaged&#151;</p>

I do not mean this as an insult to the ISC&#146;s current Chairman, but it is possible that, as a matter of course, the proposed Committee should have an Opposition Chairman.

 There is no doubt that the proposed Committee would be unique in that respect, but the American Senate has a very effective oversight committee.

What we propose is not impossible and there are various options, such as requiring all Committee members to be privy Councillors. We need to begin the debate on the matter, to ensure that we have the right level of scrutiny to match the security requirements.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is making some sensible and helpful proposals. I have pursued precisely these matters for a long time, and over the years I have become aware that people say things in opposition that melt away when they get into government. If he ever gets into government, will the right hon.

 There are two aspects for the hon. Gentleman to consider. First, I was a member of the Committee that put MI6&#151;the SIS&#151;on to an avower basis for the first time, so my enthusiasm was evident even as a junior Minister. Secondly, I am told that when people go into government they have 12 months of virtue, so when and if I am Home Secretary in three years&#146; time, I recommend that the hon.

 Perhaps I can help the right hon. Gentleman. From time to time, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs has received classified information, which it has never leaked; nor would it. Nevertheless the Committee has regularly been told by Ministers, in this and the previous Government, that certain information will not be given to us because it is being given to the ISC. The members of that Committee are good people, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), whom I served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, but the ISC is not a Committee of the House and it is not accountable to the House, so I am very interested in the proposal made by the right hon.

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the ISC has limitations? The report it produced for the House on the Bali bombings in 2002 suggested that MI5 had got the threat level wrong and that it should have been raised from significant to high. The report was put to the House, but the House decided not to act on it. The consequences of not accepting its recommendation about travel advice from the Foreign Office were huge and affected all the people consulting the website when making plans to travel to Bali. The whole report, written by Ann Taylor, was dismissed by the Chamber, which shows how limited the powers of the ISC are.</p>

the best job it can within the limits of its remit and my hon. Friend highlights a good example of one of the things that it illustrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06071176000060">The burden of the ISC&#146;s work this year has been the report into the London terrorist attacks of 7 July, about which I do not intend to go into great detail as I suspect that the story will change over the coming year. When the Committee published its report, I paid tribute to it as &#147;extremely insightful&#148;, but although the Committee is impartial, astute and of the highest integrity, as I have said before, there are limitations on what it can achieve. I shall read a quotation to the House:</p>
<a name="60711-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="06071176000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No one wants to play the blame game. No one wants an investigation to find one person who was at fault and make them pay. But we need to fully understand what happened on July 7. And there is a very simple reason - it is the best way to stop it from ever happening again. The public need to know if there was anything that could have been done immediately before the attacks to prevent them. They need to know whether there were things the police or security services might have done which could have saved all those lives.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06071176000061">Those are the words not of some wild revolutionary, but of the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham). So if the Home Secretary will not listen to me, perhaps he will listen to his right hon. Friend who, as the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee and a former Home Office Minister, has a good deal more experience in these matters than almost anybody else&#151;even members of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06071176000062">It is worth pointing out that almost every serious breach of security under previous Governments has resulted in an independent inquiry, generally led by a member of the judiciary, such as the Radcliffe inquiry in 1962, the Denning inquiry and the Franks inquiry. The least that the Government can do, to ensure that no stone is left unturned in learning the lessons from last July, is to order a full, independent inquiry. So far, the Home Secretary has shown himself willing to reconsider some of the decisions taken by his predecessors. I hope that this will be another issue on which he is prepared to be independently minded and to do what is best in the interests of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06071176000063">The ISC reports that the Home Secretary intends to toughen the Official Secrets Act. We hear that he intends to remove the common law defence of &#147;duress of circumstance&#148;, or necessity, as a defence for so-called whistleblowers, and that the maximum penalty for breaching the Official Secrets Act could be doubled from two to four years in prison. I shall wait until the Bill is published and we have had a proper chance to examine it in detail before I comment on its contents and before the Opposition decide on their stance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06071176000064">It is surprising, however, that the Home Secretary wants to change the law when the Government have failed to test its operation in crucial cases, most recently in the case of Katharine Gun, which, I understand, led to the proposals. I should make it clear that I do not approve of what Ms Gun did, but if the Government believed that her actions represented a breach in security, or had endangered the interests of the United Kingdom, they had a duty to take the case to court in the national interest. However, the case was reportedly dropped just five hours after the defence sought the disclosure of the Attorney-General&#146;s advice to the Government about the Iraq war.</p>

I hope that the Home Secretary will pay particular attention to this part of my argument, as that is an important test; for example, such an interpretation of the public interest may have been the reason for the acquittal of Clive Ponting, under a previous Government.</p>

The Government&#146;s behaviour towards legitimate&#151;indeed, public spirited&#151;whistleblowers has bordered on the disreputable. There will be a fear that the Official Secrets Act is being used to conceal embarrassing facts, rather than secrets that are essential to the security of the state. If the proposed measures represent the former, the whole House will resist them, but if they are really necessary for the defence of the state, they will receive our support. That distinction is vitally.</p>

 I am interested in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. There were newspaper reports of considerable disquiet in the intelligence services about how the intelligence was presented during the run-up to the war with Iraq. If people feel that intelligence is being misused, there must be legitimate means, without endangering security, for them to represent that view to others who may have a legitimate interest&#151;for instance, the ISC. There is a real fear that if the proposed measure goes through, there could be further oppression of people whose legitimate point of view would help the House.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, although the Committee&#146;s report covers in some detail the quite sensible arrangements for handling dissenting opinion. However, he is right in another respect: we have to be absolutely sure that the Bill is about protecting the interests of our state, not those of a particular Administration, or protecting from embarrassment somebody in the bureaucracy. That is the test that we shall apply to it when it comes before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="60711-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06071176000069">One point not mentioned in the ISC report, but to which the Home Secretary alluded yesterday, is resilience&#151;the measures taken to preserve public safety when a terrorist attack has happened. Resilience is a vital pillar in the fight against terrorism. Although the Home Secretary included it under the prepare strand of the Government&#146;s counter-terrorism strategy, it is clear that more needs to be done. For example, simple measures, such as instructions about what to do in a case of emergency&#151;as in a terrorist attack&#151;have still not been placed in tube carriages. A whole year after 7/7, a series of safety measures have not been put in place. Those are small but vital measures, which should not normally occupy the time of the Home Secretary, but they could mean the difference between life and death to members of the public in the event of another attack.</p>

 I share the revulsion of the shadow Home Secretary and of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary at the events in India today. It just proves that the terrorism that we now face is in a global form that we have never quite faced in the past. I put on the record my thanks to the Clerk, Emma-Louise Avery, and the staff of the Intelligence and Security Committee, and to the previous Clerk, Alistair Corbett. They work extremely hard. They are dedicated, committed and behave extremely independently in the work that they do. I would also like to thank the members of the Committee, from all parties and from both Houses.

Opposition Members on the Committee&#151;remember that out of nine members, four are Opposition Members&#151;are appointed on the recommendation of the leaders of their respective parties. To all intents and purposes, the appointment of the members is very similar to the appointment of Select Committee members. In addition, the way in which the Committee operates in its offices in Whitehall is exactly the same as the way in which Select Committees operate&#151;by way of cross-examination and taking evidence, both written and oral.</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="06071176000077"><a name="60711-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071176000175"><b>Andrew Mackinlay:</b>
 I think that my right hon. Friend said that the way in which the Committee is selected is known. I have to remind the House that I tabled parliamentary questions asking the Prime Minister about the manner in which the selections were made and he said that he would not tell me because it was a secret. I think that we should have revealed to us today what he understands is the method of selection.</p>

 I assume that my hon. Friend means me when he says &#147;he&#148;. I do not make the selections. What I am telling the House is that the Prime Minister selects the Labour members on the basis of his own decision, having taken advice; other members are selected on the recommendation of the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Liberal Democrat party. That seems very similar to the way in which Select Committees are appointed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06071176000079">I do not want to go too far down this road, because, as I said, I am neutral on the issue of whether the Committee should be a Select Committee, in terms of the constitutional point, but I am certain that it ought to be a different type of Committee. It has to meet in private. It is clearly absurd for a Committee dealing with secret intelligence to meet in pubic. That cannot happen. Of course, we debate such matters&#151;we are doing so today&#151;in the Chamber of the House of Commons, and that is right, too. There are reports&#151;at least one, usually two and sometimes three a year&#151;from the Committee that are debated in public and that are in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06071176000080">It is also nonsense to suggest that the members of the Committee, in the words of some journalists, are the Prime Minister&#146;s stooges, or that we have a cosy relationship with the security services. How on earth can that be the case with a Committee that is drawn up on lines that give the Government a majority of only one&#151;if that were ever to be used, which it is not&#151;and that includes among its members a former deputy leader of the Conservative party and a former deputy leader of the Liberal Democrat party? As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary indicated in his speech, by no stretch of the imagination could it be said that they are the Prime Minister&#146;s stooges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06071176000081">The accusation that the Committee is amateur and inexperienced is also clearly nonsense. Of the nine members of the Committee, one of whom comes from the House of Lords, four have been Ministers in Departments that have direct knowledge of and relationships with the security services. In terms of experience, although they might not want me to mention it, my colleagues and I have a combined service to Parliament of nearly 200 years. That is nearly 200 years of valuable experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06071176000082">The point that I am trying to make to the House is that in no way is the Committee full of people who are there to give the Government a soft line or some sort of easy ride. That is not the purpose of the Committee. The purpose of the Committee is to scrutinise the intelligence services as effectively as it can, without fear and without favour. That is not an issue that divides us. All of us on the Committee, from whatever party and whichever House in this Parliament of ours, believe that that is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06071176000083">For example, in the annual report for 2005-06, which we are considering, there are three substantial criticisms that we believe should be dealt with. Some of them were touched on by the shadow Home Secretary. There is the fact that the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and the security and intelligence co-ordinator ought not to be the same person. We are still unconvinced that that is the right thing to have happened. We also say that the emphasis by the Joint Intelligence Committee on trying to achieve a consensus in its reports could mean that it is missing, or failing to prioritise, key points. We had concerns about the new intelligence system, SCOPE, and the difficulties that GCHQ had with various staff disputes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06071176000084">At the same time, however, we are also very conscious of the fact that, where praise is appropriate, we give it to the intelligence services. That is something that any Select Committee in the House of Commons would do. For example, the staff problems at GCHQ seem to be in the process of being resolved and the IT project SCOPE will deliver next year. There is no question but that the agencies have faced a huge challenge during the past 12 months, given all the difficulties with regard to the problems of counter-terrorism and 7 July, and I think that they have met that challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="60711-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06071176000085">There is now an opportunity for dissent and challenge in the Defence Intelligence Staff&#151;an essential recommendation of the Butler review. We recognise that extra funding has gone into the agencies and we have emphasised on more than one occasion the need to ensure that there is good value for money. There is another issue that is completely misunderstood by so-called commentators. That point came out last night on &#147;Newsnight&#148;. I am talking about how people are recruited into our intelligence agencies. I understand that one of the so-called experts said that it was done by means of an Oxford don and a bottle of sherry. I have nothing against the University of Oxford&#151;I went there myself&#151;and I certainly have nothing against a bottle of sherry, but these days that is not the way in which people are recruited to our security and intelligence agencies. If Members had looked at <i> The Times </i>some months ago, they would have seen that it contained advertisements for MI6. If they turn on their computers and look at the websites of both our security services, they will see that jobs are being advertised in public in a way that is completely different from what has gone on in the past. It is right for the Committee, Parliament and the Government to put right such misconceptions. It was good that our campaign to see BBC monitoring continue was successful, and we commend the lead that the agencies are taking on European co-operation.</p>

Obviously, this debate is taking place in the context of the anniversary of that dreadful occasion. We found that there was no prior warning of the attack and no culpable failure on the part of the agencies.

Does that not indicate that we need to deal with not only intelligence, but the way in which we engage the Muslim communities in detecting, preventing and combating the ideology of al-Qaeda and its sympathisers?</p>

One thing that we can take from the poll is that although some people thought in the way in which my hon.

Although that is no longer the case, the situation came as something of a surprise. We were also worried that we had all underestimated the possibility of suicide bombings happening in our own country.

 Yes, Scottish members of the Committee, or members representing constituencies close to the Scottish border, made us aware of the situation, so we are conscious of the Scottish dimension, as we are of the Welsh dimension.

 One of the reasons we got great intelligence in Northern Ireland was the fact that the community was on side and thus presented a massive number of human sources.

 No, not in that sense, but we had a look in some detail at how to deal with the problems in Muslim communities in which extremists live, work and plot. When we compiled our report, we cross-examined and interviewed many people, from Ministers down. We also went through hundreds of documents to find out whether we could get to the bottom of the issues that were causing concern. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary indicated in his opening speech the difference between what happened in Northern Ireland and the situation that we face today. There was a structure to the terrorist activities in Northern Ireland that we faced. The situation was very much on our doorstep, and the people spoke the same language. We now face a disparate global terrorism that is completely different from what we faced in Northern Ireland, and I say that as someone who spent five years of his life as a Northern Ireland Minister. The way in which we deal with such terrorism is a huge challenge to the security services, this country and the world.

It is worth reiterating that the jigsaw will be complete only if there is a full, independent, public inquiry into the 7 July attacks and the events that led up to them. On 11 May this year, the Home Secretary told me that an inquiry would be too costly and would divert resources from other work. The expense of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, running into hundreds of millions of pounds, is regularly cited by Ministers as a reason why an independent inquiry into 7/7 is not justified. I have looked up the costs of key public inquiries in recent years, and they are not as excessive as suggested. The Bichard inquiry, which made 31 important recommendations, cost &#163;2 million; the inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove and Southall  train crashes cost &#163;1.2 million, and made  39 recommendations; and the inquiry into the awful death of Victoria Climbi&#233; cost &#163;3.8 million, and made 17 recommendations. The Home Secretary may be reluctant to hold a public inquiry but, given the record of previous public inquiries, the issue of costs is not the most powerful reason for failing to do so.</p>

face&#151;the massive threat to this country and the possibility of another tragedy&#151;to divert a great deal of resources and manpower from our badly stretched security services for a prolonged period would result in a huge drain on our capability to fight terrorism, thus increasing the risk of another 7/7.

 I am grateful to the Home Secretary. I merely make two observations. First, it is difficult for me to assess how many resources would be diverted. Given that much of the information is out there somewhere, I find it hard to believe that it would be beyond the means of an inquiry to allocate a small team from the security and intelligence services to make that information available. Secondly&#151;and this is a much more important, substantive point&#151;the Home Secretary implied that there are not a sufficient number of questions that need to be answered, as enough ground has already been covered by other inquiries and reports. It is difficult to judge with scientific accuracy whether that assertion is true. The week before last, a report was published on the death of Zahid Mubarek, who was killed in custody. That inquiry took place after full reports by the Prison Service and by the Commission for Racial Equality, yet it still identified 176 failings and made 88 recommendations. It would rest heavily on the Home Secretary&#146;s conscience, as it would on mine, if we failed to cover important ground and prevent future terrorist attacks because we omitted to hold an independent inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para0"><a name="06071176000116">As for the ISC report, I welcome the wording on the regionalisation of the operation of the security and intelligence services, and the fact that the process of regionalisation was accelerated following the July bombings. I was struck by the passage in paragraph 40 which states:</p>
<a name="60711-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="06071176000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A vital part of the regionalisation programme will be the Service&#146;s ability to work closely with local bodies, particularly the Regional Intelligence Cells within the police.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para1"><a name="06071176000117">I am surprised that the process of regionalisation does not appear to have happened earlier. It is arguable that excessive centralisation is as unwelcome in this matter as it is in so many other areas of Government policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06071176000118">It is consistent with the observation made in the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s earlier report of the 7 July bombings that the regionalisation of the security and intelligence services helps improve policing at local level and helps the front-line intelligence-gathering function of our police forces. That takes on particular resonance in the week when the Government&#146;s ill-judged attempt to force through police force mergers seems to have hit the buffers. I note that the Home Secretary&#146;s predecessor today branded that development as weak and damaging, but I come to the Home Secretary&#146;s defence, even in his absence. It is a welcome wake-up call that the move towards forced regional police mergers was the wrong way to go. The report helps to emphasise the need to localise both the police and the work of the intelligence services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06071176000119">There was reference earlier to the Committee&#146;s observations on the SCOPE IT system and the serious delays in rolling it out, from April 2005 to autumn 2006, yet the capital cost of that delay has been blanked out in the report. I find it difficult to understand why that cost should not be quantified in the report. I understand entirely that there is plenty of delicate and sensitive information that one does not want to appear in such reports, but I wonder whether there is a security risk in revealing the figure. I do not understand why the security services appear to have sought not to release the costs incurred by yet another delay in a public information technology project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06071176000120">That is particularly apposite hot on the heels of the revelations in the Sunday newspapers, notwithstanding the Home Secretary&#146;s confirmation this evening that he wants to press ahead with the development of the much more ambitious and complex ID card database, that there are pronounced reservations among senior officials about whether that is possible. One official was quoted in the Sunday papers as stating:</p>
<a name="60711-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="06071176000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nobody expects this programme to work. It is basically on hold while ministers rethink their options. It&#146;s impossible to imagine the full scheme being brought in before 2026.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para5"><a name="06071176000121">Another official remarked:</p>
<a name="60711-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="06071176000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I conclude that we are setting ourselves up to fail&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06071176000122">and yet another referred to the possibility that the scheme could be &#147;canned completely&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06071176000123">The fact that there is so much that we do not know about the feasibility of implementing the ID card database affirms the need for much more detail about why the SCOPE IT system has been delayed and the cost that that delay has incurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para8"><a name="06071176000124">The report contains an important section on the work of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and states that the Committee was told about the difficulties that could arise from the fact that SOCA will be competing with other agencies for new recruits. The Committee is to continue to examine progress and assess the effectiveness of co-operation between SOCA, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and other agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06071176000125">I endorse the Committee&#146;s observations that competition for resources between SOCA and other agencies needs to be kept under review. Vigilance is required to ensure the best possible operational relationship between SOCA and HMRC in pursuing serious drug investigations and criminal finance work, which are the two responsibilities that have been transferred from HMRC to SOCA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para10"><a name="06071176000126">However, there is a quasi-constitutional issue on which the report is silent, and which perhaps lies beyond the remit of the Committee&#151;the apparent lack of direct accountability for the work of SOCA to the House. I urge the Home Secretary and his colleagues on the Front Bench to look once again at improving in any way that they can the transparency of the important and sensitive work of SOCA and the way in which the agency can be held accountable to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para11"><a name="06071176000127">Finally, in an important section of the report there is reference to the fact that the Home Secretary</p>
<a name="60711-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="06071176000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;told the Committee that he had commissioned a study into the impact of new technology on interception, including any evidential issues, and that the Committee would have early sight of its findings.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06071176000128">Although, as I understand it, the study exists, it is a pity that the Committee has not been given early sight of it. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches look forward with some eagerness to hearing the results of the study, because for some time we have argued, as have many others, that the permissibility of intercept evidence in our courts would be an important additional weapon in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para13"><a name="06071176000129">Earlier this year the senior anti-terror police officer at the Met, Andy Hayman, advocated the use of intercept evidence in terrorist cases. As we know, in 2004 the Newton committee proposed the removal of the bar on intercept evidence as a more &#147;acceptable and sustainable&#148; approach to the threat from terrorism than the arrogation of new executive powers to restrict liberty outside the normal operation of the judicial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para14"><a name="06071176000130">We are in a rather anomalous position. According to Liberty, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are the only countries worldwide that maintain a ban on the use of intercept evidence, yet we accept intercept evidence if it has been gained under the jurisdiction of other Governments. It seems odd that it is not permissible if it has been gained under our own authorisation, but is allowed if it has been obtained under the authorisation of Governments overseas. I hope the Home Secretary will use the study mentioned in the report as a launch-pad to have the debate once again. It has been rumbling on for a long time. I accept that there are a number of practical and legal difficulties, many of which we believe can be overcome. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para15"><a name="06071176000131">Like all good reports, the ISC report raises as many queries as it poses solutions&#151;queries related to intercept evidence; the merits or otherwise of an independent inquiry into the events leading up to the  <br>

bombings of 7 July; the importance of the further regionalisation and localisation of the operation of our security and intelligence services; the need to keep a vigilant eye on how the flaws, delays and unquantified costs of delayed IT systems can be remedied; and accountability for the operation of SOCA and other agencies.

 I speak as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, albeit of only one year&#146;s standing since the Committee was re-established after the election, and in the knowledge that there are Members in the Chamber tonight who have greater experience and who have served on the Committee before. It is a particular privilege to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who leads the Committee with such great distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para16"><a name="06071177000002">The report of the Committee for 2005-06 can be said to give the agencies a clean bill of health. That is as it should be. They serve us professionally, bravely and with distinction. But the report also expresses a number of concerns, some of which were raised earlier&#151;concerns about the merging of the position of the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee with that of the security and intelligence co-ordinator, concerns that the rapid expansion of the services carries risks and needs careful management, and concerns about the overseas part of the SCOPE project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para17"><a name="06071177000003">One notable feature of the report is the planned overall increase in the single intelligence account from a combined amount in terms of resources and capital of &#163;1.1 billion in 2004-05 to &#163;1.5 billion in 2006-07 and to &#163;1.6 billion in 2007-08. That does not include the further &#163;85 million announced by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report to support the expansion of services, which will allow the earlier delivery of key elements of the expansion and which was initiated in the 2004 spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para18"><a name="06071177000004">The significant additional funding made available since 9/11 has generally been accepted as essential to counter the enormous threat that we face from international terrorism and to provide an enhanced standard of coverage and assurance. However, it cannot be that, because an agency&#146;s operations are often secret, it should forgo normal management and financial disciplines&#151;to be fair, no one has suggested that it should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para19"><a name="06071177000005">Given that the current funding and anticipated funding represent an unprecedented level of new provision for the agencies, in the Committee&#146;s view, it is important that functioning mechanisms are implemented to ensure that the money is well spent, that it is appropriately controlled and monitored and that it serves as a driver for increased efficiency. We looked at that matter last year, we shall spend more time on it this year and it will be a key responsibility of the principal accounting officer of the single intelligence account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para20"><a name="06071177000006">As has been said, the main focus of the Committee&#146;s work in 2005-06 was our inquiry into the 7 July bombings, which is not specifically covered in our annual report. Hon. Members have already referred to many aspects of the matter, but I want to mention the international dimension of the 7 July inquiry. Our report states that greater coverage in Pakistan or more resources in the UK might have alerted the agencies to the intentions of the 7 July group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para21"><a name="06071177000007">I do not want to go beyond what was said in the report, but it is clear that Pakistan is an issue. As the report reveals, two of the group visited Pakistan, where it is likely that they had some training from or contact with al-Qaeda&#151;indeed, the video which was recently released appears to make that explicit. The group&#146;s connections to Pakistan confirm the significance of overseas links and of travel to the development of terrorism in the UK. As has been said, the threat is unconstrained and global.</p>

 I agree with the emphasis that my hon. Friend is placing on overseas contacts and travel. However, does he agree that people too often assume that everything that happens in Pakistan is bad? In fact, President Musharraf has made courageous decisions and taken helpful steps in trying to counteract the influence of dangerous people and trends in Pakistan.</p>

 Perhaps this goes beyond my brief, but it seems to me that President Musharraf faces many dichotomies, dilemmas and difficulties, which he strives, generally with good intent, to tackle as best he can&#151;as we know, he is surrounded by problems. Earlier, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary mentioned the Commonwealth, which is also important. As today&#146;s sad events in Mumbai proved again, terrorism is a global issue, and it is no longer possible to separate the domestic and international parts of the problem. Terrorism comes from a range of groups, networks and individuals, which are sometimes linked and sometimes not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para22"><a name="06071177000010">In a series of articles with headlines such as, &#147;Spies hid bomber tape from MPs&#148;, some in the press have alleged that the Committee was not given all the information that it needed for its 7/7 inquiry, that it was not sufficiently critical and that it might have been misled. Although that is not the case in any respect, it is not surprising that such criticisms have been made, because disgruntled ex-staffers and so-called intelligence analysts combine with the press on the publication of the annual report to criticise the agencies and the oversight arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="60711-0015.htm_para23"><a name="06071177000011">Some, including hon. Members tonight, have questioned whether the Committee is constitutionally limited in what it can achieve, whether that is because of the limit on its investigative resources, its remit or its constitution, which makes it entirely dependent on the intelligence agencies for its information and on their willingness to disclose such information.

made by the Prime Minister. Some have said that that gives it the appearance of being a creature of the Prime Minister and the Government, but it is not. We are independent of, not an instrument of, the Government. I believe that our reports confirm that, and, as has been said, members are drawn from all parties and both Houses.</p>

We may not always report as the press or others want us to, but it is our job to try, as best we can, to tell it as it is, and I believe that we have achieved that. The Committee now considers and reports on matters that go wider than its statutory remit, and my time on it suggests to me that operating as a Select Committee is neither desirable nor, indeed, workable. There has been no occasion when we were unable to see those whom we wanted to see, when we were unable to obtain the information that we sought or when we did not ask the questions that we should have done, and I have seen no evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>

We are responsible for oversight, not the day-to-day management of the agencies, so information about operations is often neither necessary nor helpful, and both sides have to conduct their work on a need-to-know basis. Where operations have become interlinked with policy or have policy implications, we have, in my view, always obtained the information that we need.</p>

The call for a public inquiry is also made by the press, but often for their own reasons and often on flawed grounds. While I understand the deep concern of the victims and families involved in wanting to know that no stone has been left unturned and that they have got to the truth, it seems to me, even accepting the difficulty with the timing of the rail journey, that the findings of our report and those of the Home Office narrative, which were separately arrived at, are objective, workmanlike and mutually reinforcing.</p>

to service a public inquiry&#151;this is the point, rather than the cost&#151;would be significant to massive. I am sure in my own mind that those resources are best deployed in trying to prevent future atrocities and tragedies. Of course, as the Home Secretary said, one can never entirely guarantee, as professional and committed as the agencies are, that we can never have such incidents again. Obviously, we can never have advance notice of terrorist acts. We can seek only to narrow the angle as far as possible, and in some cases manage to eliminate it altogether. As the Home Secretary has remarked, four potential attacks have been thwarted in the past year.</p>

That is not a matter specifically for our Committee. However, as a Member of Parliament, one is of course concerned that the law enforcement agencies should have the best tools at their disposal and that there is a legal framework and method for dealing with the terrorist threat&#151;a terrorist threat of unprecedented awfulness and danger&#151;as best they can. My first duty as a Member of Parliament is to do whatever I can to ensure that my constituents can go about their daily lives in safety. By extension, my duty as an MP among other MPs is to ensure that citizens of the United Kingdom have a similar freedom. People talk of 90 days detention, but it never was quite that&#151;it was up to 90 days and then subject to judicial approval on a weekly basis.</p>

However, I feel personally that there will be occasions when the current 28-day period proves inadequate: because of the need to intervene early; because intelligence is by its nature inexact, partial and fragmented and needs to be converted into evidence; because of the weight of the evidence that needs to be collected and analysed; because of the complexity of the inquiry and the need to trace data; and because of the difficulties arising in consulting other countries, interpretation and so on. The Home Affairs Committee recently commented on that, and it will continue to be an issue.</p>

Espionage has not gone away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and economic protection, including the crucial issue of energy security, will become increasingly important.</p>

 I pay tribute to the work of the Intelligence and Security Committee over the past 12 years. I agree with what the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) said about the way in which the agencies can sometimes still be parodied. I recall my first visit to MI5 in the 1980s, when I was taken to a nondescript building somewhere behind Oxford street. The British public were not permitted to know that it housed MI5, although the Russians knew that perfectly well. Events have moved on, and we are slightly more grown-up about these matters.</p>

Would it really make Mr. bin Laden&#146;s task that much easier if that information were shared with him? Is not it time to realise that matters of public expenditure, in particular, can be safely shared with Parliament and with the public?</p>

However, I do say to the Government that it is not appropriate to use this as a precedent in saying that the debate is now over and those two posts can sensibly be merged. That would be unwise and foolish.</p>

The United States sometimes protests to the effect that as rendition has been going on for many years, what is all the fuss? I hope that the Committee will draw attention to the fact that there are two kinds of rendition. There is the kind that takes place when Carlos the Jackal was kidnapped in Sudan and taken to France so that, for the first time, he could face a proper trial before a proper court of law, or when the Israelis kidnapped Adolf Eichmann in Argentina because he would never otherwise have come to justice. It may have been somewhat irregular, but at least it happened so that proper justice could be done. The rendition about which we are worried today is different. People in the custody of Governments such as that of the United States may be sent to countries where the last thing they would receive is a fair trial and where they might be subjected to improper treatment. That is different and it would be right for Parliament and the Committee to examine the matter in the greatest detail. </p>

My introduction to the intelligence agencies was on my first day as a junior Minister in the Foreign Office. I was informed that a gentleman from MI6 wished to see me. He came into my office and I asked him what he wanted. With an unsmiling face, he said, &#147;Minister, it&#146;s my job to indoctrinate you.&#148; I made some flippant remark such as, &#147;I thought it was the Russians who were meant to be doing that&#148;, and he replied that it meant explaining the Official Secrets Act, which I would then be required to sign and be bound by. We have come a considerable way since then. It is important that Ministers in particular know not only how intelligence is obtained, but the use to which it can properly be put.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06071177000040">That was a political objective and no business of the JIC. It should not have been asked to produce such a document and it should not have agreed to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para17"><a name="06071177000042">That shows the Prime Minister&#146;s sad assumption that he could not achieve objectivity or credibility by himself, but required the JIC to do it for him. The chairman of the JIC was gravely at fault. When he was asked to produce the document, he should have resisted the request and, if the task was imposed on him, he should have resigned in the best interests of the country and the civil service. Instead, he has been promoted to be head of the Secret Intelligence Service. That is most unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para18"><a name="06071177000043">It is unacceptable to use the JIC in that way, and not necessarily because the document was inaccurate. Even if it had been 100 per cent. accurate and the intelligence had been 100 per cent. reliable, it would have been improper for civil servants, who happen to be intelligence agency officials, to be used in such a politicised fashion. I hope that the Minister for the Middle East will say in his winding-up speech that the Government will never again contemplate using the intelligence agencies in that role. The Home Secretary made some good comments in his opening remarks about the dangers of relying on intelligence information.

However, when the &#147;Today&#148; programme and all the newspapers publicised the 45-minute claim the following day, implying that it meant that British bases in Cyprus could be hit and other major international targets could be destroyed, I cannot understand why those who were most intimately involved in preparing the  <br>

 The right hon. and learned Member is making a helpful speech. However, is not the position even worse?

 The hon. Gentleman is right. For five years, as Defence Secretary and then as Foreign Secretary, I saw such raw material. I saw the reports that came to me every day during that period. They were invariably accompanied by health warnings, not only because the information might be inaccurate, but because the person providing the information was sometimes being paid for it. Sometimes the informant was a defector from a regime who had his own agenda and wanted to spread information for his own reasons. Intelligence agencies understand that. However, I condemn the Government for not spelling out those matters to the nation when the media, perhaps inadvertently, misrepresented the JIC document.</p>

Committee brings a fresh look to the issues. One of the things that struck me when reading the report was the extent to which it referred to issues in last year&#146;s report, which we worked hard to complete before the election. It is a matter of some regret to me that that report has never been debated; it should have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para23"><a name="06071177000051">The previous Committee was appointed just before 9/11, and the whole area of intelligence and security was transformed following those atrocities in the United States in 2001. Sadly, many of the developments in international affairs since then have served to fuel rather than dampen the rise of international terrorism. It is surely not controversial, for example, to suggest that Guantnamo Bay and Abu Ghraib will have worked for our enemies in the global battle to win hearts and minds away from terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para24"><a name="06071177000052">With the increased threat of international terrorism, it quickly became apparent to the Committee on which I served, and to the Government, that there was an important need to increase the resources available to our intelligence agencies, and I pay tribute to the increases that have now taken place. The total funding for the agencies in 2000-01 was &#163;862 million. The total budget this year is &#163;1,568 million. The Government&#146;s response to the Committee&#146;s report refers to the  &#163;1 billion covering a rather wider area of security and intelligence, increasing to &#163;2 billion. I am sure that the whole House will support those increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="60711-0016.htm_para25"><a name="06071177000053">It is one thing to increase the money available; however, the important thing is to ensure that that money is put to good use. The most important aspect of that is the increase in staffing that arose from the increased expenditure. Indeed, staff numbers at the Security Service are expected to rise about by 50 per cent. in the next three years, representing a substantial increase in addition to what has already taken place. As hon. Members have already mentioned, the Secret Intelligence Service has launched a website in the past year to aid recruitment, and it began advertising publicly for the first time in the press in May. The success of these recruitment procedures will not really become clear for at least four or five years, however, and we will not know until then whether the quality of the staff recruited will be up to the very important tasks for which they have responsibility.</p>

Of course, a key provider of open source information from around the world to the Government is BBC Monitoring. The Committee of which I was a member was tremendously impressed by the work of BBC Monitoring and by the potential for its future contribution. In successive reports, we expressed our concern at what was happening to BBC Monitoring, and I initiated a debate on the subject in the House of Commons on 23 March 2004.</p>

Department. I should like to put on the record that the stance taken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office towards BBC Monitoring was deeply disappointing, and that it is a matter of regret that the FCO could no longer be entrusted with this tremendous national asset. It is my sincere hope that the new Foreign Secretary will recognise the importance of BBC Monitoring, particularly in the context of two of the major issues facing her Department and the people of this country: the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased threat from international terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06071177000056">All those who worked on behalf of BBC Monitoring deserve credit for the fact that the present situation is not as bad as it could have been. Other contributing Departments are making up some of the financial gap left by the FCO, and funding this year has increased slightly to &#163;24.6 million, although it is set to fall again in 2008-09 to &#163;23.4 million. However, while the situation is not as bad as it could have been, it is not as good as it should be. If we consider the significant and welcome increases in funding to the agencies in recognition of the increased threat that we face, and if we consider the enhanced recognition of the importance of open source material to the work of the Government and their agencies, it is my view that we should also be seeing a growth in the resources and the work of BBC Monitoring. Instead, the funding shortfall will mean the closure of 69 posts. I realise that not all of those posts are currently filled, but I suggest that these cuts are taking us in the wrong direction. That does not strike me as a sign that we are looking after this asset entirely in the way we should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06071177000058">The report is a little bit soft in its attitude towards the Ministerial Committee on Intelligence Services, known as the CSI. The Committee on which I served took the view that the CSI should meet regularly, although not necessarily every week or month. The report points out that Ministers consider issues such as Afghanistan in different Committees and are properly briefed by the agencies, and I do not doubt that. Nevertheless, we were convinced that there was a case for regular, if not frequent, meetings. We were particularly impressed by the equivalent arrangements that we saw in Australia.</p>

I do not think that anyone in the Chamber was in the House in 1966 when Harold Wilson set out his doctrine, although I had the privilege of serving in his Government subsequently. The doctrine stated that there would be no interception of telephones belonging to Members of Parliament. As the House will know, the interception of communications commissioner recommended, on the basis of the new regulatory powers that came into operation in 2000, that that undertaking should be abandoned, and the Prime Minister gave due consideration to that recommendation, as he was duty bound to do.

 When this Committee was first mooted many years ago, I had grave reservations about it. I thought that it would be dangerous and damaging to the security services. Having read this report thoroughly and looked at the others, however, I now have to say that the Committee has made a major contribution. It has acted responsibly in carrying out its remit, and we should be grateful to it and to the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) for their work. Having said that, I have real worries about certain aspects of the report, including its structure. If I have time, I also want to talk about the costs involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06071177000061">I should perhaps declare an interest. I have had some dealings with terrorism in the past, and with the agencies of our enemies&#151;principally the KGB, for reasons that I will explain in a moment. I served in Northern Ireland, where it was pretty clear who the enemy was: it was the IRA. I also served with the British Army of the Rhine in Berlin, defending the border there. The enemy there was pretty clear: it was the Russians and the KGB. We used to go round the Soviet sector in British military mission cars, and the KGB used to come over to our sector in their spy cars. There were pretty clearly drawn lines about who could do what.</p>

Driving into the city, where I had worked many years ago, the orange horizon and the missing buildings made an indelible impression on me. I was staying in mid-town, and I remember the awful smell and the roar of the emergency vehicles and rubble trucks as they drove up and down at night. I had not realised how badly all that had affected me until I tried to make a speech about it to the Market Bosworth Rotary club. I found my eyes filling with tears, and I could not continue with my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06071177000063">Later, in the spring of 2004, I was involved in the launch of the British Memorial Garden Trust UK Ltd, a charity formed to support the building of the memorial garden to the 67 British victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which is currently being built in New York. The launch took place in this House, appropriately, I think, in the Churchill room. Although I am no longer involved in the project, I would ask that the House recognise that a small number of people, on both sides of the Atlantic, have worked extremely hard to complete the garden, due in the spring of next year, and to raise the necessary funding of several million pounds. I am sure that I speak for the whole House in extending to them our wholehearted support and best wishes.</p>

One of them is the efficiency and effectiveness of the security services, and the Committee has done a lot to improve the mechanism for working by following its remit of examining policy administration and expenditure. The agencies are also much more accountable now, certainly in relation to the use of resources. Reading between the lines, it must be said that financial  <br>

management was not a big part of the work of the agencies in the past. Methods of redress of grievances, which were addressed by Butler and taken up by the Committee, have also been important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06071177000065">If I may say so to the right hon. Member for Torfaen, the structure of the report is quite complicated. Obviously, there are the three main agencies, but many other subsections are listed, and it is sometimes hard to see how they tie in. I very much approve of the Committee&#146;s attempt to try to find common ground between the agencies, to reduce duplication and costs. I echo the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) about the combining of the posts of Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator and Joint Intelligence Committee Chairman. Reading the report, I got the feeling that the Committee was deeply uneasy about that&#151;that it had taken advice and agreed to it, but was not too happy about it. I hope that the right hon. Member for Torfaen goes back and looks at that, and does not just accept it as read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06071177000066">Another aspect of the report that alarmed me was the paragraph on the ministerial committee. From memory, the Intelligence and Security Committee remarked that the Ministerial Committee on the Intelligence Services had met only once in the last  10 years. What is going on? The ISC report qualifies that by saying, &#147;It&#146;s all right, guys and girls, because they talk to each other elsewhere.&#148; That completely misses the point. The whole point of that committee is for Ministers of State and Under-Secretaries, not Cabinet Ministers, to get round a table, come up with some ideas and understand the real worries. Paragraph 76, on page 22, makes it clear that Ministers across Government need to have a clear understanding of intelligence. If the Minister for the Middle East is listening&#151;I hope so, as we have talked and listened to each other over the years&#151;I ask him to consider that, as it is a real concern. The report states:</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="06071177000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We recommend that there should be a requirement for newly appointed Ministers and officials in key posts to familiarise themselves&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para11"><a name="06071177000067">Yes, there should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06071177000068">Another concern, which has not been mentioned, is that the occupancy of the new GCHQ building is up by 25 per cent. The building must be bursting at the seams. What is happening about that unexpected increase in manpower and personnel, which has completely thrown the planning process? I hope that the Committee considers that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06071177000069">As for the clarity of the report, I was not really happy with its structure. According to the index, &#147;The Intelligence Community&#148; is dealt with on pages 5 to 11, and &#147;The Agencies&#148; on pages 11 to 21. Surely the agencies are part of the intelligence community. What is the purpose of that division? In the previous two Parliaments, I was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and of the Statutory Instruments Committee, and one of the issues that we considered was how to achieve clarity in reports. If ever a report needed lines, diagrams and boxes to explain the different relationships, it is this one. In particular, on the role of the intelligence staff, I thought that sub-headings to make it clear that not everyone reports to SIC would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06071177000070">Acronyms are another issue. The report mentions SCOPE, which is not an acronym for anything, but it does not say what it means&#151;it does not say that it is an IT intelligence system. Paragraph 75, on page 22, contains the following quote:</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="06071177000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have regular meetings with C&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06071177000071">I wondered who &#147;C&#148; was. I thought that it must be short for CDI. Then I realised that it was CDI who had the regular meetings with C. I therefore turned back to the page of acronyms&#151;there are 43, so it took me a few minutes to read&#151;and C is not listed. Next time, can we manage to include C and SCOPE?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06071177000072">The antiquated terminology of commissioners is another issue. We have the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and, apparently, we also have commissioners in the security services. Those who have been in the House a while know that there are also Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, which is a code name for the senior Whips who sign all the Government cheques. When they are not beating Members over the head, they go back and sign Government cheques for &#163;20 million. I do not like that terminology; it is misleading, and we should change it. We should call them directors, monitoring officers or ombudsmen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06071177000073">Nowhere in the report is MI5 or MI6 mentioned&#151;it is like an alien culture. The Home Secretary mentions it, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) mentioned it, everyone uses it; it is common terminology. The report should say that the Security Service is commonly known as MI5 and that the Secret Intelligence Service is commonly known as MI6, so that it is more readable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06071177000074">In 1989, I was asked to take over the British Atlantic group of young politicians. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea, the Minister for the Middle East and the right hon. Member for Torfaen came with me, and we paid visits to Canada, America and so on. We then turned the whole group to face east, and took delegations to the east. Douglas Hurd, who was then Foreign Secretary, agreed to speak at a conference where there were 100 young MPs. I asked him whether we could use Lancaster house, because had had given it to me on another occasion. I went to Brussels on a SHAPE visit and sat next to a Russian chap in the bar. I said that I had a brief to find young politicians in Russia and bring them over here. I said that that was what the Foreign Office wanted and he said exactly what I wanted, &#147;I am a KGB man and a spy, and I will help you out&#148;. That was great; we had a good arrangement. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06071177000075">The point is that east Europe has changed and a lot of our old enemies are now friends. There is a whole diaspora of spies out there and I suspect that they are available at a very cheap price. I hope that the right hon. Member for Torfaen is looking into ways of getting our former enemies to work for us. I believe that he has done a great job with the report, which takes our intelligence services forward in the right direction. One or two issues need to be addressed, but I welcome what has taken place.</p>

Mumbai and its surrounding areas, may I begin by expressing my absolute horror and disgust at today&#146;s terrorist bombings. I hope that none of my constituents has relatives involved in the tragedy. My sympathy and commiserations go to all those affected. It is yet another outrage, occurring during a week in which the man responsible for the Beslan murders in Russia has been killed. We can also think of other terrorist events and outrages all over the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06071177000077">As the report produced by the Committee chaired by my long-standing and right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) pointed out, there is a serious and sustained threat from international terrorism to the UK and its interests overseas, the most significant being from al-Qaeda and associated networks. The Foreign Affairs Committee drew a similar conclusion in our report, &#147;The Foreign Policy Aspects of the War against Terrorism&#148;, published just a few days ago on 2 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06071177000078">The Intelligence and Security Committee states in its report:</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="06071177000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is increasing international tension over Iran&#146;s nuclear programme and backing of groups such as the Lebanese Hezbollah. There is a possibility of an increased threat to UK interests from Iranian state-sponsored terrorism should the diplomatic situation deteriorate.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para22"><a name="06071177000079">Similarly, our Select Committee drew attention to the potential difficulties of moving towards either sanctions or military action. We also noted that the Iranian regime could respond in certain ways, including asymmetrically. The ISC report refers to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as another potential danger to the UK&#146;s security and, once again, the Foreign Affairs Committee report strongly concurs. All three conclusions of the ISC echo the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06071177000080">Interestingly, there is another echo, which I find apposite. The ISC notes that the Secret Intelligence Service</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="06071177000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has started to implement a policy of requiring senior managers to obtain relevant professional skills, and holders of key posts within corporate services will be expected to attain professional qualifications. The Service considers these structural and training changes essential to improve operational focus, to enable more efficient management of resources, and to meet the challenge of planned growth.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06071177000081">The Foreign Affairs Committee has been calling on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#151;though possibly with less success than the ISC&#151;for some considerable time to ensure that its senior managers have appropriate professional skills. If the Secret Intelligence Service can do it, surely the diplomatic service can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06071177000082">I also concur with my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang), who referred to the budget for BBC Monitoring. Our Select Committee had concerns about the changes and the budget reduction, so I am pleased that the ISC has welcomed the fact that other stakeholders have made up the shortfall and come forward to ensure that the vital work of BBC Monitoring is continued for a planned period for the future. It was a matter of great concern to the Foreign Affairs Committee in the last Parliament, and we are pleased that a solution has been found in the short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06071177000083">I want to point to one area where I am concerned about the ISC report. It relates to the following narrow and limited statement:</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="06071177000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Committee is currently looking into the issue of rendition and will report in due course.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para27"><a name="06071177000084">I raise that matter because for almost a year in the present Parliament and about six months in the last Parliament&#151;going back to February 2005&#151;the Foreign Affairs Committee has been putting questions about extraordinary rendition to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We had the frustrating experience of being told that we were not being given that information because it was going to the ISC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para28"><a name="06071177000085">I was therefore interested&#151;perhaps my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen can correct me&#151;that he said, I thought, that the ISC was about to begin an inquiry into this matter. We have been told by the Foreign Office for 18 months that, in fact, we were not being given the information because the ISC was carrying out that inquiry. I should be grateful for some clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para29"><a name="06071177000086">I want to be fair to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In our latest report, on the information that we have discovered from different sources, including from a more open approach from the FCO more recently, we concluded that there was no hard evidence of the truth of any of those allegations, but that is based on the limited information given to us, having been told that intelligence information would not be given to us, even on a confidential basis, because it was being given to another Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para30"><a name="06071177000087">I hope therefore that, when my right hon. Friend&#146;s Committee comes to a conclusion on this matter, he will be able to report to the House that he has got to the bottom of it and found out all the facts of the matter, because the Foreign Affairs Committee cannot say, on the limited information that we have been given, that we have done so, even though we have found no hard evidence. I should be grateful to the Minister if he took up that point when he responds to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para31"><a name="06071177000088">I drew attention to another concern in my intervention on the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis). When the ISC was established in 1994 by the then Conservative Government, it was not a Committee of the House and its secretariat was based in the Cabinet Office. Its Chairman, despite his estimable qualities, does not sit on the Liaison Committee, for example, because he has a particular role. I believe that the time has come for the House to revisit that issue. In fact, the Foreign Affairs Committee produced a special report in March 2004, in which we said that the House should consider the following questions:</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="06071177000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What should be the status of the Intelligence and Security Committee? What principles and procedures should govern relations between the Intelligence and Security Services and Committees of this House?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para32"><a name="06071177000089">We received information from the former Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House of Commons,  my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn  (Mr. Straw), who told us that</p>
<a name="60711-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="06071177000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Parliament has decided that the ISC is the appropriate body to see intelligence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="60711-0017.htm_para33"><a name="06071177000090">That is not satisfactory, and I should be interested if the Minister could tell me when he responds to the debate where in the proceedings on the 1994 Bill or in  <br>

That Committee reports to the Prime Minister; it does not report to the House of Commons. I believe that that fundamental issue relates not just to the Foreign Affairs Committee, but to other Select Committees, and I hope that we can revisit it and that the House of Commons itself can consider the way forward in the future.</p>

 It is particularly interesting to follow the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes), the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. There are many ways in which Committees can co-operate, and the Intelligence and Security Committee has successfully co-operated with a number of other Committees, including the Public Accounts Committee&#151;thanks to which we get very significant help from National Audit Office staff in some of our work&#151;and, indeed, with the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para0"><a name="06071182000002">Perhaps some of the ways in which such things were approached in the report to which the hon. Gentleman referred were not the most helpful and constructive, but there must be some realism and some recognition that serious parliamentary scrutiny of intelligence will not happen if it is too widely dispersed. It must be done within a very controlled context, but it is quite possible for inquiries to take place in one Committee, which deals with the wider policy implications, and in the ISC, which deals with specific intelligence aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06071182000003">I do not want to spend the limited time that I have on such general issues, interesting though they are; I have talked about them before. Instead, I shall make a few specific points, one of which is a reflection on the Forest Gate incident that caused much concern. On the one hand, that incident led some people to say, &#147;The intelligence must have been shown to be weak, so the police should not have gone in.&#148; On the other, there were statements emanating from within the police and from others saying, &#147;We cannot ignore intelligence that indicates the likelihood of something very serious being plotted. We have to act.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06071182000004">I wish to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that in my view, there will be other occasions when intelligence about which there cannot be certainty cannot be ignored, either. So we have to develop sophisticated police tactics that enable them to act in such circumstances without running the risk of massive community alienation. That is very difficult, because policemen have to be protected as well; they must not go into such situations with insufficient protection. But we will have to find ways of using subtle police tactics to ensure that we can respond to intelligence reports that are sufficiently serious not to be ignored, but which are not so certain that we can go  <br>

in without any doubt that we will find the terrorist or the device that is the object of the inquiry. So there are lessons to be learned from Forest Gate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06071182000005">I turn to a completely different issue, to which the Government&#146;s response is incomplete: the continued failure of Departments to reach agreement on the funding of the security services&#146; future work in Northern Ireland. We expressed concern that that might hinder planning of such work. We have been given assurances that planning is going ahead, and the Government indicated likewise in their response, but the fact is that the dispute has not been resolved. Departments are still arguing with each other about who is picking up which tab for this work. That is ridiculous and cannot be allowed to go on. I hope that Ministers will address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06071182000006">A point was made earlier in the debate about co-operation between intelligence agencies. I suspect that lying behind that is an argument that is sometimes advanced by one or two people in this House, and which was more recently advanced in another place: that perhaps we should just amalgamate all the intelligence services in this changed and different world. That would be a mistake, but I want to put on the record that in the 12 years in which I have served in this work and scrutinised such agencies, I have noticed a massive change in the nature and extent of the co-operation between them. There was a great deal of mutual suspicion, rivalry, distance and separation when I first became involved in this work. However, there have been remarkable changes in the intervening years: joint operations; a great deal of secondment across agencies; partnerships of one sort or another; and agencies in which people from each of the intelligence bodies are involved, so that they become accustomed to working together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06071182000007">Such approaches have developed to such an extent that they are the envy of many other countries. We deal with and talk to people from oversight committees and intelligence agencies in many countries, and they are generally pretty envious of the degree of co-operation and co-ordination between our services. That is working, although it can be improved. The entire Iraq experience demonstrated this point, as did the role of the Defence Intelligence Staff. The Committee has taken an ever-closer interest in defence intelligence, having been encouraged to do so&#151;and given the support to do so&#151;by the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary, following some problems that we had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para6"><a name="06071182000008">The substantive point that I want to make emerged from two or three of the ISC&#146;s reports and from the Butler report: the importance of ensuring that intelligence is rigorously challenged as it is brought in and analysed, and that it is cross-referenced to relevant expertise and open-source information. It is a kind of triangulation process: if someone gets a piece of intelligence, they need to make sure that they set it in the context of what they or other people know because of their expert knowledge&#151;that signally failed to happen at certain points during the weapons of mass destruction discussion, for example&#151;and that it is related to open-source information that could put that intelligence into a rather different context when one realises the circumstances in which it might have been generated. All those elements have to be drawn together, and that means that people sometimes have to challenge the first conclusions that are drawn from a piece of intelligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06071182000009">Special ways to do that have been suggested both in our reports and in the Butler report, to which I shall refer briefly. Our overall view, however, is that we do not want a culture of acceptance or deference in the intelligence world. As with any good academic inquiry, there must be a culture in which things that are said are challenged&#151;in which people say &#147;Just a minute: that does not tally with something else&#148;, or &#147;Can we really make that stand up?&#148; Such discussion is necessary.

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06071182000010">I am glad to say that that has been addressed in a number of ways. There are internal arrangements in the Secret Intelligence Service for a challenge process to ensure that the first obvious explanation is not automatically accepted. There is the role of the JIC Chairman, which has been discussed a fair amount today. The JIC traditionally operates on a basis of producing consensus reports.

 I have already indicated my view that apart from this welcome but very short debate, there is no parliamentary oversight of our security and intelligence services. Let me get this out of the way immediately: obviously I have a high regard for our colleagues who serve on the committee, but that is the only nice thing that I can say about them in the present context, although I do express the hope that they may have some regard for me too.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office gave us a briefing note on the question of parliamentary oversight of the security and intelligence services. It had the audacity to include the observation that the British system was exemplary, and parliamentary oversight of security and intelligence was wonderful. I threw it across my hotel room in disgust, because either the author was blind to at least some parliamentary opinion or he really believes that. Either way, he was wrong. I challenged my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, the former Foreign Secretary, about that point at the Foreign Affairs Committee. He said&#151;and this view was adopted by the author of the report from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#151;that it was a distinction without a difference, so what was the problem. I believe that if that is said often enough, people will start believing it. But it is not a parliamentary Committee. There is no parliamentary oversight of our security and intelligence services other than these precious minutes that we get once a year.</p>

 It relates to the issue of selection for service on the committee. Indeed, it goes to the heart of the matter, because my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen mentioned advisers. We do not know their names, but my concern is that they are privy to false statements about hon. Members. Presumably, such statements are forwarded to the security and intelligence services.

Under the Select Committee system, one can apply, through one&#146;s party, and be accepted or rejected. One cannot apply to sit on the Intelligence and Security Committee. A Prime Minister might decide that someone is worth considering, and their name will be submitted for the scrutiny of people whose names we do not know.

Nevertheless, that doctrine is wholly inadequate when it comes to protecting the rights of Members of Parliament. However, what we have we need to hold.

 The ISC was set up and given its remit in 1994. Things have moved on and we live in very different times. The Home Secretary referred to changes in terrorism, so perhaps we should examine the Committee that oversees the changes in the threat from terrorism. After all, over time, in response to that threat, other bodies, such as the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, have changed their structure and the way in which they are scrutinised. Now is the time to look at a complete overhaul of our intelligence system.</p>

When I consider my intelligence experience during my service in Northern Ireland and the situation to date, there is not much difference. The principles of defeating terrorism remain the same, even though different groups of terrorists are trying to achieve different ends. However, that must not be used as a red herring to say that that is why we need to throw away certain rights and keep things less transparent than they should be.</p>

They are human beings motivated by greed, revenge, ambition, attention seeking and a range of issues that make them vulnerable to recruitment. They are also vulnerable to logistics. They need a logistical chain, whether or not it is as structured as the IRA&#146;s. They are vulnerable when they go to Pakistan to be trained or when they meet in bookshops in Leeds. Such vulnerabilities are common to all terrorist networks, even if their opportunities are fewer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="60711-0018.htm_para29"><a name="06071182000038">Our intelligence services and police force must be able to exploit those vulnerabilities&#151;to head those groups off at the pass and catch them red-handed.

terrorists did the same thing in Spain. They took the attack to London, because those tactics worked and now they have taken the attack to India. Ministers sometimes seem to believe that terrorists are so sophisticated that we need a load of new rules because they are about to invent the atomic bomb, but the terrorists attacked the twin towers with aeroplanes and Stanley knives. Their tactics have been effective, so we should not be distracted by red herrings&#151;by getting so high-tech that we forget how to defeat terrorists and ignore the fact that the original principles about getting inside a terrorist organisation have not changed.</p>

Is the overall structure of our intelligence community correct? MI5 was started in 1909, when its main thrust was to expose espionage in this country and people who were spying on it. There is also MI6 and special branch, which was originally regional and is now semi-regional and national. Is that the right way to go? I am talking about the relationship between MI5, an intelligence-gathering body, and a police force that is about evidence gathering and conviction. One has only to look at Forest Gate to start asking questions about the handover between intelligence, conviction and the gathering of evidence. That is one of the key things that we have to learn if we are to defeat terrorism. We have to do it inside the law.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. and gallant Friend for that intervention. He is absolutely right. That relates to the legal powers of soldiers serving on the streets. We have to ask these questions. Has the Government given people emergency powers? The armed forces on the mainland do not have executive powers under firearms legislation to act in the way that our police forces do. For example, if, during the course of the Stockwell investigation, it transpires that soldiers were involved, we have to be careful that there is not a grey area. We have to remember that a solider has no more rights than you or I on the street in the UK&#151;as opposed to a policeman, who does have those executive powers.

I have worked alongside PSNI special branch. They are excellent men and women who have learned that one cannot short-cut terrorism. They have learned that the hard way and they have got extremely good results. When I met a few of them recently, I said, &#147;You do realise that if you belong to MI5, you do not have executive powers. You cannot carry a weapon in South Armagh. You cannot go and arrest someone to pull them in to interview them. You do not have all the powers that you used to use to protect yourself and to help you to get access to informers.&#148; That is important. </p>

It is important that the Government pick up the detail when it comes to reforming and moving the intelligence picture along, because if they do not, the person who will bear the brunt at the end of the day will be the individual soldier, the individual policeman, or one of the security service personnel. That is important.</p>

If it is to work alongside the police each day in offices in our regions, it must accept that there will be a drive for more transparency in not counter-espionage, but the counter-terrorism field. When the agency hands over information to the police and the police act on it and get things wrong, it is the police that get the blame. The public attacked the chain of command in the Metropolitan police over Forest Gate, but perhaps Security Service intelligence should have been considered on that occasion.

We must accept the rough with the smooth, and the Home Secretary was right that if we get things wrong sometimes, that is life. If we all miss the terrorist, that is life. However, we must also realise that we cannot deny people human rights as a short cut, because the end result of that will be that Muslim communities will produce no informers or sources and will not collaborate with the forces of law and order, although such collaboration and information is the only way of defeating terrorism in that community in the long term.</p>

 I express my revulsion at the bombings in Mumbai today. I am the secretary of Labour Friends of India, and I feel desperately sorry for the families and the members of the emergency services who are attempting to sort out that situation tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06071182000052">I have had the privilege of serving for one year on the ISC under the able chairmanship of my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). This year, the Committee has subjected the heads of agencies and their teams to rigorous, often lengthy questioning. It has invariably been detailed, but it has never been soft. I have found it thoroughly offensive to read in the press that the ISC is &#147;weak&#148;, &#147;spineless&#148;, &#147;ineffective&#148; and &#147;tame&#148;. Frankly, I do not recognise any of those words with regards to the ISC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06071182000053">To my knowledge, the agencies have never held back any information. We have never held back on any question that we wanted to ask. No member of the Committee believes that we are there to protect the reputation of the Administration. We are there to get the truth. We seek the truth and we print it. The report that we have published is thorough and wide-ranging. I was delighted to hear not only the Secretary of State, but the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), say that they agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06071182000054">During the year, we have not only questioned the agencies, but visited them&#151;&#151;some more than once and many of them on many occasions. When we have not been confident that we have got the detailed response that we required, we have written and they have responded. There has been a thorough process by which we have critically and constructively examined the work of agencies. I want the House to believe that there is not a question that I would not ask, or a chance that I would let the agencies off on any score. We need to know, and if we need to improve, we need to say that we are improving. The report is thus fair, thorough and wide-ranging. When we visited security services abroad, their universal opinion was that our security services were highly professional, and served our country well. Many of them were complimentary about the work of the ISC.  <br>

My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) said that we are not a parliamentary oversight committee, but I believe that we are. Our work is intense and demanding and, although I am privileged to serve on the Committee, I do not think that I am special or different.</p>

 The hon. Lady is making a powerful statement about the Committee&#146;s performance. However, Ann Taylor, the predecessor of the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), presented a report on the Bali bombings that was ignored by the House. What are the hon. Lady&#146;s views on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="06071182000056"><a name="60711-0019.htm_spnew6"><a name="06071182000102"><b>Ms Taylor:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman rightly reminds the House that we must always discuss those reports and look at their details. The decision not to discuss the report was not appropriate. I hope that response suffices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06071182000057">I am not concerned about the report itself, but I am concerned about something that it examines&#151;the SCOPE project which, if and when it works, will offer the security services enormous support. That IT programme will enable all intelligence organisations in the UK and abroad fundamentally to improve the way in which they work together by transferring data electronically in a secure and timely manner. There is a desperate need for such improvements because, as the intelligence community grows, the amount of material it uses grows exponentially. We need methods to transfer that material in a timely&#151;for me, that means instantly&#151;manner in a secure environment. The 2004 report to the House said that we needed such a programme but, in 2006, we are still saying that we need it. It is not just a complex piece of kit&#151;the project will demand a cultural change and the involvement of highly trained people. It is therefore crucial that it is introduced, because the intelligence community needs it now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06071182000058">In conclusion, may I refer again to the statements in the press about our being weak, spineless, ineffective and tame? I do not recognise those descriptions, because my colleagues on the Committee are determined and challenging. I am positively confrontational&#151;if I do not obtain the evidence that I want I will seek it again and again, so that I am sure that I have been given the full facts. One paper said that the director general of MI5 had charmed the Committee. I must have missed that sitting or series of sittings, because I do not remember her doing so. In my opinion, she is a tough, no-nonsense person who deals with facts, and is certainly not interested in charm. She makes demands of us, just as we make demands of her. The way in which journalists characterise us undermines our work and is thoroughly unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06071182000059">I would accept the opinions of the press as worth while if their accounts of the 7 July bombings offered a careful analysis and reported the facts. However, <i> The Independent </i>printed the following headline: &#147;If only al-Qa&#146;ida were run by our spineless spy masters&#148;. That is unacceptable, and represents the desire of the press to sell newspapers at any cost. We have an oversight committee that works extremely hard. The agencies are part of the making of a secure community for all of us. We do not peddle the politics of fear, as the press do, and they are shameful and undermining.</p>

 In the limited time available, we have had a serious debate with some very good contributions from all parts of the House. It is important that right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed and who have at times appeared to offer criticism, whether in the Committee or on the Floor of the House, have done so in a positive way. It does nobody any service to suggest that those who offer criticism are attempting to undermine national security or the agencies involved. I am pleased that my right hon. and hon. Friends were able to participate in the debate, and I shall return to their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06071182000061">One of the central issues of the debate is how we maintain and strengthen public confidence in the Government&#146;s ability to deal with the terrorist threat, the effectiveness of our intelligence and security agencies and the police, and parliamentary oversight and accountability. We are all aware of the balance that must be struck in a democracy between the needs of the intelligence and security agencies to keep certain things absolutely secret, and the need, increasingly, to explain to the public why there are restrictions and controls, and why things inevitably go wrong&#151;sometimes disastrously wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06071182000062">This is not an academic debate. United Kingdom citizens have been killed, injured and kidnapped abroad, and terror is now a reality and has been symbolised by the events of last year. The threat is real and immediate. The police say that since last July they have uncovered four alleged plots, which have been stopped or disrupted. The Metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch says that it is currently involved in about 70 investigations in Britain and abroad. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan police recently said that the security position was &#147;very grim&#148; and that we must expect further attacks. We work, speak and live in one of the great iconic symbols, so we should bear in mind that at any time we in the House could be subject to attack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06071182000063">That does not mean that the House does not have a right to question, press and criticise Ministers, the security agencies or the police. That is not done in a carping or negative way. That is the strength of our democracy. The challenge for the Government and the intelligence and security agencies is, as many people have said, that the terrorists have to be lucky only once. Many successful operations to thwart or disrupt terrorist attacks can never be fully publicised, whereas failures or mistakes by the intelligence and security services receive maximum public attention. That is the lot of the intelligence and security services. It is the task of Ministers to explain and defend where necessary, and to take responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para17"><a name="06071182000064">The role of the Intelligence and Security Committee is an important one. The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) spoke passionately in defence of the members of the Committee and their job. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who speaks as shadow Home Secretary, that the &#147;Newsnight&#148; presentation last night was flippant and disgraceful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para18"><a name="06071182000065">However, genuine concern was expressed on the Floor of the House about the remit of the Committee. That was referred to by my right hon. Friend the  <br>

Member for Haltemprice and Howden and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind). The remit of the Committee is that it</p>
<a name="60711-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="06071182000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;examines the expenditure, administration and policy of the three Agencies. It operates within the &#145;ring of secrecy&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06071182000066">We must now consider broadening the remit of the Committee, which has undoubtedly been constrained at times, and it makes that point in paragraphs 6 and 32 of its report on 7/7. Given the need to sustain public confidence and the requirement for proactive scrutiny, the Prime Minister should address the matter. The issue does not merely involve parliamentarians trying to delve into every cubby hole in our security and intelligence establishment&#151;as much as anything else, it is about robust public confidence. A strong case has been made by hon. Members on both sides of the House, and I hope that the Minister takes it into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06071182000067">The Committee&#146;s series of annual reports rightly praise the bravery and commitment of the men and women of our intelligence and security agencies and how they have coped with change. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) has pointed out that many operations are long and tedious, and we should bear in mind not only the physical bravery of those men and, increasingly, women, but the fact that much of their work is of the most mind-bogglingly boring nature. I suspect that those people need the mental attitude of a librarian, a philatelist or a Back Bencher to survive numbing tedium in which there is a small nugget of crucial evidence somewhere at some stage. If they miss it, however, everyone on the touchline will ask, &#147;How could they have possibly missed that?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06071182000068">Criticism must be constructive, and the Committee&#146;s remit is functional in many respects. In the past, the Government have frequently noted recommendations or criticisms in replying to the Committee&#146;s reports. I was a special adviser in a previous Government, and I always liked it when the permanent secretary said that he had &#147;noted&#148; something, which was usually something that a Minister had said. It normally meant, &#147;I do not give a tupenny whatnot for what he is saying. He is ignorant, but I know what is going on.&#148; At times, there is an element of that in the Government&#146;s approach. However, I welcome the Home Secretary&#146;s decision yesterday to publish the Government&#146;s strategy on countering international terrorism and the change in threat levels, both of which were called for by the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06071182000069">There is no doubt that public confidence has been badly shaken by the Government&#146;s use of intelligence over Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea has referred. Indeed, the former Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), who is my parliamentary neighbour, wrote in the <i> Evening Standard </i>on 3 July:</p>
<a name="60711-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="06071182000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The experience with suspected weapons of mass destruction undermined confidence in the capacity of our intelligence services to make accurate assessments of the risks that we face&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="60711-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06071182000070">That point was highlighted in paragraph 63 of the Committee&#146;s report for 2004-05. Although it is fair to highlight failures in the wider intelligence and security establishments, Ministers cannot, as my hon. Friends have eloquently pointed out, resile from their part in seeking to get evidence to support a particular case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para0"><a name="06071182000071">Sadly, history is littered with examples of institutional mindsets on intelligence, where Ministers, generals and Presidents have determined the outcome. Today, apart from undermining confidence, that approach can ultimately lead to dreadful consequences. I point the Committee in the direction of the two official historians of the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service, Professor Christopher Andrew and Professor Keith Jeffrey, who might give the Committee useful evidence on those particular points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06071182000072">Going back over several years, the Committee has rightly been concerned that Ministers have not been more actively involved in meeting collectively to set the agencies&#146; long-term requirements and priorities. Several hon. Members have mentioned the fact that the ministerial Committee on Intelligence Services has met only once in the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06071182000073">The Committee rightly highlighted concern about the fact that since September 2005, Sir Richard Mottram has been both security and intelligence co-ordinator and Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. Sir Richard is a remarkable man in that he is a born Whitehall survivor. Anybody who could have survived being Lord Heseltine&#146;s private secretary when he resigned as Secretary of State for Defence, and then survived the debacle over the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), when he came out with that remarkable set of phrases involving a certain word that is of course unparliamentary, is a man who knows very well how to deal with complicated situations. In the words of the Cabinet Secretary&#151;I paraphrase&#151;he has got the post not least because he has no more future in Whitehall and will therefore be independent. In all seriousness, I believe that Ministers should reconsider this, as there are good functional intelligence reasons for keeping the two posts separate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para3"><a name="06071182000074">The Committee rightly recognised the expertise of the defence intelligence staff and their vital role in providing support at the military operational level as well as to other Government agencies and Departments. It welcomed the additional funds allocated to the intelligence and security services, but was rightly concerned that the agencies had not asked for more resources back in 2003-04. Indeed, they failed to spend all their additional funds at the time because the heads of the services feared that they would not be able to manage rapid expansion, with the vetting of incomers and inducting and training of personnel. I recognise that that is a serious problem, but we have been there before&#151;in the summer of 1940. The SIS found that all its overseas operations hidden under the consular service were rounded up. Many of them legged it or had to go underground. Large numbers of SIS and Security Service personnel were retired in the summer of 1940, and hundreds of temporary people had to be brought in. That was a massive expansion that worked. There were many mistakes, but it was one of the greatest successes. In managerial terms, the Security Service, the SIS and GCHQ need to get out of that mindset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para4"><a name="06071182000075">The Committee expressed concern that there should be a correct balance between short-term operational requirements and long-term threats. That is not easy to achieve, but I am not sure whether Ministers believe that they have got the balance right within the intelligence and security services. It welcomed the  <br>

Security Service&#146;s decision to set up regional offices and to work closely with special branch. However, following the recent incident at Forest Gate, it appeared from media reports that special branch and the Security Service were, if not briefing against each other, giving contradictory briefings. That is an old, bad habit that I hope will change in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para5"><a name="06071182000076">The hon. Member for Stockton, South and others mentioned the implementation of SCOPE, which is a major IT programme designed to enable organisations across the intelligence community to work together. Given the challenges involved in big Whitehall IT programmes that&#151;how can I put this delicately?&#151;have not always worked, who is managing this programme and who is the Minister ultimately responsible for seeing that it is delivered?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para6"><a name="06071182000077">The Committee&#146;s role is important and its members should receive our congratulations on their hard work. However, we need clear ministerial leadership and accountability. There is a strong argument for a Minister who is ultimately responsible across Whitehall for counter-terrorism. The Prime Minister must deal with how we go about that, but the current system&#151;illustrated by the Home Secretary&#146;s suggestion yesterday in response to being pressed by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee&#151;that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government was taking the lead, is not good enough. Greater co-ordination and integration are needed at a functional level in Whitehall. Is any individual or organisation in Whitehall thinking out of the box? Is anyone asking important questions? The Home Secretary points directly at the Minister for the Middle East. I always believed that he was in rather than out of the box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para7"><a name="06071182000078">Agencies must believe that they will be supported, especially when there are failures.

Britain&#146;s intelligence and security services. Earlier, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary highlighted their many successes, and the debate has emphasised their important role in protecting British citizens at home and abroad, often in dangerous circumstances. Some of us have been privileged to witness their operations first hand, as I did last week in Iraq, and we should be grateful to our people who are working for us there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="60711-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06071187000008">Let me try to deal with the many subjects that have been raised today. My hon.

There is nothing that the conspiracy theorists love more than a theory that involves the security services.

Friend the Member for Torfaen, among others, defended the report&#146;s criticism of the merger of the posts of Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator and of JIC chairman. The Government do not agree with the Committee on that point. We see no clash between the roles; on the contrary, they are mutually reinforcing. The appointment of Sir Richard Mottram to the roles of SIC and JIC chairman was consistent with the recommendation in the Butler review that the post of JIC chairman be filled by someone with experience of dealing with Ministers in a very senior role. Far from devaluing the JIC chairman&#146;s role, combining the posts has added further weight and authority to it.</p>

We will be watching very carefully, and we will do what we can to help. The Government see no reason to change the present arrangements, which allow a cross-party group of parliamentarians to examine a wide range of sensitive intelligence matters in some depth without jeopardising sources or methods. The ISC&#146;s independence is not in doubt. It has consistently produced comprehensive and thorough reports that are laid before Parliament and often make uncomfortable reading for the Government.</p>

After considerable parliamentary discussion, it was decided that the best way to impart proper authority and ensure effective oversight of the intelligence agencies was by establishing the ISC and laying down the Committee&#146;s duties and obligations in legislation. Transforming the ISC into a Select Committee would require a change in primary legislation. Any move to change its status would have to take careful account of the need to maintain proper security for the agency&#146;s work. Unless a Select Committee was willing to operate under similar conditions to the ISC, the end result would be less, rather than more, scrutiny.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary explained with understandable passion that, given the present circumstances, it is not a question of financial cost but of resources. We have heard already about the difficulties of recruitment. It takes time to train people, and I would not like to see those precious resources diverted, as they inevitably would be, into a long-running inquiry of that sort. Several inquiries have taken place. The Intelligence and Security Committee conducted a thorough inquiry. The London assembly also conducted one.</p>

Friend the Member for Wirral, South explained the truth behind some of the allegations that information was withheld from the Committee. The ISC&#146;s report provided a thorough, clear and detailed account of what was known about the 7 July bombers prior to the attacks. The security and intelligence agencies and other relevant Departments co-operated fully with the ISC&#146;s investigation, and no relevant information was withheld. Subsequent allegations in the media, some of which have been reported in the House, that the Government or security and intelligence agencies withheld information or in some way misled the ISC are totally false.

We want to maintain the co-operation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies on which those results are predicated.

 I am particularly delighted that you, Mr. Speaker, are in the Chair to accept my thanks for giving me the opportunity to address the House briefly this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06071187000038">My concern on the matter of front-of-pack food labelling goes back a number of years, but arises principally from the obesity report of the Health Committee, of which I am a member, published in the last Parliament in 2003-04. The background covered a number of different issues, of which food labelling was just one small part. However, the position in the UK today is such that obesity and diet-related ill health are major problems to individuals, communities and the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06071187000039">British business, British society and the British economy suffer as a consequence. Nutrition and health claims made on food packaging can often be confusing and sometimes border on being downright misleading. For example, a low-fat claim may legitimately ignore the fact that the same produce is high in salt. Supermarkets have a huge influence on how we shop, cook and eat. National Consumer Council research has shown that supermarkets need to do more to help customers to eat more healthily and the most vulnerable in society often have the poorest diets, which is a major factor in health inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06071187000040">The Health Committee report of 2003-04 was, I think, our magnum opus. The Committee did much valuable work during the previous Parliament&#151;issues of modesty notwithstanding&#151;and I believe that our report on obesity was the greatest thing that we did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06071187000041">I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) is in his place, not only because he can give testimony to what I have said, but because he is a strong supporter of the points that our Committee raised about front-of-pack labelling. I also pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman as the author of early-day motion 2055 on this very subject. A shrewd reading of the Order Paper will demonstrate that he has a slot next Tuesday under the ten-minute rule procedure. Currently, there is a reference to amending statutory orders legislation, but I suspect that it may change between now and next Tuesday. I should also add that I have agreed through all the proper channels that he may speak for a few minutes. I will sit down in time for him to have a couple of minutes before my hon. Friend the Minister replies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06071187000042">I want to draw the House&#146;s attention to what the Select Committee recorded in our report on the issue. With your forbearance, Mr. Speaker, I shall quote a couple of paragraphs from the report. It said:</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="06071187000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nutritional labelling is intended to help consumers make sound nutritional decisions when buying food, but the current state of much labelling seems to be having, if anything, the opposite effect. We have repeatedly heard the argument, both from the food industry and from the Government, that there are no such things as good or bad foods, only good or bad diets. However, both the food industry and the Government have embraced the concept of labelling certain foods as &#145;healthy&#146; with great enthusiasm, inviting the obvious conclusion that other foods must be, by definition, less healthy.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para5"><a name="06071187000043">Our recommendation was:</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="06071187000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government must accept the clear fact that some foods, which are extremely energy-dense, should only be eaten in moderation by most people, and we therefore recommend that it introduces legislation to effect a &#145;traffic light&#146; system for labelling foods, either &#145;red&#151;high&#146;, &#145;amber&#151;medium&#146; or &#145;green&#151;low&#146; according to criteria devised by the Food Standards Agency, which should be based on energy density. This would apply to all foods. Not only will such a system make it far easier for consumers to make choices, but it would also be an incentive for the food industry to re-examine the content of their foods to see if, for example, they could...move their product from the &#145;high&#146; category into the &#145;medium&#146; category.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06071187000044">We regarded such a system as a necessity and as a discipline on both the food producers and the food retailers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06071187000045">In fact, the Government, to give them credit, said in their response to our report that they had</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="06071187000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;started work with the FSA to develop criteria that take account of fat, salt and sugar levels to indicate the contribution that the food makes to a healthy balanced diet.&#148;</p>

Our goal is, by early 2006, for there to be: a clear straightforward coding system...that is in common use...and that busy people can understand at a glance which foods can make a positive contribution to a healthy diet, and which are recommended to be eaten only in moderation or sparingly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06071187000047">The Government&#146;s response was entirely reasonable. Sadly, I do not know how Government calendars work&#151;I have not been privy to them for some time&#151;but I do not think that we are in early 2006 anymore. So while progress has been made, to coin a phrase, there is much done, but much more to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06071187000048">The Food Standards Agency consulted and decided in March this year that the model of food labelling that it wanted to impress on others was for clear MTL&#151;multiple traffic light&#151;signage on the front of packs and the GDAs, the guideline daily amounts, on the back of packs. I fully support its decision. It has received strong support from many in the industry: Sainsbury&#146;s, the Co-op, Waitrose and Asda have all willingly accepted such a system, although there is a minor issue about Sainbury&#146;s definition of fat, but at least it has gone most of the way to try to achieve that aim. Marks and Spencer has said that it is willing to consider that system as well and is in consultation with the Food Standards Agency. The agency&#146;s position has also received strong support from the National Consumer Council, <i> Which?</i>, the Consumers Association, the British Heart Foundation and very many health charities that are concerned with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06071187000049">The issue on front-of-pack labelling is essentially that of the traffic light system versus guideline daily amounts. There has been stiff resistance to the traffic light system, however, and it comes principally not from food retailers, but from food processors. In particular, I mention Nestles&#151;or Nestl&#233; as it prefers to be called&#151;PepsiCo, Kraft, Kellogg&#146;s and Danone. The Food and Drink Federation appear to be opposed, but as the people who pay the federation&#146;s salaries are Nestl&#233;, PepsiCo, Kraft, Kellogg&#146;s and Danone, that is hardly a surprise or a revelation.</p>

from such organisations, who have tried to tell us why the traffic light system is completely wrong. I met someone from Kraft Foods to discuss why the guideline daily amount was the way to make progress on this issue. They gave me a presentation, which included a suggestion of what their packs would look like. I have that with me, and although I know that I cannot use audio-visual aids in the Chamber, when I look at it I really do not have a clue what any of it means. For example, a packet of cornflakes tells me that it has 17 per cent. of my saturate diet for that day. So what do I do? Do I carry an organiser around with me so that I can work out how many saturates I had in my bowl of Kellogg&#146;s? Do I then ask myself how many saturates are in the sandwich that I have at lunchtime? This is what we in the Committee generally found about the state of labelling, before the initiative: it is fact without information, and it confers nothing to the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06071187000051">The chap who came to see me subsequently sent me a letter, in which he said that he hoped that our meeting had clarified matters. Well, I have to say to the corporate director of Kraft Foods that it had exactly the opposite effect, and it has made me more animated on the subject than I have previously been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06071187000052">After the hon. Member for Southend, West had the temerity to table his early-day motion on this issue, which I signed, there was a positive plethora of letters from Kraft, Kellogg&#146;s, Nestl&#233; and PepsiCo&#151;and, amazingly enough, Danone managed to get in on the act. The first letter on the early-day motion arrived on 10 May, and it was signed by somebody on behalf of their public affairs company. By 26 May, they had decided that matters had got so bad that they sent the same letter saying, in effect. &#147;We can&#146;t possibly have this system.&#148; But they got senior executives in all five of the companies involved to sign it as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06071187000053">They did not think that I would keep the original letter, and therefore could compare them. The letter contains the following astonishing revelation:</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev4"><a name="06071187000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The arrival of GDA labels in stores comes as new research reveals that the majority of UK shoppers (97 per cent.) are in favour of food manufacturers providing consistent and clearer food labelling&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06071187000054">Well, what did the other 3 per cent. want? Did they want more obscure and opaque labelling? Did they want no labelling at all? This is absolutely ridiculous. We have since discovered that consumers find the GDA labelling system informative to a limited degree, but not enlightening. That is the subject that I wish to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06071187000055">The Food and Drink Federation&#151;the front organisation for many of the companies that I have mentioned&#151;stated in a letter to me:</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="06071187000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that the MTL system, with its &#147;stop/go&#148; instructions for consumers, takes the dumbed-down route and delivers virtually no useful information to help people balance their diet. It could also seriously mislead consumers as they fail to take account of portion sizes and frequency of consumption.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06071187000056">It then goes on to give a very detailed and technical description of why traffic lights cannot work&#151;what they will not tell people, and what they will tell people.

<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="06071187000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We launched the Wheel of Health in January 2005. It is compatible with the FSA&#146;s recommendations. It is honest and transparent, we don&#146;t duck the issue of putting Red on products.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06071187000058">The letter goes on to detail a number of further changes: Sainsbury&#146;s is also providing GDA for some 2,100 lines, and it will extend that to all products, beyond the categories specified by the Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06071187000059">Let us see what has actually happened for consumers. In 2005, 94 per cent. of Sainsbury&#146;s customers found the &#147;wheel of health&#148; symbol easy to understand. That highlights the point that the Committee was trying to make. Also, 77 per cent. found that colour-coding was useful, and</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="06071187000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;76 per cent. said that it would influence their purchasing decisions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para22"><a name="06071187000060">Let us see if that is the case. Sainsbury&#146;s cite two products. Sales of its all-butter croissants are down because their &#147;wheel of health&#148; is mainly red, whereas sales of its healthier standard loaf&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para24"><a name="06071187000062">In conclusion, I received a report today from <i> Which?</i>, the largest European consumer organisation, with 700,000 members. On reading it, I felt like chucking away all the notes that I had written in the past few days and simply reading it out this evening instead, because its conclusion is so damning. <i> Which?</i> tested the Tesco guideline daily amount system, the FSA&#146;s multiple traffic light system, the scheme used by some food and drink manufacturers&#151;Pepsi, Danone and so on&#151;and a hybrid system. <i> Which?</i> said:</p>
<a name="60711-0021.htm_brev9"><a name="06071187000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The research confirms that the Food Standards Agency traffic light labelling scheme is the most useful for all consumers, particularly those on a low income.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para25"><a name="06071187000063">The key findings were as follows:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para26"><a name="06071187000064">That is exactly what the Health Committee recommended to the Government, and we believe that that is what they accepted. I ask my hon. Friend to ensure that she brings to bear all the pressure that she can on these recalcitrants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para27"><a name="06071187000065">Tesco does not back many losers. We should advise it not to back losers on this occasion, and to do what consumers want and need.</p>

he introduced it. The Minister probably also welcomes the debate, because it strengthens her hand in dealing with this issue. I know that she and her ministerial colleagues take the Health Committee&#146;s work very seriously and have particular regard for its report on obesity. During the obesity inquiry, it was very clear that the food and drinks industry was in denial on this subject: it wanted to talk about fitness, rather than the amount of fat, sugar and salt that we eat. The Health Committee was having none of that, hence this very simple labelling suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para28"><a name="06071187000067">I entirely support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks. A clear system has been suggested, and the prevarication of these powerful organisations is an absolute disgrace. I simply say to the Minister that I hope, as the hon. Gentleman hopes, that she can charm the industry into adopting this simple labelling system. But if she fails&#151;I hope that she does not&#151;I hope that the Government will adopt the ten-minute Bill on single food labelling that I am seeking leave to introduce on Tuesday.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd) for securing this debate, which comes at an important moment, as this issue breaks into the public consciousness. There is a certain rivalry and competition between retailers and food manufacturers in respect of labelling, which is healthy. I also welcome the presence this evening of the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), and thank him and my hon. Friend for their contributions to the Health Committee&#146;s report on obesity. That report provided not only the Department of Health but all of us in government who are working to tackle the issues associated with obesity with clarity in terms of the way ahead, and with the purpose and support to enable us to move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para29"><a name="06071187000069">I have spent considerable time during the past year having joint meetings with the Food Standards Agency and different industry stakeholders on this issue. At some of those meetings, I have had various products put on the desk in front of me and have been told that the FSA&#146;s proposed model will be a nightmare for all concerned in the industry. Interestingly, a year ago, the argument was whether to have front-of-pack labelling to define products that are high in salt, fat and sugar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para30"><a name="06071187000070">Things are different now. Although there is still some progress to be made in the proper labelling of packs, there has been a shift in understanding of the scientific reasons for the need to tackle obesity and of the health needs of the community, partly because of the public pressure that has been exerted. That pressure has been enhanced by Members of Parliament who have raised the issue on a number of occasions, stressing its importance as a piece of the jigsaw of work that we are having to undertake. Of course, that work includes recommending physical activity, but it also includes giving consumers informed choice, which is what they desperately need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para31"><a name="06071187000071">Part of that informed choice is the ability to differentiate between products. When I embarked on my journey a year ago, I was concerned mainly about the products that present the hardest choices. How can  <br>

one shepherd&#146;s pie or one lasagne be differentiated from another? Many people buy processed products because they lead busy lives, but some may do so because they have no guidance to help them determine whether one shepherd&#146;s pie is healthier than the one next to it in the cabinet. Such complex products were an important issue for me, but so were cereals, which are a meal in themselves at breakfast time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para32"><a name="06071187000072">It is interesting to note the way in which things have moved on as a result of the labelling debate. It must be said that much of that has been initiated by the industry, which now seems to want to put front-of-pack labels on everything from soft drinks to products which, in our view, speak for themselves and do not really need the labels. I am not saying that I am against that, but we were examining what we considered the most difficult area. When we were designing the model with which the agency helped us and which the Government support, we wanted to end up with something that was sound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para33"><a name="06071187000073">The model had to be sound on a number of fronts. For one thing, it had to provide clear guidance that people understood. During the deliberations of the past year, it has concerned me that many people still find guideline daily amounts difficult to understand. When asked whether they would support action on GDAs, most people say that they would. When asked whether they understand GDA information on a pack, their answers are slightly different. I understand that some of the organisations which, according to my hon. Friend, do not support the FSA model are embarking on a huge campaign to educate the public on GDAs. I am sure that there will be a great deal of money behind that campaign, but perhaps what is most important is to devise a simpler way for people to understand what they are buying and subsequently consuming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para34"><a name="06071187000074">As a shopper myself, I know how much time I have when going around the stores. I want to see at a glance what is in the various products when I am shopping for my family. It should be borne in mind that there are different GDAs for men and women and for children. It is a complex issue, and some people say that they are not prepared to live or die for it. At the end of our deliberations, the agency said, &#147;If you want GDAs that is okay, but what is really important is clear information about products that contain high levels of salts, sugars and fats. How can we make it easier for people to differentiate between products? How can we make it easier for them to shop?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="60711-0021.htm_para35"><a name="06071187000075">As was pointed out by my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Southend, West, we need to find a way of providing consumers with the best possible information. It is not my job to tell people what to eat, but I think it is part of my responsibility&#151;and the Government&#146;s responsibility&#151;to gear information in a way that allows people to make choices for themselves. If we are ever to conquer the problem of rising levels of obesity, families&#151;parents, but also children&#151;must understand labelling. They must be in the driving seat: they must choose health for themselves. As was pointed out in the White Paper &#147;Choosing Health&#148; , we can play our part in Government by taking action on school meals and working with industry to reformulate and provide better choice between foods, but ultimately we will win only when people make the choice for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para0"><a name="06071187000076">My hon. Friend mentioned significant data relating to the new Sainsbury&#146;s labelling, and gave examples. I would add that it is helping people to make informed choices between brands of soup, for instance. That does mean that sales of some products are falling, but product sales of healthier choices are going up. It is interesting that just providing information causes behaviour change. We get a lot of information about our diet and various foods every day, but it is not always clear how much that drives people to make changes in their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para1"><a name="06071187000077">We have agreed with all parties to the debate on the need to commission independent research to evaluate some of the systems that are being promoted and used, to discover which ones change behaviour the most. I hope that we can do that in a spirit of co-operation and that all sides will be prepared to accept the results of that independent research if it proves its worth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06071187000078">The evidence is clear that consumers are overwhelmingly in favour of front of pack signpost labelling and they clearly prefer the colour-coded labels, which was borne out by the Which? report published this week. The issue is not good foods or bad foods, but people making informed choices. I am not saying that people should never eat chocolate or cakes&#151;not least because that would make me a bit of a hypocrite&#151;but it is a question of balance. The red, amber and green labels are not about stopping people eating certain foods, but about helping them to achieve that balance. The colours indicate high, medium and low levels of nutrients, not good or bad foods. That is not the language that we are using.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06071187000079">In every test, formats that did not have a colour element performed significantly worse than those that did. Consumers also wanted some numerical information, but they were less receptive to percentages. Some people find percentages difficult. Some people have English as a second language, and there are various other barriers to understanding information, one of which is time. What information are we evaluating when we stand in front of the freezer cabinet and choose what to put in our trolley or basket for that week? Nine out of 10 consumers said that they found a colour-coded approach very or fairly easy to use and that they could understand it quickly or at a glance. As I have said, consumers also told us that they particularly wanted to see signposts on foods whose nutritional quality is hard to judge, such as ready meals, sandwiches, pizzas, burgers and breakfast cereals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06071187000080">Evidence is continuing to emerge as new labelling appears on our shelves and consumers get to use it in their shopping experience. That evidence has informed the agency&#146;s work. The FSA carried out many tests and evaluated different models before it reached the recommended approach, which the Government have endorsed. The core principles that the FSA has applied are pragmatic and progressive. They will provide the consumer with consistency and give business the opportunity to tailor their labelling to fit their customers&#146; needs. Sainsbury&#146;s has gone for the wheel of health and others have chosen an oblong label on the front of packets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06071187000081">As I have said, the approach is not about demonising foods, but helping busy people to assess quickly the nutritional quality of complex foods so that they can  <br>

make their choices easily. On GDAs, our approach is flexible enough to allow manufacturers and retailers to provide additional information such as calorie content or GDAs if they wish. However, GDAs are not simple to use and the manufacturers will have to produce better arguments if they wish to pursue them instead of colour coding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06071187000082">I began work on this matter a year ago, and I welcome the progress that has been made. I hope that the Select Committee involvement of my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Southend, West has helped to move things along, but I am delighted that more than one third of the retail sector is committed to schemes that meet the FSA model. Sainsbury and Waitrose are so committed, and Asda and the Co-op will be soon.</p>

 Has my hon. Friend noticed that, with one or two significant exceptions, the retailers are most receptive towards the scheme? The food producers are trying to hide behind the retailers, who are closest to the customers.</p>

 That is absolutely true. The retailers have been helping us a lot, in other areas of public health, with their understanding of consumer behaviour. Moreover, it is interesting to see how some of the brand products have ended up competing against retailers&#146; products. Finding out what impact that has, in terms of the products that are put in trolleys and taken out of the supermarket, would make an interesting piece of research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="60711-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06071187000085">We need to encourage more retailers to take up the FSA model. We have committed ourselves to the independent research that I mentioned earlier, which I think will keep us engaged with the industry. In addition, we know that Europe is looking closely at what is happening in the UK. The EU has responsibility for legislation on food labelling across Europe, and I know that some of the companies mentioned by my hon. Friend are already making their case there. They want to find out what works, because that is the most important factor in this matter.</p>
