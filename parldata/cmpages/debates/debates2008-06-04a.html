 Issues to do with next year&#146;s quota have to be decided at the Fisheries Council. On the first point, the Marine and Fisheries Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw), has been in long discussions with Richard Lochhead and the Scottish Executive about ways in which these quota exchanges can be managed and carried out more professionally, but the reality is that to circumvent all of that with no warning and to impose a moratorium that is not universally welcomed in Scotland, let alone elsewhere, is deeply irresponsible.</p>

 The fact that Richard Lochhead and the SNP Administration have taken such a unilateral decision blows a rather large hole through the SNP&#146;s desire that a Minister from the Scottish Parliament should lead on UK fisheries negotiations in Europe.

 My hon. Friend is right, which is why this will be seen to be a very short-sighted decision.

 My hon. Friend has a long tradition of, and reputation for, campaigning on these issues. I am aware that he has raised the issue of the carer&#146;s allowance with my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for disabled people. He rightly points out that Scottish standards in social care are excellent and have been through various Administrations, and I commend Scotland&#146;s social care practitioners on that. I shall reserve judgment on the kinship carer&#146;s allowance until I have seen the colour of the Scottish National party&#146;s money, because what we have got used to in Scotland over the past year are high-falutin&#146; announcements with absolutely no money to pay for them.</p>

 I think the whole House acknowledges the role that my right hon. Friend has played in campaigning in this area, particularly for the rights of disabled children and their carers. It is simply a matter of growing national scandal that the money that has been allocated, thanks to the report that he offered, precisely for carers of disabled children in Scotland has simply not got through to them. The issue must be pursued with the First Minister to ensure that money that should be going to the families of disabled children actually gets to them.</p>

Will he join me in praising the work of Falkirk council and, in particular, the chair of the cultural committee, Adrian Mahoney, who has made this his priority for Scotland? Can the Secretary of State assure us that the resources of the UK Government will be put together with the efforts of Falkirk to ensure that this is delivered as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2008?</p>

 I commend my hon. Friend and Falkirk council, which is one of five councils across Scotland supporting this bid and has sustained the infrastructure of the Antonine wall in its present state. That allows it to become part of this international application for world heritage status. I have no difficulty in commending Falkirk council on the work that it has done. In 1999, it secured lottery funding to improve the infrastructure, and it continues to discuss with the Heritage Lottery Fund not only how to exploit the tourism potential, but the restoration and maintenance of the sites, as indeed do other councils. My hon.

 Not at all. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman does not fully understand where the strengths of the scheme lie. He also probably does not understand his party&#146;s policy on identity, given that 80 per cent. of the scheme and its costs relate to e-passports, which are supported by his party. The scheme and its integrity depend on being able to build a database that links biometrics to the individual person&#146;s identity so that it can be protected. Whether any service, devolved or otherwise, chooses to use that opportunity to check the identity of those people who access the service will in no way undermine the scheme.</p>

 The Government have constantly said that the ID card scheme would help to protect Scotland from the threat of terrorism. The Anglo-Irish treaty in 1921 will mean that Irish citizens will not be required to have an ID card, and the Government&#146;s legislation will mean that foreigners who stay for three months or less in Scotland will not have to have one either. Do not these foreign exemptions, plus the opposition of the Scottish Government, mean that the ID card scheme in Scotland is a colossal waste of money and an unnecessary threat to civil liberties?</p>

 It is nothing of the sort. The hon. Gentleman has asked me questions at the Dispatch Box about the ID card scheme before. On the last occasion, it was manifest that he did not understand his party&#146;s policy of support for 80 per cent. of the scheme. The scheme underpins e-passports, and 80 per cent. of the cost and administration of the scheme is required for the e-passport scheme that his party supports.</p>

Of course it will, for the following reason: 67 terrorists have been convicted in the UK courts in the past 18 months, and it is almost certain that 90 per cent. of them had multiple identities. Anything that helps those whom we charge with stopping those people carrying out their evil tasks in this society will be useful. That is not only my view; it is that of those we send to police such matters, who say that the single most important thing we can do to protect ourselves against terrorism is to introduce an identity scheme.</p>

 There is a fundamental misunderstanding about this scheme, it would appear, across the Opposition Benches. I know what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party&#146;s position is, but I ask him rhetorically whether he supports the e-passport system. If he supports his party&#146;s policy, he will. The national identity scheme is necessary to underpin and support that e-passport system. Any UK citizen who wants to travel in the 21st century will require an e-passport.

 Another flaw in the SNP local income tax policy is uncovered daily, and this particular one relates to the policy&#146;s alleged fairness. An answer to a question in the Scottish Parliament revealed that 55,000 students would be brought into paying local income tax. Of course, all those students are exempt from paying council tax. I have a series of quotations from student leaders indicating how unfair the policy would be, but I think that we all know how unfair it would be. It is bad enough that we did not know that it would affect those students, but we do not know how the money would be collected, and those are only two of the several major flaws in the plans for local income tax.</p>

 On local taxation in Scotland, the Secretary of State will know that the UK Government confirmed in 1997 that council tax benefit would form part of the Scottish block. That was repeated in the funding statement published by the Government in October 2007. Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that if the Scottish Government proceed with changing the nature of local taxation in Scotland, this Secretary of State will hold fast against the Treasury and ensure that the UK Labour Government do not denude Scotland of the &#163;400 million that it gets to offset local taxation in Scotland?</p>

 To all but a very small minority of people, it appears quite clear that if there is no council tax, there is no need for any council tax benefit. The SNP&#146;s fundamental problem with the policy&#151;there are many other problems&#151;is that it promised the people of Scotland that it would unveil a tax system that would be fair, but it has unveiled a tax system with a number of manifest unfairnesses, and it is seeking to cover them up by trying to access a benefit that relates to the taxation system that it said was unfair and that it wanted to remove. That does not make any sense.</p>

 The Treasury, no doubt in consultation with the Justice Secretary, has said, along with several legal experts, that a tax that is set and collected on a Scotland-wide basis would not be sufficiently local to remain within the powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

 Of course I have responsibilities in relation to the devolution settlement; they are set out in law, and I intend to fulfil them. In my experience of practising law, it is always unwise for a person to anticipate what they will be asked to express a legal opinion on, and if one asks five lawyers for a legal opinion, one gets six different opinions. In my position as Secretary of State for Scotland, with those responsibilities, it seems wise to wait to see the legislative proposals. I have, in the Advocate-General, access to one of the leading lawyers in Scotland. I rely on his advice regularly. He will give me advice, and if it is necessary for me to act on it, I will do so.</p>

On that first day, 1 September 1939, many Polish aircraft were destroyed on the ground, in the German forces&#146; dastardly attack. But those Polish pilots did not just give up; they came to this country to continue the struggle against fascism. Some 145 Polish pilots defended the skies during the battle of Britain. Polish 303 Fighter Squadron claimed the highest number of kills of any squadron during the second world war. In total, eight Polish fighter squadrons formed within the RAF claimed 629 axis aircraft destroyed by May 1945. Older citizens of this country remember those brave airmen and their gallantry, but it is difficult for people of my generation to remember their contribution. I hope that my Bill will remind them.</p>

Polish cryptographers played a leading role in the project at Bletchley Park, a fact not generally known. Later today, I shall donate a book to the Library on the role that Polish cryptographers played at Bletchley. According to the Foreign Office, 45 per cent. of all intelligence reports from continental Europe came from Polish informants. Many of those brave Poles were sent back to Poland by the British security forces to spy on the Germans and to bring valuable information back to Britain about armaments production and all the other things that the Germans were doing. Poles fought with the British in Monte Cassino, north Africa and Arnhem. Britain let them stay after the second world war and they have contributed ever since.</p>

Most Poles are extremely hard working and law-abiding, and make a tremendous contribution to this country.

controversial immigration from other parts, always referring repeatedly to Polish immigration. I have undertaken a study of BBC coverage of immigration. Those hon.

If what is being done to Poles was being done to a black or other ethnic minority group, it would simply not be tolerated. I demand that the Commission for Racial Equality also focus on white ethnic minorities in this country, so that nobody is penalised or made to feel like a scapegoat. As chairman of the Conservative Friends of Poland group, I have come across many cases pointing to increased violence towards Poles in this country.

 The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) is entitled to come to the House to ask us to recognise the contribution made by Poles in this country. I unreservedly do so.

I was at school with Polish youngsters in mid-Wales, where they had settled, as they did in other parts of the country. However, I do not think it a well conceived idea to introduce a Bill to give a bank holiday to recognise one group of people, however eminent, who came and served alongside us in this country.

The Czechs also supplied brave people. As you will know, Mr. Speaker, people of other countries&#151;not eastern Europe, but other parts of Europe&#151;specifically came and helped in our struggles.

there are others who came from different parts of the world and gave fantastic military service, such as people from many of the islands of the Caribbean. Large numbers of people from India and what are now Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka served in our forces. People from most African countries in the empire&#151;not just South Africa, but the poorest countries such as Sierra Leone&#151;served with great distinction. People from other parts of the world also came.

There are probably a dozen other major countries from all over the world that are with us in Afghanistan to this day, and contributing&#151;for example, the Baltic states, Ukraine and Denmark provide troops.

 Exactly&#151;but I digress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000204">There have been three major reports, in quick succession, on volunteering: Baroness Neuberger&#146;s wide-ranging and excellent Commission on the Future of Volunteering; the Morgan inquiry, which looked at the barriers that discourage young people from volunteering; and, yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition launched our radical and groundbreaking policy paper on voluntary action in the 21st century. The latter is very much the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), who has immersed himself in the subject for some years and is widely regarded in the sector as a serious authority on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000205">Every week, millions of people across Britain volunteer their time for others, providing indispensable personal care across the country. Less than half of those voluntary groups receive any income from Government, and most of them simply would not exist without the work of volunteers. A survey of 59 hospices has concluded that the value of volunteering to the hospice movement as a whole is &#163;112 million, which is almost equal to the financial contribution of the NHS. It estimated that for every &#163;1 spent on supporting volunteers, hospices receive a return worth more than &#163;11, so there is a huge return on modest investment. Indeed, few investments can produce such a rich yield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000206">Whole areas of community life would simply cease to exist without volunteering. Local sport is an obvious case in point, as 93 per cent. of sports clubs use volunteers. According to Sport England, volunteer coaches, officials, minibus drivers, match secretaries, umpires, treasurers, stewards and countless other helpers sustain more than 100,000 affiliated clubs with more than 8 million members. The annual contribution to sport is about 1 billion hours a year. The London Olympics, in 2012, will mobilise and rely on the energy of many hundreds of thousands of volunteers specifically for that event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000207">We know that Britain stands well in international comparisons of volunteering. It is unclear exactly how much volunteering is done, as different studies show different numbers, but we are exceeded only by Norway, among comparable countries, on the number of people who do any volunteer work. About half of Norway&#146;s population are volunteers, compared with about 30 per cent. of ours. However, if one measures the number of volunteer hours rather than the number of volunteers, we slip down the ranks to fifth among comparable, developed nations. We compare rather less well with Sweden and the Netherlands, in particular, on the contribution that is made by volunteers. They are well ahead on volunteering as a share of gross domestic product. Those figures suggest that there are very different patterns in different countries, as one would expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08060476000208">In Britain, lots of people do some volunteering, but a smaller proportion here than in other countries volunteer regularly. Volunteers are spread pretty evenly across age ranges, with no huge bias in any particular range. Women are twice as likely as men to volunteer, as are those who describe themselves as religious. The Charity Awareness Monitor independent quarterly review shows that except for a few shallow peaks and troughs, the level of volunteering has remained essentially unchanged at a little below 20 per cent. To add to that confused picture, while some volunteering organisations say that they are reaching saturation point, others warn of a shortage.</p>

 Is my right hon. Friend aware of the excellent work being done by the third sector and volunteers in prisons and youth offender institutes? They are going in and helping youngsters, in particular, to rebuild their self-esteem. Above all, they are giving them the confidence to go out and find work when they leave prison. Is he aware that many volunteers are put off by the over-onerous and over-bureaucratic work of the Criminal Records Bureau, which puts in place obstacles that surely should not be quite as tight as they are?</p>

<p><a name="st_o109"><a name="08060476000210"><a name="80604-0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="08060476000993"><b>Mr. Maude:</b>
 I shall come to exactly that concern. I was going to mention the work on penal reform and the incredibly important work that needs to be done to address our appalling rates on the reconviction and reimprisonment of prisoners. My hon. Friend puts his finger on an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000211">Some parts of the volunteering sector have as many volunteers as they need, whereas others warn of a shortage. That indicates that episodic volunteering is flourishing, rather than the kind of long-term commitment that most volunteering organisations seek. Youth organisations such as the scouts and guides are, happily, growing fast, but they are finding it hard to recruit enough leaders to cope with the serious growth in the number of young people who want to take part in those activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000212">There have also been shortages in the public service. The number of special constables has dropped sharply in the past 10 years. The National Trust reports an increase in volunteer numbers but a decrease in the amount of time that the average volunteer can contribute. At the same time, there is evidence that some existing volunteers are taking on ever more responsibilities. It is not surprising that in a Volunteering England survey of charities, 86 per cent. of respondents said that their priority was to keep existing volunteers rather than to search for new recruits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000213">A fantastic amount is being done, and nothing that we or any other party proposes should in any way diminish our recognition and celebration of that. Every volunteer whom I meet&#151;I expect that other hon. Members have found the same&#151;passionately wants more people to volunteer and volunteers to do more.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend pay tribute to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, whose headquarters are just outside my constituency? The RNLI is a great example of how a national charity can not only raise funds but perform an important service, rescuing up to 22 people a day. It succeeds because it is independent of Government interference.</p>

 The RNLI is an amazing national institution that carries out a crucial public service in an exemplary way. My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point: the fact that the RNLI is able to raise that funding and to use volunteers to the extent that it does puts it in the happy position of being independent of government. The pluralism to which that contributes is a crucial part of a free and civil society. I am grateful to him for drawing attention to that point.</p>

most powerful ways of doing that is to persuade volunteers of how much they can personally gain from volunteering.</p>

 I totally agree, and I shall come to that point, which has been addressed in our policy paper that was published yesterday. There are great benefits not only for the employees who give their time to volunteer, but for employers. I shall return to that point towards the end of my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80604-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000218">We support the Government&#146;s desire to build on what already exists, and we share many of their ambitions, but I want to look at their record. I do not want to be churlish or partisan, but there are some differences of approach that it would be only right to highlight in the debate. In recent years, there has been a bit of a tendency for Ministers to launch one &#147;eye-catching initiative&#148;&#151;as Tony Blair used to describe them&#151;after another to boost volunteer head count. There is a suspicion&#151;these are not my words&#151;that many of those initiatives amount to little more than a launch, a lunch and a logo. Despite the evidence that a culture of volunteering has to be grown from the bottom up, the Government have slightly tended to prefer a top-down approach involving high-profile Government initiatives. Rather than investing in the grass roots of volunteering, there has been a tendency to create more public bodies that, from the top, aim to change what happens.</p>

 I noticed that catchy phrase, &#147;a launch, a lunch and a logo&#148; on page 22 of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s document. Will he give us some examples of initiatives that he thinks have failed in that sense?</p>

 I am coming to exactly that point. An example would be the Experience Corps. A volunteering initiative was set up by the Government. It was aimed at retired people&#151;a splendid objective&#151;but it greatly underperformed in relation to its targets and was subsequently abandoned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o116"><a name="08060476000221"><a name="80604-0005.htm_spnew9"><a name="08060476001000"><b>Tom Levitt:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman might not be aware that, in three weeks&#146; time, I shall be hosting the annual event of the Experience Corps in the House. The organisation has certainly not been abandoned. When it was set up, it was intended to be a three-year programme, but it is now in its eighth year. It deals not only with retired people but with people over the age of 50. We have a problem with this year&#146;s event, in that it is significantly over-subscribed by hon. Members who are working with the Experience Corps to draw attention to the work of older volunteers in their constituencies. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would like to congratulate the Experience Corps, five years after Government support for it finished at the end of the programme, on still being a thriving and active organisation.</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but my understanding is that the Experience Corps has not met the targets that were set for it, and that the Government have had to come back and chop and change in a way that has been disadvantageous. I am delighted that lots of our colleagues across the House are going to attend the event; that is very good news. However, that organisation is an example of the kind of top-down approach that does not always work.</p>

It is still establishing itself, and so far, its impact has inevitably been limited. I made a visit in my constituency that was set up by v in order to show me exactly what it did. I visited a voluntary organisation based in West Sussex, and I am afraid that I came away from it without any sense of what v was doing that added to an initiative that was already busy and successful.

There are new initiatives in my constituency and elsewhere that are being helped along by v. I hope that the right hon.

They said that they were not quite sure why v was there or what it was adding. Perhaps, in time, that will change, but that concern was raised during the commission&#146;s work.

As we know, that is much more honoured in the breach than in the observance. We are saying that there should be at least the possibility when that happens for voluntary and other organisations to make a surplus in what they do. Part of the problem is that it is much too difficult for really outstanding organisations that have found innovative and successful ways to address a particular problem to replicate that in different places in the way that a private sector organisation naturally would be able to do.</p>

 On finance, in Shropshire many volunteers are senior citizens and people on very low incomes. They play a vital role as volunteers, but due to a lack of support from the Government to Shropshire country council, the council is struggling to give those people enough money to pay for their mileage in covering very large distances in a rural county such as Shropshire.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point about full cost recovery. Clearly, both sides wish to see a relationship where services are delivered in common, where common aims exist and where there is a professional relationship between the third sector and the public sector, but one of the problems with full cost recovery has often been the inability of third sector organisations to judge properly the full cost element. They are building up that experience over time. Throughout his document, the right hon. Gentleman decries the professionalisation of the sector. It seems to me that we cannot keep the values of amateurism while being good in terms of administration and accountancy.</p>

 I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman says and I am delighted that he has had the chance to look at our document, but he is wrong to say that we decry professionalisation. We talk about it and say that the lessons of growing professionalisation are unclear. If we are to see the sort of growth in the sector that we believe to be essential for the strength of our society, organisations need to be efficient and professionally run. We do not have the slightest problem with that.</p>

 There is a real nub to this debate and my right hon. Friend is on it now: whether or not the state sees the voluntary sector as an add-on to the work it does, or as a viable, separate entity that it will help and support in the areas where it works. When Beveridge designed what we call the welfare state, he wrote a third paper in response to the introduction of the welfare state by the then Labour Government. He warned that the voluntary sector would be subsumed into the welfare state, instead of being viable and separate in its own right. Think of the private sector. We write off vast sums of money from small businesses in taxation and do not ask them to pay the money back when they fail. They get huge write-offs. When it comes to the voluntary sector, we say, &#147;There is only a year&#146;s contract. Give us full cost recovery. If you can&#146;t do that, goodbye.&#148;</p>

moderate and thoughtful response from his Back-Bench colleagues. I do not want to be partisan. This is a good debate without particular doctrinal differences, but we need to explore differences of approach, which are important. If the approach is, as ours is, that to address many of these powerful social challenges requires the work of third sector organisations, voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises, the question properly to be raised is, &#147;Where will the additional capacity come from?&#148;</p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) has mentioned, one is our support for the long overdue moves being made to improve the Criminal Records Bureau checks system. Such moves have been recommended. We know that confidence and morale can be destroyed by bureaucratic hurdles and burdens. It is important to understand that Britain&#151;society&#151;will lose volunteers who are fired up and enthused, and who want to get on with things, if they find themselves parked for weeks while the bureaucracy creaks its way through the checks, because, all too often, the moment will have passed, the spark may have died and the enthusiasm may have waned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o136"><a name="08060476000255"><a name="80604-0006.htm_spnew8"><a name="08060476001020"><b>Jeremy Wright (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con):</b>
 This follows up the point that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk made. There clearly must be a case for simplifying and speeding up the CRB process. Does my right hon. Friend agree that, given cases such as that of a constituent of mine who underwent all kinds of checks to enable him to be employed at a young offenders institution, only to be told that he would need another CRB check when he approached the scouts to offer to help on a Thursday night, we should, at the very least, ensure that one check will suffice for all similar activity?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. It is painful, it kills the spark and it takes the edge off things when people who are fired up and want to get on with volunteering are suddenly told, &#147;You can&#146;t do anything for five weeks because we have to go through this whole process.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80604-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000257">We will also act to clear up any remaining confusion surrounding the rules on volunteering and benefit claimants, so that misunderstandings on that front do not dissuade potential volunteers. We also want to exclude any notion of compulsory volunteering, which is, of course, a contradiction in terms. There is a sense that the Government, frustrated by the failure of their volunteering campaigns to deliver the growth for which they hoped, are displaying a bit of a tendency towards making volunteering compulsory in some circumstances. There is a hint of that in the Education and Skills Bill, which proposes volunteering as an enforced alternative to work or education&#151;even v, the Government&#146;s own youth volunteering organisation, is aghast at that. We are also concerned at the apparent Home Office plan to force volunteering on new immigrants as part of its probationary citizenship scheme.</p>

young people who are members of a youth or sports club are twice as likely to have helped out in their community as those who are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80604-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000260">Meanwhile, many pioneering companies&#151;this deals with the point raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas)&#151;from John Lewis to KPMG, have begun to establish volunteering as a social norm of working life. They give their employees an entitlement to volunteer, and a small number of hours that they can use during the year to add to their own time spent volunteering. KPMG, for example, allows each employee 3.5 hours of firm time per month to volunteer, and last year, KPMG people contributed more than 38,000 hours to the community. The company recognised that their volunteering commitment is a major factor in giving it a competitive edge in retaining vital staff and recruiting the top people of tomorrow. Therefore, that is an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80604-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08060476000261">As we know, social norms cannot be legislated for, but the Government can lead by example. I would like to refer to a final proposal today. The Conservatives would make a start by allowing every central Government employee eight hours&#146; volunteering during employed time a year. That is perhaps not a huge amount, but when one adds up all the hours, one finds that it amounts to a big contribution. I applaud the Government for being very ready to pick up our ideas in recent months, so there is one that we have prepared. What a great contribution to national volunteering week it would be if the Minister were to announce in his speech that that is yet another Conservative idea that the Government intend to implement.

 The hon. Gentleman is right.

colleagues, Departments and others to ensure that they understand and implement the new Government policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000287">We welcome the report by Baroness Morgan, which was mentioned by the right hon. Member for Horsham, on volunteering by people on benefits. It includes further ideas and suggestions. We will consider them and see what more we can do to ensure that we ease volunteering into the role of a route into work for workless people. Many of us can think of projects and examples where that has been the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000288">When it comes to expenses, benefits and CRB checks, volunteering is getting easier, but if one listens to the right hon. Members for Horsham and for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) one would sometimes think that the only thing the state should do is get out of the way. Those are almost the same words as were used earlier. I do not agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000289">That takes me to my second point. We need actively to support volunteers and the small voluntary organisations that bring them together. Let me say how. Often, volunteers work for very small community organisations&#151;we all have examples in our constituencies&#151;often with no paid member of staff and little or no access to funds. For those very small volunteer-led community projects, a small amount of money can make a huge difference. That is why we now have a new programme, announced in last year&#146;s Budget, to provide small grants to the smallest community organisations. The grassroots grants scheme will give grants of between &#163;250 and &#163;5,000 over the next three years to small volunteer-led organisations based in the heart of our communities. In July, we will announce the local partners who will give out the money, and I hope to se the first grants go out to those community groups in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000290">Embedded in the programme is an endowment component. Part of the money for the grassroots grants will create new endowments in every area of the country. That is a fundamentally new approach that has not been taken before by any Government and will create a sustainable source of small grant funding in every area of the country. The endowment funds will never be spent, but the interest generated by them will provide a supply of small grants to small community groups in every part of the country. That is an extraordinary new and ambitious way forward, and I hope that it has the support of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08060476000291">Volunteers are often deeply rooted in their community. That is what makes them so effective. They do not always hear about the best ways to recruit other volunteers and to ensure they are used effectively. That is why in November 2007, as part of an overall &#163;11 billion a year investment in education, employment and training, the Government opened up the flagship Train to Gain skills programme not only to paid staff of voluntary organisations but to volunteers. I want to use the debate to encourage all third sector organisations to access the Train to Gain funding pool to help to upskill their staff and volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000292">Last March, we announced &#163;4 million to train volunteers and those who manage them. That is why our GoldStar programme, which started in 2005, is working nationally and locally to spread good practice in volunteer management, going out to local and voluntary sector groups and providing them with training and support. I want to pay tribute to Baroness Neuberger for her work with the independent Commission on the  <br>

Future of Volunteering&#151;members of the commission have already spoken in the debate&#151;which has drawn attention to these issues. She is a tireless champion for volunteering and is viewed with huge respect&#151;some would say fear&#151;across this House and in the wider volunteering community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000293">Not only small grants and training, but active support can be needed when people want to volunteer but need an extra bit of help to do so. If someone is disabled, has no formal qualifications or faces other barriers, they can be left trapped and isolated without a helping hand. That is why Government programmes such as Volunteering for All are so important. They help to dispel the myth that volunteering is &#147;Not for people like me&#148;, spreading the message that volunteering is truly for all and that it should become part of the DNA of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000294">Our most significant investment is in the future of volunteering. Strong habits&#151;such as volunteering, taking responsibility and taking part in the community&#151;are best started early, so over three years, the Government are investing &#163;117 million in the independent charity v. The remarks made earlier by the right hon. Member for Horsham, which were critical, were unwise and, as he must know, inaccurate. So far, v has created more than 210,000 volunteering opportunities and it plans to deliver more than 500,000 more in the coming years&#151;I hope that answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes). That is a way in which we can encourage hundreds of thousands of young people to engage in a variety of youth-led projects and initiatives across the country, to get involved in their communities and to make a difference. Once they have that habit, I think that they will keep it for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000295">It is important that we reward and recognise the contribution made by volunteers. The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green was wrong to say that we should not recognise and celebrate the work of volunteers, although I do not think that he quite meant it in that way. I was at Buckingham palace only a few days ago to watch the volunteers and groups of volunteers receive the Queen&#146;s award for voluntary service. Those awards were presented by the Queen, and other members of the royal family were present, and those who came to the awards were over the moon at the recognition of the value of the contribution made by those often unsung heroes. Although it is not the only thing that we should do, we should not underestimate the importance of giving such recognition to individuals who play a part in their communities.</p>

 I did not say that volunteers should not be rewarded. I said that debates in the House tend to be about who celebrates them more. The truth is that they do not need that much celebration from politicians. They need a lot of action to help free them up to get on with things on the ground. That was my point.</p>

 Before the Minister leaves the point about on-the-ground assistance to small voluntary organisations, will he deal with this point? I am sure that he will accept and appreciate the huge contribution that community amateur sports clubs make to local communities by encouraging participation in healthy pastimes, particularly for young people, who are diverted away from antisocial behaviour. Will he join those Members, some of whom are in the Chamber today, who are campaigning for tax relief on junior sports club contributions?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. I regret the fact that as a Member of the Government I am unable to speak on behalf of the Chancellor, but my hon. Friend has made a powerful point that I am sure will be heard in the Treasury as a proposal for encouraging more people to volunteer, not least in the world of sport. Volunteers in sport and the arts play a huge role through not only increasing participation, but the wider benefits that that participation brings. Young people become engaged, gain greater skills and are diverted from antisocial behaviour into social behaviour. They learn to gain skills and self-confidence as a result. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point out the wider benefits of volunteering in a range of ways.</p>

 Follow that, as they say. I chair the national strategic partnership for volunteers in sport, which represents 3 million to 5 million sports volunteers across the country. Does the Minister recognise that most organisations that are set up to look after the voluntary sector do not necessary regard sport as part of the traditional voluntary sector, and vice versa? Most of us in sport tend to regard ourselves as helpers rather than volunteers, so some of the structures do not quite match. I know that some work is being done, but we need to look further at bringing that right down to the grass-roots level so that voluntary sector organisations are cognisant of that slight difference of approach to volunteering and what it means to individuals.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we need to find better ways to connect those in the world of sport who are involved with not-for-profit organisations in sports clubs up and down the country that take part in and encourage participation in sport to be seen as part of the whole community of the third sector. We must ensure that our policies and programmes reflect that.

a large infrastructure body that we support and fund as a strategic partner to embrace a whole wealth of organisations in not only the world of sport, but the world of art.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08060476000304">The Conservative party has been talking about leadership. The right hon. Member for Horsham concluded his speech by talking about volunteering by civil servants. Indeed, I think that he briefed the <i> Daily Mail</i> that</p>
<a name="80604-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="08060476000815"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tories accept that a day off a year is only a first step&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08060476000305">He talked about eight hours today. However, on that first step, he has fallen over. Every civil servant in every central Government Department already has the right to paid time off for volunteering. Those in the Cabinet Office have the right to three days a year and in some Departments, such as the Home Office, the right is to five days a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08060476000306">The right hon. Member for Horsham will have welcomed our moves to help not just central civil servants, but all public sector workers, including doctors, nurses, police and teachers. Thanks to a new &#163;13 million fund that we announced in March, they can now volunteer in some of the poorest countries in the world without losing their pension contributions. I am sure that he will welcome today&#146;s announcement by the Cabinet Secretary that we have established a cross-Government working group to promote volunteering in the central civil service. I am delighted that, rather than us adopting Conservative party policy, the Conservative party has caught up with something that has been Government policy for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000307">We have a great track record on volunteering, and we are working with volunteers and voluntary organisations to push back the frontiers of what they can do. However, volunteering does not exist in isolation. There are two debates that affect it deeply, but they have met only silence from the Conservative party. The first is on money. When questioned, the right hon. Member for Horsham felt unable to tell the House that total public funding for the third sector has more than doubled in real terms over the past decade from less than &#163;5 billion in 1997 to more than &#163;10 billion according to the latest figures. That record investment is a proud achievement of a Government who are working in partnership with the third sector to ensure that it continues to thrive and succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000308">There is more than that, however. This comes down to a philosophical divide: do volunteering and the ethic of volunteering get weaker or stronger when public services are well funded? Labour Members know the answer. Volunteers complement good funding. If one talks to them and hears what they are working to achieve, there is no doubt that they are helped, not harmed, by good public services. Indeed, the Conservative party&#146;s publication shows that countries with high public spending have lots of volunteering. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Norway. Volunteers add most to gross domestic product in the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, and the countries with the largest number of volunteers are Norway, the UK and Sweden.</p>

Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), the Conservatives&#146; policy chief, who is writing the party&#146;s manifesto. He let the cat out of the bag while speaking to the NCVO in February. The Conservatives do not believe in a strong society that supports services that enhance that society being paid for fairly through taxation, even though the international comparisons suggest that volunteering thrives in societies in which public services are strong and collectively paid for.</p>

Does he believe that we are hearing from Conservative Members a proxy for compassionate conservatism, the like of which is espoused by George W. Bush? My hon. Friend does not have to take my word for it. The man who coined the phrase &#147;compassionate conservatism&#148;, Michael Gerson, said in the <i> Washington Post </i>in March that what the Conservatives were doing was the &#147;reincarnation of compassionate conservatism&#148;.</p>

 There is a philosophical divide, not least when we think about the wider role of volunteers. When volunteers see for themselves that something needs to change, do they feel able have their voices heard and to campaign for those changes, or do they worry that if they speak up against the way in which law works or public policy affects the people whom they help, they will find themselves on the wrong side of the law or cut out from decision making regarding the public services about which they care so much? Volunteers are not motivated by plugging the gaps where public services fail. They are motivated to change those services through speaking up for the people affected, campaigning to change the law, being involved in the design of services that could make all the difference, and working towards ensuring that new services are the right ones that are properly funded by all of us through taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80604-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08060476000313">When we have clashed with the Conservatives here and in other places on campaigning, their discomfort has been palpable and their silence deafening. Although there is no mention of the issue in the report that they published yesterday, we remember when charities such as Oxfam were afraid to campaign because the Conservative Government were disapproving. I see volunteers acting as advocates for those whom the system has let down, and acting not only as individuals, but as a group, to change the system altogether. One great example was the mass movement of volunteers who were mobilised through the Make Poverty History campaign.</p>

 The Minister talks about philosophy, but before he gets too carried away with the way in which volunteers see the Government, will he explain why there is so much criticism from the grass roots of volunteering about how the Government are handling volunteers, using them in the public services and pushing them towards targets? Will he explain why those people complain about how they are being controlled, and why volunteers feel that they are unable to contribute to their fullest because of the way in which the public sector drives them at the Government&#146;s command?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman cannot deny what his party has published about the future role of volunteers and the third sector. The publication makes it clear that the approach is not about setting volunteers and the third sector free, but about abandoning them to work in some of the areas of the country with the greatest challenges. That is the wrong way to go about things. The philosophical divide between us is on whether volunteers and voluntary organisations should be left to cope on their own&#151;isolated and without support&#151;or whether there should be a genuine partnership among ourselves, the third sector and volunteers to create new ways of responding to needs, not least those of the most needy individuals and families in our society with the most challenges.</p>

 There is a fundamental difference, and I welcome a debate on it. The Minister has just let the difference slip out. In all his extolling over the past five minutes of the virtues of the voluntary sector, he concentrated hugely on its ability to campaign for change in the public sector. At no point did he address the point of delivery and what people are doing to change radically what is happening on the ground by changing and saving lives. He did not talk about the small voluntary sector that works against the odds because local government and its officials are often inconsiderate of what it does and do not take a huge interest. Those involved fight to get funding from the sector because they cannot control it, or the organisations are subjected to tick boxes, targets and lists, and feel that they are taken over. The fundamental difference is that Conservatives say that these people need to be set free and to be given real opportunities and access to money, but not to be lectured to and directed by the Government, whereas Labour talks about direction and campaigning at the top.</p>

 First, the hon. Gentleman is wrong. Secondly, the compact was introduced in 1998 by the Labour Government&#151;10 years ago. We have appointed a new commissioner, Sir Bert Massie, who is hugely respected in the sector. I congratulate Richard Corden, the new chief executive of the commission for the compact team, who will drive forward ways of strengthening the compact, so that it works across Government and in local government, too. A key part of the Government&#146;s contribution to strengthening the third sector&#146;s ability to deliver was the introduction and promotion of the compact. I am glad that we might have cross-party consensus on that, at least. The hon. Gentleman is just wrong.</p>

 We have heard that it is Conservative policy to free up voluntary organisations to do what they do better, but we see in the document that has been published that under a Conservative Government, cognisance would have to be taken of the reputation of the lottery when it came to giving lottery funding. Does my hon. Friend think that those two policies combined would help organisations that set out to help asylum seekers, refugees or people with HIV/AIDS? Does he think that their cause would be enhanced by those policies? I certainly do not.</p>

Member for Horsham a copy of the Budget so that he can read for himself how charities can now bundle together donations under &#163;10, so that they do not have to list all the individual donors on the claim form&#151;a major step forward in reducing bureaucracy. Charities with small claims will no longer be penalised for errors in record keeping. Charities with a good record of bookkeeping may soon be able to self-certify. All that comes about after our discussions with charities on how to make the system work, and individuals can already give oral declarations rather fill in a form. He and his party make warm noises about getting rid of paper trails, but they have no ideas to contribute. The truth is that we are cutting out unnecessary paperwork. I challenge him now: would he abolish the need for a record of declarations&#151;for an audit trail for more than &#163;800 million of public money&#151;or does he admit that he was creating false expectations by promising action when there is nothing that he can deliver?</p>

Let me send the right hon. Gentleman copies of the reports by v, the independent youth-led charity that we have already mentioned, which works with hundreds of other grass-roots volunteering organisations to deliver volunteering opportunities. Those opportunities are directed not by Government, and not even by organisations, but by young people themselves. I can send him our press release of 31 January on the small grants programme, which, as I said earlier, will support voluntary organisations, not through a Government body but through local funders with grass-roots knowledge and experience of grant-making in their area.</p>

They are uncomfortable with charities&#146; disruptive, campaigning voices. They are unbriefed on the facts of Government policy.

 I got the constituency wrong again; I meant the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark). I am terrible at constituencies. I sincerely apologise. The event was in Newcastle.

The feeling was that that line should not be crossed. We heard from volunteers and volunteer groups that the focus must be on additionality, not on substituting what professionals and public services should deliver. That is an important message to underscore, because it seems that there is tension in the way in which the Government relate to the public sector and public services. Voluntary sector organisations are trying to cope with that tension, and are working out what role they should play. The issue of independence has been stressed throughout the debate.</p>

communicated far better. Perhaps at some point the Minister will clarify the position. I am not sure that he recognises the need for expenses to be paid up front. It does not work if someone who has no resources, particularly a young person, has to pay and go through a reimbursement cycle. The problem needs to be taken on more directly.</p>

We heard that repeated today. May I raise with him the issue of the Official Secrets Act? As other hon. Members will know, prison visitor volunteers struggle with requirements to sign the Official Secrets Act in the course of their activity. There are many small bureaucratic issues that interrupt the process of volunteering. CRB checks are only a small part of that.</p>

The focus of both reports is on enabling people to volunteer and removing obstacles so that people can make a genuine choice whether to volunteer and how best to do so. I am glad to see from the Green Paper that they issued this week that the Tories have finally dropped the idea of compulsory volunteering, which always seemed to be a contradiction. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon.

In order to graduate from high school, it is necessary in many schools there to perform what is called voluntary service, but that is not very voluntary. As it is regarded as part of the curriculum, most youngsters find some way to do it more in the breach than by actively engaging. When volunteering becomes embedded as a necessary part of the curriculum, there is always the risk that that will undermine the spirit of community and engagement that should be part of a healthy volunteering community. Opportunity within the education system makes an enormous amount of sense, but compulsion, whether it is back-door compulsion or front-door compulsion, is not a particularly attractive characteristic.</p>

 I fully accept what the hon.

I honestly cannot say that that was of serious educational benefit or an addition to his skills, but he was able to craft it in such a way that it probably sounded quite good when the written CV was issued.

There is a hesitation on the part of charities and voluntary groups more broadly to engage those individuals. I hope that we can get better guidance to make it clear that that is a resource that we can turn to, because there are often incredible skills in the asylum community. We can argue about issues of immigration and asylum, but we have not used the skills of people willing and sometimes almost desperate to become engaged in some way, because the boredom of living day to day with no activity is utterly shattering and destroying.</p>

Ironically, however&#151;the statistics do not bear this out, perhaps because of a flaw in statistics&#151;small businesses in my community value volunteering because they already see themselves closely engaged with the community. I do not find resistance from small businesses; the large business organisations, which feel that things have to be put on a more formal basis, struggle rather more.</p>

 I do not question the intent or the fact that it has done good work. However, I am cautious because of a much broader, more fundamental point about the health of a democratic society. We live in an environment where the tendency for many decades has been to pull power to the centre. That has always been done with good intent&#151;&#147;We know better&#148;; the removal of London government might be one of the dramatic examples, but centralisation has continued under the Labour Government in a number of ways. A healthy, democratic society needs centres of power and influence that are outside the remit of central or local government.</p>

By definition, civil society should not be fully co-opted into Government. When we go overseas, we see civil society as key, for example, to delivering aid in a way that will not be influenced by the local Government&#151;frequently because we think them corrupt, biased or whatever else. We see civil society as incredibly necessary as a mechanism for challenge; we want it to be an authentic voice of the people. There is real risk if we try to grasp it, draw it in and co-opt it. I am concerned about that and about the approach that says, &#147;Let&#146;s put civil society in the Cabinet.&#148;</p>

 To set the hon. Lady&#146;s mind at rest, I should say that we want the office to be for civil society, not of civil society. It is important that all the incredibly valuable activities that we all wish to flourish and prosper should get support from the Government; much of this debate has been about how that should happen. What we propose does not in any way try to co-opt civil society into the Government. In fact, the very reverse is true: we see the independence of the body as crucial to its future thriving.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady surprised by the inconsistency of the Conservatives&#146; position?

They are putting those groups at risk. I am thinking, for instance, of the Phoenix club in my constituency.</p>

In my own constituency there are groups such as&#151;they have these terrible, old-fashioned Victorian names&#151;the Barnes Workhouse Fund and the Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity. They have been crucial to the survival of our small charities at a time when the large charities&#151;the premier league of 18 or so major recipients of Government funds through various contracts to deliver services&#151;have managed to use the increased base to thrive and grow, while many of the smaller and middle-sized charities have struggled, and a few in my community have closed. From time to time, charities will close. Their purpose will disappear, or somebody else may start to deliver the service better. However, that is not the case with these groups, and I am glad that there is a nod in the direction of creating an endowment body that can continue to give life to this sector, which has been generally under-recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80604-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000372">The Minister made a point of the importance of Government providing investment in and support for charities. However, let us all recognise that the requirements for monitoring and accountability, the application process and the ongoing reporting process are often such that they are virtually impossible to satisfy unless one has a significant staff of people merely to push the paper. I am thinking of inappropriate demands such as a charity for the homeless being required to justify its geographical reach by providing the addresses of the people who attend it&#151;an inept monitoring mechanism if ever we were to choose one. Small charities probably use volunteers to the maximum because they use them in so many broad roles and because they are so often spontaneously driven by the concerns of local people.</p>

I hope that we can make this debate in large part a celebration of national volunteering week and a recognition of the extraordinary work that so many people do.</p>

They have set up an organisation called Digital Outreach, which is a consortium comprising a private sector enterprise called Collective Enterprises Ltd. and three major national voluntary organisations&#151;Community Service Volunteers, Age Concern and Help the Aged&#151;which have come together to provide a service that only the voluntary sector can provide.</p>

That is a unique collaboration: public sector responsibility, private sector organisation and third sector delivery coming together for a one-off cause&#151;it will not be required again after a couple of years&#151;to deliver something of great value to our communities. That is the epitome of partnership between the sectors these days, and it is only the latest of many examples of that to celebrate.</p>

I welcome, too, the call from both Opposition parties for less bureaucracy and for encouragement and enjoyment of volunteering for its own sake, and, modestly, along with the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), the support from across the House for the report by the Commission on the Future of Volunteering. The Minister&#146;s formal response to that report clearly shows that there is momentum for a healthy future for volunteering, if we can deliver together on our side of the bargain. We cannot guarantee outcomes for the sector, but we can make its life easier and give those in the third sector generally opportunities to succeed at what they have set out to do where they have chosen to match and to work with the statutory providers.</p>

There is no reference to the report in the motion, and I wonder whether the Conservatives were entirely pleased with its reception in the press. I noticed yesterday&#146;s whirlwind tour to Harlow and other places picking out different bits of the report.

 I am aware that those comments were made in years two and three of the Experience Corps&#146; work.

They really do not like the Big Lottery Fund, do they? They are going to replace it with a voluntary action lottery fund. Their justification for that, however, does not make sense. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) has corrected me on this matter in the past, but at the last general election they were committed to 25 per cent. of lottery funding going to each of the four good causes, which would have led to a reduction in funding for voluntary sector causes. I understand that that is no longer the policy, and I accept that, but that is part of the heritage of the process.</p>

Bye bye&#151;you won&#146;t get funding from the Big Lottery Fund.&#148; In the &#147;Breakdown Britain&#148; document published by the Conservatives in 2006, they talked about consultation on where funding should go, and of having referendums on where it should go.

In that document, the Conservatives hinted that assets that they calculated were worth &#163;35 billion, which were collectively held by the major charities, should be disbursed. That does not appear in their new document as far as I can see, but I should be grateful if, when he winds up the debate, the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells confirmed that that is no longer his party&#146;s intention, or at least that that recommendation in &#147;Breakdown Britain&#148; has not been taken up, because that would be disastrous. Let me ask the House, how could a small, local organisation do what, for example, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People did when, working as a partner with the Department of Health, it delivered a &#163;95 million programme to provide digital hearing aids through the NHS? That could not have been done by a small, local voluntary organisation; it had to rely on a larger body.</p>

I was on the management board of the citizens advice bureau in my constituency in the early 1990s, when the CAB was threatened with loss of Government funding&#151;it received grants directly from the then Department of Trade and Industry&#151;if it continued to challenge Government policy on matters such as benefits. That was wrong. It was an abuse of power by the Government of the day. I am delighted to say that legislation was not needed to correct that&#151;all we needed was a change of Government&#151;but when the Prime Minister tells the country that the voluntary sector is the voice for the voiceless, we must listen. I am certain that my colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions listen to bodies such as the citizens advice bureaux, because their feedback on how Government policy is or is not working is essential to our understanding of the effect that the Government are having on the people whom we have the privilege to govern.</p>

companies. Established by the Charities Act 2006, community interest companies are run, often by volunteers, for purposes that are wholly consistent with those of the voluntary sector and are not directed by Government at all. Their work is very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08060476000406">The image of volunteering has been modernised as its depth and diversity have increased. It is much more organic than the brigade of charity shop volunteers, volunteer drivers and fete organisers who have been mentioned. It includes trade union activists, magistrates, special constables and all those people who came together to make poverty history in 2006. The sector also delivers a huge proportion of this country&#146;s residential care and funding for medical research and the lifeboat service, and it acts as a champion for children, disabled people and animals. Voluntary action can be passive&#151;signing petitions or postcards, or sponsoring a fundraising event&#151;or active. The services that volunteers provide can be stand-alone or complementary to services provided by the public sector; they can even be integrated within public sector provision. I challenge anyone to go for an out-patient appointment at a typical acute hospital and not encounter several volunteers providing key services as they always have done, whether by raising money for a new machine, making tea, selling flowers, or carrying X-rays from one department to another. Volunteers are everywhere, and any policy on the voluntary sector must recognise its huge diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08060476000407">Where I want to praise the Conservative document published yesterday is on its unequivocal statement that voluntary action must be voluntary. I have written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families about that, and I believe that I have received an undertaking in response to the sector&#146;s worry that by integrating volunteering too far into the curriculum, its voluntary nature is lost, which can reduce the quality of the experience. Although it is difficult, by and large schools manage to encourage and practise active citizenship, which is not quite the same as volunteering, although it certainly includes volunteering. We must find ways to encourage, promote and give young people opportunities to experience active citizenship without treading on the sector&#146;s toes and making people volunteer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000408">My conclusions on what I want to see in future come in several sections and I suspect that they will find favour on all three Front Benches. In service provision, it should be easier for the voluntary sector to compete with the private and public sectors, either through contracts or through partnership. Means should be found better to ensure that full cost recovery is built into such contracts&#151;at the moment, that cannot be guaranteed, in part because of the skills set available in the sector. The length of contracts should be extended&#151;that has happened and is happening, but it should continue. Now, the lottery sometimes gives five-year grants for programmes, instead of the three-year, two-year or one-year grants that used to be the norm in local government. Local government now has three-year funding, so there is no reason why it should not fund local projects on a three-year basis, rather than the traditional one-year basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000409">The next group of conclusions deals with the other funding of volunteering, outside service provision. Better communication is needed within the sector and between the sector and its partners to ensure more  <br>

equitable and transparent access to grants and funding streams. It is essential that the sector has a healthy organisational core and a diverse funding base. I am excited by the some of the work that has been done on endowments, and the organisation that I chair&#151;the Community Development Foundation&#151;is working with the Office of the Third Sector on that and other schemes. Endowment, combined with social ownership of assets within communities, is a way to ensure independence and sustainability of funding, especially for smaller organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08060476000410">We need to find ways to promote both giving generally and payroll giving. A minute ago, I said that we should not force people to volunteer, but let us make it a bit easier for them to be payroll givers, especially in the light of the welcome announcement in the Budget that the effect of the reduction in income tax will not be felt on gift aid for three years. Nevertheless, it will be felt in three years and we need to find ways in which to mitigate that. If we have changed the basis of funding by that time and, through diversity of funding, are not so reliant on gift aid, so be it. If gift aid is so big that the difference will not cause much damage, so be it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08060476000411">We must fulfil our responsibility to promote volunteering as an end in itself. It is a healthy thing for people to do. I find that the communities that do not work are those where the community and voluntary sectors do not exist. That is as true in developing countries as it is in parts of Britain. We need to do more work to encourage the voluntary sector in some of our developing country partners, where resources are often not recycled in the community in the way in which the voluntary sector can achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08060476000412">I applaud the moves that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, of which I was not aware, on the five days&#146; volunteering in some Departments. Let us keep on with that, encourage other employers to take&#151;dare I say it?&#151;an American approach to volunteering and make corporate commitments, which people in companies deliver in their own time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08060476000413">There must be absolute clarity at the interface between benefits and volunteering, and improved user-friendliness of the Criminal Records Bureau system.

However, I find it difficult to forget that someone, who shall remain nameless, once said that there was no such thing as society, and I do not intend the House to forget it. As Members of Parliament, we all know that we have thriving voluntary sectors in our constituencies and we ignore them at our peril. We engage with them because they are what citizenship is about and because that is what we should do.</p>

I suggest that he read our excellent report on social justice, which was launched yesterday. Above all, the incident is a clear reminder that people in Sir Clive&#146;s position must remain impartial, despite their political leanings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08060476000417">To volunteer means to offer oneself or one&#146;s services by choice and without being forced. The Government do not force people to volunteer, but once they have volunteered they are often forced to do things that they would not choose to do. They have to tick endless boxes, for which they cannot understand the need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08060476000418">On the Isle of Wight, we are very fortunate. We have a strong community spirit and many people become involved in voluntary work. I witness at first hand the astounding work that volunteers carry out. I know that, without volunteers, many islanders would be stuck. That is why I support my right hon. and hon. Friends&#146; attempt to strip away the endless and often mindless bureaucracy that handicaps those who are simply trying to help others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08060476000419">The Government seem to mistrust anything that they did not invent and seek to control and micro-manage it into submission. The voluntary sector has been corroded little by little, leaving well-meaning souls wondering what they have done wrong. The work that they carry out has been underrated and undermined, and their roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-on-with-it mentality has been replaced with red-tape handcuffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08060476000421">If we want our communities to stay strong and our society to flourish, we must allow volunteers to get back to basics and get on with what they do best&#151;volunteering, without the interference of Whitehall. From school governors drowning in paperwork to scoutmasters jumping through hoops for the Criminal Records Bureau, we need to let people who want to help others simply get on with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08060476000422">The YMCA on the island has just carried out research on young volunteers for the rural community council. It identified overbearing bureaucracy as one of the key factors that put young people off volunteering, as well as a lack of understanding of its value. I think that those two ideas are connected. If one gives one&#146;s time voluntarily, one wants to feel that one has made a real difference to somebody&#146;s life, not merely become involved in a paper-chasing exercise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08060476000423">The research also demonstrated that smaller organisations succeed better in utilising volunteers by keeping paperwork and bureaucracy to a minimum. We need to encourage that. After all, if we do not succeed in attracting young people into volunteering, our society will never regain the idea that volunteering is valuable and useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08060476000425">We should recognise the need for longer-term contracts so that organisations can plan for the future with certainty. Local government and national Government get to know the work of charities and voluntary bodies over time. They should be able to trust them to make good use of public funds. There should be more grants and fewer contracts. If one trusts an organisation to do a good job, one does not need to specify in minute detail how it should be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08060476000426">When contracts are needed, they should be based on outcomes rather than processes. It should be recognised that those organisations are rather special. Model contracts should be available so that successful smaller charities can have the chance to put public money to good use. They are currently often excluded from the process because they do not have legal expertise and cannot afford to employ staff to ensure compliance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08060476000427">Volunteering can take many forms. All hon. Members have taken part in and benefited from the voluntary ethos. Where would our political parties be without those who stuff envelopes, lend their gardens for social events, such as the annual True Blue party in Seaview, and trudge the streets in winter and summer? I do not believe that there should be more public funding of political parties. It could never replace such involvement and commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para31"><a name="08060476000429">I do not suggest that the Government are not well intentioned. We all recognise the vital part that volunteers play in our society. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations estimates that the annual benefit to the UK economy of volunteering is &#163;27.5 billion. That is irreplaceable. Volunteering is also an enriching experience for those who take part. As well as knowing that they are helping others, volunteers often benefit from learning new skills and finding a new circle of friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80604-0010.htm_para32"><a name="08060476000430">To be fair, the Government are facing up to some of the problems. For example, they are making moves to improve the system of Criminal Records Bureau checks. I applaud that, but they need to move faster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000433">This has been a good debate, and we have broadly stuck to the convention of recognising that the major parties share a great deal on volunteering, and so gleefully falling on our differences and spending a lot of time exploiting them. This debate has been given spice by the publication yesterday of the excellent paper by my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) on volunteering, which threw those on the Government Benches into something of a tizz. Now that the Conservative party speaks extensively on social issues, the Government think that tanks are being parked on their lawn. They therefore respond, forgetting that it was not their lawn in the first place&#151;it is more like a common, which we have all occupied, but on which the Labour party occasionally squats and pretends to claim exclusive rights, which it has never had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000434">Consequently, a frisson of excitement is still felt among Labour Members when we take them on, drawing on the vast experience of Conservative Members and representatives, and people throughout the country who support the Conservative party who have always been involved in social issues and are pleased to see their party speaking out on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000435">I shall come to the Minister&#146;s remarks shortly, because they have required me to alter somewhat those that I was going to make. I noticed that he fizzed like a decent bottle of Spanish cava when my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight talked about the need for the Government to stand back and not get involved. That reminded me of a quotation from someone who gave evidence to the commission. We spend a lot of time saying what we think about volunteering, but the commission amassed a great deal of evidence in the past 12 to 18 months from people actively engaged in volunteering. Their comments deserve a hearing, in order that they are not missed. I have a lovely quotation here, on page 39 of the evidence, from an elected member of a public sector organisation:</p>
<a name="80604-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="08060476000822"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Keep out of it&#151;let the organisations get on with doing what they are doing. Don&#146;t put so much red tape on them and just let them do what they want to do. Any structuring and you will lose what volunteers you have. Why should I spend my free time taking a lot of stupid orders from a lot of bureaucrats, when I could be retired and sitting on a sun-drenched beach?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000436">I suspect that the sentiment that my hon. Friend expressed is not held solely by him or Conservative Members, and that it was not the impression that the commission formed, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08060476000437">I shall return to the evidence later. By taking on my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), the Minister sought to project an image of the Government&#146;s relationship with the voluntary sector with which he is entirely comfortable, but which is not shared by the sector. I do not minimise things that are going well or areas where the voluntary sector is working entirely comfortably, but the sector wants to take on the Government on a number of issues. I hate the phrase &#147;a sense of complacency&#148;, but there were elements in the Minister&#146;s response to my hon. Friend that smacked a bit of, &#147;I think we&#146;ve got it right and I&#146;m not listening to anything else.&#148;</p>

a local authority, and I was also on the Morgan inquiry. Most of the remarks in the document that he quoted are almost exactly the same as the sort of comments that I heard 20 years ago about local authorities or the Government getting off people&#146;s backs. That is the nature of the voluntary sector. However, does he accept that it is also our responsibility, as the funders, to require a certain amount of accountability for those funds? If the voluntary sector wants us off its back, so that it can go its own way, that is fine&#151;indeed, we should leave the sector alone as far as possible. However, we all have a responsibility, as parliamentarians and in local government, to require those projects to be accountable for the public funds that they use.</p>

 As the great Tony Hancock once said in &#147;Hancock&#146;s Half Hour&#148;, &#147;Do you know, that could&#146;ve been me talking.&#148; Of course, the hon. Gentleman gets it absolutely right. A lot of the comments made by the voluntary sector about the Government could indeed have been said about any Government, because there is a necessary tension in the relationship. I want to bring out the fact that, because the Minister sought to emphasise the difference in approach between the Government and us, he missed the fact that some of the issues being raised by the voluntary sector are partly due to the approach taken by the Government. Therefore, they have a special responsibility to deal with the situation. However, the hon. Gentleman is of course correct that there are always tensions and accountabilities.</p>

 I can confirm that the hon. Gentleman and I spent an enjoyable 18 months on the commission. I hope that he, like me, will welcome not only the outcome of the commission, but the Government&#146;s response, which was positive and supportive. To put the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) asked slightly differently, if the Government want something done and make money available to do it, it is surely quite legitimate for a voluntary sector organisation to have to make adaptations in order to take advantage of that funding. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that mission creep should only ever come from the voluntary organisations, rather than being imposed on them.</p>

 In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, the Government&#146;s response to the commission was indeed good, but Julia spent so many hours with the Prime Minister that the dear man was probably browbeaten and could only respond generously to what she had said.</p>

If the parameters are set and the voluntary sector is given the opportunity to take on a role that has been broadly set out by the Government, that is all well and good. However, we have picked up a concern that the requirements, rules and targets set out under a Government course of action for which money is available to the voluntary sector have gone a little too far. The Government should be warned about that, and I hope that my colleagues have picked that up as something that we would not do when we get the opportunity.</p>

to what has been a good debate&#151;let me say that, like most colleagues, I draw much of my experience of the voluntary sector from my constituency. It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to those who work in our constituencies in a voluntary capacity.</p>

Carers in Bedfordshire is a service set up by Yvonne Clark, a dedicated woman, to look after those who care not only in my constituency, but throughout the country, and to provide a meeting point where best practice can be spread for such work. Headway is the organisation that looks after those with head injuries. Chris Batten does remarkable work with them. I was fortunate to run this year&#146;s London marathon on behalf of St. John&#146;s hospice in Moggerhanger and Sue Ryder Care. My wife has chaired Home-Start in Bedford for many years.</p>

Sport does so much for so many people who are looking for guidance, and I echo the comments made by a number of others about the need for more adult volunteers to coach and to get involved. What youngsters need most is for grown-ups to be involved in what they are doing; that is what they are looking for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08060476000447">I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight, as we would all do, in thanking the volunteers who work for us on the street, supporting political parties. That is not the most popular form of voluntary activity. I regret the fact that MPs being the target for popular attacks reflects on those who give their time to work for political parties, making it harder to recruit them and making it difficult for them to feel valued for what they do. Those who put many pieces of paper through people&#146;s doors, as they have recently in Crewe and Nantwich and as I believe they will do shortly in other parts of the country, are to be immensely valued. We very much appreciate what they do.</p>

We found volunteering to be in rude health throughout the country, and we found exactly what hon. Members have spoken of&#151;tremendous commitment from individuals to what they are doing and no need for direction from any great authority. Those people are committed to what they are doing because of their wellspring of need to respond to their neighbours and build a better society.</p>

volunteering, they have found an opportunity to train, give to others and ensure that a cohesive society, which is not the same thing as the state, is working effectively. We are all delighted that we found that, and I have no wish to go over the statistics that colleagues have already referred to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000450">Psychologically, volunteering is crucial for a society that is obsessed with work and the working culture, as well as the number of hours that people devote to them. It is essential that there is another outlet for our energy, and volunteering fulfils that remarkable need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08060476000451">A number of barriers were mentioned by those we spoke to, which have nothing to do with the Government and are not their responsibility. Lifestyle is one. I represent a rural area and a rural community. There are fewer jobs in rural areas than there were. Think of the change in the nature of society over the last 50 or 100 years. People commute more and spend more time travelling. No longer do they finish work locally at 5 or 6 o&#146;clock, have their tea and get ready to go out and contribute to local activities. They get home at half-past 7 or 8 o&#146;clock. They are tired. After they have eaten, the evening is gone. We are all suffering from the problem that that causes, in that there are not enough people who are able to commit themselves to such activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08060476000452">The problem of sustainability was mentioned earlier. People cannot make a long-term commitment to do something day after day. I spoke to the leader of Bolton lads&#146; club, who told me that the club, which has about 3,000 members, is successful because, &#147;We operate whenever the schools don&#146;t. Every night of the week, every day during the holidays, we&#146;re there, because we can rely on a large number of people to give us time day after day.&#148; It is not like running a youth club once a week or once a fortnight, with attendance inevitably dropping off. There is that commitment from volunteers, which means so much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08060476000453">I shall come to rules and regulations, red tape and health and safety in a moment. The onus placed on trustees is much greater than it used to be. It is harder for some people to accept the obligations, because they suddenly realise that they might end up more committed&#151;financially and in other ways&#151;than would have been the case some years ago. Being a trustee of a voluntary group is no longer the job it was. That issue ought to be looked at by Members on both sides of the House to see whether we can in some way relieve people of those responsibilities. That matter was referred to more than once in the evidence given to the commission.</p>

I think that the Minister was too defensive, perhaps because he was stung by the document that we have produced. He deserves to listen a little to what those involved in voluntary activities think of what is happening out there. A section in the results of the public consultation is entitled, &#147;The relationship between Volunteering and Government&#148;. Some of it is positive. Page 88 deals with positive experiences. However, pages 89 to 113 set out a rather different story of problems that volunteers experience, which they put down to things that the Government might do something about. They include the planning  <br>

understand that&#151;but the Minister, in his determination to have a go at a document produced by my colleagues, which he has barely had a chance to consider, was over-optimistic in his view of how the voluntary sector views the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08060476000465">As the hon. Member for Loughborough rightly pointed out, much of this criticism could be directed at any Government. If we were in government we would have to take full note of the views of people who spend their lives in organisations, either as volunteers or as employees. I would be disappointed if we glossed over criticisms and did not accept them as being genuine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08060476000466">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) observed that the philosophical difference between our parties related to the intention of volunteers. It seems to me that the Government focus on their importance in relation to the process of delivering services, while we concentrate on their importance in relation to the end product. What matters is the quality of services delivered to the people for whom we are concerned and for whom we have responsibility. Are those services effective? In broken-down families, is the necessary work being done to mend people and keep them together? Are old people helped by what we are trying to do? This is not about a process, but about outcomes. I think that too often the Government concentrate on the process&#151;hence their self-admiration in the context of the amount of money given rather than what is actually delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08060476000467">My colleagues&#146; approach to the document published yesterday indicated our interest in using the freshness of voluntary groups&#151;large and small, but in many instances community-based&#151;to deliver what they do best without being excessively trammelled by Government targets, regulation and direction. Yes, there must be accountability, but we must not lose that freshness of approach. According to what we hear from voluntary groups, they feel that the Government have overdone it&#151;for all sorts of reasons, but perhaps because they cannot quite let go in this sector as in others. That is the main difference between us. My hon. Friends have responded to that desire for freshness&#151;the desire to allow people to do what they do best; the desire for the professionals to be professional in public services, and for the volunteers to deliver what they know so much about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80604-0011.htm_para31"><a name="08060476000468">I believe that we can set those people free. If the Government do not listen to the criticisms coming from the sector, they will miss an opportunity to do something rather better in the couple of years remaining to them. We will make the very most of that opportunity on the basis of the information that the voluntary sector has already given us.</p>

 It is a pleasure to be able to mark national volunteering week with a debate on the subject. It is good that the Government did not table an amendment, thus enabling us to unite on a motion that draws attention to the contribution made by voluntary organisations, and specifically by volunteers, to our national life.

but the real contribution lies in the transformation of the lives of the people whom we see in our constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000470">The great attraction of today&#146;s debate is that although not many Members have had a chance to make speeches or intervene, we have been given so many examples that capture in a microcosm the widespread contributions made by volunteers. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) spoke of the great work done in prisons to get people back on to the road and to prevent recidivism. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) told us of the signal contribution that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, free of any requirement to do what it does, makes to our national life. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) talked about the Scouts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000471">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) praised the work done by charity shops, but also referred to more quirkily named charities such as the Barnes Workhouse Fund. Its Victorian name may appear somewhat archaic, but I gather from the hon. Lady that it continues to do fantastic work. The hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) mentioned the RNID, a national charity. It was clear from what we heard that, from national level to a very small level, the sector makes a colossal difference. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) took the prize in listing the litany of organisations with which he is involved: the Sea Cadets, the Bedfordshire carers, Headway, the hospice movement, Sue Ryder Care and Homestarts, with which his wife does such great work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000472">All that demonstrated the great variety of contributions that we have the opportunity to make through volunteering. One of the unsung contributions to our national life is made by volunteers in the public services. Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for example, has pioneered the use of volunteers in the delivery of care and making life better for patients. The Kent and Sussex hospital in my constituency has just embarked on a pilot enabling volunteers to become &#147;supper-time companions&#148;, giving their time to be sociable with patients who may have no one to talk to during the day and ensuring that they have company, which is good for their morale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000473">The debate has given us an opportunity to record our appreciation of the work of the voluntary sector, and in that context I found the tone of the Minister&#146;s opening speech slightly regrettable. We were careful to table a motion that was not partisan and reflected broad cross-party support, but he seems to have the knack of rendering divisive issues on which I think there ought to be a degree of consensus. I think he was wrong to ascribe to a Labour Government in particular the fact that the voluntary sector is flourishing; volunteers throughout the country may well resent the fact that their efforts, voluntarily given, have been described by a Minister as in some way down to the activities of the Government. Those people are there because they have the instinct to take voluntary action, and I do not think they will take kindly to having it usurped by the Minister, in words at least.</p>

the Victorian age for charities, but that half what was in it had already been proposed by the Government. That strikes me as being in the long and admirable tradition begun by the former Deputy Prime Minister, who famously said that the green belt was a Labour achievement and that we must build on it. If the current Prime Minister is seeking a replacement for that much-missed figure, he may have found one in the Minister if he continues to make statements like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000475">We have discussed the contribution that the sector currently makes, and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire spoke of the rude health that it enjoys, but there is still a shortage of volunteers. According to a survey of people who manage volunteers, 59 per cent. said that they experienced difficulty in recruiting enough of them. The Morgan report&#151;an excellent report&#151;said that that was particularly true of young adults, which was confirmed by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate. The Scout Association, a fantastic organisation, has a waiting list of 40,000 children and young people for the Beavers, Cubs and Scouts, because there are not enough adult volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o200"><a name="08060476000476"><a name="80604-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08060476001085"><b>Mr. Andy Reed:</b>
 May I return the hon. Gentleman to what was said by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)? I took part in the Morgan inquiry, and have been involved with the Scouts and Beavers as a helper. I used to help to run a Friday night Beaver session. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many of the constraints that he has mentioned are social constraints relating to the work-life balance? Given that 65 per cent. of people now have an atypical working week, parents tend to do volunteer work for a shorter time before moving on with their children. A generation earlier, people such as my parents would volunteer for 20 years. The problems are social problems that we must work together to eradicate, not just through the voluntary sector but in the wider context of social mobility and the social contract that we have as a country.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is exactly right. The commission has helpfully suggested, and spread the notion, that employers should play their part. If work life is impinging more on what was previously leisure time that could have been devoted to volunteering, perhaps a bit more give and take is required, and people, especially young adults, should be allowed to take time off. That is one of the more welcome contributions, which we have sought to echo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000478">It is concerning that the number of young people who volunteer seems to be static. In an nfpSynergy study, between November 2006 and November 2007, the number of young people who said that they had not volunteered in the past three months had increased&#151;it had done so only marginally, but it had not declined&#151;from 79 per cent. to 80 per cent. It is important to get more people, especially young adults, involved in volunteering. That is particularly true in the volunteering deserts, as they have been described. The parts of the country that would benefit most from volunteering are those where the level of volunteering is half of that in less-deprived areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000479">Committed volunteering is important. It will be fantastic if people try their hand at volunteering this  <br>

week, in national volunteering week, but it is crucial to the running of scout groups, and even more so for organisations such as the Bolton lads&#146; club, which my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire mentioned, to get people to commit to volunteering regularly. I completely agree with the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) that that will require a change in the work-life balance to which people are subjected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000480">Certain issues hold back further possibilities in the sector. For example, we have heard a lot about over-regulation.

Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire served with distinction, said time and again that it had heard stories of bureaucratic hurdles. The motivation for having those hurdles might have been good, but they have degenerated into caricatures of risk-aversion. We must act on that issue. CRB checks are a particular bugbear, so I am delighted to hear that the long-awaited reforms were published today, and I look forward to reading them.</p>

Member for Loughborough served, talked about the rigid package of bureaucracy that surrounds the unemployment benefit system and dissuades young adults from volunteering. It is important that we address that problem. The rules might have changed but the orders have not got out there. In a letter to the Prime Minister, the volunteer centre in Nuneaton said:</p>

For example, it picked up a lot of criticism about several aspects of the Government&#146;s initiatives to promote volunteering. I do not doubt that those initiatives had the best of purposes, and I shall not repeat the quotes that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire gave from the groups that took the trouble to give evidence to the committee, but it is wrong for the Minister to dismiss that point so readily as having being dreamt up or motivated in a partisan way.</p>

both sides of the House made the point that it is important that the party in government should draw back from seeming to suggest that volunteering might be compulsory. We want to spread a social norm of volunteering, so that it happens in all sectors. There are some fantastic examples of companies that give time to their employees to volunteer, and they benefit substantially from that. We have heard that KPMG gives three and a half hours a month, and we have suggested that there should be a minimum commitment across government for eight hours a year. The Cabinet Office rightly makes a commitment to do that, but we need to make sure that, at the very least, everyone knows, across government, that they have the right to take eight hours a year to make a difference to their communities. It is empowering that they should know that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08060476000489">We need to get rid of bureaucratic checks. CRB checks have been mentioned, and we will look at the matter with great interest. Benefit complexity has also been mentioned in that regard. It is also important to recognise training. The Morgan inquiry recommended that the skills that young adults can gain from volunteering should be recognised. In response to the comments of the hon. Member for High Peak, I point out that when we say that that should be owned by the sector, we do not mean to say that it should not relate to the world of employment&#151;far from it. However, we do not think that it should be imposed on the sector by the Government. It should be driven by the sector and by the enthusiasm of those in it.</p>

 I do agree with that recommendation. We have made a suggestion in our report that we should work with the sector to see whether we can develop a system for recognising that training. Training is absolutely key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08060476000492">The question of investing directly in the grass roots has come up, and v has also been mentioned. That organisation has a particular responsibility, because the &#163;117 million of public funds that is going into it over three years is a lot of money. It needs to demonstrate that the value that it offers is proportionate to the amount of public support that it is receiving. The alternative would have been to put that money into existing organisations, such as the Scouts. The Scouts would benefit from having access to even a fraction of that amount, to enable them to employ more development officers in areas where there are not enough volunteers to lead scout groups, and we need to be convinced that that would not be a more effective use of the money. We wish v well, but the evidence to date is far from conclusive. A lot of the evidence given to us and to the various commissions suggests at least that the jury is still out in regard to v. In particular, over the past year, the fact that there has been no material increase in youth volunteering, despite the considerable funding that has gone into the organisation in its first year, gives cause for concern.</p>

end for us in civil society. Volunteers were always the first to open schools and hospitals, and the first providers of relief to the poor. Today, they are still the first to spot patterns of deprivation developing, and problems that need to be resolved. They are still the first to take action on some of the sources of social breakdown. They have always been there first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08060476000494">It is also important to reflect that volunteers are always there at the end. Often, it is volunteers who are there as a last resort when all else fails. They are the last resort for the vulnerable and marginalised people who slip through the net that the state erects to catch them. Outside this country, volunteers are the last gasp of civilisation when Governments have ignored and turned their back on their own people. No sector is more central to our national life, and it is important that we have recognised it today. We have made some suggestions in our Green Paper on how we can strengthen the support and help that the Government can give to the sector. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the debate and thank him for his agreement to make this a cross-party motion today.</p>

 With the leave of the House, I would like to respond to the debate. We have had a good, robust discussion today about volunteering. Last week, I had the privilege of joining users, volunteers and staff at Newark Mind, and of preparing, cooking and eating lunch with them. I experienced at first hand the difference that such an organisation can make to people with mental health problems&#151;the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) mentioned such people in her speech&#151;who are endeavouring to get back into society and to develop their self-esteem and self-confidence. Organisations such as Mind are doing terrific work to bring about a transformation in people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08060476000496">This afternoon, Members on both sides of the House have recognised the value of the contribution that volunteers, charities and third sector organisations are making to communities in their constituencies. I am worried, however, that we are seeing a new tactic being used in the House. The Conservatives published a controversial policy document on the third sector. They then tabled a motion on volunteering, about which there is genuine consensus. But they are expecting to use this consensual debate as a cover for a debate on their policy, because they know that we do not want to break the consensus on volunteering that clearly exists. Well, they are not going to get away with that. If they publish a policy document, their proposals are going to get robust scrutiny, not least from Labour Members and from me, as Minister for the third sector. I believe that their policy is, at worst, flawed and damaging to a thriving third sector, and that it would take us back to a Victorian era of silent and grateful charities.</p>

exactly where the Opposition&#146;s policy is fundamentally flawed, because it does not embrace the full range of volunteering opportunities and the role that the third sector has played in bringing about massive changes over the last century and a half.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08060476000499">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) criticises me, as did the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), for putting on record the success of the Labour Government, under whom volunteering and third sector organisations have genuinely flourished over the decade. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells even suggested that I should be appointed Deputy Prime Minister. That particular suggestion may have some merit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08060476000500">Without wishing to be too tendentious, let me say that the number of registered charities has risen over the last decade from 120,000 to 160,000. The number of people volunteering formally or informally at least once a month has risen from 18.4 million in 2001 to 20.4 million in 2005. Research into charities estimates that turnover has increased from around &#163;16 billion to more than &#163;27 billion over the last decade. The work force has increased by around a fifth. I cannot agree with the hon. Members for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), for Tunbridge Wells or for North-East Bedfordshire that we do not have a strong and flourishing third sector, brought about by the policies to create the environment in which that it can flourish.</p>

 I shall address some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points in a second.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08060476000503">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight confused grants and contracts. The point about contracts is that they specify outcomes and services because they are part of a wider commissioning strategy in which third sector organisations are involved at every stage, identifying user needs, talking about user outcomes and designing services. Where the third sector wants to engage in bidding for contracts, it can deliver those services while holding all providers&#151;third sector, public sector and private sector&#151;to account for their performance. That is why those systems exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80604-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08060476000504">The hon. Member for Richmond Park asked about expenses. Volunteers can get expenses up front, and DWP guidance has stated that. I very much agree that young people in particular need their expenses up front, which is why v has an allowance scheme that has enabled expenses to be paid up front to young people on their full-time volunteering programmes.</p>

That gives me the opportunity to remind the House about the new local government performance framework, which includes two indicators in a national set, one on volunteering and one on a thriving third sector. Two thirds of the 35 local area agreements will have at least one of those indicators as priority indicators to pursue.

In 2006, the Government undertook the largest ever single consultation, involving more organisations, voluntary groups, social enterprises, community groups and charities than on any other occasion in drawing up the third sector review, which spells out a 10-year strategy to ensure that we have stronger communities, better public services, flourishing social enterprises and a flourishing third sector.</p>

I have announced the CRB guidance today, and there is more money for training and more help for disabled volunteers. New benefits guidance is to be published as well. He is right to say that the Prime Minister spent a great deal of time with Baroness Julia Neuberger. One of the Prime Minister&#146;s first acts on being appointed was to appoint Baroness Neuberger as the Government&#146;s champion for volunteering. To say that we have not listened, do not know the issues or have not responded is so far from the truth as to be laughable. Baroness Neuberger has recently produced a groundbreaking report on the development of volunteering in health and social care services and is now working on the role that volunteers can play in criminal justice.</p>

He gave a forensic analysis of the Opposition&#146;s proposals, particularly in respect of how the Big Lottery Fund might be disadvantaging organisations that are doing a good job. He talked a lot about the role of organisations becoming the voice of the voiceless, but he rightly said that we have more to do on ensuring that contracts really do take into account the needs of third sector organisations and that we can do a lot better on employee volunteering.</p>

I am delighted that Justin Davis Smith, the chief executive of Volunteering England, who continues to press us to do more, has said that volunteering has never had it so good.

About two thirds of those pensioners living in poverty are women. Between 1997 and 2006, the number of people living in severe poverty&#151;defined as living on less than 40 per cent. of median income&#151;increased by 600,000. The poorest quarter of pensioner households saw their incomes rise by less than 1 per cent. last year, which is well below inflation. That means that their incomes are dropping in real terms. The worst off single pensioners saw their real incomes drop by about 4 per cent.</p>

that, especially as council tax levels rise so much, would be welcomed in all parts of the House. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000584">In opposition, the present Prime Minister spent much of his time telling the Labour party that it could not promise to restore the link between the basic state pension and average earnings. The Government are the Johnny-come-latelys to the issue. We were the ones who promised to restore the link in our last manifesto. There is a great deal of mythology about the link and the scrapping of it, which we have gone into before and no doubt can again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000585">As I understand it, the Government&#146;s current position is that they intend to restore the link in 2012 or 2015, or possibly not even then if it is unaffordable. We have already legislated in the Pensions Act 2007 to do that. What we need is the trigger to be pulled by the Government. [Hon. Members: &#147;You abolished it.&#148;] I personally did not, but I know what hon. Members mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000586">A couple of weeks ago, the Government had the opportunity to tell the House and the wider public precisely when they intend to redeem that promise. They ducked that opportunity and whipped their Members to vote the amendment down&#151;another example of dithering by the Government. No wonder Age Concern concluded that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08060476000588">There is another problem, linked directly to means-testing. It is the corrosive effect that that has on saving for retirement. Why should people put money aside now when they cannot be sure that they will be better off in retirement? No wonder the savings ratio has dropped to an historic low. The Government are storing up more potential poverty for the future because of the decline in pension saving. The current poverty statistics, as I explained, are significantly flattered by the success of previous Conservative Governments in encouraging private and occupational pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08060476000589">As part of their attempt to repair the ravages of private pension saving since they came to power, the Government are setting up personal accounts. As the official Opposition, we have broadly supported the Turner package of reforms, but we want to ensure that personal accounts are indeed targeted on low and middle earners who have no pension savings. We have argued long and hard that personal accounts could well fail if the level of means-testing is not much reduced from present levels. The Pensions Policy Institute in particular has done a great deal of work to identify the at-risk groups who may be no better off or even worse off by being auto-enrolled into personal accounts. I am delighted that Ministers are now taking the matter seriously and have embarked on a programme of work with us, among others, to tackle the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80604-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000590">When it comes to pensions, confidence is a vital ingredient in getting people into the pension saving habit. Nothing has done more to undermine confidence than the Government&#146;s shameful dithering for more than four years about giving proper compensation to the 160,000 pension victims who lost their pensions through no fault of their own. The Government got there in the end, and should be commended for that, but they should not have taken so long or fought so hard against the move.</p>

Indeed, the Government&#146;s own energy White Paper makes it clear that there is no prospect of their hitting their target of removing all vulnerable households from fuel poverty by 2010.

No wonder the Government are now being taken to court over their fuel poverty strategy by Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth. What do we hear from Ministers?

Conservative Members really expect us to believe that they have somehow changed&#151;that they have been transformed from the hard-faced Thatcherites who removed the earnings link and slashed pensioners&#146; incomes into compassionate Conservatives? They delude themselves that their record of 18 years in government can so easily be consigned to the dustbin of history. Pensioners, above all, will remember. They lived through the Thatcher and Major periods, and they know that at the next election the choice will be clear&#151;Conservative or Labour. The party that broke the link with earnings, or the party committed to restoring it? The party that consigned millions of pensioners to poverty, or the party that has lifted more than 2 million out of absolute poverty? The party that forced pensioners to live on &#163;68 a week, or the party spending an extra &#163;12 billion a year so that no pensioner need live on less than &#163;124 per week?</p>

On taxation, the people involved will be taxed, but will be able to refer that tax back to the period during which they would have otherwise received their payments.

This was, after all, their big chance to launch a new initiative&#151;perhaps something on pension credit or winter fuel payments, or a measure to deal with food prices&#151;but all we have heard today is the same old things. They have flunked the test. They said that they were going to set out some principles, but we never heard any. They claimed that they had changed, that they were different and that they were going to look after pensioners&#151;unlike during the 18 years of Conservative Government. Their thin disguise fools no one. All we have heard is the same old opportunist polemics and point scoring, the same fussy misuse of statistics and, most painful, the same old lack of substance. If anyone had any doubts, they now know that, on pensions, the Conservatives will not make a difference, because they have nothing new to say.</p>

Whether it will go to people aged over 70 is still being discussed. It is now up to the energy companies to take that up as part of their &#163;225 million contribution.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s statistics are not accurate because they exclude, for example, council tax benefit and several other payments such as the winter fuel payment. His statistics, which I have seen cited elsewhere, are partial and inaccurate. Indeed, they suggest that those on low incomes are on much lower incomes than they are. Half of single pensioners have incomes of less than &#163;7,600 after deducting tax, council tax and housing costs. The &#163;6,000 figure excludes, for example, housing benefit and various earnings and investment income. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s statistics are simply wrong.</p>

 I represent a rural area. It concerns me that many people who are in the most difficulty with their fuel bills cannot have gas and rely not on electricity but on fuel oil, the cost of which has gone up massively and will not be affected by the measures that the Government are introducing. They often live in old houses, which are the least amenable to sensible measures for reducing energy loss.

 The supply of heating oil is a difficult issue. The Government still believe that open competition between the companies is the best way in which to try to keep prices down. The Office of Fair Trading monitors the market for the supply of heating oil to consumers. For many years, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has tried to promote connections to the gas network for deprived communities, thereby reducing their reliance on domestic heating oil. That Department&#146;s design and demonstration unit has developed and tested a model for such connections where existing funding is available. Furthermore, the energy efficiency measures that are in place can help to reduce some fuel bills. Ofgem and Energywatch have organised a joint initiative, energy smart, which explores measures that can be taken to improve energy efficiency. I hope that those points help the hon.

do not have a strategy on pensioner policy, simply a way of opportunist point scoring. My old teacher used to say that empty vessels make the most noise. The Conservative vessel is certainly noisy, but it is empty of policy and has a captain who is always chasing the latest breeze.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80604-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000651">Let me now deal with some of Conservative Members&#146; more detailed claims because I welcome every opportunity to set our record against theirs. They say that pensioners are poorer. I will take no lessons on poverty from the Tories. In 1997, hundreds of thousands scraped a living on &#163;68 a week. I remember the then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, simply telling pensioners that they had to wear long johns and woolly night caps to keep warm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80604-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08060476000652">Average pensioner incomes under Labour have risen by 29 per cent. in real terms since 1997, which, importantly, compares with an increase in average earnings of 16 per cent. Pensioners&#146; incomes have therefore risen above average earnings. Pensioner households are &#163;1,500 better off this year than under the 1997 system. We have focused help on the poorest, so that the poorest third are &#163;2,100 better off. That means that pensioners are today less likely to be poor than many other groups of the population. This is the first time that that has been the case. It is not that there are no poor pensioners&#151;there are&#151;but, because of pension credit, winter fuel payments, free bus travel and the other measures that we have introduced, pensioners are less likely to be in the lowest group.</p>

 This is an important point and I glad that the Minister has raised it, because he raised it in questions on Monday. Until relatively recently&#151;I am talking weeks or a couple of months&#151;the mantra from Ministers was that pensioners were now no more likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population. There was a sudden shift in the rhetoric on Monday, when the Minister said&#151;I understand that he has said it again today&#151;that pensioners are now less likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population.

 We have been looking into the statistics, and that is the current position. As we have put in place measures such as pension credit, the income of pensioners has risen, up to &#163;124 in the case of a single pensioner. That is a significant help that other parts of the population cannot access. We heard some other strange uses of statistics from the hon. Gentleman.

 I certainly do want to contest that statistic, because it distorts the poverty data and the EUROSTAT statistics. Because we are a wealthier country, our poverty level in the EUROSTAT statistics is set higher than that for most European countries. That is the way the EUROSTAT statistics are set. For example, the UK poverty line is 13 times higher than Bulgaria&#146;s and seven times higher than Poland&#146;s. Our pensioners are therefore much better off than those in most other countries. When we take into account the basic state pension, pension credit, free TV licences, winter fuel payments and private pensions, our pensioners are better off than those in, say, France, Sweden, Denmark and similar countries. Our pensioners are much better off than those in most other European countries. Indeed, we are about fifth in the league and have moved way up since the Government came to power. The hon. Gentleman needs to be aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000659">Another issue that the hon. Gentleman raised was council tax, so let me say something about that. I know that pensioners are concerned about council tax increases&#151;often, increases come from Conservative councils. We recognise that we need to help the most vulnerable, so this year is the 11th year in which we have increased local authority grants by more than the rate of inflation. By 2010-11, the increase in Government grant for local services since 1997 will be 45 per cent. higher than inflation. Council tax benefit is also important, because it goes to 2.5 million pensioner households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000660">I heard hon. Members&#146; comments on the difference between rural and urban areas. However, I represent a rural area in Warwickshire where, during the mid-90s, when John Major was Prime Minister, we had to join marches against school cuts. Teachers in Warwickshire were losing their jobs hand over fist as a result of cuts in local authority grant to that rural shire county. Under John Major, there was an 11 per cent. cut in policing. Today, police numbers are well up. There are no such marches or demonstrations at the moment, because we are better funding local authorities than the previous Conservative Government did, and if we had policies of the sort that they had, council tax would be even higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000661">We seek to improve how we help pensioners who are paying council tax. Many of them are finding it difficult, which is why it is a priority for us to achieve take-up of council tax benefit. It is encouraging to note that pensioner take-up of council tax benefit increased by 2 per cent. in 2005-06&#151;the first increase in a long time&#151;but we need to get more take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000662">We think that about four out of 10 pensioners still fail to take up council tax benefit. That represents a massive &#163;1.9 billion in unclaimed council tax benefit. The money is there and we are ready to provide it, but we cannot force people to take it. We want to encourage them to do so, and I note the suggestion that local authorities could write much more effectively to local people to achieve greater take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08060476000663">I hope that the automaticity of payments that we plan for this October will boost take-up next year.

restoration of the earnings link. After all, they abolished it in 1983. This Government have enshrined in law their commitment to restoring the link. To make our position clear, we understand the desire for a specific date, but we have indicated that we would wish to restore it in 2012, or during the next Parliament, as the public finances and economy allow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000665">I have to say that this is not just something that we regard as desirable; it is fundamental to the package of reforms that we are taking forward. It is the foundation stone&#151;the building block&#151;for many other reforms, not only in the state sector under the Pensions Act 2007, but in the Bill that we are taking through Parliament. Restoring the link will mean lifting many more people out of pensioner poverty, and we will ensure that people are better off when they are saving on a private pension. That is a fundamental building block of our reform and it will be done&#151;it is the key to our policies&#151;but we need to take account of the wider fiscal and economic conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000666">The Conservatives also talked about other changes. I want to look at some of those. In the 1980s and 1990s, being old was the single biggest indicator of poverty, but under this Government pensioner poverty is down. Our record shows that, today, age is no longer a proxy for poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000667">In relation to pensioner poverty, there is a bigger issue that I want to touch on. We are committed to dealing with pensioner poverty&#151;from Keir Hardie and Frederick Rogers, who led the campaign for the first state pension, to Clement Attlee, who extended the right of a pension to all, and Barbara Castle, who fought for better second pensions for older people&#151;and we will continue to build on their legacy, targeting support on those most in need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08060476000668">Today, the challenges of ageing stretch beyond financial poverty. I want to talk about how our ageing society presents us with new challenges. While it is still important that we address poverty&#151;that must be the first priority&#151;the challenges stretch wider than material well-being. The poverty of experience in old age and people&#146;s lack of control over their own lives need to be addressed. We are developing a comprehensive strategy to ensure that old age is a time of opportunity and enjoyment, rather than merely struggle and endurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08060476000669">Through our public service agreement, we want all Departments and local authorities to ensure that their policies and services better meet the needs of older people. Just as Beveridge identified the five giants he wanted to slay, I shall identify the five giants of old age with which we as a society&#151;not just the Government&#151;must get to grips in the decades ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08060476000670">The first is, of course, poverty. Our second challenge is to tackle the problems of frailty, both physical and mental, so that the onset of dementia or the loss of mobility does not mean that an older person becomes detached from society; rather, their life should be lived with some dignity and some respect. Thirdly, we must tackle discrimination, so that the 70-year-old who is still bursting with energy can continue to work and perhaps re-train in order to volunteer or contribute in some other way as an active member of the community.  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000671">The fourth challenge is to tackle fear, so that older people feel confident in their homes and free to walk in their local streets, taking advantage of the public space that encourages interaction with others of all ages. The recent report by the World Health Organisation on age-friendly cities made particularly good points about that. The fifth challenge is perhaps the most difficult, and relates directly to pensioner poverty. We must tackle loneliness, so that the pensioner who lives alone, often isolated in a flat&#151;talking to no one for a week, watching television&#151;can find out where to go to make some friends, and can be encouraged to socialise or help in the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000672">We need progress on those new challenges to our ageing society, and we will build on our record of tackling poverty to ensure that we deal with them as well. Our Government are committed to tackling poverty and improving the lives of older people. Our achievements since 1997 are in sharp contrast to the empty rhetoric and cheap soundbites of Opposition Members, and my commitment today is that we will not rest here. In 1997 we spent &#163;62 billion on pensioners; in 2008 the figure has risen to &#163;90 billion, and is projected to rise to &#163;264 billion as a result of our reforms. We are the party with the belief, the energy and the passion to do more for our pensioners.

 A Labour Back-Bencher told me yesterday that pensioners had never had it so good. While that may well be the case for some middle-class pensioners who bought their houses in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or 1980s&#151;although they may be starting to get a little worried now&#151;many pensioners are living close to, if not on, the poverty line. Many others are only not below the poverty line because they have undergone a complicated and intrusive process in order to claim means-tested benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08060476000674">I agree with all the points made in the motion, although there is an important omission. It is the one thing on which the Conservatives are holding back: an immediate restoration of the link between pensions and earnings. I shall say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08060476000675">When Labour came to power 11 years ago, they promised so much for pensioners. For some pensioners, life has improved. A huge 4 per cent. fewer of them live in poverty than in 1997, which represents progress, albeit a small amount. On the whole, however, pensioner poverty has remained fairly stagnant under Labour. According to the Government&#146;s own figures, 2.2 million pensioners are living in poverty after housing costs, compared with 2.4 million in 1997. The Minister looks confused, but those are the Government&#146;s figures. That equates to 21 per cent. of pensioners compared with 25 per cent. in 1997. However, given that in 1908, when the state pension was first introduced, 1.3 million people were considered to be paupers, the fact that 2.2 million pensioners in the same age category are now living in poverty strikes me as a slightly worrying trend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08060476000676">There has been some improvement in one area. Because the minimum income guarantee and pension credit are uprated in line with earnings, unlike the basic state pension, fewer pensioners have slipped into poverty. However, the absence of a larger problem is not necessarily much cause for celebration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08060476000677">A big problem with Labour&#146;s approach to pensioner poverty is its reliance on means-testing, which has been mentioned by several hon. Members today. The 2005-06 figures for the take-up of pension credit showed a rate of 65 per cent., or 2.6 million households. The Government estimate that 1.7 million people are missing out, and they are giving up on them by not pushing any further to increase take-up. The Government accept that they are not achieving that public service agreement target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08060476000678">The Department&#146;s annual report, which I am sure all hon. Members would agree makes gripping reading, said that in November 2007, 2.73 million households were receiving pension credit. That is positive, because it was a slight increase on the figure for 2005-06, but it prompts a question about information. Clearly, more data are available to the Department than have been published, and it is disappointing that that information was not made available for scrutiny as soon as possible. It would be interesting to know what other data the Department holds that have not been published.</p>

Members have mentioned the take-up of housing benefit and council tax benefit, although I think we all accept that housing benefit is less of an issue than council tax benefit. According to the 2005-06 figures, the take-up of housing benefit was about 85 per cent., which still left more than 300,000 people who were eligible to claim it but did not. Indeed, the figures were worse in 2005-06 than under the last Conservative Government. The worst of the lot was council tax benefit, for which the take-up among pensioners was about 57 per cent. Therefore, about 2.1 million people in pensioner households were eligible for that benefit but did not claim it. Again, the figure was worse than that under the last Conservative Government.</p>

 How do the Liberal Democrats aim to end pensioner poverty if they are setting their face against targeting help at the poorest pensioners?

the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) has said, it must be disappointed by the number of people who, by its own definition, should be claiming the benefit but are not, and who therefore are not getting the money that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08060476000685">In July 2006, the National Audit Office published a report on Labour&#146;s progress on improving the take-up rate of benefits among pensioners in which it said that the PSA target on pension credit would not be met. Why has it taken the Government two years to reach the same conclusion? The same report suggested that the Government should improve the range of data that they collect on who is not claiming the benefit, and should share those data with the Pension Service and local services so that people in need can be better targeted. The report also said that the Government should allow more local autonomy so that local service providers could better target pockets of low take-up.</p>

Lady quoted and her suggestion that information on the PSA target has not been in the public realm for two years, she should be aware that the then Secretary of State, my right hon.

 If the Minister will allow me to say so, I think that he has confused two different issues that I have raised. One related to the information that the Department holds that is not in the public domain. I also referred specifically to the statistics in the annual report relating to November 2007. On the question whether the target was going to be met or dropped, there is a world of difference between a Minister telling a Select Committee that the target is likely to be missed and the Department actually acknowledging that and dropping the target. Those are two separate things.</p>

 I join the Minister in welcoming the hon. Lady to her new position. Does she agree that none of this is terribly important when compared with the reality that this is indeed a target that the Government have abandoned? There are still 1.7 million people who are not getting the pension credit to which they are entitled. Indeed, when the Government introduced the pension credit, the Treasury calculated that 1.4 million people would never claim it. The Government have therefore always cynically assumed that large numbers of people would never get round to claiming it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08060476000693">Will the Minister tell us, when he winds up the debate later, whether the suggestions made by the National Audit Office in 2006 were looked at and attempted before it was decided to drop the PSA target? The Government appear instead to have focused on gimmicks such as the pensioner Christmas bonus&#151;a generous &#163;10, I believe&#151;which will not do very much to help, with food inflation at its present rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08060476000694">One of the major reasons that pensioners are falling behind the rest of the population is that, since the Conservative Government broke the link with earnings in the 1980s, the basic state pension is uprated only in relation to prices. I concur with the Minister that that is a fundamental cause of many of the problems that pensioners now have with poverty. If they do not qualify for pension credit, they can get poorer in relation to the rest of the population as they get older, as the value of their pension diminishes. The Tories did a huge amount of damage between 1979 and 1997, reducing the basic state pension from 26 per cent. of average earnings to 17 per cent. That represents a huge drop over 18 years. Unfortunately, it has dropped even further under Labour, and it is now just 15 per cent. of average earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80604-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08060476000695">Different European countries have already been mentioned, and I shall now throw another one into the mix. The value of our basic state pension, at 15 per cent. of average earnings, is worse than in the overwhelming majority of European countries&#151;and not just the ones that we might expect, such as Sweden and Norway. That proportion is also worse than in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Portugal. Our basic state pension is worth less in relation to wages now than it was in 1978, 1958 or even 1908.</p>

 It was remiss of me not to congratulate the hon. Lady, my ex-Select Committee colleague, on her promotion when I last intervened on her. Perhaps she is being disingenuous in making these comparisons. She says that the basic state pension in Britain is worse than that of Italy, but I am sure that she knows&#151;as I do, having met some Italian politicians&#151;that there is very little second pension provision in Italy. Almost all pensioners there depend almost wholly on the state pension. The relative wealth of pensioners in the two countries is therefore quite different, and in Britain, our pensioners are much better off.</p>

 I was making a specific point about the basic state pension because, as the hon. Lady points out, there are different systems in the different European countries. In the UK, we rely significantly more on private provision than is the case in some other European countries.

 To put the record straight, the lack of confidence in private pensions came about solely because of the tremendous scandal of the mis-selling of private pensions in this country, orchestrated by the Conservative party when it was in government. [Hon. Members: &#147;Orchestrated?&#148;] Orchestrated, yes.</p>

<p><a name="st_o320"><a name="08060476000701"><a name="80604-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="08060476001205"><b>Jenny Willott:</b>
 I would rather not get into the politics of who did what to whom on private pensions, but there are a number of reasons why people are very concerned about saving in private pensions; mis-selling is one, but there are also examples such as Allied Steel and Wire and other cases mentioned earlier where people lost their pensions. People are also concerned that through means-testing, they will lose out on more than they have saved; the disincentive of means-testing puts people off saving through private schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000702">Women&#146;s pensions concern me. Currently, around 30 per cent. of women retire on a full state pension, in comparison with about 80 per cent. of men&#151;a huge disparity. I know that Members on both sides are concerned about this and everybody wants to see progress made. But 2025 is a long time to wait for equality for women pensioners and millions of women are written off in the meantime. Even with the current pension reforms, nearly 40 per cent. of women will not get a full basic state pension in 2018. That seems to me far too far down the line for us to be making progress. We have a sexist system&#151;designed by men for men&#151;that has, over the decades, been to the detriment of women pensioners.</p>

 The way in which the hon. Lady is using these statistics is questionable. She knows very well that, following the 2007 Act, as from 2010&#151;not so long to wait&#151;75 per cent. of women will become eligible for a full basic state pension. She is right that it will rise over the following decade and a half to 90 per cent., or full equality. But the big jump will take place in 2010 for carers and for women who will be able to get a full basic state pension.</p>

Those figures are higher than the levels under this Labour Government. Income support for pensioners under the Conservatives was worth 18 per cent. of average earnings, whereas pension credit is now worth about 21 per cent. The take-up of income support by pensioners in 1997 was about 65 per cent., which is almost the same as the current figure. The Conservatives did not crack the problem either. Admittedly, they did have slightly better take-up rates of council tax benefit and housing benefit than the Labour Government have achieved, but hundreds of thousands of pensioners still missed out on what they were due.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000722">The biggest error that the Conservatives made was when the former Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, broke the pensions and earnings link in the 1980s. For all the soft words that the Conservatives have spoken on pensioner poverty, they have not made a concrete commitment to reinstate the earnings link at a particular point in time, unlike the Liberal Democrats. Despite the Conservatives&#146; making a clear commitment before the previous election&#151;it was made both by the then shadow spokesman, the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), and in the election manifesto&#151;and despite the fact that they have been pressing the Government on this point repeatedly, they still have not said when they would reinstate the earnings link.</p>

 Not for the moment. The Liberal Democrats would restore the earnings link immediately, so that pensioners stop falling further and further behind the rest of the population, and then we would introduce a radical overhaul of the basic state pension. We would increase it by up to &#163;130 a month for single pensioners, and by up to &#163;220 a month for couples. We would base entitlement on residency, not on national insurance contributions, and that would particularly help carers and women who have taken time out to bring up children. Such an approach would also reduce significantly the means-testing requirements. As well as improving income levels, it would, thus, encourage and support private saving, because it would remove the disincentive that has been introduced by significant levels of means-testing. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) referred to that. Those proposals would eventually remove  <br>

3.5 million pensioners from means-testing, and would reduce the projected levels of means-testing from the current estimate of 40 to 50 per cent., to about 10 per cent. The problems that having such high levels of means-testing will generate have been flagged up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08060476000726">We need to tackle the cost of living for pensioners, rather than just their income levels. As has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members, one of the biggest problems is council tax. Scrapping that and replacing it with a fairer system based on people&#146;s income&#151;the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) discussed that&#151;would make a huge difference to pensioners&#146; disposable income. There are also real concerns about fuel poverty and the cost of other items of household expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08060476000727">The cost of food and fuel has risen significantly, especially recently. Since pensioners spend on average a third of their income on food and fuel, their inflation rate this year is much higher than the national indices produced by the Government. Estimates were produced in January that showed that inflation for pensioners will reach 7 per cent. in 2008. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said earlier, it may be as high as 9 per cent., or more than double the national inflation estimate. At the same time as pensioners&#146; income is falling behind that of the rest of the population, the pensioners&#146; price index is significantly outstripping RPI, and that is a disturbing trend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08060476000728">Fuel poverty is an issue that I have been concerned about for some time, even before I took on my present role. I represent a Welsh constituency and Wales has much higher levels of fuel poverty than other parts of the UK. It is good to see others taking up the issue and I welcome some of the moves that the Government have made recently to try to tackle the problem by working more closely with energy companies. We have already reached a crisis point on the issue. The number of households in fuel poverty has more than doubled since 2004 and the average energy bill is more than &#163;1,000 this year, which is a huge amount for poor families and pensioners to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08060476000729">In 2005, there were 1,500 excess winter deaths among pensioners in Wales alone, so the figures for the UK as a whole are very worrying. People are dying partly because they cannot afford adequate heating, and that should not be allowed to happen in a civilised country such as ours. We need a much more concerted effort to tackle that issue, and I am glad to see the Government taking the first steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08060476000730">The Government have made some progress, but they are grinding to a halt with their abandonment of the PSA target&#151;at the worst possible time, given rising prices, increasing fuel poverty and the basic state pension reducing in value year on year. While I agree with the motion, the important missing element is a commitment to a date for the restoration of the earnings link. The Conservatives are pussyfooting around on the issue and making no firm commitments. Given that the last time that they were in power the situation of pensioners worsened, we have to ask why it would be any different next time.</p>

 I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott). Although she is new to her role, she has fallen immediately into the trap for Liberal Democrat spokespeople on any subject&#151;making unrealisable promises, made because Liberal Democrats know that they will never be in a position to fulfil any of the commitments that they make. It is easy for them, because it is only words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08060476000733">I have a great personal regard for the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) and I always enjoy listening to him. However, I have to say how sorry I am that he has been used as the front man for a Conservative debate on pensions that is one of the most opportunistic debates in which I have ever participated or to which I have listened. Listening to Conservatives bewailing the plight of pensioners is like listening to Scrooge singing, &#147;Have yourself a merry little Christmas&#148;. It does not come credibly from a party that had an appalling record on pensions in the 18 years for which it held office before Labour regained power in 1997. The hon. Gentleman explained to my hon. and learned Friend the Minister how keen the Opposition were to debate pensions, despite the fact that they have postponed the debate twice. The hon. Gentleman did not point out that today is one of the Tory party&#146;s days for choosing the subject, but throughout the debate on this issue, which the Conservatives claim is of such importance to their party, 93 per cent. of the Conservative Members of the House of Commons have been absent. It is their day, and it for them to produce speakers and people to listen to those speakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80604-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000734">As I said, the Conservative voice on pensions is very difficult to accept as credible. For example, we had an intervention from the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who has now very sensibly made himself scarce. The right hon. Gentleman inveighed against the cost of fuel, yet it was him who, as a member of the Conservative Government, voted for the Norman Lamont Budget that introduced the annual built-in fuel tax escalator. As I said during Question Time the other day, there is no point in the Conservatives&#146; staging debates and producing commitments when we look at their record. As Aneurin Bevan said, &#147;Why look into the crystal when you can read the book?&#148; The book of the Conservative party&#146;s record on pensions is one of the most abysmal of those on all the subjects with which it has been involved in the House of Commons.</p>

As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has said, in 1997 the Conservative party left one of the strongest and best pension systems in Europe.

elected, during my first Parliament, we used to have general subject debates on Fridays. I made a political speech and the predecessor of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, Sir Charles Taylor, came up to me at the end of the debate and said, &#147;You are a new Member and therefore I think I should explain to you that we keep politics out of debates on Fridays.&#148; The fact is that the House of Commons is all about politics. Not one of us would be sitting here on either side of the House without politics. When we are elected, we deal with subjects of profound interest and concern to many millions of people in this country, but the very idea that one can debate a subject such as pensions, or the national health service or law and order, without having a political basis for what one is talking about is very odd.</p>

I think that he fought an election campaign as a Conservative candidate and that he talked politics during his campaign.

If they had not done that as a deliberate act of policy, which was announced by their Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, there would be no debate about restoring the earnings link, or when to do so, because it would never have been broken. Breaking the link forms part of the Conservatives&#146; record. Our Government have legislated to restore the earnings link. I wish that they could restore it sooner, but at least they have legislated.</p>

wailing about us not putting right as quickly as some people would like something that the Conservatives put wrong deliberately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08060476000743">When the Government introduced winter fuel payments in November 1997, the Conservative party derided the payments. It said that they were a gimmick and implied that it would get rid of them. It was only when it turned out that winter fuel payments were popular and helpful for pensioners that the Conservative party backtracked. When Conservative Members talk about the value of winter fuel payments and about poverty for pensioners, they must take account of the fact that they are complaining that something initiated by a Labour Government should be improved still further. That is quite true, but let us not forget that without a Labour Government, there would not have been winter fuel payments. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that pensioners know about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08060476000744">The hon. Gentleman complained about the take-up and availability of the Warm Front scheme. Constituents write to me, as no doubt they write to him, about their wish to be involved in the scheme, but who created the scheme? The Labour Government did so in 2000. The scheme never existed under a Conservative Government. For Conservative Members to say that there is not enough take-up of the scheme is for them to admit that the scheme is valuable, which makes one wonder why the Conservative party never introduced it. When constituents ask me to do so, I visit them in their homes to discuss issues if they are not well enough or mobile enough to come and see me at my constituency surgery. When the Conservatives were in government, in winter, constituents would ask me to visit in the early afternoon, because as soon as it got dark they would go to bed, as they could not afford to heat their houses. They lived in misery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08060476000745">The Liberal Democrat party seems to believe that the issue is simply about reeling out a succession of statistics. The issue of pensioner poverty is of course involved with money, but in the end it is a human problem. As hon. Members have said, pensioners are living longer and longer because of the creation of the welfare state and because of the way in which health services assist pensioners. That involves the possibility of pensioners living alone and having to spend time alone. If their relatives do not live near them, they have the problem of loneliness, and the problem of participation in the general life of the community. That is a very important point. There is absolutely no doubt that money is very important for pensioners, but they also need the possibility of company. They need drop-in centres and the availability of all kinds of other facilities to make them feel that they are not on their own and are part of a community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08060476000746">I do not for a moment say that the Government have solved the problem of poverty among pensioners. Of course they have not, and I very much doubt whether any Government will totally solve it, because there are more and more pensioners the whole time. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central mentioned the number of people who were helped as a result of the creation of the old-age pension by Lloyd George. There are now 11 million people of pensionable age&#151;a huge proportion of the population. Their need for the public services created by the state grows and grows.</p>

At the time, there were no spaces in care homes, which the Conservatives had privatised.

This very April we introduced free local bus travel for every pensioner as a right throughout the United Kingdom.

When that is fixed, I go there and I am given the inoculation without a wait at the precise time that has been arranged. I regard that as a dazzling act of efficiency that the Government have been able to achieve.

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08060476000760">However, the numbers themselves do not tell the whole story of pensioners in my semi-rural constituency; they are struggling to run a car, and struggling with rising energy bills and the rising cost of a pint of milk and a loaf of bread. I want to focus on just two themes: fuel poverty and the Government&#146;s addiction to the means-testing of pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08060476000761">Rising energy costs are inconvenient to almost everybody, but they are potentially deadly to pensioners. Earlier this year, I wrote to the chief executive of EDF Energy, which supplies many of my constituents in Braintree and Witham, to ask what steps the company was taking to lighten the load of fuel poverty, which is falling on vulnerable people, particularly pensioners. The response that I received drew my attention to EDF&#146;s very welcome social tariff, which offers a 15 per cent. discount on energy bills for those in receipt of income support or pension credit or who are recognised as living in fuel poverty because they spend more than 10 per cent. of their annual income on energy. Nevertheless, a percentage discount of that kind becomes less and less relevant as the underlying cost continues to spiral upwards. The scheme will need to be kept under review, particularly as some energy suppliers have raised their tariffs by more than 15 per cent. already this year and average fuel bills have risen by 60 per cent. in the past four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08060476000762">I have two further observations, applicable to both the private sector and the Government in their respective responses to pensioner poverty, the first of which is short-termism. EDF, for instance, confirmed that its scheme is guaranteed to continue until March of next year, but not beyond. Similarly, the Government have shown time and again that they also favour short-term solutions to pensioner poverty; this year&#146;s Budget offered another one-off payment for pensioners, who would rather have a sustainable income. I have previously addressed this issue at some length with the Prime Minister. When the Treasury Committee considered the 2006 Budget, I reminded the right hon. Gentleman of Help the Aged&#146;s view of the failure to repeat a &#163;200 council tax rebate for pensioners:</p>
<a name="80604-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="08060476000847"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government issued a pre-election bribe last year but they have not renewed it for 2006. This exposes a shameful level of political expediency&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08060476000763">When I asked the Prime Minister what had changed since the general election, he said</p>
<a name="80604-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="08060476000848"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What has changed is we said in the last Budget that this was for the year and we made no commitment for it beyond that.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08060476000764">Unfortunately, this culture of Government living from year to year, devoid of long-term planning, does little to help the vulnerable pensioners who are living from hand to mouth day by day.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the causes of today&#146;s short-termism is almost certainly the Government&#146;s tight financial circumstances?

headroom to make such short-term measures become sustainable longer-term measures. The reason for their short-term thinking is the financial pressures that they have landed themselves in.</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="08060476000766"><a name="80604-0018.htm_spnew7"><a name="08060476001238"><b>Mr. Newmark:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. This is happening across the board throughout all public services. The pre-Budget report and the Budget showed that the Government are having to make cut after cut, and the people paying the price are the vulnerable&#151;the poorest in our society, particularly pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08060476000767">We have seen all too recently what happens to a Government fearing annihilation in local elections and by-elections&#151;they feel free to make costly electoral bribes with taxpayers&#146; money. Unfortunately, we have also seen the doubling of council tax over the past decade, met with rebates that then vanish after the electoral dust has settled. Now there is an additional one-off winter fuel payment of &#163;100 for 2008-09. There has also been an increase in personal allowances partially to compensate those who lost out from the doubling of the 10p rate, which, again, will vanish when the year is up. The common theme in all the Government&#146;s disingenuous ingenuity is the short time horizon for additional support offered to the elderly and the vulnerable. This is not a helpful approach for those who are on low and fixed incomes and whose savings have been systematically eroded by the Government&#146;s ever-increasing dependence on means-testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08060476000768">My second observation concerns the challenge of increasing uptake. A total of 55,000 people are currently on EDF Energy&#146;s reduced social tariff, although the chief executive was unable to tell me how many of them fell within my constituency. I am glad that the private sector is taking action, and I hope that more will be done to promote uptake amongst pensioners and other vulnerable people. Yet the Government&#146;s response to pensioner fuel poverty has been an expensive awareness campaign through Citizens Advice that is unlikely to reach the most vulnerable pensioners who do not take the initiative to seek such advice. On the DWP&#146;s own figures, between 1.1 million and 1.7 million pensioners are not claiming the help that they are entitled to, and the Department even admits that the numbers responding to its campaigns to increase uptake are steadily decreasing over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08060476000769">More worrying still is the proposal for even more invasive data sharing between the Government and the energy companies&#151;a point eloquently made earlier in the week by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan). If a major energy supplier such as EDF does not hold data that can tell me how many people in my constituency&#151;or in Braintree district, if that is easier for it&#151;already make use of its own scheme, I have little confidence in entrusting it with the personal data of millions of vulnerable pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08060476000770">The elephant in the room concerning uptake remains the Government&#146;s utter failure to address their reliance on the principle of means-testing pensioners. The first question that I ever asked the former Prime Minister, in response to the concerns of the Braintree Pensioners Action Group, addressed that very point and it is  <br>

something that I have since followed up with his successor. The current Prime Minister has told me that,</p>
<a name="80604-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="08060476000849"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our aim is to link tax and benefits for pensioners in a way that there is a seamless transition through the benefit and tax system.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08060476000771">But outside his own parallel universe, the interaction of the tax and benefit system has so many burst seams that the stuffing is falling out completely. The Government are still trying to compensate for the heavier tax burden and higher costs of living facing pensioners by relying on one-off bribes and means-tested benefits that pensioners find complicated and inaccessible. As many hon. Members do, I routinely see pensioners who qualify for means-tested benefits but do not understand their entitlement, even if they happen to receive it, because they are forced to plough through page after page of abstruse computer-generated calculations. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) made that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08060476000772">The Prime Minister has also told me that the complexity does not matter so much because:</p>
<a name="80604-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="08060476000850"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What we have reduced is the amount of means-testing that is done for pensioners.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08060476000773">Bah, humbug! But there are still 3.74 million people over the age of 60 in receipt of means-tested benefits and many more who are entitled to claim but do not do so. Help the Aged identifies a staggering sum of up to &#163;4.5 billion that lies unclaimed each year. Furthermore, half of those pensioners entitled to council tax benefit do not claim it. Once again, there is a disconnect between the Prime Minister&#146;s rhetoric on means-testing and the reality of stagnating uptake, a declining savings culture and an ongoing failure to reach those pensioners who are most in need of additional support. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80604-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08060476000774">As the Government move to the introduction of personal accounts, the reliance on means-tested benefits will pose new problems for a new generation of savers looking towards their retirement. The Government must face up to the need to grasp the means-testing nettle so that people feel confident about saving for the future. The message must be that taking personal responsibility along with a personal account is the right thing for pensioners, and we will not leave them worse off. The Opposition motion is right to call on the Government to deliver on one promise from 1997, but they must also deliver on another: the end of means-testing for the elderly.</p>

 I had not intended to speak today. I intended just to come into the Chamber to hear what the Conservatives were going to say about pensioner poverty. I thought that they would be embarrassed and shamefaced when we looked back at the appalling record of the previous Conservative Government on pensioners and pensioner poverty. In contrast, the present Government&#146;s record is very good. How well we look after the most vulnerable members of society is the mark of a civilised society. This Government have a good record of looking after those vulnerable members, including the poorest pensioners.</p>

 I think it is a case of flip-flopping around. It will be interesting when the Conservatives have to start stating what their policies actually are.

 I want to pick up on some of the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) made in his opening speech. It is worth beginning by agreeing that the Government have done an impressive job of working on long-term pensioner poverty. They have taken some important steps, supported on a cross-party basis and by many people outside this place, to try to alleviate the systematic problems in the existing pensions system. We should acknowledge and celebrate that as an important piece of institutional workmanship, which, I hope, will stand the test of time and provide a solid foundation for reducing pensioner poverty in the long term. It is important to have cross-party consensus on that, and it is worth therefore celebrating the fact that there are reforms to the state pension in the works, including a vital measure on personal accounts, which is currently being considered in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08060494000013">Restoring the earnings link from 2012 or 2015 is tremendously welcome, although we can argue about the timing. Reforms to the arrangements for carers&#146; and women&#146;s pensions have also been mentioned. All those matters are vital and will make a material difference. However, the current problem is to do not with those long-term arrangements, which are impressive, but with a point that the committee of the Weston-super-Mare Senior Citizens Forum made to me. I encourage the Under-Secretary to visit it if he needs a refresher course because it is a feisty and well educated group, whose members will be delighted to discuss some of the problems with him at length.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08060494000014">Those pensioners say that it is all very well trying to put things in place for tomorrow&#146;s pensioners, but ask what the Government are doing&#151;and why they are not doing more&#151;for today&#146;s pensioners. They feel that the progress on long-term pensioner poverty alleviation is not matched to anything like the same extent by that on current pensioner poverty. That is a crucial point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08060494000015">The earnings link will not be restored until 2012 at the earliest. As my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) said, because average earnings will continue rising higher than the state pension in the next few years, the state pension will continue to decline as a percentage of average earnings relative to people in work. That makes it more affordable for the Government, if they delay reintroducing the link until 2012 or 2015, but it also means continual increases in the number of pensioners on means-tested benefits between now and the date when the link is reintroduced. Clearly, we will start from an even worse position than we are in today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08060494000016">The problems of fuel poverty have already been mentioned.

have mentioned, the take-up of means-tested benefits is appallingly low. That is to do with the design of those benefits, as much as the complexity of the forms. I have already mentioned the pension credit form, at 17 pages, but it is worth while mentioning the housing benefit and council tax benefit form, too. That form is 29 pages long and the explanatory notes are six pages long. Although it is true that plenty of people are available to help pensioners to fill in those forms, that does not help with the fact that pensioners find them intrusive and demeaning. It must surely be better to reduce the low take-up rates by redesigning those benefits in a way that does not mean just simplifying the forms, but redesigning the complexity out of the system. That is the only way in which the Government will make progress on improving take-up rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08060494000018">The Government have, I fear, faced a significant problem in improving take-up rates and have already admitted defeat. They have been trying to persuade pensioners to parade their poverty by filling in all the forms, but have failed to improve take-up rates dramatically, as a result of those difficulties. A much more fundamental change needs to be introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08060494000019">Why has the Government&#146;s progress on current pensioner poverty not been as impressive as the longer-term arrangements that they have put in place? My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree put his finger on it when he said, &#147;It&#146;s all to do with money.&#148; The Government&#146;s finances are tighter than they have ever been and their three fiscal tests are under severe pressure. In fact, if we include the figures for Northern Rock, which the Government tend to forget, they have broken one of their fiscal rules. The Government faced problems over the 10p tax fiasco, which meant a one-off fix for this year, which will create additional fiscal pressures next year. As my hon. Friend said, the result is a series of short-term measures that do not allow pensioners to plan for the future or to be certain about their financial arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08060494000020">As the shadow Chancellor has said, the fundamental problem is that, fiscally, the Government failed to mend the roof when the sun was shining. The Under-Secretary will not be able to say this in public, but I am sure that he knows that there should be an opportunity to improve current pensioner poverty; indeed, there would be such an opportunity if there were more money in the Government&#146;s coffers, but there is not. Improving pensioner poverty would surely be at the top of this or any Conservative Government&#146;s priority list, but that opportunity will be lost, because of the financial constraints that the Government are currently under. I know that the Under-Secretary knows that that is a tremendous missed opportunity, which I am sure he would prefer not to have to face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08060494000021">There are, however, two things, which I hope the Under-Secretary will point to, that will help without costing too much money. One of them, which should be fiscally neutral, is to improve the take-up of the key pension benefits that I have mentioned. I am assuming&#151;I hope that he will reassure the House about this in his winding-up speech&#151;that there is a contingency in the Government&#146;s budgets for an improvement in those key take-up ratios. On the assumption that there is, and that the Government  <br>

therefore have the money ready, redesigning those benefits and forms, and improving the take-up rate will make a tremendous difference, particularly to those pensioners in the severest poverty, 60 per cent. of whom are not claiming the benefits to which they are entitled, according to the Government&#146;s figures. If the Government have the money in their budget, that fix, although not simple, would be tremendously effective and would not put the Government&#146;s finances under additional pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08060494000022">The second thing that the Government could do&#151;it would not cost a penny&#151;is to ensure that the scandal of age-related discrimination is finished once and for all. I was particularly pleased to hear questions about that earlier today, in Prime Minister&#146;s questions. Perhaps I was being a little over-optimistic, but I hope that I heard from both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Pensions Reform, in his opening remarks in this debate, that there is a commitment to include measures to abolish age-related discrimination in the upcoming legislation that the Government are preparing. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure us on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08060494000023">Those two measures alone would not put the Government&#146;s finances under any greater pressure, but would make a material difference, promptly and practically, to the problem of pensioner poverty today, not just in the long term.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak towards the tail end of the debate, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08060494000025">I listened closely to the speech of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who made a number of telling points. The first was that the old will always be with us. Of course they will. It is incumbent on politicians&#151;yes, we are politicians with differing views&#151;to ensure that, more often than not, we get it right when looking after those who in the main have given a huge amount to society throughout their working lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08060494000026">We can have political differences over how that is done, but there is not a single politician in the House&#151;on the Government, Conservative or Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;whether in government or in opposition, who does not have at the core of their beliefs a desire to improve the outlook for pensioners. Therefore, I am not going to be partisan in this brief contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08060494000027">Without doubt, pensioners face serious problems right now. In the main, that has to do with problems afflicting the global economy. Fuel prices are going up. A large amount of pensioners&#146; income is spent on fuel, so that increase is hitting them in the pocket right now. Fuel prices are going up, so the cost of food production is going up. That means that food prices are going up, which is also hitting pensioners in the pocket right now. This is not something that will happen in a year&#146;s time; it is ongoing and it is causing financial hardship. We in the House need to come up with a range of ideas to alleviate the immediate pressure on pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08060494000028">There is also the issue with the council tax. One could be a little more political about how the council tax has risen so far in excess of inflation, but I do not  <br>

want to be political. We need to consider how the council tax impacts on pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08060494000029">The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) and the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton also referred to the fact that poverty goes beyond income. It is about a range of other, connected issues. As politicians, we need to examine them in the round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08060494000030">Many elderly people are carers. In my constituency and in many others, elderly people are looking after loved ones who suffer from Alzheimer&#146;s. That puts a huge strain on them emotionally and physically. We need to ensure that that strain is recognised and, wherever possible, alleviated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08060494000031">One problem at local authority level is the ring-fencing of funds. Funds delivered to local authorities have to be spent in specific project areas. I would like far more local democracy to be introduced to local government, so that local government would live or die according to how it spent its money. For example, if the elderly population in Hertfordshire, the county in which I have a seat, were growing and more money needed to be spent on the elderly, and local politicians took the view that that is what needed to happen, the money could be found within existing budgets&#151;I am not asking for more&#151;and the argument could be made to redirect it towards alleviating the issues created around caring for people with Alzheimer&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08060494000032">There also needs to be far better co-operation between the NHS and local authorities on providing integrated support services. The NHS is often quick to push people off its books and out of its beds, back on to the local authority. Again, costing pressures are created, which need to be addressed urgently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08060494000033">More generally, pensioner poverty can be linked to access to health care. Pensioners tend to have less access to cars. When a partner, husband or wife is taken into hospital, the distances that pensioners have to travel to see that person might be extremely large and expensive to cover, and pensioners may have to rely on either taxis, which, as we know, can cost a lot of money, or public transport, which may run infrequently. If they are lucky enough to have a car, often when they get to the hospital, they have to pay parking charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80604-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08060494000034">We need to consider how we deliver health care to our elderly, but also how the people who care for them when they are in hospital&#151;for example, their children, husbands or partners&#151;can visit them in a cost-effective and reasonable way.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has omitted to mention one way of conveying elderly people to hospital to visit wives and other loved ones: community transport. In my area, where the general hospitals are in remote parts of Derby, Leicester and Burton, there are plenty of buses run by community transport schemes, at least part of whose purpose is to take elderly people to hospital for appointments or to visit friends or family. Perhaps Governments could do more to underpin such provision.</p>

local government can play their part in the funding of such schemes. Our local authority, Broxbourne, provides a subsidised bus service to help people to travel to hospitals to visit friends and relatives. I should like such services to be provided in a more joined-up way, rather than just being provided by local authorities with a bit of spare cash. If the Government could give a lead, that would be a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08060494000037">We have heard a great deal about access to benefits. I know that the Government are keen to ensure that pensioners receive the benefits to which they are entitled, and the Conservatives are as well, but the truth is that that is not happening. I do not think any of us can afford to rest on our laurels until the rate of benefit take-up by pensioners is nearly 100 per cent. Those benefits can make a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08060494000038">If we are to deal with many of the cost issues faced by pensioners, we must either increase their incomes or reduce their costs. There are a number of ways in which we could do either. First, we should consider the cost of energy production, in which the Government have a part to play. Oil still forms a fundamental part of the energy burned by our power stations. We must find ways of reducing the cost of energy, which would have an immediate impact on pensioners, and we must encourage energy providers to subsidise the services that they deliver to pensioners. Such subsidies need not continue indefinitely, but at a time when energy prices are high and fuel bills are rising by 20 or 30 per cent. a year, the situation requires urgent attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08060494000039">Many pensioners who could be described as middle-income earners have scrimped and saved throughout their lives to build a future for themselves. Their earnings may have been similar to those of people living opposite, but instead of buying new cars and taking holidays, they bought their homes and made provision for their old age. Too often when such people go into residential care, there is a price to pay in the form of confiscation of their assets. I do not have an immediate answer to the problem, but we need to address that element of unfairness in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08060494000040">Pensioners are slow to anger. They are wise people who have lived long lives and have seen it all before, and they like to take a long-term view of big issues. They do not jump up and down like younger people such as me, getting frightfully agitated. However, pensioners are now becoming worried and angry. On 22 October there is to be a lobby of the House by a pensioners&#146; pressure group, and between now and then we need to make some progress in alleviating the immediate problem faced by pensioners: the increasing cost of day-to-day living. I know that the Government have taken the message on board, I know that we have taken it on board, and I hope that we can work collectively to ensure that that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08060494000043">In his opening remarks, the Minister said what a wonderful situation the country is in at the moment. He said that there were no marches or demonstrations and that everything out there is rosy for our pensioners and other constituents. I am not certain what world he lives in, but that certainly is not the case in my constituency, and I draw his attention to some recent demonstrations. Pensioners have joined me to demonstrate against the school closures in my constituency that the Government are, sadly, pushing through. The Government will not listen to the local pressure groups that have asked them not to close those schools now, while we are short of numbers, because they are imposing 18,000 homes on us, whether we want them or not, and children will be coming through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08060494000044">The Minister could have joined me on the picket line at my local fire station, which has recently been closed because of financial problems.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was addressing the comments that the Minister made in his opening remarks. If the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) had been in the Chamber at that time, he would have known that and would not be wasting the Chamber&#146;s time now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08060494000048">If the Minister thinks that no demonstrations are taking place and that pensioners are not concerned, he should join the hundreds of thousands of people around the country who are demonstrating against hospital closures, not least the 30-odd thousand who have signed a petition in my constituency. He mentioned that there is no bed blocking, but the reason why there is not much bed blocking in my constituency is that the wards are closing. Many care homes are also closing, and that is causing even more problems for hospitals in other areas that are trying to bring patients back to my constituency, because there is nowhere for them to go.</p>

hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)&#151;and show the many problems of so many pensioners who are still in poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08060494000050">Let me draw the Minister&#146;s attention to one of the biggest demonstrations by pensioners in this country. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central has joined me on many demonstrations, at which, to draw attention to the plight of the 140,000 pensioners whose pensions were stolen from them, many middle-aged men who had never demonstrated in their life took off most of their clothes just to get some publicity and to get the Government to listen to their plight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08060494000051">The Minister has proudly said that he has addressed that issue and that the Government have come forward with a package for those pensioners, who will get 90 per cent. of what they would have got, but I find that slightly difficult. I know the Minister well and I know that he has tried hard, but that has taken five years of promises, meetings, more meetings and demonstrations by people who had done the honourable thing. I have made this speech many times before in the House, and I know that the Minister agrees that they are honourable people who did the right thing. They worked hard and did not spend their money on holidays in lavish places, but put it into a pension scheme that Governments had said was safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08060494000052">This Government were taken to the parliamentary ombudsman on this matter, who found that they were in breach and that there had been maladministration. That is a fact that even the Minister cannot deny. He might disagree with the conclusions that were reached, but that is what the independent ombudsman found. The Government challenged the finding and said that they would not pay the compensation that the pensioners deserved and went to court, where they lost again. They went to the European Court, but they lost again, although they kept saying that they would not. They challenged the ruling in the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08060494000053">For the Minister to stand here and say what a wonderful job the Government have done in compensating those pensioners five years later sticks in my throat slightly, because I know that although he has done his bit, his predecessors have been misleading, frankly, in many ways, regarding the promises that were made. I do not know why the Government did not listen to the parliamentary ombudsman at the time. That is exactly what previous Governments had done; they had adhered to the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s report, come up with a compensation package and paid the compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08060494000054">One of the great problems&#151;I know that the Minister knows this to be a fact&#151;is that, because this has taken five years, a lot of these pensioners will now get a lump sum, which will put them into a completely different tax bracket from the one that would have applied if they had been given their pension, to which they had a right, five years ago. It cannot be right for the Government to bring forward a compensation package that will force pensioners to pay more tax than they would have done if they had had their pension by right. Earlier on, the Minister said that this was a matter for the pensioners to take up with the taxman, but it is not; it is a matter for the Government to sort out. It is not the pensioners&#146; fault that they did not get their pensions. It was due to this Government&#146;s maladministration&#151;that is the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s word, not mine&#151;that they failed to get their pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08060494000055">Two groups of people are really suffering, at both ends of the spectrum, in relation to income tax. There are those who will receive a lump sum and will have to pay 40 per cent. of it, which they would not have had to pay if they had had their compensation earlier. Another group&#151;a smaller group, I admit&#151;comprises those who are the most needy and who would have paid only 10p in the pound before the Government abolished the 10p tax rate. Surely it cannot be right for any Government&#151;let alone this Government, who have promised to compensate the people who have lost out&#151;to do that. If the 10p rate had still been in place, and if those people had been given the pension that they deserved, they would not have to pay the 20p in the pound that they will now be asked to pay. I have not seen any compensation package that will protect those people.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. He and I share the same group of pensioners who have been affected by the Dexion pension collapse. He has put forward a cogent argument in relation to the package that has now been put in place, but that package will not compensate for the stress and worry that people went through, and the life-altering changes that they had to make during that time, when they did not know how much money they would be able to spend or what debts they might incur. On top of all that life-altering stress and change, it seems doubly unfair to tax them at a higher rate. The Government really should show a bit more compassion over this.</p>

They will now fall into the higher tax bracket. Some of them have had to go to work because they had no income from the pension that they had paid into. They have already paid tax on the income that they earned, and now they will be asked to pay tax on top of that, which will take them into the 40 per cent. tax bracket.</p>

They are the most vulnerable pensioners&#151;in my constituency, they worked for Dexion&#151;who earned the lowest amount, but they are now going to be hammered.

He talked of the need for proper and fundamental reform of our pensions system. I was delighted to hear what he said about the need to get rid of age discrimination. Future generations will look back with incredulity at the way in which we treat people above pensionable age who want to work. The sooner we get rid of that form of discrimination, the better.</p>

made in a previous intervention on the Prime Minister&#151;that those council taxes are higher because local authorities are having to put more money into the pension schemes for their staff because of the Government&#146;s &#163;5 billion a year tax raid on occupational pension funds. We do not hear enough about that.</p>

I heard a recent story about shepherds in Scotland whose bill for filling their oil tank is more than their monthly wage; they have to have their oil paid for by their employers, who they then pay back on a monthly basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08060494000069">The Minister&#146;s approach seemed to be to go back and knock what happened under the last Conservative Government&#151;a sign of a Government who are backward-looking rather than focused on preventing future pensioner poverty. Instead of attacking what took place 11 years ago, they should be more focused on ensuring that the nearly &#163;5 billion of unclaimed benefits today actually gets to the pensioners who desperately need those benefits, 500,000 of whom would be lifted out of poverty if those benefits were paid out, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80604-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08060494000070">The Conservative party has supported the Turner pension reform proposals as a sound basis for a future pensions settlement and we are pleased that at last the Government are taking seriously the concerns we have raised about those people who would be better advised not to enrol in the new personal accounts scheme because of their loss of means-tested benefits. But these vital pension reforms to state pensions and personal accounts do not come in until 2010 and 2012 respectively. That is 13 to 15 years after the Government entered office, pledging that all pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nation. That means that a large proportion of the working-age population will be poorer than they need to be in retirement, as the Government will have taken 15 years to put a decent pension settlement in place when they would have had the support of the Conservative party to do that on day one. Rather than hearing self-satisfied complacency from the Government about what they have done, it would be good to have a general recognition across the House of the scale of the problem.</p>

Revenue &amp; Customs have been of little help in answering my questions...The Government&#146;s proposal to compensate those who have lost out is, to my mind, too late as it does not reflect a change in policy but is simply a political response to last week&#146;s defeat at the polls. I wish you well in your legitimate attack on the Government and, like many other citizens, await the next General Election when we can vent our displeasure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08060494000078">It is good for Ministers to hear what ordinary pensioners who used to support the Labour party are saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08060494000079">I raised with the previous Prime Minister the fact that some of my constituents, and others up and down the country, were paying one third or more of their entire income in council tax. Many pensioners across the country run down their savings every year in order to stay in the home they love and to pay their council tax, which invariably rises at a far higher rate than their pension. What have the Government done with the Lyons review on the future of council tax? Again, they have dithered and kicked it into the long grass. That simply will not do; our elderly constituents deserve better, as the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale rightly mentioned. That applies not least to English pensioners, who are suffering tax and council tax increases, while the Scots have their council tax frozen this year. What happened to fairness across the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08060494000080">We have heard criticisms of a lack of Conservative policy, but my hon. Friends were elected to this House in 2005 on a manifesto commitment to halve the council tax of everyone over the age of 65, up to a maximum of &#163;500 a year, for the life of this Parliament. That compares with the Government&#146;s lower, &#163;200 for one year only, offer. We were also elected on a pledge to restore the earnings link, when the Labour party was telling the country that that could not be done. So, we are not going to take any lectures tonight on Conservative party failings, not least because the Government have nicked at least eight Conservative policies. I know that Labour Members are keen to know what the Conservative policy will be in more areas, but as they have already stolen so many of our policies, we will keep a few in the locker until just before the general election, so that the Government do not take those as well.</p>

 We have had an interesting debate this afternoon with contributions from the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)&#151;I welcome her to her new post&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) and from the hon. Members for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose), for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) and for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous). The debate has been based on the Conservative motion and I shall conclude it by focusing on that, and as I do so, I shall respond to specific points made by hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08060494000083">The motion begins with a comment about 2 million pensioners still living in poverty. As we have established this afternoon, we take no lessons on poverty from the Tory party. During the 1980s, pensioner poverty fell only when there was a recession. That was the Tory method of cutting pensioner poverty&#151;reduce median income, watch the wages of working-age people drop and unemployment rise and, hey presto, pensioner poverty falls. In fact, when this Government came to power in 1997, 3.2 million pensioners were in absolute poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08060494000084">Unlike the Tories, we believe in giving the poorest in our society meaningful help, while keeping the economy strong. Because of the effective measures that we have taken and substantial extra investment, pensioner poverty has fallen while the economy has grown. And it has fallen not by a bit, but by more than 2 million in absolute terms. Support such as pension credit, winter fuel payments and help with council tax mean that today pensioner households are on average &#163;29 a week better off than under the 1997 system and the poorest third are &#163;40 a week better off. That means that today, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than any group in society. That could never have been said under the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08060494000085">The second claim in the motion is that</p>
<a name="80604-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="08060494001193"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the poorest pensioners are seeing their incomes decline in real terms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08060494000086">That claim is simply wrong. The Conservatives&#146; source seems to be a misreading of a parliamentary answer given by my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Pensions Reform in July 2007. The figures in the answer were in real terms and included the effect of inflation. To get the figure used in the motion, the Conservatives have double-counted for inflation. Perhaps that is because they used to run inflation at double the level that it is under this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08060494000087">Opposition Members appear to find it difficult to even get a basic understanding of the figures. Such figures are only accurate as trends and the trend is very  <br>

<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 880</b><br>
firmly up for all groups of pensioners over the past decade. The trends show that the incomes of the poorest pensioner households have risen by around 30 per cent. since 1997. Average pensioner incomes have risen by 29 per cent. since 1997 in real terms, compared to earnings growth of 16 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08060494000088">The motion then makes a claim based on the EUROSTAT statistics about pensioners in Latvia, Cyprus and Spain, to which the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire returned in his speech. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central also focused on them. The claim rests on a complete misreading of the data. The EUROSTAT survey measures the median income of each country and that of pensioners. The UK is relatively well-off so our poverty line is higher, and so our &#147;poorest pensioners&#148; are better off than the &#147;poorest pensioners&#148; in other countries. The motion&#146;s claim is therefore spurious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08060494000089">The UK has the fifth highest median pensioner income in the EU&#151;higher than in France, Denmark and Sweden. So a &#147;poor&#148; pensioner in the UK has an income a 10th higher than that of a poor pensioner in Germany and a fifth higher than one in France. A poor pensioner in the UK has an income nearly twice that of a poor Spanish pensioner, three times that of a poor Latvian pensioner and more than 10 times that of a Cypriot pensioner. Furthermore, the EUROSTAT figures also ignore housing costs, personal pensions, and free health care&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o382"><a name="08060494000090"><a name="80604-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="08060494001250"><b>Andrew Selous:</b>
 Will the Minister give way?</p>

 No, I do not have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08060494000092">So, if hon. Members want to use EUROSTAT, the most reliable data are those that show that a decade ago UK pensioners had a median income which was one seventh below that of the EU15. Today, it is nearly one 10th above that median. That is the reality of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08060494000093">The charge of rising costs adding further to poverty was stressed by the hon. Members for Braintree, for Weston-super-Mare and for Broxbourne. In the past 10 years, pensioner incomes have increased by more than inflation and by more than the average growth in earnings. That puts pensioners in a better position when dealing with the recent increases in the cost of living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08060494000094">Where we can take action to help the poorest with the rising cost of living, we are. On fuel bills, we announced last week that we are taking serious steps to enable energy companies to ensure that the most vulnerable pensioners have cheaper bills. For this winter, we have offered the energy companies the facility to send a mailshot or voucher to any of our clients on pension credit. That is coupled with the increase in the winter fuel payment announced in the Budget and the commitment of the energy suppliers to provide an extra &#163;225 million in support over the next three years. That will provide significant extra support to the most vulnerable, enabling them to pay their fuel bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08060494000095">Of course, pensioners are concerned about council tax increases. That is why council tax benefit take-up is important. We are encouraged by the fact that since we have increased activity on take-up it has started to rise,  <br>

going up by 2 per cent. in 2005-06. We need to go further and so we are introducing automaticity into the claiming of pensioner benefits. We estimate that that will lift 50,000 more pensioners out of poverty by 2010. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08060494000096">One of the most incredible aspects of the motion is what we have heard from the Conservatives about restoring the link between average earnings and the basic state pension. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton reminded us, the Tories broke that link and when they did so they said that it was the right thing to do. Clearly, they have no credibility whatsoever on the issue. We are committed to restoring that link, and of that there is no doubt, because we have enshrined it in law. Our aim is to re-link in 2012, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, so the latest that it could happen would be the end of the next Parliament. Restoring the link is part of a package of reforms. Unlike the Tories, we are not breaking the link or talking about restoring it for one Parliament only. We are making a commitment to do it for real and in a lasting and sustainable way. It will ensure that the poorest in our society benefit from significant increases in their income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08060494000097">We then come to the claim about abandoning the target for pension credit take-up. That is old news, as we have established before. Last year, we had a stretching target to get 235,000 new claimants on to pension credit. All the indications are that we have exceeded that target, so for this year we have set an even more stretching target of 250,000. That shows our commitment to the poorest in society and to ensuring that we continue to make every effort to lift them out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08060494000098">The motion moves on to make claims about the decline in private pension savings. That decline has been going on in the UK since the 1960s. In 1967, there were 8.1 million on such schemes. By the 1970s, there were 6 million, by the late 1980s there were 5.8 million and today there are 4.5 million. The reforms that we have introduced will ensure the best offer in the future for savings for pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80604-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08060494000099">To conclude, the motion has been on the starting grid on a couple of occasions, only to be withdrawn to something else to be debated. The motion rather resembles one of the Tory party&#146;s old bangers; I suspect they got it ready to go a couple of times, took a look at it and thought, &#147;Well, perhaps not&#151;it doesn&#146;t really look very roadworthy.&#148; That is what we have found out today. Even with the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)&#151;an advanced motorist&#151;at the wheel, it could not be kept on the road. Bit by bit, it has fallen apart&#151;</p>

 I am pleased to have the chance to discuss internet content and internet service providers with my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy, not least because I have been trying to secure this debate for several months. I know that, like me, many of my colleagues regularly receive correspondence from constituents who are worried about internet content, and I have been especially keen to discuss those matters following the Byron review, but on several occasions I have been told by the Table Office that there is no Department appropriate to field such a debate. The strategy of representatives of each Department that we tried to assign it to has been to hold up its hands in affront and deny any responsibility for the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para10"><a name="08060494001145">My worry is that that is an allegory of the current situation relating to responsibility for internet content, and that the excuse is, sadly, endemic. ISPs claim to be mere inanimate conduits; search engines plead their neutrality; Ofcom has intentionally been denied any remit for content; other UK Executive and regulatory bodies, including the police, have powers over only a tiny minority of websites; and the Internet Watch Foundation is limited in the subjects it monitors and by the international nature of the internet. As a result, the various initiatives that have been implemented are piecemeal and inadequate, and the internet stands out as an anomaly against similar media as a place where, essentially, anything goes. It is a paradox that the efforts of ISPs to deal with illegal content are a strong argument for regulating them, as we see that the tools they have are the most effective method of controlling material online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para11"><a name="08060494001146">Before outlining my case, I should state that, as joint-chairman of the all-party communications group, I am a fully fledged internet enthusiast. I welcome the fact that just under 60 per cent. of households in the UK now have broadband, although I am disappointed that my own city, Glasgow, has the lowest uptake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para12"><a name="08060494001147">Even in the space of a decade, the internet has revolutionised the way many people live, from accessing information to socialising. Across the world, it has been an empowering and democratising force. I do not doubt that freedom for the network is important to its continuing evolution and, in that respect, our approach to regulating the internet in the UK will set an important precedent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para13"><a name="08060494001148">However, because the internet has come so far, we need to regulate content. What was originally a network that was exclusively confined to communications for the American military establishment is now in the majority of homes across the country and in three quarters of households with children. Furthermore, there is an increasing blurring of the distinctions between the internet and the traditional media and means of accessing services. Two examples are that half of all internet users have watched video online, and that BBC iPlayer has a weekly audience of around 1.1 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para14"><a name="08060494001149">In the light of those trends, the argument that the Government previously used to justify inaction&#151;that  <br>

there is a tradition of non-regulation of the internet&#151;surely becomes untenable. Together with the benefits of the internet, there has been a range of tangible negative effects for the UK. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Revenue and Customs have both attributed a vast increase in counterfeit medicines to websites selling illegal drugs. The BPI has calculated that around &#163;160 million was lost by the music industry through illegal downloads in 2007, and NBC Universal estimates that online piracy cost film and TV businesses &#163;129 million a year. Those are coupled with less tangible effects, for instance, the increased availability of extremist and hate-inciting literature, or of young people being exposed to pro-disorder and suicide websites.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that some of the sites about suicide are truly evil? They not only encourage, urge, assist and facilitate people to take their lives, but distract especially youngsters from finding the help, advice and guidance that would enable them to live full and productive lives. We must find some way of monitoring and closing them.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her input. I know that her constituency has suffered more than most through young people committing suicide. It is the Government&#146;s duty to consider that and try to do something to help prevent people from committing suicide for some unknown reason, which makes them think that it is all right to do that.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend and colleague for his input. He is right that we should show a lead in the world. We have an opportunity to try to put something straight and I hope that the rest of my contribution will explain how and where that should happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para16"><a name="08060494001155">One reason that was given for the Government&#146;s decision not to regulate content at the time was that the general law of the UK applies to the internet. A declaration, which seems slightly naive in retrospect, was made that,</p>
<a name="80604-0023.htm_brev12"><a name="08060494001220"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;what is illegal off-line is illegal online&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para17"><a name="08060494001156">However, the real difficulty with the internet is that what is illegal and enforced in one place often bears little relation to what is illegal and enforced in another. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para18"><a name="08060494001157">The existing law applies to websites that are hosted here, which means, for instance, that an online pharmacy hosted in the UK will need to comply with the same rules by which a high street pharmacy abides. However, those that are outside our jurisdiction will be free to continue as they wish. That is why we see  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 895</b><br>
websites based in the South Pacific, often with misleading &#147;dot co dot uk&#148; addresses, selling prescription drugs without the normal safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para19"><a name="08060494001158">Alongside the general law, internet service providers, which are not required to have a licence to operate in the UK, have a self-regulatory regime for content. The fulcrum for that is the Internet Watch Foundation, which provides a notification service of illegal content to ISPs under three headings: child sex abuse images hosted anywhere in the world; criminally obscene content hosted in the UK; and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK. The IWF has a hotline for members of the public and maintains a list of websites with material under those three headings that are potentially illegal. It instructs, albeit without sanction, the relevant host ISP to take down the website and refers details to the police. In the case of child abuse websites outside the UK, the IWF notifies the relevant national enforcement agencies where they are hosted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para20"><a name="08060494001159">It is important to note that although the IWF does not require ISPs to block content not hosted by them, some providers have undertaken to do this, such as BT, whose Cleanfeed programme blocks child abuse websites on the IWF list. The effect of that is to prevent BT customers from accessing such material, even when it is hosted outside the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para21"><a name="08060494001160">To return to the general law, the final facet that I should mention is the liability of ISPs. The e-commerce regulations of 2002 prevent liability for content unless, first, the ISP has been made aware of both its presence and its illegal or tortious nature and, secondly, the ISP is storing the information in some way, either through hosting or caching. As far as I am aware, the liability of ISPs for content has been tested only in a handful of defamation cases, and those only where the material had been hosted by the respective server in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para22"><a name="08060494001161">That brief outline should make it clear that the regime for content&#151;or, rather, the lack of a regime&#151;leaves huge gaps. The most important and extensive of those is the fact that, for any material not hosted in the UK, including child abuse images, we are reliant on other countries being both prepared and able to shut down websites or specific pages. According to the IWF, less than 1 per cent. of potentially criminal content appearing online since 2003 has been hosted in the UK, so the general law and the self-regulatory approach reach only the tip of the iceberg. That is clearly not good enough. We must do far better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para23"><a name="08060494001162">The figures from the IWF are also interesting in that they show that around one fifth of the child abuse sites that it reports to other countries&#146; regulatory agencies remain online for more than 50 days, and sometimes for up to 100 days, after being passed on. When we have the ability to block access to such sites, with programmes such as Cleanfeed, it is hard to understand why the Government have not been more demanding. Furthermore, as I have said, much of the material that would be illegal if hosted in the UK will be perfectly legal elsewhere. Many countries have far broader rights to freedom of speech and no prohibitions on inciting racial or religious hatred, and are far more lax when it comes to rules on obscenity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para24"><a name="08060494001163">The second limitation is that the IWF covers a narrow range of topics. There is no organisation concerned with general online content in the UK and, with billions  <br>

of web pages worldwide and millions hosted in the UK, it is unrealistic to expect anything other than piecemeal control from UK Executive bodies with other priorities. Finally, the IWF and the general law are concerned only with what is illegal or tortious online, whereas many of my constituents have expressed concerns to me about material that is either harmful or offensive, such as that which my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para25"><a name="08060494001164">I would like to ask the Minister: how is it that we have heavily regulated content on TV, but we leave parents to police the internet and stand over their children while they use it? When it comes to illegal content at least, I would urge the Minister to place the responsibility on the ISPs. As the gatekeepers to the internet and, most importantly, being based in the UK, they are the obvious candidates to deal with such material. That is gradually being recognised across the world, with regulation in Australia and China and the Olivennes agreement in France.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para26"><a name="08060494001165">Indeed, while the IWF system in the UK is cited by ISPs as a reason for not regulating them, it shows that the most effective way of tackling illegal content is to have service providers take it down and block it. With only a minute fraction of illegal content being hosted in the UK, any solution that is limited by our borders and jurisdiction is really no solution at all to the problems of the internet. The only thing we can really do is require ISPs to block that illegal content regardless of where it is hosted. If we do not do that, I ask the Minister, how can our efforts to tackle a host of crimes such as inciting religious or racial hatred possibly be taken seriously? If China and Australia can do it, why cannot we?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para27"><a name="08060494001166">The objection that is often raised to that is that ISPs simply cannot filter or monitor content. In the light of that, it is interesting to note that network providers in France have undertaken to assess whether they will be able to implement such technology to tackle copyright infringement. But we need not be so burdensome to have an effective regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para28"><a name="08060494001167">The IWF system of notification and takedown orders could form the basis of a broader system for tackling content, whereby ISPs would be required to block material in breach of the law that they were notified of. The Minister would no doubt ask how such a body could be resourced and funded, but I do not see that as an insurmountable problem. In negotiations between ISPs and the music industry, the rights holders are suggesting that they would take on policing and monitoring content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para29"><a name="08060494001168">While ISPs may not be responsible for producing and editing content that appears on their servers, they are the only ones with the power to deal with it, so why do the Government not force them to do so with a licensing regime? There has been movement from the Government on internet-based crimes such as grooming, which makes it bizarre that what would be illegal content in any other sphere is left unfettered simply because it appears online. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also announced that ISPs will face regulation in 2009 unless they take action on copyright infringement, but that is too late&#151;we needed it yesterday&#151;and far too limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para30"><a name="08060494001169">At the start of my speech, I mentioned that the Government decided during consideration of the last  <br>

Communications Bill to exclude content from Ofcom&#146;s remit, and we have reaped what we sowed. The problem has grown since. With the possibility of a new communications Bill being introduced in the next Parliament, it is clear that we now have the technology to control content. The only remaining questions are whether we have the will power and the common sense.</p>

Those people clearly recognise how important this matter is. Perhaps the Government, now that a Department has finally been found to respond to this debate, should do so too.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) has raised a most important issue and I pay tribute to him for his excellent work in this area. This is a matter of common concern to many different parts of the Government, and the way we respond to it will be important in ensuring the safe enjoyment of the internet by users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para32"><a name="08060494001172">My hon. Friend talked about the work of the Internet Watch Foundation, and I pay tribute to what it does, as well as to the way that the internet service provider community and others work with it to seek to ensure that such repugnant material is not available in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para33"><a name="08060494001173">In many ways, it could be argued that the IWF is a model of how self-regulation can work. However, as my hon. Friend stated, it has limitations. As we have heard, it has a specific remit to deal with child sexual abuse content hosted worldwide, and criminally obscene and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK. ISPs act promptly on information received by the IWF to take down or block access to sites carrying such material. The problem with extending the IWF model to other areas, such as copyright or the promotion of suicide, is that the issues are far less clear-cut and open to legal challenge. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) that I shall say more about issues involving suicide later in my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="80604-0023.htm_para34"><a name="08060494001174">The IWF does not want its remit to be extended to other areas, and there are good reasons for that. In the case of activities that are unambiguously illegal and recognised in all jurisdictions as unacceptable, it is relatively straightforward to maintain the collaboration that makes that system work. If more equivocal content were brought into the scope of the IWF&#146;s remit, it would be difficult to command the support of all who need to be engaged. So what can we do? I agree that the world has moved on since the Communications Act 2003. It would be very odd if things had not changed in five years in such a high-tech area, and the Government have already embarked on consideration of what those changes mean for the future regulation of content, whether it is broadcast, sent to a mobile phone or sent to a computer.</p>

We need to anticipate how the online world will develop, and plan accordingly. That is why the Government set up a convergence think tank to examine the impact of convergence on the United Kingdom communications market and its implications for future policy, regulatory and legislative frameworks in relation to broadcasting and telecommunications, and the online world or the internet. We expect the think tank to report to the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and for Culture, Media and Sport early in 2009, and they may recommend new legislation if it seems necessary.</p>

That is why the Prime Minister asked Dr. Tanya Byron to conduct an independent review of the risks posed to children by exposure to potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games, and that is why we accepted all Dr. Byron&#146;s recommendations without condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="80604-0024.htm_para2"><a name="08060494001177">It is worth repeating that the Byron review recognised the enormous benefits of the internet, whose technology offers children&#151;and adults&#151;new opportunities for communication, participation and creativity to a degree never witnessed before. It can help children to improve some of the skills that are so crucial to their cognitive development. Inherent in those benefits is the ability to overcome many of the disadvantages and inequalities of real life, which has led some to hail the internet as providing the means to a more democratic media environment.

As a Department, we want to engage fully with Members on the issue. It is vital that we ensure that the regulatory framework as it applies to  <br>

the internet keeps up with changes in the technology, and with changes in the way in which people use it. The Government are acting to secure the protection of children through the Byron review, and getting the long-term framework right by means of the convergence think tank.</p>

Friend referred to this&#151;to stick to the principle that what is illegal offline is illegal online. Enforcement online might be much more difficult than offline, especially where those engaging in illegal activity are based outside this country, but that is no reason to apply different approaches as to what is and is not allowed, in particular when it comes to content that is considered undesirable rather than illegal.</p>

Friend has called for a widely applicable solution based on blocking unpleasant or unlawful internet sites, based on the model of the Internet Watch Foundation. Network level blocking presents some difficulties. In reducing access to such material, we would need to weigh up the costs and potential difficulties against the evidence of benefits, and to compare its potential effectiveness against other options, such as improving filtering tools and pointing people towards sources of support and other positive material.</p>

Friend the Member for Bridgend raised the distressing issue of suicide websites, and the tragedies that have occurred in her own community. What is being done to protect people from websites that encourage suicide? The Government are deeply concerned about those websites and the influence that they can have on vulnerable people and, particularly, young people. We have accepted the recommendations of the Byron review, including that the new UK council on child internet safety look at whether the law on  <br>

harmful and inappropriate online material could usefully be clarified, and that appropriate enforcement responses be explored. The Ministry of Justice is looking urgently at whether the law in that area could sensibly be strengthened, and will make an announcement shortly.</p>

 Will the Minister address a point that was raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) on liability? The Select Committee was told by YouTube that, if it attempted to pre-screen material before it appeared on the site, it would potentially become legally liable for any inappropriate material that was posted. If that is the case, it is surely perverse that the law should make such sites more vulnerable for trying to do the right thing than for sitting back and doing nothing.</p>

 I do not claim to be an expert on the law in that area, but, prima facie, that would seem perverse. I shall draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question to the attention of my colleagues in the Ministry of Justice who are, as I have said, looking into these issues. </p>

We also need to ensure that the internet continues to be able to offer the range and scope of services that people have increasingly come to expect and enjoy.</p>
