 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to explain to the House the absence of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer from today&#039;s questions. He is in Israel and the west bank, meeting the Israeli and Palestinian Finance Ministers, the Israeli Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. To help expedite the peace process and to foster enterprise in the west bank and Gaza, he is announcing a small loan facility worth a potential $400&nbsp;million, building over a number of years, which will help to create thousands of jobs and small businesses.

<a name="stpa_o0">In 2003&#150;04, an average of 7,500&nbsp;families in Staffordshire, Moorlands benefited from tax credits. Tax credits reach far more families on low or moderate incomes than any previous system of income-related financial support.

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51110-01_spnew0"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that answer. Clearly, tax credits have brought huge benefits to my constituents, but is he aware that problems of overpayments persist? In my experience, they are caused largely by the faulty transcription of details over the telephone. How does he intend to address those ongoing problems?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51110-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. Tax credits have lifted more than 500,000&nbsp;children out of poverty since 1998&#150;99, but I accept that computer and administrative problems in the past have resulted in a number of incorrect overpayments. We are aware of those problems, and have apologised for them repeatedly. On several occasions, my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has set out what we are doing to improve the tax credits system. She told the Treasury Select Committee on 26&nbsp;October that, subject to testing, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 450</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>where a claimant disputes the recovery of an overpayment, action would be taken to prevent automatic recovery until the case had been looked at. Final testing has been completed successfully, and Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs has now implemented the procedure.

 (Con): Whatever the merits of tax credits, overpayments are causing serious problems. Will the Chief Secretary clarify what he has just said? Will all overpayments resulting from bureaucratic cock-ups be written off?

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51110-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I will not say precisely what the hon. Gentleman invites me to, but he asked me to clarify the matter and I shall do so. We have made it clear that our objective was to ensure that, when a claimant disputed an overpayment, action would be taken to prevent automatic recovery until the case had been examined. We have been able to achieve that, and either I or my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General may have an opportunity to provide details later. However, the present procedure is manual, and we are working to introduce a fully automated system in due course.

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51110-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil)</b> 
 (LD): Will the Chief Secretary confirm that people in Staffordshire, Moorlands will continue to face the problem that the ombudsman called &quot;systemic maladministration&quot;? He has set out today the changes that will be put in place, but overpayments will still be recovered before his Department has assessed whether, under the code of practice, they are recoverable. Is not that the systemic maladministration that the ombudsman described? Will not the problem remain very considerable until the right hon. Gentleman and the Paymaster General deal with it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51110-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I accept that the ombudsman&#039;s report on tax credits used that phrase, but it did not say that the tax credits system was in general disarray. The hon. Gentleman constantly makes that suggestion but, given the scale of the undertaking, the system has been broadly successful. He encourages me to write off all overpayments, but I am not prepared to do so. Of course, some will be written off, or people will be unable to pay the money back, but HMRC&#039;s duty is to seek recovery where that is possible. However, we have made the position perfectly clear as regards errors made by HMRC.

 (Lab/Co-op): I welcome the Chief Secretary&#039;s comments on the disputed overpayments. He knows that the Treasury Select Committee is looking into the administration of tax compliance. On behalf of my colleagues on the Committee I welcome the progress that has been made, but we will keep our eye on the system so that it becomes more efficient over the months and years. I am aware that on 30&nbsp;September the renewal process was completed. What assessment has the Department made of that, and can my right hon. Friend make a statement?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51110-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his support and I am sure that the Treasury Select Committee will continue to review these matters, as it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 451</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should, and I welcome that. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the renewal process commenced some time ago, but it is still early days in this year&#039;s renewal process to give a full review of how well it is going. Early indications are, however, that some people fail to renew and termination notices have been sent out to those who have not renewed. If those people come back to us with good reason why they are unable to respond, their payments will be reinstated. Last year that happened with about half of the people. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs are continuing to make efforts to remind people. Hon. Members will be aware of the high profile publicity campaign to raise awareness of the deadline. In addition, we have made significant numbers of outward bound calls to claimants to remind them of the need to renew.

<a name="stpa_o1">Turning to the tax credits fiasco, the Chief Secretary will be aware that the parliamentary ombudsman said recently to a Select Committee of this House that she is &quot;hugely concerned&quot; that the Government are simply &quot;picking and choosing&quot; from her devastating report and that the Government are

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">On the contrary, it recognises that, given the scale of the undertaking, its introduction has been broadly successful. We have responded in detail to the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations. The hon. Gentleman is correct that not all of them have been accepted. The fundamental point is that this process is bringing significant numbers of children in particular out of poverty. The question for him is: where does he stand? Is his position still the same&#151;that he does not think that the tax credit system has helped to reduce child poverty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51110-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 The Chief Secretary seems completely unaware of the real situation. Thousands of families are being driven below the poverty line by the administration of tax credits. The citizens advice bureau, which has to pick up the pieces from this mess, told me this morning that it is not uncommon for it to apply to charities for food vouchers to help desperate families who are not getting the tax credit payments that they expected. The Chief Secretary has told us that things are getting better, but the National Audit Office tells us that they are not. Is it not time that he joined a growing consensus that believes that we should consider moving to a system where payments are more certain and less prone to error, or has he decided to join the Prime Minister in his bunker?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51110-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s assertion about the tax credit system and its effect on poverty is simply not true.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51110-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The tax credit system has served to take a significant number of children out of poverty and 6&nbsp;million families throughout the country are taking advantage of it. It was set up in a detailed design in consultation on child and working tax credits published alongside the 2002&nbsp;Budget. At the time the Government recognised that we would need to monitor the operation of the system and learn lessons in the light of experience. That is exactly what we have been doing. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has periodically reported to the House on that, and that process will continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">I know that the hon. Gentleman desires simplicity. Indeed, we know of his desire to simplify the tax system to a flat tax. He will know that, just like the flat tax, simplification always introduces significant inequities. A flat tax would cost &#163;50&nbsp;billion of public spending, and I am sure that the simplification that he suggests would drive a significant number of people into poverty, as, indeed, did the previous system of support in work.

 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern about regional funding and policy.

He will be aware that three quarters of the funding for UK regions and nations is from domestic Government rather than from Europe.

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="51110-02_spnew8"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Indeed, as my hon. Friend knows extremely well, given her experience in Europe, the rationale for the British rebate is the imbalances and distortions in the European budget, principally around the common agricultural policy. Those imbalances mean that Britain has paid almost twice as much as France into the European budget since 1984, and that we are paying seven times more on agriculture than on the other parts of the European budget that will help Britain and other European countries to adjust for the future. That is why the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have been leading negotiations to try to secure a review as part of an overall budget settlement. They remain committed to that and are working hard to do the deal that will allow the budget to be approved at the December Council.

However, she should look at the employment rates and the number of people moving into work who are lone parents, especially, and partners in marriages.

<a name="stpa_o11">We need to consider the issue in the context of pension tax simplification, which has been welcomed by almost everyone&#151;the industry, financial services and all Opposition parties. It is also true to say that the rules do not put the investments into any tax privileged category over and above any other investments in a pension. There are already around 15&nbsp;million pension savers who can invest in residential properties. At the moment, there are only around 200,000&nbsp;savers in SIPPs. Having said that, if we find that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns prove to be justified, we remain willing to act and to act appropriately. At this stage, however, we believe that pension tax simplification is the right thing to do and, in that context, SIPPs are relevant. However, if there are unintended consequences, we are willing to consider those and to act appropriately.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="51110-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises a legitimate issue. At the moment, there is a 12-month gap between the regulatory regime that the Financial Services Authority will be able to introduce and the changes from 1&nbsp;April next year in terms of pension tax simplifications and, specifically, the impact on SIPPs. Clearly, the Treasury and the FSA are concerned about that gap, and we are considering whether we can do anything practical about it. Having said that, it is important that the FSA follows its usual consultation processes before rushing in inappropriate rules. We are conscious of the 12-month gap.

 (Con): The Chief Secretary has just spoken about flexibility and diversity. Can he explain how giving 10,000&nbsp;work permits to Bangladeshis to work in the hospitality industry helps social cohesion among the 50&nbsp;per cent. of young Bangladeshis in this country who are unemployed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="51110-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman refers to a specific route of migration that has been taken advantage of by those who operate what we call Indian restaurants, but which are predominantly owned and populated by Bangladeshis. Part of the raison d&#039;&#234;tre for that was that those jobs could not be filled from the indigenous labour market because of a skills shortage. In fact, the people who come in and work in those restaurants make a significant contribution not only to the economy of this country but to the diversity of the community that we live in&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, among others, has enjoyed some of the products of their labour&#151;and, in my view, the ability to do just that in our communities, where we can celebrate our diversity, contributes to cohesion.

 (Lab): There is one element of employment flexibility that adds to cohesion, particularly among families, that my right hon. Friend did not mention: measures to enable people to combine work and home responsibilities, such as those in the Work and Families Bill on parental and maternity leave, and leave for carers. Will his Department take action to promote with employers and businesses the advantages of such measures to them in helping them to retain experienced staff who are not totally stressed out by the daily burden of juggling their lives at work and at home?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="51110-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is perfectly correct. It will become more important as time goes on, with the changing demographic of this country, that skilled workers, particularly women, are not lost to employment because of the competing pressures of home life and work. That is why the Government are, after full discussion with all the sectors of industry and business, incrementally and carefully moving forward to deliver the best balance between work and family responsibilities. Of course the Treasury will play a full part in that process.

 Charities benefit from VAT and other tax reliefs worth &#163;2.4&nbsp;billion a year. This forms part of the Government&#039;s total support to the voluntary and community sector of something like &#163;3.3&nbsp;billion a year. An exemption for all charities would add between &#163;500&nbsp;million and &#163;1&nbsp;billion to the cost, and the Government believe that the available resources are better and more effectively deployed through targeted initiatives rather than through a general VAT refund scheme.

 In 2004, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution paid &#163;3.2&nbsp;million in irrecoverable VAT&#151;that is &#163;3&nbsp;for every &#163;1&nbsp;raised by volunteers. That would have paid for the running costs of the Larne lifeboat station in my constituency for the next 13&nbsp;years. What plans has the Paymaster General to implement the Transport Committee&#039;s recommendations on search and rescue, published earlier this year, which called for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such organisations to be relieved of the burden of VAT, or if that proved legally difficult, to make an annual grant to offset the VAT payments for the previous year?

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on giving a great deal of support in this area. The whole House would want to echo his comments with regard to the RNLI and the services that it provides for the country. He will also know that since 1997&nbsp;the Government have undertaken two reviews to consider this issue. There are something like 250,000&nbsp;charities, and a general exemption for all of those would produce astronomic costs, of the order that I explained to him in my previous answer. The review also demonstrated that it was extremely difficult, and nigh impossible, to reach a fair and principled position, and to decide how some charities might get VAT relief and some might not. He referred to the Select Committee report, to which the Treasury responded, and I have noted his comments. I undertake to consider the matter again, but I hope that he and the House understand the tight and difficult constraints in relation to a complete exemption for all charities and the costs that that would incur.

 (Lab/Co-op): Successive Governments have done a great deal to help charities with various VAT exemptions, but inconsistencies remain. For those charities that operate admission fees to facilities, exemption is provided as long as the surplus is invested to improve or protect those facilities. Will the Financial Secretary consider the inconsistency that prevents them from using any surpluses for deficit funding of a general nature? It would be immensely helpful to museums, art galleries and other such facilities to have access to that exemption for that, too.

 I know that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will of course bear in mind the points that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) has just made. I want to stress to him and the House, however, that having completed two extensive reviews, making exemptions within the tax system that are fair, targeted and properly used is a challenging and difficult task, and can lead to perverse incentives in the system. I shall reflect on his points with my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, but I am sure that he appreciates that it is extremely difficult to achieve what he is seeking.

September sittings are important and the principle of having them ultimately needs to be revisited, but unless we can persuade the political parties to change their conference arrangements, I do not see how we can get the continuity of sitting arrangements that Members require. In the light of that, I have written to the chairs of each of the political parties, urging them to look at this matter and to consider having their conferences earlier in September, thereby allowing the House to return earlier and on a continuous basis, so that the sitting is sensible and manageable for all concerned.

It is important that we continue to use private sector funding through PPPs as a means of adding to the amount of capital spending that can be achieved. That has been successful, certainly in other parts of the country, and I am sure that it will be successful in Northern Ireland. Obviously there needs to be proper checks and safeguards to ensure that that money is properly spent and is part of the overall Government spending alongside the private sector. From time to time that takes more time than would be the case if simple capital provision were made available, but the benefit to the whole country of that extra finance is that we can do more.

Does not that send a signal that far from being tough on terror, as the Government like to pretend, they are actually in the business of abjectly appeasing terrorists in Northern Ireland, and that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists? Is not it clear that the proposal is outside the terms of even the Belfast agreement?

 I am not going to trade with the hon. Gentleman remarks about the situation in Northern Ireland. He has experienced that and knows that far better than I ever will.

The Bill sets out a legal process that will be undertaken in relation to those who have been on the run and who allegedly committed offences before the signing of the Good Friday agreement. He is right that no specific detail in that agreement deals with the issue, but it was part of the wider agreements surrounding the peace process that were made by the Government and other Governments involved in ensuring a ceasefire and continuing peace in Northern Ireland.

 The hon.

It is obviously important to demonstrate to the public that it is safe to use public transport and to go about their lives in the way in which we want them to continue to do, but we must be concerned about the serious and continuing threat that exists. We must explain that in a way that does not unnecessarily arouse fears. However, the hon.

 To return to the subject of the House of Commons cleaners, which was mentioned earlier, my understanding is that the 15&nbsp;per cent. offer that is on the table is not an overall increase in the amount of money available; it is dependent on about 30&nbsp;jobs being cut and a reduction in hours.

I regret that the matter has to be repeated for the benefit of the Leader of the House, but the problem is that he is not answering the question that has been put to him.

If he can give an illustration of where a police officer has indicated to a Member of Parliament that he should vote in a specific way, that is a matter that perhaps we should consider, but I understand that police officers have been indicating to Members of Parliament, as they have done certainly all the time that I have been a Member, their views on the appropriate level of protection that the House should consider making available to the public.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51110-13_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. Charles Clarke): </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_51">It is only a little over two weeks since the Bill had its Second Reading, but I do not think that anyone could claim that it has not been subject to proper scrutiny, both in the House and in the country more generally. The Bill has, very properly, been fully discussed and debated, and what we have clearly represents the will of the House. I reject the suggestion made by some hon. Members yesterday that there has been insufficient opportunity to debate it. We held the Committee stage on the Floor of the House for two days to allow all right hon. and hon. Members to take part, we introduced a second programme motion to extend the time available on Report, and, of course, we now have ahead of us much more time for Third Reading than is customarily the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_52">As the House will know, it had been my wish and that of the whole Government to proceed by means of consensus. To the degree that that has been possible, I pay tribute to my counterparts in the other parties for their co-operation and willingness to engage and talk about the various issues that we have had to address. However, I regret that it has not been possible to achieve consensus in all respects, in particular regarding the length of pre-charge detention. Nevertheless, the Government have made it clear all along that if, for any reason, consensus broke down, we would not hesitate to press ahead with measures that we felt were necessary in the fight against terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">We remain of the view that the offence of encouragement to terrorism is needed and that it needs to be framed in the way in which the House has now agreed. In line with our manifesto commitment, it needs to encompass the glorification of terrorism, and I am glad that the House explicitly endorsed that again yesterday. There is no reason why people should be allowed to glorify the terrorist acts of others in such a way as to encourage others to prepare and commit acts of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_54">As we always intended, and announced as long ago as July, we have created new offences relating to acts preparatory to terrorism and terrorist training. We have also created a new offence of attending a terrorist training camp. No one has any good cause knowingly to attend a place where terrorist training is taking place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_55">Moreover, the new offences will give the United Kingdom the ability to ratify two important international conventions&#151;the United Nations convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism and the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism. I am sure that the whole House will recognise the importance of working internationally in the fight against terrorism. The Bill will also extend the offence of criminal trespass to cover civil nuclear sites so that we can protect them, because they are an obviously tempting target for terrorists. However&#151;I stress this, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 493</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>particularly in the light of our debates&#151;nothing that we are doing in any way disturbs the absolute right to protest peacefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_56">Let me turn to the issue that has probably attracted the most attention&#151;that of the maximum pre-charge detention period. Yesterday the House made a decision on that. It is perfectly proper for it to reach such a decision and I make absolutely no complaint that Members of Parliament have exercised their ability to vote in the way in which they have all individually chosen. What I do regret is that the House has chosen to ignore the professional advice of our law enforcement and prosecution agencies, which we employ to protect us from the very real threat that we face from terrorists. I believed that a maximum pre-charge detention period of 90&nbsp;days was in the best security interests of the country and I remain of the view that we were right to take the course that we did. Nevertheless, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Government accept the decision that the House has taken and we will not be seeking to overturn it in another place.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51110-13_spnew0"><b> David Howarth  (Cambridge) (LD):</b> 
 Will the Home Secretary clear something up? In our discussions yesterday on this very issue, I asked him about the possibility of questioning suspects after charge. In his response, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The hypothesis that we are discussing is that, in a number of cases, there is no possibility of charging on a short-term basis.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9&nbsp;November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 333.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_57">I have had the opportunity to read the code for Crown prosecutors, which says that the test of whether to charge is merely &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; in cases in which it is intended to hold the suspect, and that reasonable suspicion can include consideration of future evidence. Is it really the Government&#039;s policy that people against whom even reasonable suspicion is not present should be held? That strikes me as close to internment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51110-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman reheats yesterday&#039;s discussion. I reject entirely the idea that our proposals can be called internment by any other name. That is quite wrong. He should consider the issue carefully in the light of the possibility&#151;he may reject it, but it is real&#151;that there may be people who threaten our country whom we are not able to charge in the way that we would like.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_58">The House yesterday also accepted the sunset clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick). As I have since discussed with him, his amendment is technically defective. I hasten to say that that it is not in any sense a criticism, but simply a reflection of the fact that he cannot call on the services of parliamentary counsel. However, it does mean that the Government will need to table an amendment in another place to replace it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51110-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I welcome that. The most important consideration is that the House has an opportunity to debate every year, if necessary, the powers of detention. However much we disagree about 90&nbsp;or 28&nbsp;days, will my right hon. Friend take this opportunity to reject with contempt allegations made&#151;outside, of course&#151;that those of us who have a different view, and 28&nbsp;days was the majority decision,

</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51110-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 To be frank, I accept what my hon. Friend says in his personal case. That is true. He has a long and distinguished record of combating terrorism in a variety of ways and has consistently argued for that. He has a different view of the appropriateness of the length of pre-charge detention, but, as I said publicly in broadcasts today, he personally acted with integrity, in a way that is within the traditions of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_59">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, however, I will not take the invitation to say the same about everyone who voted for his amendment. There were people in the House&#151;I do not desire to name names, and I was not intending to say this unless in response to such a point&#151;who do not fully appreciate the nature of the threat with which we have to deal. That is my view.
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51110-13_spnew4"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the Home Secretary accept that people in Nottinghamshire know about the threat and accept that it exists? Will he take my reassurance that my office and my phone have been busy today with people backing the 90-day detention period? They believe that he and the Prime Minister were right, and they would like that to be pursued.
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51110-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am grateful for that comment. It is the case that all recent tests of opinion, as well as the feedback that I have received informally from a large number of colleagues in the House, reflect my hon. Friend&#039;s experience in his constituency. I know that he has always been assiduous in consulting his constituents before deciding how to vote on difficult and problematic issues.

</p>








<p><a name="st_100"><a name="51110-13_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 You will need to advise me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as to whether or not the phrase &quot;ne&#039;er-do-well&quot; is a parliamentary expression. I am genuinely not sure, so I have to be careful about using it or not using it. It is true that I used the phrase outside the House about my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). To be frank, I do not regret using it. There was a conspiracy, in which he was engaged with the Opposition Front Bench, which I thought it appropriate to draw to the attention of the House&#151;

 Order. I wonder whether I can help the right hon. Gentleman? Expressions used outside the House do not fall within the rules of order and seemly language within the House. However, if some of those words are brought into the debate, there is a danger that one might get into the realms of immoderate language.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 495</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51110-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I certainly shall not bring any other such words into the debate. I was seeking to respond as honestly as I could to the question.
</p>








<p><a name="st_103"><a name="51110-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 May I take the Home Secretary back to another point, away from such contentious issues? He said that the annual renewal clause, which was moved by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) and which I supported, will have to be recast in the other place because it was incomplete. I have no objection to that, but why did the Government not move their own renewal clause, thus obliging the hon. Gentleman to move his? Was that in a fit of pique? I fail to understand why that was not done yesterday, when the provision was on the amendment paper?
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="51110-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Sometimes failure to understand is the hon. Gentleman&#039;s characteristic. As I sought to explain in the House yesterday, the Government&#039;s amendment for 90&nbsp;days included a sunset clause for a clear reason. It was that there should be an opportunity for the House to reconsider the situation after a year&#039;s application of the legislation, so that the concerns that had been raised by hon. Members on both sides of the House could be assessed and considered by the House after a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_60">The sunset clause that my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North moved was of a different character. It referred, for example, to annual renewal. Therefore, we decided not to oppose my hon. Friend&#039;s amendment but we, the Government, did not move it. I can confirm that the redraft that we will introduce in another place will accept in all respects the intention behind his proposals. I gave him the commitment privately yesterday that I reassert across the Floor of the House that I will consult him in drawing up the exact wording of what we propose. He can then satisfy himself that we are operating in the spirit of what the House agreed yesterday. There is no intention on my part to go past that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_105"><a name="51110-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke  (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> 
 I realise that the Home Secretary had no opportunity of warning the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) that he was going to refer to him because he was invited to reflect on comments that he made this morning. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman would not welcome my leaping to his defence. Will the Home Secretary reflect upon the rather vindictive spirit in which he referred to the hon. and learned Gentleman because he had been hostile to parts of the Bill? I listen to the hon. and learned Gentleman myself quite frequently and do not doubt the sincerity of his views. I regard it as absurd to suggest that he is in some way sympathetic to terrorism. I have to confess that I agreed with quite a lot of what he said. Is the Home Secretary prepared to modify the views that he expresses for some reason about one of his critics?
</p>








<p><a name="st_106"><a name="51110-14_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker</b> 
 Order. Perhaps enough has been said from either side of the House on the subject of personality. Perhaps we should get on with the substance of the debate.

</p>








<p><a name="st_108"><a name="51110-14_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I have heard no unparliamentary language in this debate. What I have said, and will say again, is that I think that we are getting into dangerous ground and getting into the use of immoderate language if we dwell on personality. I think that enough has been said now. We should draw a line under that and move on with the substance of the debate.

 My right hon. Friend was talking about the sunset clause. If in a year&#039;s time we choose not to renew, we will go back from 28&nbsp;days to 14. Many of my constituents who have been in touch with me today and who have been speaking on BBC Radio Wales and elsewhere want Parliament to consider an extension in a year&#039;s time, if the police still believe that that is necessary and if the circumstances in the intervening time suggest that it should be done. Will my right hon. Friend look at that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_111"><a name="51110-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am certain that my hon. Friend is accurately reflecting the views of his constituents who have been in touch with him. It is always open to the Government to bring back further proposals if we wish to do so. I will shortly make a comment about that process. It is important to get all our terrorism legislation on to a very firm, secure and permanent basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_61">I shall turn to an issue that was raised briefly near the end of our proceedings yesterday, which is the definition of terrorism. I know that several hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), have concerns about that. Even though the Government are not yet convinced that a more satisfactory definition is easily available, we recognise the level of concern about the issue among Members on both sides of the House. I know that the House will be keen to have a further opportunity to consider the definition of terrorism. Accordingly, the Government have invited the independent reviewer of our terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile of Berriew, to carry out a review of the definition of terrorism. I do not think that anyone could cast doubt on his independence or his experience in these matters. I am sure that he will want to take account of the current initiatives in the European Union and the United Nations. As the House may be aware, the UN comprehensive convention on terrorism is grappling with just these issues. I am sure that he will also want to take account of the views that have been expressed in the debates that we have had on the issue in the context of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">Lord Carlile has said that, in performing his task, he will want to see contributions and views, including consultation with people in the House who can make a relevant contribution. I have asked him to complete this

Clearly I cannot predict at this stage what the outcome his deliberations may be, but I can say that we shall provide Parliament with an opportunity to debate and take a view on his conclusions. If consensus is achieved on a change to the existing definition, we would commit to bringing forward that change as soon as parliamentary time would allow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">Lord Carlile is also reviewing the operation of the control order regime that we established under the Terrorism Act 2005. He will be reporting on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">More generally, I am extremely keen to see whether we can find some means of getting the legislation to combat terrorism in Parliament on to a secure and stable basis rather than having a series of emergency arrangements. As the Opposition parties know, we considered in this Parliament trying to bring together the Northern Ireland terrorist legislation that the House is considering in parallel with the legislation that is before us. For a series of reasons about the time of expiry of existing legislation we decided we would not do that. In general&#151;I am not making any proposal at this stage&#151;I am keen to get to a state of affairs where we arrive at a stable and fixed position that is the will of Parliament across the entire range of the legislation. That is the approach that I will follow. Lord Carlile is particularly important in his looking at these issues to try to move into that sort of process. In that context, I would listen to the proposals being made and take them more generally.
</p>








<p><a name="st_112"><a name="51110-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 If that is the course that the Government intend to adopt, we will help and co-operate with the Government in trying to achieve it. I think that the right hon.

If we can be of assistance in that process, we shall take that approach.

I am sure that my noble Friend Lord Carlile will do a good job. I wonder whether he will have access also to the considerations of the Law Commission, which might be of value.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">I suggest to the Home Secretary that he might review another aspect of this legislation that has caused concern, which is the legal context of post-charge questioning. As my hon.

 To return to my right hon. Friend&#039;s exchange with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), in what way has my right hon. Friend dealt with post-charge questioning? Now that the maximum period of detention can be only 28&nbsp;days, what is the Government&#039;s view on allowing the police to question people after charge and adjusting the law relating to bail to allow that to happen? In my opinion, more damage could be done to our judicial system, and in respect of the propaganda point, by going down that route than by sticking with the 90&nbsp;days that we could have had.
</p>








<p><a name="st_119"><a name="51110-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, with his experience, puts his finger precisely on the issue that we are considering. There are attractions in that route, as I have indicated. There are also some significant wider implications for the way in which the legal system, and particularly the bail system, operates, that we would need to consider extremely seriously before taking that course of action. However, I can confirm that we are considering the matter. It is right to do so, but as with every legal reform of this type, and many of the issues that we have discussed, a reform that seems simple in one neck of the woods can become very complicated in other respects.

 As one who jousted with the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety on the definition of terrorism, and who expressed a real concern about the plight of people fighting for freedom in thoroughly unfree and, in some cases, bestial environments, I consider this an extremely positive development.

 May I take the Home Secretary back to post-charge questioning? I appreciate that there may be some difficult practical issues, but if he gets advice, I am sure he will find that the principle of post-charge questioning does not pose any great theoretical difficulty. It may be a change to our general criminal law that could properly be introduced, if there are adequate safeguards. I urge him not to disregard this. The police have consistently said that it is a problematic area in terrorist cases. If we are responding to a problem identified by the police, we should do so positively where we can, especially where it appears to be wholly compatible with the maintenance of the rights of a suspect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_123"><a name="51110-15_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am overwhelmingly delighted that those on the Opposition Front Bench are listening to the advice of the police on these matters.

<a name="stpa_68">No hon.

We face foes who seek to destroy our way of life and everything we stand for. They are happy to sacrifice their own lives in pursuit of that aim and they have no qualms about how many innocent lives they take. I do not pretend that legislation is the only solution to such a threat, but it is very important that we have the most effective legislation at our disposal. The Bill will be another important weapon in our armoury in fighting terrorism, and we need to get it on to the statute book as soon as possible. I hope therefore that colleagues from all sides of the House will unite to give the Bill a Third Reading and to send it to another place.

 The Bill as it now stands merits the continuing support of the official Opposition and will have it. In the unlikely event of the House being divided this afternoon on Third Reading, we will support the Government. I am pleased that the circumstances that have arisen in the House, both in Committee and on Report, have enabled us to do so. It is greatly to the credit of Parliament as a whole that the Bill has been sufficiently improved so that the consensus that the Home Secretary sought has been achieved, even if he might have wanted somewhat different details in the Bill from those that are in fact present. We will give the Bill our support and wish it fair passage through the other place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_69">I hope the Home Secretary will forgive me if I examine some of the details. I had to disagree slightly with him on one aspect. It is true that we have had a great deal of time to debate the detail of the Bill, but we have not had&#151;I do not entirely blame the right hon. Gentleman&#151;sufficient time, particularly yesterday, to decide whether we wanted to make changes to the Bill in certain areas, following that scrutiny. There are issues relating, for example, to whether a defence should be available to somebody who is arrested for having been present at a terrorist training camp. The House has not had an opportunity to decide whether a proper defence should be allowed and, if so, how it should be worded. That will have to be considered in another place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_70">We have also failed to resolve whether there should be a defence for the dissemination of terrorist publications. That has been of great concern to academics and librarians because, as the Bill stands, if one hands out an al-Qaeda manuscript to students so that they can write an essay on it at a university, one commits a serious offence. Only the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions will prevent prosecution. That is unsatisfactory. It is not sufficiently unsatisfactory to make us abstain or vote against the Bill, but it must be tidied up in another place.

<p>
<a name="51110-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_71">We have great problems with clause 1&nbsp;that have not been resolved at all. Glorification remains a concept in the clause and it essentially muddies the provision&#039;s clarity.

 I beg my hon. Friend&#039;s pardon for not being a regular attender at earlier stages of the proceedings. Has sedition been considered in the context of the problem of glorification? That already covers in law the sort of anxieties that the Government rightly have&#151;we would like to support the Government in resolving them&#151;without the side effects about which my hon. Friend is rightly worried.
</p>








<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51110-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. One of the curiosities of the Bill is that, in almost all cases, it is at least arguable that offences similar to those that we are creating already exist. There are some exceptions, especially mere attendance at terrorist training camps abroad and aspects of terrorist training. My hon. Friend is right that the offence of sedition already exists. One of the extraordinary aspects of clause 1&nbsp;is that nobody has yet been prosecuted for the sorts of utterances that it criminalises, yet in the past few years many such utterances have been made and existing law is available to deal with them. The Government have never provided an explanation for that. I have therefore inferred that they take the view that such prosecutions would perhaps cause more harm than good. That poses the question of why clause 1&nbsp;is being promoted with so much gusto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_72">Bringing anti-terrorist legislation together in one Bill may have something to commend it. The problem is that clause 1&nbsp;as it is currently worded remains deeply unsatisfactory. We discussed and debated yesterday the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem of whether indirect incitement can be caused intentionally, recklessly or negligently. The Government have amended the Bill and it now reads slightly better, but it is remarkable that they have adopted a test for recklessness that the House of Lords described last year as no longer sustainable because it risked creating injustice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_73">I have serious doubts about whether the clause will last long in that form when it is scrutinised in another place, where, apart from anything else, one or two former Law Lords may be present who will point out the intellectual problem that it poses. The word &quot;reckless&quot; is incompatible with the way in which the Government have qualified it in the provision. It will create injustice and lead to people being criminalised who should not be. I hope that that will be altered when the Bill is considered in another place. I also hope that the glorification provisions will be amended or removed.

<a name="51110-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_74">There are two major problems in the Bill and we have touched on both. The first is the period of detention and the second is the definition of terrorism. The definition of terrorism colours the consideration of the Bill. I acknowledge that the Government have a problem. We have little difficulty in deciding what constitutes terrorism if it takes place in this country, but much more difficulty when we try to apply the definition abroad, especially in countries that may be governed by tyrannies. It is unfortunate that we have been unable to resolve that problem satisfactorily.

<a name="stpa_78">I do not want to take up too much of the House&#039;s time&#151;after all, we have had plenty of debate. Let me deal with the key issue of the period of detention. I listened carefully to the Home Secretary&#039;s speech and I regret the tone of his remarks on that. When the police approached the Government in the summer, they presented a series of documents. I have seen them, the Home Secretary has seen them and I daresay that, by now, every hon. Member has seen them. Although they raised a clear concern about whether 14&nbsp;days was sufficient time pre-charge to carry out investigations, they never explained anywhere why 90&nbsp;days was the appropriate period to which detention should be extended. Nothing in the documents explained that and nothing since has provided a justification for that figure.

<a name="stpa_79">What is the House to do in such circumstances when faced with a request from the police for a change, and the need to protect the liberty of the subject, which is one of the fundamental reasons for our existence? I say to the Home Secretary kindly that the outcome of 28&nbsp;days, which some hon. Members would argue was too long, represents a reasoned and reasonable assessment of, and a sensible response to, the information that was placed before us. To accuse people of opportunism or conspiracy demeans the Home Secretary and suggests that the Government are woefully out of touch with what this place is supposed to try to achieve. Speaking of opportunism, if we had wanted to be opportunistic in the face of the Government&#039;s propaganda barrage, the solution would have been to say that the period should be 500&nbsp;days, and to appeal to the most frightened or base sentiments in the country. It is greatly to the House&#039;s credit that it did not respond in that way.

If he had come back and said, &quot;We think 28&nbsp;days is too short, but we have decided that 30&nbsp;days is the right period&quot;, it would have been extraordinary if the House had not given serious thought to what he was saying.

All those things were done so that the Government could have their way over the figure of 90&nbsp;days which, as the right hon.

 The sedentary intervention by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) is correct.

Clearly, the House has to respond to the information that it receives. In fact, no justification was ever provided by the police for why they wanted 90&nbsp;days as opposed to any other period.

Something strange has happened. Decision making now seems to be done informally, and those decisions, once articulated publicly, are no longer capable of being subjected to proper scrutiny because that would be seen as an attack on the Government&#039;s standing.

Some Members of the House would hold that 14&nbsp;days, under the existing terrorist legislation, is already a long time, and not something that we should celebrate&#151;we might be forced to accept it reluctantly, but we certainly should not celebrate it. I also said to the media, and, I think, to the Home Secretary, as I remember, that that is our position, but we understand that the Home Secretary is coming up with other options and the ball is in the Government&#039;s court. Those were the very words that I used. The ball remained in the Government&#039;s court, because we never heard anything further from the Government about the matter.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="51110-18_spnew2"><b> Mary Creagh: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that Lord Carlile&#039;s report was on something else, but I was referring to his report on the Bill, in which he discusses clause 22. He also describes his own inquiries and processes as an independent reviewer. He is the person whom the House has charged with reviewing the Terrorism Bill. Why is his opinion not important, and why does the hon. Gentleman think that he and his party are in a better position than the independent reviewer appointed by the Government to review the Bill? Do the Opposition somehow have a greater understanding of the police and the processes involved in the case? On the 90-day point, will he support a move to the investigative magistrate model, which is in place in other European countries? Does he not agree that if there is any chance of mass-casualty terrorism, certain people should not walk our streets?
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="51110-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is not doing herself much credit, certainly on the final point. First, as far as an investigative magistrate system is concerned, the Government have at no stage suggested that that is the policy that they wish to adopt. I only point out that there is plenty of evidence to show that the system of investigating magistrates, which exists in some continental countries, is not free of difficulty, particularly in respect of miscarriages of justice, which she might do well to ponder.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_87">That said, I have never taken the view that our system is necessarily perfect, but it does provide safeguards. As we have debated, there are ways in which, in my view, one can both detain people and carry out the investigation pre-charge&#151;and post-charge, if we applied the rules correctly for post-charge questioning&#151;none of which require investigating magistrates and prolonged periods of detention before someone is brought to trial, which is not a satisfactory state of affairs.

<br>&nbsp;<br>access to information to which Members of the House are not necessarily privy. All that adds to the strength of any of the recommendations or views that he expresses. They are views, however. If Lord Carlile simply gives a view on 90&nbsp;days without the police providing an explanation as to why that is the period required, we are here to apply our independent judgment, not just to say that because some expert or anyone else has pronounced on the subject we should follow that slavishly.

I respect both those Members. I must face the fact, however, that that highlights that we should not suspend our independent judgment just because someone else says that we should do something. Yet the way the Government treated the House was such that it was our obligation to do so. The more the Home Secretary told me that it was my obligation to do so, the more reluctant I was, because I was elected above everything else to defend people&#039;s freedoms. I do not intend to abdicate that duty to Lord Carlile or anyone else.

I do not need to remind Members that, as recently as the Labour party conference, it was reported that a persistent heckler had been interviewed by the police under anti-terrorist legislation.

I was as horrified as anyone by the happenings of 7&nbsp;July, which will live with me for the rest of my life. I am also conscious of what was said some time ago by Sir John Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner. I have great respect for Sir John Stevens, with whom I had dealings when he was in the north-east. He was right to say that no matter what was done and no matter how hard people tried, there would be times when certain acts of terrorism could not be prevented, but that we were duty-bound nevertheless to make every effort to minimise it.

I never heard that, but I may be wrong. I think that, in any event, we should consider another important factor: civil liberties.

No one needs a PhD in English language to realise that that is internment. I shall be honest, and say that I find it extremely distasteful. If someone is interned on suspicion, surely that suspicion will be strong enough to be turned into a criminal charge in a very short time. It should not take 28&nbsp;days. If we are going to lock people up, there should be some semblance of evidence that the suspicion is soundly based.

<a name="stpa_103">Today&#039;s debate offers the House an opportunity to take stock, to reflect on yesterday&#039;s events and the debates of the past few weeks, and to consider&#151;in a more measured way than was possible yesterday&#151;how we should proceed from here. It is unfortunate that the Home Secretary is not present, because I was going to say something nice about him. I have had substantial disagreements with him on this subject over the past few weeks, and I believe that he has made a number of mistakes&#151;and that mistakes have been made for him, notably by the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, he responded to the immediate aftermath of yesterday&#039;s vote with a remarkable degree of personal dignity, for which I give him credit. I must qualify that by saying that he rather blew it today with some of his comments about certain of his hon. Friends.

<a name="stpa_104">The Home Secretary also said that he found Liberal Democrats difficult to debate with. I considered that to be a remarkable piece of praise, for which I should thank him.

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_105">The replacement of the 90-day period and the amendment to 28&nbsp;days has removed a major barrier to our support for the Bill. It indeed gives me and my hon. Friends some reassurance that we can begin to work with this Bill. For that reason, I place on record the fact that we will not oppose the Bill on Third Reading today. If others choose to divide the House, we shall not be with them. We nevertheless view the legislation very much as work in progress. It is beyond doubt that there remains substantial scope for improvement. I want to take some time to highlight a few of the remaining areas of concern from the point of view of my right hon. and hon. Friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_106">On clause 1, it is important to reflect and acknowledge that we have come a very long way from the original views expressed by the Government and the Home Office earlier this summer. The continued inclusion of glorification within the clause, however, remains unsatisfactory, as does the formulation of recklessness, which needs to be fixed. Those matters will be dealt with again in the other place. The concerns of academics about many of the offences in part 1&nbsp;have not had a proper or full airing. They will also have to be dealt with, sadly, in the other place. We also want to put on record the fact that we remain concerned about the lack of proper statutory defences in respect of clauses 6&nbsp;and 8.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_107">Clause 17&nbsp;deals with the commission of offences abroad and it is right to welcome the substantial amendment and restriction of the clause&#039;s scope that the Government put into the Bill yesterday. It is still far from a model of clarity, however, and it may help the House if I read out the amended provision in clause 17, which refers to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;an offence under section 1&nbsp;or 6&nbsp;of this Act so far as it is committed in relation to any statement, instruction or training in relation to which that section has effect by reason of its relevance to the commission, preparation or instigation of one or more Convention offences&quot;.</p>

 Is that not a classic example of where the Home Secretary was wrong to say that we had enough time to debate the Bill? Given that the House has for once improved a Bill in this place, it is a pity that the Government did not give us enough time to do the full job of improvement, so we now have to rely on the other place to do the detailed work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51110-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 Proceedings on this Bill have demonstrated that, if given the opportunity, this House can be trusted to do the job that it is here to do in holding the Executive to account and properly scrutinising legislation. The fact remains that the time allotted to us was inadequate for the job in hand. It worries me that we are sending the Bill to the other place with so many unresolved questions. As is the case with so many provisions in the Bill, clause 17&nbsp;still suffers from the absence of a proper definition of what is meant by terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_109">I welcome the Home Secretary&#039;s announcement from the Dispatch Box today of a review that is to be carried out by my noble and learned Friend, Lord Carlile. I greatly look forward to participating with my hon. Friends and other Members in that review. Implicit in that offer, however, is the Government&#039;s acceptance that they have not got it right. Given that we have 12&nbsp;months before we can revisit the provision, we seem to have legislation that will be firing on something less than all cylinders for the course of those months, so we should not be satisfied with that. In welcoming the review, I also say to hon. Members in this place and our noble Friends in the other place that they should not feel that this is the end of the story on the definition of terrorism. If we can come up with a better definition than the current one, it is still open to my noble and learned Friend to review it, if he feels it necessary.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">Finally, I want to say a few words about clause 23. It is now apparent that 28&nbsp;days is the settled will of the House and I believe that it will be included in the final form of the Bill. In our view, there remains scope for improvement and I remind the House of the terms of our amendment yesterday. I am uncomfortable with the idea that 28&nbsp;days should be automatically available. Liberal Democrats would prefer to put some locks on the availability of extensions from 14&nbsp;to 28&nbsp;days. We would like that extension to be made available only where there was evidence to be obtained from abroad or where there was some issue awaiting a further outcome of an analysis of evidence or perhaps decryption. A judge should be required to be satisfied that no other terrorist charge can be brought. Given the terms of provisions relating to acts preparatory to terrorism, which will eventually be passed with the Bill, it raises the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 513</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bar significantly. The judge should also be required to approve any further questioning that is to be carried out.

<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51110-19_spnew3"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for some check or constraint on the operation of the 28-day period, as agreed in the amendment. There are two reasons why that is important. First, as I said earlier to the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Bill Etherington), many of us voted for the 28-day period only in order to prevent something worse that would otherwise have appeared in the Bill. Secondly, there is the simple principle that, in respect of the police and intelligence services as with any other organisation, work tends to expand to fill the time available.
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51110-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">My other concern is much more fundamental: that the longer a person is held in custody, the greater the likelihood that eventually a court may see that any evidence obtained from that person will have been obtained under duress. Such evidence would then be inadmissible, leaving us with the prospect that, ultimately, the prosecution will be unsuccessful. In that case, either terrorists will go free or people who have had serious allegations placed against them may never have a proper opportunity to vindicate their name because they are seen to have been released on a so-called technicality.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51110-19_spnew5"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 Before the hon. Gentleman returns to the remainder of his list, will he also comment on what the shadow Attorney-General had to say about the uncertainty of the conditions in which these people will be detained? If they are detained in anything other than solitary confinement, is there not a risk&#151;the longer they are detained&#151;of radicalisation? On the other hand, if they are innocent, is there not a danger of them being brutalised by other prisoners merely on the suspicion that they might be guilty?


</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="51110-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point speaks for itself and I agree absolutely. As someone who used to earn his living in the criminal justice system&#151;mostly as a defence solicitor, but for a number of years as a prosecutor&#151;I have seen at first hand the conditions in police stations. In most cases, they are certainly not suitable for a lengthy detention, and the same is true of the conditions in prisons, particularly&#151;dare I say it?&#151;those in which remand prisoners are held. It is the ultimate irony that the conditions in which a person is held on remand are infinitely worse than those in which a person is held post-conviction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_113">We Liberal Democrats will be interested in exploring with Ministers how we can monitor the number of cases that may be dealt with in the extended detention period. I suggest in the broadest possible terms that we could have some mechanism for triggering a report to Parliament on the operation of this part of the Bill once a certain number of detentions has taken place. That would go some way towards addressing the concerns that were expressed earlier about what constituted a small number of cases. We, as parliamentarians, are duty bound to keep the closest possible eye on that issue.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="51110-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Kidney </b> 
: Given what the hon. Gentleman has just said about the Liberal Democrat proposal on questioning after charge, is he saying that whatever the total length of detention may be, whenever a charge is laid there would never be questioning beyond 28&nbsp;days after arrest?
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51110-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 No, and I do not see why the hon. Gentleman could even think that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="51110-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 I pursue this point because of what the hon. Gentleman said about the idea that the longer a person is detained, the less reliability can be given to anything said in interview. Let us consider the example of a suspect who has been detained for 28&nbsp;days, and who is then charged with an offence unrelated to terrorism, such as fraudulent use of a credit card. I choose that example because Mr. Hayman cited such a case. As it stands, the police would grant bail or put before the court. If put before the court, the accused could apply for bail and the court would have the power to grant that. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there would be another change in the law to prevent such a person having the right to bail at all, or would the ability to question depend on whether the court held the person in custody?
</p>








<p><a name="st_172"><a name="51110-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 No. On the question of lesser charges, I hope that the hon. Gentleman has simply misunderstood and is not misrepresenting my case. We have always said that it is a question of other terrorist charges, which is why I made specific reference to acts preparatory to terrorism. On the question of a person being held for a particular length of time, leading to a greater danger of evidence being obtained unfairly in the view, subsequently, of the trial judge, that is no barrier to questioning. However, the longer that a person is held, the more careful the police and the prosecution must be about the nature, extent, duration and circumstances of such questioning. The court will consider the circumstances in which the person has been held. <i>[Interruption.]</i> In England and Wales, all such matters can be dealt with through the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&nbsp;code, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) says from a sedentary position. What, therefore, is the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about bail?
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="51110-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman mean that a person could not apply for bail because the police would need to keep them to ask them further questions after charging?
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51110-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 That question relates to cases where a charge other than a terrorist is charge is brought in the first instance. In Scotland, at least, it would be for the court to decide whether or not a person is admitted to bail. Such a question would be determined on the basis of the procurator fiscal bringing charges. I am not familiar with the concept of police bail, but I see no barrier to questioning taking place after someone has been admitted to bail. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman knows of examples to the contrary. I am mindful of the fact that I am skirting around a subject&#151;English evidence and procedure&#151;in which I am scantily qualified.

 I am glad that we have finally got to the kernel of the issue. There is no question of bail being given when terrorism charges are brought. In any jurisdiction in the United Kingdom, the nature of the offence is always a substantial factor, and in such cases bail is not given.

Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) did point out to me last night, however, that the intelligence services commissioner&#039;s report of earlier this year makes it clear that section 57&nbsp;has not been introduced yet because the extent and nature of encryption has not been as great as was envisaged when the Act was passed by this House.

<a name="stpa_115">I want to conclude by saying a few words about the nature of the debate in this House, and outside it, in the past few weeks. The debate in this Chamber has been of the highest possible quality. Contributions from Members in all parts of the House have been well motivated, sincere, well informed and passionate. That debate has done a great deal, notwithstanding some of the press comment today, to restore the standing of this House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_116">The debate outside this House, however, has caused me some concern. The role played by the Association of Chief Police Officers has crossed lines that, frankly, should not have been crossed. I was going to say a great deal more about this issue that might have proved fairly controversial. However, I shall not say too much today, because the time for that debate is when the dust has settled and tempers have cooled. There is, however, a distinction to be drawn between briefing, which is quite appropriate for a body such as ACPO, and lobbying, which is not. ACPO clearly crossed that line, something with which the House must concern itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_117">The Bill leaves this House with much work still to be done. We see ourselves as involved in a process; we will play the fullest possible part in that. We hope that at the end of the process in the other place what we have is rather better than what we face today.

 I rise to welcome the Bill, as amended. I did not vote for those amendments; I voted for the 90-day provision. Those who know me, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Bill Etherington), know that I am not someone whom the Whips approach and that I have voted many times with my conscience and according to what I think is correct for my constituents. In this case, I had serious reservations. The Bill is amended as it is because the Government lost the argument many times in Committee. At that time they appeared to be conciliatory and to accept that even though, when a Government lose an argument, they may be able to press the vote and get their Members through the Lobby, they then have to reach a proper compromise. In some cases they did, and that is why I welcome the Bill, as amended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_118">My hon. Friend raised the question of moving away from the 14-day provision. We got locked into thinking that we were giving the police the power to slam someone up for 90&nbsp;days almost automatically, rather than the detention being seriously reviewed again and again. I regret that our law did not originally state that people could be held for only seven days before the case went to the High Court for proper review. I believe that holding for seven days anyone who might prove innocent would be traumatic for them and their family, for their personal relations and for their relationship with their community, whether or not that is a Muslim community. When we moved to 14&nbsp;days, we moved beyond what was, without review, a reasonable step. The debate should have been about how many times one could go back and ask, at a review, for another seven days and about why that request should be granted each time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_119">I was therefore much more interested in a number of issues on which the Government have made significant moves. I was not so concerned about the idea of time, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 517</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but the debate became fixated on that idea. If we had been more skilful, we might have got a better amendment that would have allowed the reasonable renewal of detention for seven days, but within a very strict process, which I will mention later.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_120">The question of definition is still difficult, although we have moved a long way. I have discussed this at length with my constituency party and my constituents, some of whom went through experiences similar to those mentioned by my hon. Friend. I represent a large section of the mining community in West Lothian. On incitement, the people to whom I spoke said that they want people to be stopped from inciting. On encouragement, they want people to be stopped from encouraging.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_121">Acts of glorification have to be defined in a proper, fixed and recognised context. &quot;Glorification&quot; is such a vague term that lack of definition could lead not only to miscarriages of justice, but to a waste of time by the police and those involved in intelligence and research. That time should be focused on proper concerns&#151;going to war in Iraq has not improved our ability to fight international terrorism and is a glaring example of our chasing the wrong enemy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_122">I heard a number of Members refer in the debates in Committee and elsewhere to the Jenny Tonge test or the Cherie Blair test: whether glorification could be inferred from what someone has said. When I discussed that with people whom I regard as serious and intelligent, they laughed. What they wanted was a Mr. Hamza test, in which it would be clear whether someone was doing something that could incite or encourage terrorism. We were told that the powers available would not deal with such situations, and they wanted that dealt with before we got into what seemed like silly arguments about what people had said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_123">I have often been to Palestine and seen the victims of what was clearly sniper shooting by the Israeli Government. I have seen the families of children killed&#151;not in confrontations with soldiers, but by the mischance of being in the wrong place when soldiers decided to continue shooting. That leads one to understand why people cross the barrier of what is reasonable and commit acts against other innocents in anger and stupidity. That is not to condone those acts; indeed, one can completely deprecate them. I can see why Jenny Tonge might say what she did and why Cherie Blair might say what she did. That is not glorification of terrorism, and the fact that it was described in those terms was inappropriate and downgraded our discussions in the eyes of the public who followed what we were saying.

<a name="51110-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">The question of the review clause needs to be settled in a better way. Any review clause must be debated on the Floor of the House and carried by a vote of the House. Anything in a statutory instrument may be taken off the Floor or considered in a way that does not allow full debate on the Floor, and that would not be acceptable to those who are concerned about having the Bill at all. I hope that when we get the review clause in its final form, after the Bill has been through the other place and returned to this House, the Government will ensure that we have the right to a full debate on the Floor on a proper motion and that the provision is not slipped through. Prevention of terrorism legislation passed when we were not in government was discredited by the fact that, in the early stages, we did not have those debates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">There was some to-ing and fro-ing about the word &quot;reckless&quot;. It is a difficult word, but I first saw it in an amendment tabled by the Conservative Opposition in Committee. I do not know how one deals with that difficulty in legislation. If people do something innocently but recklessly, which part do we lean on? Do we judge their act innocent, so the police do not pursue them? Or do we judge it to be reckless and have the police pursue them, even though they may end up, days or weeks later, being deemed innocent but a little reckless? Holding them under the Bill would have a damaging effect on their life, their family and community and on the perception of them in the community, and it would also be damaging to the work of the police. I hope that we can have a provision that clarifies what we mean.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">If someone knowingly does something recklessly, such as driving a car and causing an accident, that is different from doing it unknowingly. I think of a recent case in Scotland in which someone thought that they were driving properly but were in fact driving recklessly. That case went to court and the individual was fined because he should have known that he was driving recklessly. We have to get the definition of &quot;reckless&quot; right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">I return to the time provisions that the Bill now contains&#151;28&nbsp;days; four periods of seven days. That may prove inadequate. I know that people voted for that for all the right reasons. The problem is that the House focused on time rather than process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">I was concerned about the definitions used in the Bill, especially in connection with the actions of people who wanted to encourage and support those fighting against oppression and state terror in other parts of the world. The Bill has still not got that quite right. For example, when I was a youth I went around sticking up posters for &quot;Back from Hanoi&quot; meetings. Representatives from the National Union of Mineworkers had gone to Vietnam to find out what was really going on, and on their return condemned what the Americans were doing to the people there. At the time, that was not a popular opinion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">Would the Bill mean that I would end up in the slammer for sticking up posters, going to meetings and handing out leaflets that told of the American atrocities against the people of Vietnam? Theoretically, the Americans were our allies, and thank goodness that the Prime Minister of the time kept this country out of that terrible debacle. We have to get our approach right as we cannot discourage people&#151;anywhere in the world, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">I return to the question of process. Sadly, the House originally settled on a 14-day detention period. Judicial review every seven days depends on the Bill containing the strictest definition of what merits continuation, but I believe it probable that opportunities will arise to abuse the system that is being proposed.That abuse will take the form of acts of omission, and I am worried that the police will think that, in order to keep a person in detention, they will have to prove only that they are pursuing a trail of evidence, regardless of its weakness. In contrast, I think that they should have to show that they are engaged in a serious and ongoing investigation of evidence that has not yet been analysed properly. The important point is that the evidence should exist: if it does not, and the police merely hope that they will find it after holding the person for another seven days, that will be insufficient reason for continuing that person&#039;s detention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_131">The process has to be defined very clearly. In our discussions, we were told that such matters would be kept under review by a High Court judge and that the people in detention would be properly represented. However, I want to know in detail how transparent the process will be. Giving the people involved representation will be no good if they are told by the police that they are in possession of evidence that can be shown to the High Court judge but not to the defence representative, on the ground that it has security implications. I want the people accused under the Bill to have the right to due and proper process, but such an approach would render that process null and void.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_132">In addition, we must make sure that the police do not think that they can hold for 28&nbsp;days anyone whom they pick up. They cannot be allowed to believe that the detention period will be automatic as long as they can show that they are pursuing an investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_133">I voted for a period of 90&nbsp;days because I wanted a reassurance that the proper process would be observed. The actual length of the detention period would not matter to me&#151;or to my constituents, or those in my constituency party who hold me to account&#151;as long as the security authorities were required to show that they were pursuing a trail of evidence. As long as they could do that, detention could be prolonged by successive periods of seven days. The arguments that we got locked into about 28, 90&nbsp;or 14&nbsp;days were less important than ensuring that a person arrested by the police on suspicion of taking part in terrorist activity was held to be innocent until enough evidence had been gathered to allow a charge to be brought. Adopting that approach would make sure that every review by the High Court judge would start from the assumption of the person&#039;s innocence, even though there were grounds for suspicion. At every review, the police would have to prove that extending detention for a further seven days was justified, and they could do that only by demonstrating in an obvious and transparent way that they were accumulating real evidence against the person involved.

If that is the case, the Bill will be a good one. Whoever said that the people who voted for the strongest possible Bill consistent with the wishes of the public was on the money. It is possible that the House will benefit from the way that the Bill has been debated and we may feel that the process of deliberation has been wonderful. However, if it fails to do what it sets out to do&#151;that is, prevent another atrocity such as happened here on 7/7, or on other occasions around the world&#151;we will be held liable by the public.

 I am sorry to begin my Third Reading speech by underlining the fact that I take very seriously the threat that terrorism poses to the citizens of this country. Much of the campaigning that is going on retains an undertone of suggestion that those who have resisted the more draconian elements of the Bill are complacent about terrorism or do not take it seriously, but that is certainly not my position.

<a name="stpa_135">The Home Secretary was in a rather petulant mood today, for understandable reasons.

<a name="stpa_136">I take the threat of terrorism extremely seriously. Over the past fortnight, I have taken as active a part as possible in discussions about the Bill because I think that terrorism is one of the most serious problems that will face this Government and their successors for years to come.

<a name="stpa_137">It is not possible to guarantee complete protection, however dramatic the measures put in place. I have a dreadful feeling that more bombs will explode from time to time, with the concomitant political reaction. It therefore behoves us all to consider very seriously how we will tackle the problem. If we can, we should act on a consensual, cross-party basis to protect our population and minimise the terrorist threat.

<a name="51110-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_138">Many factors outside the Bill are involved. For example, how will we approach resolving the mounting conflict between the Muslim world and the rest of the world? How will we address the question of the relationships between this country&#039;s Muslim community and their fellow British citizens, and how can we make sure that we avoid producing growing numbers of alienated young men who can be radicalised and turned to fanatic activity?

<a name="51110-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_139">Those are important questions, but the key will be to get right the balance between, on the one hand, the force that we apply to security and the fierceness with which we crack down on those who propagate terrorism in this country with, on the other hand, our belief in personal liberty and individual freedom and our need to protect the values of our society that the terrorists want to threaten.

One of the main aims of terrorists attacking a civilised society is to provoke an overreaction by that society&#039;s authorities. The best present for terrorists is to introduce repressive measures that help them politicise and mobilise the elements in the community with which they identify. Those people might then be persuaded that their sense of injustice and deprivation is so strong that it justifies extremism.

Member for Sunderland, North (Bill Etherington) was eloquent and graphic when he demonstrated how people have not merely followed the party line. If the Government need more reassurance, they have proposals forthcoming on education, health and welfare, where they might expect my support on their more well-judged measures. It is no good saying that all Conservative Members are opportunists and that the opponents of the Bill are motivated by ill will towards the Prime Minister or any such thing.

<a name="stpa_143">My opposition to the legislation so far has been on the basis that I regard it as extremely ill considered.

I rather think that it was motivated by a desperate desire to do something in response to the appalling events of July. At the time, the Government were seized with the feeling that they did not know what else to do. I cannot get rid of the feeling that, essentially, the Bill is gesture politics.

<a name="stpa_144">The bombs in July were not caused by any gaps in our legislation. We have 200&nbsp;pieces of anti-terrorist legislation already on the statute book. So far as I am aware, the bombs in July were not caused by the outpourings, however distasteful and unpleasant, of some bizarre, extreme preachers, encouraging people to do what they did. The reaction, at a time when the public were frightened as a result of the horrors on the underground and when the Government were in something of a political panic about how to react, was to suggest that tough legislation and a provision to deport mad mullahs from our territories would be the answer that a strong Government would implement to minimise the chances of that happening again. Since then, we have gone into more detail. Some measures in the Bill, such as offences about preparing and training for terrorism, might add something, but at its heart I still suspect that this is gesture politics, padded out with measures to make it look more convincing.

I brought before the House the renewal of terrorist legislation, suspending provisions of the European convention on human rights. I was opposed by my shadow, the present Prime Minister, for going too far. I was a more liberal Home Secretary than any of my successors. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) was a more liberal Home Secretary than any of his successors. The last truly liberal Home Secretary was Lord Hurd.

My main reason, that it is gesture politics, has been touched on by others. It is difficult to see what almost all its provisions add to the present provisions of the criminal law. Incitements to violence by people preaching in mosques can be dealt with under the present law. It has been a decision of public policy not to prosecute some of the more self-publicising, wild preachers because a judgment has mistakenly been made that that would cause more trouble than it was worth. There is scarcely a new provision in the Bill that could not be covered by a prosecutor under some existing charge, if the evidence existed to proceed against someone engaged in terrorist activities. Therefore, it is ill-considered legislation, which has caused terrible trouble. We now shall see whether anything worth while can be produced from it when it goes to the House of Lords.

<br>&nbsp;<br>essential provisions that bear on the liberty of the individual, are determined by focus groups or newspaper headlines and leaders. The arguments used by Ministers on occasion, both inside and outside the House, have strongly suggested that that is the approach that we should adopt.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_147">We have been told to consult our constituents on the issue. I live near the constituency of Sherwood and I was astonished to hear that the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) has been showered with representations on the issue. I have received only two, one for and one against. I might ask my two correspondents what their feelings were based on and what they thought was lacking in the powers available to the police and the present period of detention of 14&nbsp;days. I could ask them what had led them to the conclusion that 14&nbsp;days, which was introduced only in January last year, was too short and that 90&nbsp;days were necessary. I suspect that neither of my constituents, enlightened though they may have been by the opinions of <i>The Sun</i>, would have been aware of the present constraints, the basis for arrest and charge or the present state of the law. If they had been asked what the case for 90&nbsp;days was, I would have been interested to see if they could have produced a response, because no Minister has yet been able to provide concrete argument to explain why 90&nbsp;days is preferable to 14&nbsp;days, except that I should ask my chief constable. That is what is at the heart of the legislation, and that is why the House has done a good job putting it in its present state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_148">The only argument that has been introduced to justify the provisions in the Bill that extend the law&#151;the extension to 90&nbsp;days and the creation of the new offence of encouragement of terrorism, which are the two dramatic and draconian measures&#151;is that they are needed to face the new threat of modern terrorism. We are told that we must now understand that what we have done in the past to waive our normal civil liberties to deal with extremist terrorism&#151;mostly from Ireland&#151;is overtaken by the modern terrorism, for which the rules of the game have changed. That, we are told, is why we need to toughen up particular provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_149">I find that argument faintly preposterous. I do not like being fobbed off with the argument that I do not understand modern terrorism. Apparently, Irish terrorists were simpler folk and less sophisticated measures were necessary to deal with them. They were decent fellows, apparently, who did not do too much harm and gave a bit of warning. They did not pose the risk of mass murder that we now face from disaffected Islamic youth. Well, I do not believe that. It contradicts my recollection that it was always a mistake to underestimate the sophistication and cunning of the IRA. It knew exactly what it was doing. It went in for mass murder and, when it gave warnings, they were usually slightly misleading, so that the police could be blamed for the casualties that resulted. I do not see that modern terrorism has moved on very much when I recall the outrages in public houses in Birmingham, in which young people were blown up by weapons deliberately designed to cause mass injury in two underground bars. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="51110-22_spnew2"><b> Mary Creagh: </b> 
 Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that, when we were dealing with the threat of IRA terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, terrorists did not have mobile phones, the internet was in its infancy and in most cases the terrorists spoke the same language as us? There were none of the interpretation and translation issues that we find in the current threat.
</p>








<p><a name="st_192"><a name="51110-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall deal with some of those points. First, the mobile phone has proved a great aid to investigation of crime of all kinds. One can intercept mobile phone conversations much more easily than most other forms of communication. I do not understand why the Government adhere to the tradition in parts of the police and security services of not using intercept evidence. I support such use. Indeed, I have always thought resistance to it faintly preposterous; it is getting more preposterous as time goes by. In that sense, things are not moving in the direction that the Bill suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_150">Of course, there is the argument that today&#039;s terrorists are more multilingual, but most of those who attacked us were British-born, spoke perfectly good English and were educated in this country. Certainly, the international links, which the IRA also had, involve a certain amount of multilingual activity, but it is not impossible to find interpreters. We do not have to wait three months to find someone who speaks Arabic. Perhaps if we improved our relationships with the Muslim community, we would receive a constantly ready supply of helpful Arabic speakers. I do not accept the argument about interpretation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_151">Encryption is usually given as the main reason why things should now take longer because the codes to what is encrypted are refused. However, the weapons being used are not that high-tech. Computer technology is not normally required to design today&#039;s terrorist bomb. Reference has been made to communications and planning, but if the only man who knew the codes was dead, it would take someone months and months, unless they were lucky, to decrypt the material on a computer. The idea that the difficulties of modern computer technology justify giving the powers originally in the Bill is not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_152">The changes in the situation are not that dramatic, but the Bill was introduced in the heat of the public reaction to terrible and dramatic events, as though that was something new. The importance of tackling such events is the same as ever, but the exploitation of emotion after the underground bombs should not allow us all to be persuaded that we face grave new threats that justify the erosion of our liberties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">I am delighted to say that, due to the state to which the Bill has been brought by the House, our noble colleagues in the other place will have almost carte blanche to address it and to find what can be made sensible out of the improved but somewhat battered Bill that is about to receive its Third Reading. I invite them to have a go and rewrite large stretches of the measure with all vigour. There are some distinguished people in the upper House who will be able to improve the current Bill beyond all recognition.

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_154">I shall not rehearse the arguments that I have already made in Committee and on Report. We have an extremely difficult clause 1, with the new offence of encouragement to terrorism, into which the ill-fated reference by the Prime Minister to the glorification of terrorism has been rolled. I fail to see the need for that new offence, as incitement to violence can be covered in other ways. The present definition in the Bill is quite appalling. It will catch radical campaigners of both the right and left, and immerse us in international controversy on a scale that should be avoided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_155">We all talked at length about detention without charge. It is extremely important that in all normal circumstances&#151;apart from extreme situations&#151;we do not allow the police of our country to hold people without charge indefinitely, and persistently to continue to question them. The House was persuaded to move to 14&nbsp;days, with effect from the early part of 2004. The Australians are still in a ferocious internal controversy about whether to move to 14&nbsp;days. The 90-day period is preposterous and I have yet to hear a good case for 28&nbsp;days. The only case that would induce me to vote for 28&nbsp;days would be that it was better than 90&nbsp;days, and that if we did not vote for it the Bill would leave the House of Commons unchanged. I hope that the Lords address that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_156">I am rather worried about a consensus that seems to be growing about questioning after a charge has been laid. There are restrictions on the ability to question after someone has been charged in this country, although in my opinion&#151;unless they have changed since the days when I practised&#151;they are not as absolute as some people have assumed. If there is new evidence, questioning can be resumed, and I do not quite see what the difficulty is meant to be. Before we sweep away the whole question of allowing the police to continue to question a suspect after he or she has been charged with an offence, we should hesitate and exercise some care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_157">I agree with those who say that, if the idea is that we should bring in someone without sufficient evidence to bring a charge against them and persist in questioning them day after day for a month&#151;let alone three months&#151;we are likely to start to produce evidence or confessions that no one will regard as reliable because of the undue pressure put on the suspect since he or she was brought in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_158">I mention en passant, because I kept going on about it, that the extraterritorial application of the Bill is absolutely extraordinary. I do not wish to have bizarre litigation in this country with people arguing from strange parts of the world about whether they were terrorists or freedom fighters when they made a speech that someone has decided justifies their being arrested on a visit to London. I really do think that we must comply with our international obligations, but we must not go one inch beyond what we have committed ourselves to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_159">My final point causes me most concern. The atmosphere of the past two or three days, when the Prime Minister made the foolish decision to intervene and stake his own authority on the proposition that got defeated last night, has been extremely unpleasant. An attempt has been made to whip up popular fervour. I have no idea whether the Government were associated

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_160">The Home Office&#039;s encouragement to ACPO and the chief constables to start going in for political lobbying was taking ACPO into very dangerous territory indeed. We all have the highest respect for the opinion of chief constables and indeed for the police who are at the sharp end of the fight against terrorism, but to start lobbying for a political position in Parliament is not what ACPO and chief constables should do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_161">I return to the point that I made when my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) intervened. If we pass criminal law of any kind in the House in response to populist campaigns on the back of well-publicised crimes and if we are all told that we should go out and just take an opinion poll or read the newspapers, we will have some appalling legislation. Indeed, it is the danger that we might slip into that that gives a role to the upper House and, indeed, to the courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_162">Whenever I see a chance being taken to try to bounce Parliament into some ill-considered, populist measure that impinges on personal liberty, I think how lucky in some ways the Americans are to have the Supreme Court to make sure that their Congressmen cannot do that. It is probably wise that we remain signatories to the European convention on human rights, and I do not resent British judges feeling themselves bound by that convention to make the principles of human rights override populist legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_163">We have an upper House, and it is very sad that we have got into a state where this House is increasingly passing silly, ill-considered, populist legislation, with everyone relying on the fact that the upper House will rewrite it. This is by no means the first Bill in the past five years that we have allowed to leave the Commons with all hon. Members on both sides of the House knowing perfectly well that some of its provisions will not last five minutes once it gets to the House of Lords and that, fortunately, the House of Lords will rewrite it and send it back.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_164">The last time that something similar happened, we had all-night sittings when a bizarre attempt was made to bully this House and the upper House into agreeing to provisions on control orders that, I am glad to say, both found quite unacceptable, and the Government had to compromise. I hope on this occasion that having had a bloody nose on the Floor of this House&#151;this is where Governments of all complexions should get a bloody nose when they step an inch too far&#151;the Government will not try to start imposing some of the worst features of the Bill on either this House or the House of Lords.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-22_para18">
<a name="stpa_165">The Bill should never have been introduced. It contains some of the silliest and most curiously drafted pieces of criminal law that we have seen for a long time, and the House of Lords will probably make it much more sensible. I hope that the Home Secretary will finally reveal to us whether he is the gentle face of the Government, or genuinely the conciliatory and more liberal policy maker in the Government. If he has more arguments with the Prime Minister about whether they should tough it out, or reason with their colleagues in Parliament to reach an acceptable consensus, I will be grateful.

We all hate terrorism and we would like the broadest possible agreement on what should be done to enable people to protect us from it. A more measured view is the way to go about that, rather than trying to take through Bills such as this.

 We have heard a lot of argument, discussion and debate in the House. There has been a lot of intellectual haggling and squabbling to try to win the argument on the question of civil liberties and the length of time for which people should be detained. Some of the barristers and solicitors in the House, as well as others, have exercised their vocal cords to try to win the argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_167">I broadly support the measures in the Bill. I recognise the unique situation in which we find ourselves in this country when fighting a terrorist threat of new complexity, with new evils and new murderous proportions. However, I was disappointed that hon. Members did not vote yesterday for a pre-charge detention period of 90&nbsp;days, which the police requested for a good reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_168">My constituents and I are sadly no strangers to the evils of terrorism. In the middle of the 1980s, I was subjected to murderous threats against my life by terrorists and placed under armed police protection. Terrorists in the UK who were supporters of a separatist movement in the Punjab in India murdered three law-abiding members of my constituency in Southall and included me on their murderous hit list. Kashmiri terrorists murdered an Indian diplomat in Birmingham. Those terrorists were able to enjoy the freedoms of this country that were available to them and to foster terrorism here and abroad by disseminating their message and collecting money for their evil acts in the UK. Such opportunities should not be afforded to any terrorists in the future. In summer 2001, a Real IRA bomb exploded in Ealing town centre, in my constituency. It caused millions of pounds of damage to property, but fortunately did not result in the loss of human life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_169">Evil and terrifying as the acts in my constituency that I have described were, they do not compare with the new terrorist threat that we face today in the wake of the 9/11&nbsp;and 7/7&nbsp;terrorist atrocities when suicide bombers were intent on taking as many lives as possible in terrifying circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_170">We all know that we face a new threat of chilling proportions, and we have felt the reality of such a threat with the sad events of 7&nbsp;July. The new threat, with its new complexities&#151;with international terrorists using new technologies and computer encryptions&#151;requires a new response by the Government and the country. New police powers must be given to tackle it. The Government have been pushed into that situation. They have no choice but to tackle the deadly new terrorist threat to protect the people of this country.

<a name="stpa_171">The threat should be met in a united way. The whole House and country should be united. Sadly, the Tories show double standards. When in government, they wanted to introduce tough laws and always claimed to be the custodians of law and order. Now, in opposition, they enjoy the luxury of opposing parts of the Bill and of voting against police advice in spite of the evidence held by the police and security services. What hypocrisy!
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_172">Three different categories of people spoke in opposition to the Bill and the 90-day pre-charge detention period. First, there were those who had genuine concerns about civil liberties. Secondly, there were those who were naive about civil liberties and the terrorist threat. Thirdly, there were those who indulged in cheap politics by opposing the 90-day amendment as a weapon against the Prime Minister and the Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="51110-23_spnew1"><b> Stewart Hosie  (Dundee, East) (SNP):</b> 
 Surely there is a fourth category: those who believed that the doubling of pre-charge detention from 14&nbsp;to 28&nbsp;days to provide the necessary time for the police was useful in principle, and who were not forced to take that position, who were not hypocrites and who did not indulge in oppositionalism? That category should be mentioned as well.
</p>








<p><a name="st_195"><a name="51110-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Khabra: </b> 
 I am coming to that and will tell the hon. Gentleman why the Government had a good reason for introducing the 90-day detention. We are not dealing with an ordinary situation. It is unique. We are dealing not with ordinary criminals, but with terrorists and organised terrorist activity. They have a network everywhere and keep this country under the threat of terror. I agree with the Government&#039;s proposed detention period of 90&nbsp;days. I hope that hon. Members who voted against the police advice of 90&nbsp;days will not live to regret their decision. I also hope that the police will be able to halt the efforts of the murderous terrorists within the 28&nbsp;days that the House, in its wisdom, has decided to give them.

<a name="stpa_173">Detaining arbitrarily a massive number of suspects would be unpopular, counterproductive and wrong. As a Member of Parliament with a large ethnic minority population in my constituency, I am sensitive to people&#039;s concerns. However, I am also convinced that the vast majority of my constituents supported the proposed measures to deal with the threat. The new powers would, I believe, have been used only in exceptional circumstances, where there was strong evidence and it was felt necessary for an early arrest to protect the public from terrorist attacks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_174">We never know how terrorists organise such activities. We know that they have the facilities in this country. Ours is a liberal country, which provides all sorts of protection, even to those who are engaged in such activities. We are dealing not with a catch-all situation, but with something that is designed with the new terrorist very much in mind. I believe that many human rights campaigners and civil libertarians take a naive view of the people with whom we are dealing. They wrongly charge the Home Secretary with trampling on their civil liberties.

<a name="stpa_176">It must be emphasised that we are dealing with a completely new and dangerous situation. Terrorist and suicide bombers from across the world plan for long periods the mass murder of innocent civilians. Some Northern Ireland Members know what terrorists can do, how they organise and how much damage to the community they can cause. It is not ordinary crime where individuals are involved in murder, rape, robbery or fraud and where it is not necessary to detain suspects for a long period. When terrorism is involved and the lives of people are at risk, there is a need to detain suspects for a longer period to enable the police to investigate. When it is a well planned international conspiracy, we all know that al-Qaeda is involved.

When he spoke on 18&nbsp;March 2003&nbsp;in that amazing debate before the country went to war&#151;let us not forget that he gave the House the opportunity to vote on that&#151;he spoke with a passion and an eloquence that I have never heard exceeded by any Prime Minister in my 35&nbsp;years in the House.

 When the Conservative party is in government, it is prepared to listen to police advice but when it is in opposition, and the police ask for 90&nbsp;days for good reasons&#151;to detain people who are involved in or planning terrorist activity&#151;it does not.

<a name="stpa_192">To return to the point that I was making, I believe that we should have been better informed. The point was made yesterday by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe and me, and by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) and others, that this debate has not been structured as it should have been. This has been treated as emergency legislation, but it is not. Emergency legislation&#151;it is generally wrong; one has only to think of the legislation on dangerous dogs, or that enacted after the Omagh bombing&#151;is introduced in the wake of a specific emergency and rushed through the House. There is a case for it in theory, even though it often does not work well in practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">This however is not emergency legislation, and the constraints on the House at this juncture of this Parliament are not such that we could not have had considerably more time to debate the Bill. It might even have been better, within the allotted time scale, to have spent more time on Report and less on Third Reading. We should have been able to debate the definition of terrorism, but we did not. There were other matters that we should have been able to debate properly&#151;including stop and search, on which a new clause had been tabled&#151;but did not. Those issues must be debated. We have had quite a discussion today, following the welcome announcement of Lord Carlile&#039;s new responsibilities.

There must be a tightening up of definitions, and further attention must be paid to the glorification concept&#151;a misguided one, in my view, even though I understand the motives behind it. There must also be a further opportunity to consider the period of detention. I am not convinced that we have decided on the right period. The Home Secretary said that that issue would not be reopened, but it might well be, when the Bill reaches the other place. If it is, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that any amendments made in the other place are properly and fully considered.

In this Chamber, there should be adequate and almost unrestricted opportunity for full and lengthy debate on issues of great importance. In that 1970&nbsp;Parliament in which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe and I were new Members, I well remember how night after night we were kept up by the Labour Opposition, led by people such as Eric Heffer and John Mendelson, great orators in their day, on the Industrial Relations Bill. On the final day, as dawn broke, I remember a chorus of &quot;The Red Flag&quot; coming from the Opposition Lobby, as they felt that they had exercised their democratic responsibility.

 I have listened intently to a large amount of the debate on the Bill over the past few days and weeks. I am glad that I have the opportunity to raise a few issues today, and I will be brief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_200">In the early stages of the Bill&#039;s consideration, I had reservations about the Government&#039;s proposal for the pre-charge detention period of up to 90&nbsp;days. I came to the opinion that there was significant movement by the Government in relation to issues surrounding the clause, brought about largely by the empowered discussion and knowledge of the House. In my mind, the proposal for seven-day judicial review by High Court judges, or by judges of the Court of Session in Scotland, and for defence representation at such hearings, addressed any sort of inappropriate use of the proposals. Having listened to much of the debate, however, I am left with the impression that our judiciary would have been unable to act in everyone&#039;s best interests in the face of a maximum 90-day detention period, which is not a view that I hold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_201">I think that the sunset clause would have provided a suitable way of determining whether the 90-day period worked in practice. It would have allowed both Houses to analyse its use and effect, establish the average number of detention days and then possibly suggest to the Government that the legislation should be adjusted to fit the actuality. I supported the 90-day period last night because I thought that the mechanisms were appropriate. Both police forces in my constituency, Central Scotland and Tayside police, confirmed to me that they agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland on the issue.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51110-25_spnew2"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b>

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="51110-25_spnew5"><b> Gordon Banks: </b> 
 The police were happy with the proposal. They are the experts, and I will be guided by them. I believe that we should be guided by the

<br>&nbsp;<br>experts&#151;the police and the security forces&#151;because they are charged with protecting our security, and because they risk criticism and condemnation if they fail to keep us safe should further terrorist atrocities occur.

<a name="stpa_202">I believe that new threats require new methods, and I believe that the current terrorist threat is new to our way of life. I am not convinced that, in its present form, the Bill deals adequately with the threat that we face. Much has been made of civil liberties and rights, but it has been largely one-way traffic. What about the human rights of people in this country not to be victims of terrorism&#151;not to be maimed by suicide bombers, or killed by religious fanatics who want to destroy our very way of life?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_203">There has been much discussion about the 110-day limit in Scotland, and a certain lack of knowledge has been displayed. As a Scottish Member, I remind the House that the 110&nbsp;days relate to the period between the charge and the case being brought to court. It never was and never will be an additional 110-day period of detention before charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_204">As we have heard, the pre-charge detention period would have been used only in exceptional circumstances. Today Members have mentioned five, 10, 15&nbsp;and 20&nbsp;people. In my view, those are low numbers. Indeed, I fear that 28&nbsp;days will prove inadequate, and that something may happen that could have been avoided if the House had adopted &quot;up to 90&nbsp;days&quot; yesterday.

<p><a name="st_213"><a name="51110-25_spnew7"><b> Gordon Banks: </b> 
 We have had that discussion several times today and in earlier debates, and enough convincing arguments have already been made. I have spent only a short time in Parliament, but I want to say that this debate has impressed me most and that applies to both sides of the House. Despite my disappointment about the conclusion of last night&#039;s vote, I recognise the will of this democratically elected House. I simply hope that the media speculation in today&#039;s press and the words I have expressed today come to nothing.

I will not rehearse those reasons again. We have had masses of information&#151;whether it has been good, bad or indifferent, we have had lots of it from many sources&#151;particularly from those to whom we turn when we want them to look after us and our people. They believe that this unprecedented threat warrants draconian measures that have no parallel in any period of our history. We decided, in our wisdom, not to give them the powers that they sought, but whether we agree with 28&nbsp;days, 90&nbsp;days or something in between, we must not let the situation that we face prevent us from looking at this law in the same way as any other.

<a name="stpa_221">Earlier this week, I raised with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and with chief police officers&#151;the personnel concerned with security in this country&#151;the way in which most right-minded people viewed existing laws as being abused during the miners strike in 1984&#150;85. At that time, police were using Road Traffic Acts and section 5&nbsp;of the Public Order Act 1936&nbsp;to halt miners at the Dartford tunnel and tell them that they were not allowed to travel the 200&nbsp;miles to Nottingham, even though people were trying to enjoy their legal right to picket. We had exclusion orders given as bail conditions, which meant that miners were separated from their families and communities, sometimes for months on end. Perhaps most seriously of all, we saw the use of the Riot Act at Mansfield and Orgreave, out of which, ultimately, no cases were proven. The impact of the application of those laws had the desired effect sought by the Government of the day, who, after all, believed that the people concerned were the enemy within. Miners and their union were prevented from using their right to picket and convince others to support them; the misuse of those laws took them out of the game. We hope that these laws will not be used in that way.
</p>

<a name="stpa_222">I have been advised, and I accept, that the situation is not the same as in 1984. If the Bill had been tightly drawn, so that it could never be used against anyone other than those we are facing today, I would have felt more comfortable with the proposals right from the start. I also have to face up to the fact that our job is not just to prevent innocent people from being locked up; it is also to prevent innocent people from being blown up. Like everyone in the House, I hope that I do not have to visit a mother or father in the next few years and say, &quot;I&#039;m very sorry that your son or your daughter was locked up when they should not have been.&quot; Bad as that would be, surely it would be worse to go and see a mother and father and say, &quot;Sorry your son, your daughter, has been blown up.

<a name="stpa_225">I return to the lessons that we can learn from 1984. We can debate the rights and wrongs of what happened forever, but the actions of the Government at the time, and of the police and the judiciary, led to a massive feeling of disillusion in the mining communities. People came to mistrust the police, and many still do. In addition, 11,000&nbsp;people were arrested in the dispute. Most were regarded as heroes in the mining communities. If the Bill causes the same thing to happen in Muslim communities, we will have a big problem. The Government therefore must make sure that the legislation is as tight as possible. It must be applied fairly, and it must not be abused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">The legislation must be monitored properly&#151;that is vital. I am not sure what the impact of the sunset clause will be, but the law must be used very sparingly.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_228">I want to touch on three issues. First, my colleagues and I will support the Third Reading of the Bill, even though we remain concerned about the question of glorification. Those proposals are drawn very widely and we are worried about some of the possible uses to which the clause may be put. We are also concerned that the Director of Public Prosecutions is the only safeguard against abuse of the provision. However, the overall benefit of the legislation is sufficient for us to set that concern to one side and perhaps to hope that the other place may be able to take some corrective measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_229">We have been mindful throughout the process that this is a terrorist Bill. At every stage that has been at the forefront of my mind, particularly coming from where I do in Northern Ireland. The Province that I represent has suffered considerably over the past four decades. Members who represent Northern Ireland know better than most what the dangers of terrorism are and what the impact of various elements of legislation can be. Therefore, we approached the debate recognising that difficult decisions had to be taken and might not always be understood.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_230">The second issue that I want to touch on is the need for the House to be united in the battle against terrorism. I can well understand that the Home Secretary is a little bruised 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 541</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>today. He seems to be flaying around a little. However, I do not believe that the type of yah-boo politics, &quot;I&#039;m tougher against terrorism than you are&quot; will advance us. Conservatives could argue that they suggested that intercept evidence should be taken into account, which would have toughened the legislation. If I wanted to get into yah-boo politics no doubt I would say that it ill became the Government to lecture the House about being tough on terrorism when, on the day of the Committee stage key vote, they introduced legislation to allow on-the-run terrorists in Northern Ireland to go through a farce of a judicial process to be freed. It does not help us to go down that road. It is far better that we all recognise that the House must be seen to be united in the battle against terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_231">I certainly take it hard to hear the Home Secretary say that those of us who voted for 28&nbsp;days are soft on terrorism. I entered politics because my friend was killed by terrorists. Few of my colleagues on this Bench have not been shot at or bombed. I have had two bombs sent to me and I have to have permanent police protection because of the danger from terrorism. Nobody in Northern Ireland would consider me to be soft on terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_232">I come from a party that was opposed to internment. Because we are regarded as at least a centre right party, most people would have expected us to support internment. We opposed it and we were right to do so. We saw the effects that it had in Northern Ireland. I am not saying that the 90&nbsp;days would have been in effect internment, but there were similar features. The impact on the nationalist community at first, and within sections of the Unionist community later when people were picked up, held for long periods and ultimately released, undoubtedly aided those who wanted to stir up the anger of the community against the state. There is no inconsistency in our position that we were opposed to internment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_233">From Second Reading, we made it clear to the Home Secretary that we were convinced from the evidence from chief constables and others that he had a case to increase the detention period beyond the existing 14&nbsp;days, but we were not at that stage convinced that he had made a case to extend it to 90&nbsp;days. We supported the Government on Second Reading to give the Home Secretary the opportunity to convince us and, frankly, we were open to be convinced. In our own discussions we felt that there certainly was a case to extend the period to 28&nbsp;days. We were even minded to go as far as 60&nbsp;days, but no case suggested to us that 90&nbsp;days was the appropriate length of time. I do not say&#151;and I hope that no one will suggest&#151;that 90&nbsp;days was right or wrong, or that 28&nbsp;days is right or wrong. It was a judgment call; it is not an exact science. There are advantages to 90&nbsp;days and advantages to 28&nbsp;days, as well as disadvantages to both.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_234">The overall balance that we struck recognised the dangers involved in a very long period of detention, not simply because the evidence produced in a court might be rejected because of the length of time for which an individual had been examined, but because of the injustices that could be caused as a result, especially for those who might be considered vulnerable. I am reminded of the case that is known in Northern Ireland as the UDR Four. Serving soldiers were charged and convicted of murder. They were later brought before an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 542</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>appeal court and three of them were released, because the convictions were unsafe. The case did not involve individuals who would have felt strange in the company of police officers or unaccustomed to the pressures of the examination to which they were subjected. However, after a period of detention, they made confessions because of the strain of the examination by the police. If that was possible under existing terror laws in Northern Ireland, it would certainly be possible during detention for 90&nbsp;days. The problem is not only that the courts would find it difficult to rely on such evidence, but the injustice that might arise as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_235">Like the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson), I think that many people would say that we should have a heavy heart if someone were detained for 90&nbsp;days and then released without charge, because they would feel a sense of injustice. We would have even heavier hearts if allowing detention for 90&nbsp;days would have prevented a terrorist act from taking place. However, that argument could be advanced for 120&nbsp;days, 360&nbsp;days or beyond and that is why we had to make a judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_236">Our view was that if the police could not come up with at least a holding charge within the time frame that my party was prepared to allow of between 28&nbsp;and 60&nbsp;days, it was unlikely that they would be able to produce a more substantive charge by the end of 90&nbsp;days. The decision that has been reached is the best in the circumstances. The House has settled its mind on the issue and I trust that we can bind the wounds that divided us and move forward, united, in the battle against terrorism.

Many people wanted a period of 14&nbsp;days on a point of principle, but were prepared to move to 28&nbsp;days. Hon. Members on these Benches chose the provision for 28&nbsp;days on a point of principle because it doubled the length of time allowed, which we thought was adequate. I hope that she will realise that there was a rationale for choosing 28&nbsp;days. We believed that that time period did not breach the right against arbitrary detention. We also thought that evidence obtained prior to the end of the 28-day period would be admissible in a court of law, but that evidence garnered thereafter might not be. Given the Home Secretary&#039;s absence, I hope that the Minister will be more generous than he was earlier by accepting that those of us who chose 28&nbsp;days on a point of principle did so for good reasons, not for some of the nefarious reasons that he perhaps tetchily mentioned earlier.

<p><a name="st_237"><a name="51110-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 The House has arrived at a settled position, so it is now our responsibility to make the Bill work. I assume that the other place will revise the Bill, rather than transform it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_253">I want to consider the advice that we should give to the police on the rare occasions when a person has been detained for 27&nbsp;days and not yet charged. I believe the police and the security forces when they say that they are working actively to prevent and deter terrorist attacks on our soil. I understand why they say that they intervene sooner rather than later. We have heard a lot about how the police can get things wrong, but if they get this wrong, the results could be catastrophic, which is why they require time for investigation. We know that delays to an investigation could be caused by the decrypting of computer evidence, inquiries overseas and the tracing of records on the multiple use of pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The police need reasonable suspicion to arrest people, but admissible evidence to charge them. By the end of 28&nbsp;days, the police will have to decide whether to charge or release. The House must advise them that, if they have not finished their inquiries and do not have admissible evidence, they must release.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_254">Some people hope that the police will charge people with other offences instead. Liberal Democrat Members say that the police could charge a suspect with a lesser terrorist offence. However, the police advise us that they will not have reached the point at which they can decide to charge because they will not have the evidence to charge a person with a terrorist offence at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">Some people have suggested that, if a person is charged with terrorism and must thus be put before a court, the court would of course refuse bail. However, the Hayman briefing note points out that a terrorist was granted bail and left the country, but the police subsequently believed that he was a prime conspirator, so that assertion does not help us. Conservative Members have said that a person could be charged for other reasons, such as not giving the decryption key to the police. However, that would mean that the person would have the right to attempt to get bail, which would interfere with questioning after charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">If we have to change the law to allow people to be questioned after charge and to stop them being granted bail, but if no one says for how much longer after 28&nbsp;days such questioning may go on, we will end up in the same position as we would have reached under the Government&#039;s proposal. However, we would have done more damage to our system and given more ammunition to those who are against us and say through their propaganda that the police make trumped-up charges, keep people in and question them until they get their evidence.

<a name="51110-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_257">The debate has, on the whole, taken place in a good-tempered and sometimes even convivial fashion, so let me be clear: I do not suggest for one moment that the Prime Minister is a tyrant. I think he is a patriot and, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) said, a person of remarkable qualities and courage. I think that sometimes he is right. I happen to think on this occasion that he is wrong. It is a question of an honest difference of opinion&#151;a concept that I hope the Government and their Back Benchers would be prepared to recognise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_258">Specifically, the kernel of my objection to the Bill in its current form&#151;as it was my objection on Second Reading&#151;is that it contains too broad a range of powers, which are too vaguely defined and threaten too much damage, in return for too little benefit. I want to focus on a couple of the arguments that the Government have advanced in support of it. Neither of them strikes me as compelling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_259">One argument is to say that the public want it. That, frankly, will not do. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) argued in a powerful contribution, we cannot reduce ourselves to a situation in which we accept that legislation should be formulated, defended and passed on the basis of survey research or an opinion poll. I argue&#151;I think legitimately so&#151;that we should heed the words of Edmund Burke who, in his letter to the electors of Bristol in 1774, said that he was their Member of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament and representative, and in that capacity he owed them not merely his industry, but his judgment, and he betrayed, instead of serving them, if he sacrificed his judgment to their opinion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_260">We must be prepared to look at the merits of the case. If we are not robust enough emotionally and intellectually to withstand the rather downmarket, low-grade and substandard attacks on us that will emanate from the veritable organ of public opinion, <i>The Sun</i> newspaper, we should not be in this place. I want to argue the case on its merits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_261">The second argument that the Government advance, to which we have to pay significant attention, but which I do not regard as conclusive, is that the police tell us that the power is necessary. I was concerned by the argument of the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks), who said that he was guided by that argument because we have to listen to the experts. We have a responsibility to listen to, but not be overwhelmingly persuaded by, the experts&#039; view. That is especially so if we are not told of the evidential basis for that view. The argument, &quot;The police say it&#039;s necessary, and that&#039;s good enough for me&quot;, may be good enough for some hon. Members, but it is not good enough for me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_262">I want to know the evidential case for an extension of the period of detention without charge from 14&nbsp;days to 28&nbsp;days. I am still not convinced that there is such a case. I certainly should want to be persuaded that there was a compelling evidential case for 90&nbsp;days. It is my view that there is a better way forward. Intercept evidence should be admissible in court proceedings. I fear that the Home Office is against that because, were the policy adopted, it would require warrants to be issued on the basis of a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 548</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>decision by a judge and not simply on the say-so of a junior Home Office Minister. Nevertheless, it is the right course of action and the Government should adopt it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_263">Moreover, there is a better approach. If the security services cannot manage&#151;it is a difficult process because they would have to download computer files, de-encrypt and study the detail&#151;let us have a massive increase in the investment in the personnel, resources and training that are required to enable the police and intelligence services to do their job. I am sad that that argument was not properly explored before the Government contemplated and advocated the abandonment of an historic liberty of the British people. If, in blindfold pursuit of enhanced security, we sacrifice precious liberty we shall end up with neither enhanced security nor precious liberty. That would be a tragedy. I respect the Government&#039;s integrity. I believe that they are motivated by the highest considerations of national protection and public service, but I honestly believe that they are wrong.

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). I was particularly interested in the comments that he made about the attempt to reintroduce intercept evidence. It is worth pointing out that within the past few days the Australian Government have avoided a serious attack&#151;we assume by Islamist fundamentalists. There was excellent intelligence work, excellent intelligence gathering and excellent police work. Yet that Government are now wrangling over whether they should extend their period of detention up to that huge limit of 14&nbsp;days.

<a name="51110-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_264">We have had some very interesting and helpful speeches from hon. Members on both sides of the Floor. One of the best speeches came from the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Bill Etherington), who touched with great principle on a number of subjects, not least internment. The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) spoke equally well but from a different point of view. The hon. Members for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) and for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) talked of matters of high principle. Those speeches sit in stark contrast with that of the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Khabra), who made a rather bitter speech that impugned many people&#039;s intentions and many people&#039;s honour within the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_265">One of the most moving speeches was from the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson). He began by talking about the need to get through and beyond and to grow up from yah-boo politics. He, too, mentioned the juxtaposition of internment as opposed to 28&nbsp;days and 90&nbsp;days. He spoke also, movingly, about the need for the House to combine across the parties in the fight against terrorism. The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) were particularly helpful and illuminating. I agree with him that it does not seem that the Bill falls within the category of emergency legislation. I will deal in more detail with the comments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) in a moment.

<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 549</b>

<a name="51110-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_266">I thought that the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkland&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I beg the hon. Gentleman&#039;s pardon, I was referring to the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty). The Falklands are a long way from home. I am sure that his constituents will not be grateful for that slip. The hon. Gentleman made an interesting series of points but failed to look outside the fact that the Bill should go much further than it attempts to do at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_267">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe made that point exactly correctly when he talked about the terrorists&#039; aim to produce an overreaction inside this country. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) touched cleverly on that. He made the point that longer detention gives a greater possibility of evidence being obtained under duress. That is certainly something of which I have personal experience. I shall return to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_268">The speeches that started the debate need to be examined in a little more detail. The Home Secretary started with the theme of internment. Whether one uses the term or whether, like the hon. Member for Belfast, East, one merely touches on it as having parallels with the problems in Northern Ireland, the one thing that convinced me of the need to go no further than 28&nbsp;days was my experience of internment in Northern Ireland. I suspect the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality would disagree, and he is welcome to do so, but there are parallels. There are similarities and dissimilarities. In a number of arrests that I carried out, people said to me, &quot;I have never lifted a hand against the Crown forces. Yes, I am a nationalist. Yes, I am even a republican. But the thing that persuaded me and persuaded others was my unlawful detention for a long and unnecessary period.&quot; I cannot help but feel that, as a number of right hon. and hon. Members said today, if we introduce a period greater than 28&nbsp;days&#151;I am unhappy even with that&#151;we are in grave danger of producing discontented people who will go back to the communities from which they came and spread the word of resentment against the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_269">Interestingly, my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), in an intervention, spoke about the charge of sedition and why that has not been used. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who has done such a brilliant job of leading on the Bill through all its stages, dealt in some depth with the nonsense of glorification and indirect incitement. He posed the question why no preachers of hate have been charged under current legislation. He went on to speak about the definition of terrorism and about the Government&#039;s vacillation, which has done them no favours over the past 10&nbsp;days or so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_270">If the House is to continue to consider only legislation, we would do well to concentrate on the comments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe who spoke of the Bill as mere gesture. We must get right the period of detention that we impose on our citizens before they are charged, but if the Bill really were emergency legislation, it should have been dealt with immediately after the attacks in July. We made that offer to the Government at the time. I fail to understand why we spend so much time concentrating 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on legislation which, after all, will not deter a terrorist from carrying out the new form of terrorism, about which we have heard so much today. If the Bill were not merely a gesture, we would have considered the concrete measures needed to protect our people and physically stop such attacks happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_271">I regret that the Government have changed their position several times. I thought last week that the Home Secretary would reach some accommodation with us that allowed the whole House to go forward together. Sadly, I believe that the Prime Minister changed the Home Secretary&#039;s mind. That has weakened the Government&#039;s position, both in their own eyes and in the eyes of the public. I also very much regret the way the Association of Chief Police Officers has been used to make political points and, to borrow the words of the hon.

 This has been a good debate and I am grateful to all hon. Members who have taken part. Although our audience is a little depleted compared with yesterday, some important issues have been raised. The Bill has had a fairly eventful passage through the House. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) asked why we did not introduce it in the immediate aftermath of the events of 7&nbsp;July. We gave undertakings that we would deal with the Bill in normal time as far as we could, so that it received proper scrutiny in the House and was not dealt with by way of emergency legislation.

He suggested that charging on the basis of the threshold test rather than the evidential test would be an easy alternative to a lengthier pre-detention period. I am not sure whether he knows that, if one charges on the basis of the threshold test, one must get the evidence to fulfil the evidential test within one or two days of choosing to charge on the threshold test.

When it is in the interests of justice for detainees to have put to them&#151;and have an opportunity to comment on&#151;information about the offence that has come to light since they were charged or informed that they might be prosecuted, one can question post charge, but the defendant must agree to be interviewed.

They could not put them to the suspects in an interview because they were not discovered until after the detention period had elapsed. If one cannot put the evidence to the person who is the subject of the charge, one cannot get an explanation of the circumstances of the evidence and, when one gets to trial, the evidence is much weaker. I presume that the hon. Gentleman has read Andy Hayman&#039;s paper in great detail, because he is the kind of Member who would.

The measure on offences preparatory to terrorism is really important. On direct and indirect incitement, we do not have indirect incitement on the statute book at the moment. Also, there are differences between the terrorism that faces us now and the terrorism that we have faced in the past. Certainly the emergence of suicide bombers is something that we have not seen in the past, and it presents a real challenge for us to deal with.

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="51110-31_spnew0"><b> Greg Clark  (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the subject of local government finance in Kent. I am grateful to the Minister of State for being here at the end of what has been a busy week for all of us, and to my hon. Friends for joining me for this important discussion. I do not intend to use this opportunity to excoriate the Government to make us all feel better. Instead, I want to take the opportunity to make some serious points, and to invite the Minister to reflect further on some of the pressures that my and my hon. Friends&#039; constituents face when the budget settlement, on which Ministers are consulting, is finalised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_292">People get the wrong idea about Kent. Because it is close to London, in the south-east of England and has beautiful countryside and historic towns and cities, such as the one that I am proud to represent, they assume that we are universally affluent, with no social or economic problems or real worries. That is far from the case, however. Even Tunbridge Wells has some areas where deprivation is as extreme as in other places that are more renowned for their levels of social deprivation. A charity in my constituency that does fantastic work in one of the most deprived areas of the county has even had to take the name Tunbridge Wells off its letterhead, because its experience was that when looking for donors and applying for grants, people turned a blind eye and assumed that there was no possible need to help the poor and vulnerable in Tunbridge Wells. That is not the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_293">Kent is more surprising than many in the outside world realise. In terms of deprivation, for example, 12&nbsp;per cent. of Kent constituents are wholly dependent on benefits&#151;a massive figure. Kent has 5.6&nbsp;per cent. of all the looked-after children in the country, which is twice the national average. It is important that we give the best possible service to those young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_294">Far from being an area in which proximity to Europe and London has resulted in jobs galore with high productivity and salaries, we lag behind in knowledge work. For example, only 13&nbsp;per cent. of people in Kent are employed in the knowledge industries&#151;only just over half the level in south-east England as a whole, which is 24&nbsp;per cent. Areas of deprivation are therefore scattered across the county.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_295">The case that I and, I am sure, my hon. Friends want to make to the Minister is not one of special party political pleading, but for a review of the situation in Kent. As the Minister considers the funding settlement, I want to commend such a review to him for five reasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_296">First, deprivation and trends in deprivation in Kent should be considered. Sadly, deprivation in Kent is deteriorating compared with other parts of the country. Between 1991&nbsp;and 2001, on all the key indices of deprivation, it has shown a marked decline. In Kent, the number of pupils in the areas of greatest deprivation is increasing, which is the opposite of the pattern across the country whereby growth in pupil numbers tends to be in the more prosperous areas. No doubt there are various reasons for that, but it is a fact. Because there is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 556</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a uniformity of decline in socio-economic indicators, it is particularly important that Government funding keeps up with the facts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_297">We know the indices of deprivation. They are very clear in the 2001&nbsp;census, and yet the Government persist in allocating funds not on the basis of that census, which is already nearly five years old, but on the basis of the 1991&nbsp;census, which is almost a generation out of date. People in my constituency, especially young people, should be given their fair share&#151;no more than that. If the Government persist in using the 1991&nbsp;census, a whole generation will have passed their lives as children without the care and support that they might expect if the Government were up to date.
</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="51110-31_spnew1"><b> Sir John Stanley  (Tonbridge and Malling) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that given the level of deprivation to which he has referred, it is unjustifiable that whereas when the Government came to office Kent council tax payers were contributing a quarter of local government expenditure, eight years later they are being asked to shoulder more than a third? Is that not grossly unfair to them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="51110-31_spnew2"><b> Greg Clark: </b> 
 I agree with my right hon. Friend, who makes his point with characteristic force. The position is particularly unjust in view of the fact that the statistics relating to Kent match those relating to other areas that have been treated more generously. My constituents, and those of my right hon. Friend, feel let down by the Government.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_298">The second factor is our ageing population. As we know, the population throughout the country is ageing, but in Kent that is happening with particular force. In the next 15&nbsp;years, there will be 56&nbsp;per cent. more people over 85&nbsp;living in Kent. We know the reasons for that. People have always moved out of London to the home counties, especially to seaside resorts, to retire. A problem that affects the country as a whole affects Kent particularly severely. Yet again, however, the funding formula does not afford my constituents and Kent county council the fairness that has applied to other parts of the country. The average payment for an elderly person in the London boroughs is over &#163;1,600&nbsp;a week; the figure in Kent is &#163;630. That is a massive difference, which cannot be explained by the cost of accommodation and services. Paradoxically, we in Kent are given much less money with which to look after our elderly people although wage pressures and property costs are as high as in other parts of the south-east.
</p>








<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51110-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, but the position is even worse than that. Many elderly people from London are in Kentish homes. Absurdly, there may be two elderly people side by side, one of whom is receiving more than twice as much Government funding as the other although they are in nursing or residential homes at the same cost.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051110/debtext/51110-32.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51110-32_spnew0"><b> Greg Clark: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. My constituents are often bewildered to find that they cannot obtain places in Kent care homes and must move miles away to Hastings or the Medway towns, because the Kent homes are full of people being funded much more generously by London boroughs.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 557</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_299">There is a further paradox. Many people who move to Kent after retirement start off with a reasonable level of resources enabling them to look after themselves, but run through those resources as they get older, especially as care home costs increase. Because they have become resident in Kent, the Kent council tax payers end up footing the bill. A number of anomalies combine to produce a very unfair position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_300">The third factor that makes Kent a special case is the particular burden that we bear for the care of asylum seekers. It is appropriate that Kent, as the gateway to Europe and, in many respects, the rest of the world, should extend the warmest possible courtesies and welcome to those who come to our shores as refugees, and Kent county council has a record second to none for so doing, but that comes at a price. It is important that council tax payers who happen to be in Kent, which happens to be the gateway, are properly recompensed for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_301">I am afraid that the system of obtaining what is only reasonable reimbursement of asylum costs from the Government has proved tortuous. It has taken hours of the time of Kent county council officers and cabinet members and resulted in less than satisfactory settlements that have ended up being compromises. For example, claims for 2003&#150;04&nbsp;have only recently been settled, and there is an outstanding bill of &#163;4.5&nbsp;million for 2004&#150;05. That introduces, for a social services department that is one of the best in Britain, a damaging degree of instability. It is difficult to plan for excellent provision if it is unclear for what part, if any, the Government will pick up the bill. It is important that Kent county council should benefit from some certainty and stability in the funding of asylum costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_302">The fourth area in which Kent has been relatively poorly treated is education. We have some of the best schools in the country and many of my constituents have moved to Kent because of the quality of its education. It is important for us to support our teachers and head teachers in their work. The Government&#039;s most recent regulations include a requirement for 10&nbsp;per cent. of teachers&#039; contact hours to be set aside for what is called PPA&#151;planning, preparation and assessment. To be fair to the Government, some financial provision has been made across the country to allow for that. Kent, however, has fallen short of what is required yet again. We have received an average of 3&nbsp;per cent. less funding for work force reform than the country at large. For an average-sized secondary school, that means a shortfall in funding of &#163;100,000&nbsp;a year. I know from talking to head teachers in my constituency that that is a huge sum, representing the cost of nearly three teachers. We all know how important it is to ensure that our children continue to be well educated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_303">Having spent time during the recess sitting in the back of classrooms and observing the work of teachers in my constituency, I saw first hand just what a strain it is for head teachers to have to arrange for these periods of preparation without the necessary resources to bring in cover or extra teachers. It has put heads and teachers in an invidious position, which should not be the case when the rest of the country has been treated more generously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_304">Finally, there is infrastructure. Many of my hon. Friends have experienced, and continue to experience, the pressures that growth can cause to the infrastructure in their constituencies. As it happens, Kent incorporates 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 558</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>two of the Government&#039;s prime growth areas for residential development&#151;the Thames Gateway and the area around Ashford. That places considerable burdens on the infrastructure. While it is true to say that some financial provision will eventually follow, Kent county councillors maintain that the Government have been niggling in the amount allocated and there is also the important issue of timing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_305">Eventually, the increased population will, of course, bring with it greater resources in the form of Government grants and council tax. If we are to proceed rationally, the infrastructure should be laid down in advance of people arriving in our county. Roads must be built before people need to use them and schools need to be opened before others are full. That means often running at below capacity as we build up towards higher capacity. The Government&#039;s funding allocation mechanisms compensate for population when it is there, but do not anticipate population movements. We are sure to find over the months and years ahead that schools and roads will be in the wrong place. That will occasion expenditure that will have to come from the county council&#039;s own resources, as it is not compensated for in the Government&#039;s funding formula.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_306">So there are five specific, one might say technical reasons&#151;none of them, I contend, are pungent party political reasons&#151;why the settlement in Kent should be looked at carefully to ensure that it reflects these cost pressures. Sadly, that appears not to be happening. My hon. Friends will recall that when the last local government funding settlement was entered into, Kent was a big loser. Ultimately, Kent council tax payers lost &#163;55&nbsp;million. I am aware that a system of ceilings and floors will mitigate the effect of that settlement over time, but ultimately, it will cost every council tax payer in Kent in the region of &#163;100&nbsp;a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_307">Because of the failure to update the socio-economic census data, which are now 15&nbsp;years out of date, another &#163;9&nbsp;million has been added to Kent council tax payers&#039; costs. It is estimated that the Government&#039;s latest proposals could result in a further relative loss of up to &#163;33&nbsp;million for Kent council tax payers. So, altogether, Kent is losing out by &#163;100&nbsp;million a year, compared with other parts of the country. For reasons that I have outlined, we have particular pressures relating to some of our most vulnerable people. This is not a situation that the Government should be proud of, and I hope that they will reflect further during this consultation period on whether it can be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_308">It is not that Kent county council is profligate, wasteful or ineffective; quite the opposite. It is one of the United Kingdom&#039;s flagship councils. It has consistently achieved a comprehensive performance assessment rating of &quot;excellent&quot;, and it has been especially commended for its financial prudence. It has gone beyond the Gershon targets in terms of savings made. In every respect, this is an excellent council. Over the years, its leadership has been responsible and has been prepared to engage in rational discussions with the Government. Indeed, Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart is one of the most respected local government figures in Britain today. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister nods his assent. Sir Sandy&#039;s successor, Mr. Paul Carter, has a distinguished record in education. He knows at first hand the pressures that our schools face, and I am sure that he will continue that responsible record.

<p><a name="st_257"><a name="51110-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  (North Thanet) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) on securing a debate on a subject of incredible importance to Kent Members of Parliament. It has got to be wrong that one of the most beautiful counties in the country&#151;a county that is the garden of England, and which has phenomenal natural resources and proximity to the capital city&#151;should also host some of the highest levels of social deprivation not just in the south-east, but in the country. East Kent, Thanet and parts of Dover&#151;I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser) is unable to be here this afternoon, but I am sure that he would agree with me&#151;host levels of deprivation that people in the metropolis would probably find hard to grasp. Much of that deprivation has been imported. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells said, it is not the result of bad local government&#151;quite the reverse. As he also said, Kent is a flagship council&#151;it has been performing superbly since Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart took over what was indubitably a basket-case and turned it round. The economy of the county has, in the past dozen or so years, come on in leaps and bounds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_310">Nevertheless, what we face, and have faced continually in the 22&nbsp;years for which I have been a Member of Parliament, is an influx of social problems. Throughout the 1980s, east Kent, and particularly Margate in my constituency, suffered from what became known as the dole-on-sea syndrome, as the unemployed from around the country and Ireland came to Thanet to live in seaside hotels and guesthouses, on the dole. As that problem was solved, what has been described as a wave of asylum seekers hit Kent. Dover and Thanet in particular have borne the brunt of that and of the social, cultural, educational and medical problems that arrived with people from some of the most deprived places in Europe and, indeed, the world. That has placed an enormous strain on the county.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_311">In tandem with that, there has been an influx of retiring people, many from the east end of London&#151;people who spent their honeymoons in Margate 30, 40&nbsp;or even 50&nbsp;years ago and wanted to retire to the dream of a seaside home. They are now living in genteel and, sometimes, less-than-genteel and rather sad poverty. In many cases, one partner in the relationship has died and the other is left on very strained resources. Those people, I have to say to the Minister, are the ones who end up running out of money and being supported, not by the east London boroughs, not by Tower Hamlets, not by Islington, but by Kent county council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_312">Kent is paying for the placements in retirement homes, but we have seen a diminution in the available care. Homes have closed in their dozens because there is not the funding in the east of the county to make them commercially viable&#151;they are, after all, businesses. In

<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 560</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the west and north of the county, homes have thrived, but not by making provision for the elderly of Kent. Those homes are, as my hon. Friend rightly says, accommodating clientele being paid for by the London boroughs at &#163;1,600&nbsp;a week in funding from central Government. The Minister has to be able to explain to us, the representatives of these constituents, why a granny in Kent is worth a third of a granny coming from Islington. That is what we are talking about. Central Government gives money to Islington, for example, and the council buys space in Kent because it cannot be bothered to make provision for its own elderly, and still pockets a healthy balance.

<p><a name="st_259"><a name="51110-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 I am not talking about Kent county council&#039;s old people&#039;s homes, which, by modern seaside standards, are simply not viable. If the hon. Gentleman wants to go down that route, I can tell him that Campfield, in my constituency, is about to be closed by the county council because it cannot meet the standards required under regulations. That has been the case way down the line. If the hon. Gentleman is seriously suggesting that somehow the county council should be able to keep open homes that do not meet today&#039;s modern standards or offer the desired facilities, I have to say that I do not agree with him. If he is saying that Kent ought to be refurbishing, rebuilding, modernising and reopening these homes, I might just agree with him, if Kent had the money to do it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51110-33_spnew2"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman argues in favour of the Care Standards Act 2000, which I supported&#151;but which the Opposition did not&#151;for the reasons that he now presents. The home closures of six or seven years ago took place because Kent no longer wanted to be a provider, but merely a commissioner and purchaser. The closures had nothing to do with quality.

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51110-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 That is incorrect, as there were severe implications about the quality of the homes involved. Those Opposition Members who know something about the matter did oppose elements of the 2000&nbsp;Act&#151;I have to be careful, as I chaired the Bill in Standing Committee&#151;but on the basis that taking away an en suite lavatory from an elderly person merely to provide an extra square metre of floor space was a nonsense. To be frank, the elderly person involved was not likely to get out of bed and play football, so a lavatory was of more use than the space. There are many other examples that I could give the House.

<a name="stpa_313">The Registered Homes Act 1984&nbsp;led to improved standards in both local authority and private residential homes by the end of the decade.

</p>

Is it then surprising that they resort to daubing graffiti and to engaging in antisocial behaviour, vandalism and truancy? Of course it is not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_316">Best practice in social services says that those young people should be placed as close to home as possible, yet they arrive in Kent with no provision having been made for their education or medical care, and they receive no attention worth speaking of from social services. No resources follow them to provide the policing and other back-up that they need. They are simply dumped.I have spoken to the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), who has responsibility for these matters, and asked for a moratorium. To date, nothing has happened, even though the Thanet report has been on her desk for months. The cost incurred in looking after these dumped children is another one that the Government are not meeting.

<a name="stpa_317">I come now to the question of asylum costs. Opposition Members in Kent have fought long and hard for the money that the Government acknowledge that the county should have to meet the costs incurred by asylum seekers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells said, we have just about cleared the slate up to 2004, although that has involved rather more give than take on our part. The Home Office agreed the figures&#151;grudgingly&#151;and has finally shelled out for the costs incurred up to 2004.

 The hon. Gentleman refers to the grudging way that the Government have reimbursed Kent county council for its expenditure in respect of asylum-seeker children. I want to emphasise that the county has spent that money on children, as adults are dispersed around the UK. When the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) was Home Secretary, no money at all was reimbursed to the local authority. Does the hon. Gentleman recall that?

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="51110-33_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 What I cannot recall is when the hon. Gentleman came to the House, but I have a clear recall of other matters.I recall clearly saying to a Home Office Minister in the summer of 1997, on good advice from Kent police, that a wave of asylum seekers from the Czech and Slovak Republics was about to hit Kent. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) and I drove from Kent to the Home Office, demanded to see the Minister 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 562</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and warned him, on the strength of the information given to us by Kent police, that that was about to happen. The Home Office did nothing about it. When my right hon. and learned Friend was Home Secretary asylum figures were falling. The problem started in 1997&nbsp;and worsened. I will take no lectures whatsoever from the hon. Gentleman on that score.
</p>








<p><a name="st_266"><a name="51110-33_spnew8"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 I would not want to appear to be lecturing the hon. Gentleman. For his information I came to the House in 1997. Before that I worked for 10&nbsp;years for Kent social services, so I have first-hand knowledge. I knew that the local authority was not reimbursed by one single penny from the then Government. His idea is that when we arrived in office in 1997, that was somehow a watershed for asylum seekers. Does he recall the conflict in Kosovo and the conflicts that have arisen around the world? It is not just Kent and this country that have seen an increase in the numbers of asylum seekers, but many countries across the world.

<p><a name="st_267"><a name="51110-33_spnew9"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 I am prepared to give way again if the hon.

The costs bear no relation to each other. The costs to Kent of asylum seekers prior to 1997&nbsp;were minimal.

With respect, the hon. Gentleman did nothing whatsoever to help to secure the funding. Kent was owed &#163;14&nbsp;million by central Government and had to fight for every penny of it, but still did not get every penny of it.

<p><a name="st_271"><a name="51110-33_spnew13"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 Simply on the strength of the information and representation made to us by the leader of Kent county council. If the hon. Gentleman can produce the letters that he has written to Ministers asking for payment, I should be delighted to see them and even more delighted to acknowledge that perhaps he played a tiny part in securing the money. The fact is that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Government have for years failed to pay. If he made representations, they were not effective. We waited a long time for the money. Perhaps he can now explain why we are still waiting for the &#163;4.3&nbsp;million for the period from April 2004&nbsp;to April 2005. Why has that money not been paid? That is probably a question that the Minister should answer. To be fair to the hon.

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to visit Herne Bay in my constituency and see how green fields are being built over without any infrastructure to support that building. Look at how many houses have been given planning consent; look at the lack of primary and secondary school places; look at how children who cannot get into the single secondary school in the town are bussed, at Kent county council&#039;s expense, halfway round the county to get their education; look at the lack of road infrastructure; look at the fact that the Government have failed to give priority to the vital east Kent approach road that might just help Thanet, the area with the highest level of deprivation in the south-east; look at the shortage of doctors; look at the growing shortage of water; look at the lack of sewerage infrastructure for all those houses, and tell me where the money will come from. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) was right in his intervention earlier. If we are to build houses&#151;and I accept that people have to have homes&#151;we have to make provision for primary and secondary education, and transport and medical care, before and not after the event.

<a name="stpa_320">My hon.

The fact is that there is no justification for the Government not basing Kent&#039;s grant on at least the most recent census figures. It is nothing short of a scandal that Kent is being short-changed because of a grant based on census figures that are very nearly 15&nbsp;years out of date.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Nov 2005 : Column 564</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) on the measured way in which he set the scene, although, inevitably, some of us will feel more strongly about such issues than others. He described the problem as the perception that Kent is particularly affluent, which is the issue at the heart of this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_322">We do not have to take my hon. Friend&#039;s word on that problem because, in February, when I complained about the funding for Sevenoaks on the local government finance report, the Minister&#039;s predecessor told me that it was an affluent area and that was why we had been badly treated. If the present Minister cannot recall the basis of my complaint, I shall tell him, because it was very simple. In terms of the increase in per capita funding since 1998&nbsp;for all the district councils, county councils and police authorities in England, Sevenoaks was 424th out of 424&nbsp;for percentage change. We were the worst treated. In fact, we had no increase at all and were among four or five councils that had actually been cut in per capita terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_323">The House does not have to believe my hon. Friend. The Minister himself said that our funding had been cut because Sevenoaks was an affluent area. It is true, of course, that some constituencies are more affluent than others, but it is equally true that there are serious pockets of deprivation in every constituency, including mine. Parts of north Sevenoaks, and especially in the town of Swanley, can match any of the deprived areas about which my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) spoke so eloquently. The problem with the funding allocation is that it does not properly reflect the serious pockets of deprivation that exist alongside some of the more affluent areas. It does not respect the fact that all our district councils and the county council have to provide the same basic services as councils in areas that are better treated by the Government&#151;perhaps in the north. We all need the same basic services, so it is wrong that councils are treated unequally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_324">My hon. Friends made some powerful points about the care homes scandal, asylum costs and so on. I have three short points. The first is that the Government must deal with the widespread perception, or allegation, that they are covertly switching funding from south to north. The Minister may try to deny it&#151;he may even admit it&#151;but it would be for the good health of the debate generally that, if there is such a policy, it is made explicit and Ministers have the guts to say that they are moving money from southern districts to northern metropolitan districts or the larger conurbations. If Ministers are doing that, they should say so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_325">It is remarkable that if you look at the league table, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;the list of 424&nbsp;district councils, county councils and police authorities to which I referred&#151;you may not find that your local authority is anywhere near the top of the table, where there is a strong north-east, north-west and midlands flavour. Few southern councils appear there. If the Government, through their decisions about annual local government allocations, are moving money from south to north that is their decision. They are the Government so they are free to do that, but they should at least be explicit about it and accept what they are doing, so that they can be judged accordingly by my constituents and, doubtless, by the constituents of the hon. Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) and for Gillingham (Paul Clark).

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_326">My second point is about London weighting. It will come as no surprise to the Minister that I return to that point, as I have been making it constantly since 1997. London weighting is a shambles. Time and again, I have pointed out that police officers can resign from the Kent force to join the Metropolitan police and immediately earn an extra &#163;3,000&nbsp;a year, due to the effect of London weighting, but remain in the same housing in west Kent. Nurses in our hospitals in west and north Kent can transfer across the line to work in a London hospital and gain London weighting.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_327">The arrangements are different for each public service, but in each case that I raised, because the arguments were so overwhelming, Ministers responded&#151;I must be fair to them about that&#151;but only in an ad hoc way. The Kent health authority was given additional money to deal with the problem. The then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) accepted that there was a problem and gave a one-off allocation to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_328">Two years later, the same thing happened in relation to the police settlement. Kent police authority was given additional funding to tackle the problem, which was more acute in the west Kent than the north Kent area: in Tunbridge Wells, Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, we lost about 30&nbsp;officers in a single year. Ministers had to respond, but they did so in a completely ad hoc way, from service to service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_329">If we are talking about joined-up government, someone must consider London and south-east weighting regionally. It is absurd that some weightings in London extend outwards to Hampshire or parts of Essex, but not to Kent. It is absurd that some people are eligible in some public services, but not in others. The whole thing must be considered more coherently and those of us on the fringe of London should not have to beg each time for additional resources in respect of individual funding streams. The whole of Kent should be classified properly, with London, as a high-cost area because that is exactly what it is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_330">My third and final point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells touched on, is that I am quite sure, having served my constituents for the past eight years, that we are not getting our fair crack of the whip in terms of spending on infrastructure. The Minister has a north-western constituency.

It is striking that in regions such as the north-west, part of which the Minister represents, it is almost impossible to go from one town to another without travelling on some sort of motorway&#151;the M60&nbsp;or whatever. We in west Kent still seem to have much of the infrastructure that was placed there in the 1920s or the 1930s&#151;for example, the single-carriageway A21, along which my constituents must travel if they want to go to Pembury hospital or further south.

Several of the Conservative Members in the Chamber will remember a debate that was held in February 1997&nbsp;when they attacked the county council and went on about its various visits and trips abroad. That was a disgraceful assault on a local authority that could not defend itself. There were no Labour Kent Members at the time. I have read the transcript of that debate and wonder if the hon.

<p><a name="st_280"><a name="51110-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 In that particular year, Kent county council spent &#163;5&nbsp;million on computer equipment and furniture for the education department&#039;s offices. The computer equipment did not result in any job savings and administrative manpower continued to increase. Although &#163;5&nbsp;million was spent on furnishings and equipment for offices, there were classrooms without enough chairs in them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_281"><a name="51110-35_spnew3"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 That was the first time that Kent&#039;s local authority had spent more than its standard spending assessment. In the years during which I went to schools in Kent, it spent consistently much less than its SSA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_336">I am delighted to talk about schools in Kent. They were underfunded for years, and it was not until the administration of 1993&nbsp;to 1997&nbsp;that they started getting resources. Let me address the area of my constituency and that of the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley), who is in the Chamber. He knows that in our area, the Malling school, Aylesford school and Holmesdale technology college are being rebuilt at a cost of about &#163;50&nbsp;million. The total amount of private finance initiative money in Kent is about &#163;80&nbsp;million. Aylesford school, which the right hon. Gentleman knows well, is a series of huts. There was no prospect of getting that school refurbished to a modern standard with the levels of capital spend present under the Conservative Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_282"><a name="51110-35_spnew4"><b> Sir John Stanley: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must do his homework. Aylesford school received a substantial capital grant from the Conservative Government because it was one of the first schools to achieve grant-maintained status. It received major investment from the Conservative Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_283"><a name="51110-35_spnew5"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 I am well aware of the building. Grant-maintained status gave a little bit to a few schools, but there was little hope of the school getting the real refurbishment that it needed. When we got into office, the Tory Government had been spending &#163;800&nbsp;million a year on school buildings. That is quite a lot of money when one thinks about it, but not when one considers that that figure is &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion this year. Such funding means not that there is just one small capital project in Aylesford school, but that the whole school can be rebuilt. The contrast is stark. Money is being spent on schools throughout the county. There are now more teachers and classroom assistants in Kent and they are better paid than before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_337">The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) talked about the police service and leakage to the Metropolitan police. Such things occur from time to time, but the Government responded positively to that situation. They got little thanks for that, just as there was little thanks for the &#163;1&nbsp;million for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s school at Riverhead. The Government gave that money and that has happened time and again throughout the whole county.

 I did not want to intervene because I spoke at great length. Nevertheless, the &quot;Come on&quot; related to the police. The hon. Gentleman knows that Kent police are in dire financial straits. He knows that Thanet and Canterbury have lost policemen to the Medway towns to make up for those who are going into the Met. He knows that there are no special constables in parts of the county because they have been taken into the regular force to make up the numbers that we have lost to London.
</p>








<p><a name="st_287"><a name="51110-35_spnew9"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 Kent police have more constables than ever before. The Medway police force is at full strength. It has not been before. The decision to allocate police officers is not for politicians but an operational matter for the chief constable. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that it should not be, let him say so. We have more than 100&nbsp;police community support officers. The chief constable supports that. The hon. Gentleman knows that the chief constable will bid for a further 500&nbsp;over the next two years. We have investment in our health service. Kent was one of the first counties to meet the three-month target for cataract operations. That is what is happening in our hospitals, schools and police service. Each service is increasing and each is in a better shape than it was when we got into power in 1997.

 There was a long list of road proposals at the time, but the money had never been allocated to them.

The Chancellor in 1996&nbsp;admitted that there were no resources for those projects, and they did not go forward.

<a name="stpa_341">Again, in my area, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling campaigned for many years to get a special surface put on the M20. It would have cost millions, and the Conservative Government refused every time. Their policy was that it was not possible to have quieter road surfaces unless it was a new road or it was being widened, but our council, with his support, managed to get them to change that policy. We got the quieter surface, which helped our constituents. That is another road improvement that has assisted our constituents.

 I merely wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is listening to what he says. In the period that I was in the House before he was&#151;those years of Conservative Government immediately beforehand&#151;the extra sections on the M20&nbsp;were built. During that time, huge investment was committed to the Thanet way, which my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) and I enjoy. It was completed shortly after Labour came into office, but the bulk of the building was done under the Conservatives, when the money was committed to it. Since Labour came into office, I cannot think of even a bypass that has been built in Kent&#151;and the hon. Gentleman talks about resurfacing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_291"><a name="51110-36_spnew2"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 I am sorry to keep picking on the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling. The Leybourne bypass is being constructed as we speak. Many road and infrastructure projects have occurred in that period. I told the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) the amount of money that Kent county council has received. That was only to tackle road congestion and public transport. There is also the &#163;70&nbsp;million that the council received. It said in its press statement that it got more than anyone else in the country. On roads, public transport, schools, police and hospitals, what we heard from Conservative Members was that Kent has not been getting its fair share whereas that simply is not the case.

 I know the Kent and Sussex hospital very well. I used to take adults with learning disabilities when they sadly had accidents to the hospital when I worked in that area. The right hon.

<p><a name="st_294"><a name="51110-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 I have been listening with interest to the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw). I intended to be brief but the hon. Gentleman has provoked me to speak at slightly greater length than I intended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_344">The distinction should be made very clear between current and capital spending. I shall comment on what the hon. Gentleman said about capital spending. About 95&nbsp;per cent. of the examples that he gave involved capital expenditure whereas the basic submission of my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), apart from the remarks that he made at the end of his contribution, related almost entirely to the problems in current spending. Yes, there are some problems of infrastructure and I shall start by saying something about that, but the main issue is the ever-tightening garrotte on the level of current spending&#151;rate support grant&#151;available to Kent county council for people in old people&#039;s homes, children in care and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_345">On the capital side, the hon. Gentleman really must find out about Kent&#039;s road programme. The last Government invested a fortune in Kent&#039;s roads&#151;the building of the extra sections of the M20&nbsp;for the link-up with the channel tunnel, the dualling of the Thanet Way, in which my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet played such a vital role over all those years, and which was finished about 18&nbsp;months after the present Government took office, and the dualling of the A2&nbsp;extension of the M2. There was one programme after another, all carried out by the Conservative Government. Under the present Government, there has been virtually no capital expenditure, apart from the odd tiny bypass in the road programme, and money available for road repairs has declined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_346">There are other areas that I could challenge. I shall mention one on the capital side. The hon. Gentleman made great play of investment in the NHS. Certainly, a great deal of money has been invested in new hospitals in other parts of the country, but it is in east Kent that there were two and three-day queues in casualty, after the Government took office. There was a two-page

</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_347">The burden of the debate and almost the whole of the submission from my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) was on current spending and the tourniquet that the Government are applying to the support grant for current spending in the county of Kent. I remember arguing once with a group of people in the Tea Room&#151;I have some friends in the Labour party, and I count the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford as one of them&#151;about whether it is worse to be poor in an area neighbouring better-off areas or to be poor in a poor area. The answer must be that it is much worse to be poor in south-east England than in a relatively deprived area, for several obvious reasons. One is that it is much more expensive to provide support for poor people in an area with neighbouring better-off areas, because it is a struggle to attract well-qualified people into the public services there. Another reason is that food and other basic amenities are more expensive near a better-off area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_348">In east Kent we have a particular problem. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet said, in parts of east Kent and one or two other parts of Kent we have some of the worst deprivation statistics anywhere in southern England. In some wards in Thanet, the statistics are among the worst in the country. However, the fact that we are relatively close to the capital means that we have serious additional problems. Against that background, the dire figures take some explaining.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_349">I will not go through the equation on the funding of the elderly, which my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells so effectively covered. I shall take the parallel equation for children in care. My hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet is right about the dumping of children in care in Kent, without the associated money always coming with them in knock-on areas such as education and health. Putting that to one side, how can it be right that a child in care in Kent gets from the Government &#163;263&nbsp;a week, compared with &#163;425&nbsp;in Blackpool, an area in the north of England where costs are lower, and &#163;1,373&nbsp;in a London borough such as Islington?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_350">Hon. Members will know that over the years I have taken a particular interest in children in care, particularly through my role in the all-party group on adoption and fostering. I am horrified at what is happening to our local social services as a result of the squeeze on funding. I shall give an example. It is no good talking about shiny new buildings and the rest of it; we are talking about current money to cover current costs. One of the effects is that almost no provision is left for the most awkward fostering cases. In the old days, special placements would have been provided, because it was acknowledged that those cases were simply too difficult for most foster parents to cope with. The money is no longer available for that. I spoke recently to foster parents who told me that several of their colleagues had given up fostering because children had been placed with them with whom they were simply incapable of dealing.

<a name="stpa_358">I also want to point out that the last delegation that came to see me from a county was not from a Conservative county in the south-east of England but from Labour-led Lancashire, which also feels that it is being treated the worst. I am a fair person and I approach these matters in a non-partisan way. However, Lancashire has also received increases in its budget. Of course, hon. Members on both sides of the House have raised issues on behalf of their constituents, but can we please acknowledge that there has been an increase in funding, and that these problems are relative ones? If I were tempted to be partisan, I would point out that, in the four years up to 1997, there was a real-terms reduction in the grant to local government of 7&nbsp;per cent. So, fair&#039;s fair. Last year was the eighth successive year in which the Government provided local government overall with an increase in total Government grant above inflation. And it was the third year in which we were able to guarantee increases for all local authorities at least in line with inflation.
</p>

I do not deny the pressures on social services, but I want to put this in context. Spending on social services over the past 15&nbsp;years&#151;again, I am making a non-partisan point&#151;has doubled, at a time when gross domestic product per head has increased by 50&nbsp;per cent. So we are meeting a new demand, and this is a more civilised country as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51110-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_360">Specifically on this Government&#039;s watch, we have provided some &#163;11.5&nbsp;billion this year for adult social services, which includes some &#163;1.9&nbsp;billion paid to councils as specific revenue grants. That includes the additional &#163;100&nbsp;million of non-recurrent funding to support existing older people&#039;s services, which was added to the access and systems capacity grant. Total funding for children&#039;s social services was &#163;4.3&nbsp;billion, an increase of 8&nbsp;per cent.

I could also point out Labour-led local authorities that would make the same point that he has made. Of course there is a difference in the per capita funding. I do not have the exact figures at the moment, although I might come to them later, as they are somewhere in my very extensive briefing. I accept that there are differences in the figures, and the hon. Gentleman will have to be patient in regard to the forthcoming settlement.

The specific grant increase in funding direct to police forces is more than 5&nbsp;per cent. Specific grants enable us to target funds where they are particularly needed. The crime fighting fund, for example, has enabled us to secure record police officer numbers. No police force has received less than a 3.75&nbsp;per cent. general grant increase this year. That is substantially above police pay increases and inflation, and above-floor increases range up to 6.8&nbsp;per cent. Again, the points being made by hon. Gentlemen are relative, not absolute.

I have already given one example of the staggering waste in the education department at a time when schools needed the money in the classrooms, but let me give two wider examples. First, we had 15&nbsp;chief education officers then, and a chief education officer was paid more than the Prime Minister. Within weeks of the Conservatives&#039; taking over, the number had fallen to six. Secondly, the council managed to spend all the reserves, apart from the legal minimum, in running up huge debts, but in the end it was squealing that it was not receiving enough rate support grant, despite a formula that was much more generous in comparison with those in other parts of the country than it is today.

I am not here to defend Kent county council&#039;s actions during the period concerned, although I would imagine that&#151;as my hon.

<a name="stpa_371">The hon. Member for North Thanet asked why people were displaced from London. That problem affects all major cities, particularly in Kent and parts of east Sussex. The reason is probably the high costs to London local authorities were they to keep the care homes in London. I know from my own constituency that, unfortunately, people with severe problems&#151;especially mental and disability problems&#151;have been placed in homes many miles away. I wish that that were not the case, and the Government&#039;s policy is to reverse the position, because it is better for local people to live locally.

<a name="stpa_372">The hon. Gentleman cited Islington council. I am pretty sure that it is controlled by the Liberal Democrats. Perhaps we can unite at this point, because, as usual, no Liberal Democrats are present. I am sure that if Islington council were spending local and national taxpayers&#039; money on accommodation at the rate at which they would have to spend in central London, the hon. Gentleman would be lambasting it here and elsewhere.
</p>








<p><a name="st_305"><a name="51110-38_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gale: </b> 
 The point is that Islington&#039;s grant per elderly person, and indeed per cared-for child, is three times the grant that Kent receives. That is supposed to reflect the very costs in London that the Minister has mentioned. Like a number of London boroughs controlled, probably, by all parties, Islington is placing people in Kent, buying facilities that Kent cannot afford in its own county, and pocketing the change. The money was put there for the council to provide for itself. Let it do that.


</p>








<p><a name="st_306"><a name="51110-38_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must face up to the paradox that his own speech exposed. First, one could not reasonably pursue a policy whereby spending on social services for the elderly in inner London boroughs should be the same as that in shire areas, though we could argue about the differential. Secondly, it is not reasonable to say that any authority should provide residential care only within its own boundaries. I do not think that I would like to live in a country where that was the case. Local authorities across the political parties should be congratulated on making efficiency savings. If they are getting a cheaper&#151;in the financial sense&#151;service by placing people in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, it is easy to understand why they should be doing so. If Islington can make financial savings, I would have thought that both my party and the hon. Gentleman&#039;s should congratulate the council on that.

 The Minister is awarding boroughs such as Islington higher costs for looking after its elderly, reflecting the higher costs in the area, but if it chooses to spend a greater amount in sending old people out of those areas, surely that should sooner or later be reflected in the allocation that he makes. The council cannot have it both ways. If it is getting extra money because the area has higher costs and then benefits by sending its elderly out of the borough, is it not unfair on other authorities that are receiving a lower grant?
</p>

 The impression has been given in the debate that that is the only criterion for the allocation of money.

Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) makes a serious point, which I will take very seriously. The consequence of doing what he recommends would be to punish success. It would be to tell councils that are producing efficiencies and spending council tax payers&#039; money more responsibly that that money should be withdrawn from them.

 The hon. Gentleman, who shouts from a sedentary position, is in danger of becoming the Chicken Licken of the Tory party. The channel tunnel link was a Conservative Government initiative, and the policy was that it should be paid for entirely and exclusively with private money. The scheme collapsed, and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister negotiated a package to save it. Is the hon. Gentleman denying the Labour Government&#039;s crucial intervention to ensure the modernisation of the channel tunnel and the creation of a fast link? He virtually implied earlier that we are not allowed motorways up north. Goodness me! The idea that there are more motorways up north than down south is ridiculous.

 Is it?

<p><a name="st_312"><a name="51110-38_spnew9"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The policy of this Government is that all areas should share in prosperity. I was asked for an assurance that there is no policy of northern bias by stealth, but that observation is based on the assumption&#151;one could almost say prejudice&#151;that up north we are all poor. The second richest county in the UK is Cheshire, and there are bits of the north and the north-west that are beautiful, just as there are bits of the south and south-east that are poor. In the run-up to the local government settlement, the special interest group of municipal authorities accused us of not giving money to the north and of giving it all to the southern softies. I apologise to SIGOMA; I was paraphrasing. Equally, southern authorities are accusing us of the reverse. However, the formulas are based not on geographical distribution, but on a genuine attempt to achieve fairness that is being made in the context of a rising tide. So I can give the assurance that has been sought on this issue, and if Members look at the figures, they will see that my point is borne out by the position of, say, Lancashire, in relation to other county councils. The Government&#039;s policy is based on the view that the differences within regions are as great, if not greater, than they are between regions. The poorest areas in the country are overwhelmingly in London, and some of the richest are in Cheshire and Yorkshire. A very fair point was made about pockets of poverty, and the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) relayed his interesting conversation in the Tea Room about where it is better to be poor. I do not want to be drawn into that, because the truth is that there is a balance in this regard. It is more difficult to get a job in a poorer area, but I acknowledge that there are perhaps extra costs associated with living in a pocket of poverty in a richer area.

It is fair to point out that it would be wrong to assume that there are no pockets of deprivation in the better-off areas. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks said that my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) described Sevenoaks as an affluent area, and that that is why it is badly funded. Sevenoaks is a relatively well-off area, but there are no doubt pockets of poverty and deprivation within that. Our policy is to ensure that our funding formula addresses that.

I would include in the equation the difficulties and differences resulting from the area cost adjustment. Incidentally, those systems were not set up by this Government, but the hon.

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could clarify something on the record because it might help a lot.

There is a fear that all a developer has to do is go to appeal, and

<br>&nbsp;<br>because of the ODPM&#039;s attitude, the appeal is bound to be granted, at the local ratepayer&#039;s expense. Whether the development is designated by the Deputy Prime Minister is almost immaterial; the effect is the same.

 I listened to the point that the hon. Gentleman makes as a constituency MP, and take it at face value. I hope that what he describes is not the case: it is certainly not the Government&#039;s policy to encourage such a development or such attitudes.

<a name="stpa_385">Finally, I want to put on record some of the statistics that I promised earlier. In the past five years, Kent has received an annual average increase in formula grant of 5.4&nbsp;per cent. In total, it has received an extra &#163;200&nbsp;million in grant over that period, on a like-for-like basis. That substantial annual increase is above the rate of inflation each year. Over the same period, Kent has increased council tax by an average of 7.4&nbsp;per cent.

<a name="stpa_386">Moreover, Kent&#039;s provision of personal social services for adults this year amounts to some &#163;278&nbsp;million, up by 6.1&nbsp;per cent. from last year.

<a name="stpa_387">The figures involved are clearly substantial. This year alone, Kent has received a 7&nbsp;per cent. increase in total resources for children&#039;s social services. As a three-star social service authority, no part of Kent&#039;s social services resources is ring fenced, so the county can target those resources at the greatest need.
