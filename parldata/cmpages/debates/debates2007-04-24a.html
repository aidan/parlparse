 The digital technology being delivered through the national programme for IT is already being used widely by clinicians on a daily basis, and 91 per cent. of general practitioners have made a booking through choose and book. Most importantly, it is bringing benefits for patients by improving their care, safety and experience, and by improving the efficiency of services across the NHS in England.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that the British Medical Association&#146;s working party on information technology is concerned about the non-compatibility of the IT systems of the four home countries, and in November it wrote to the director general for IT in the NHS to express that concern. Will the Minister please say why it was not thought appropriate to design compatibility into the systems from the outset, and what effect does she think that lack of compatibility will have on patient safety, particularly in border areas?</p>

 Of course we are working with our colleagues across the borders of England to set standards and to consider issues of interoperability. For example, although the devolved Administration in Wales have chosen to adopt different approaches to the development of IT in relation to the health service in Wales, we are in discussions about how we can facilitate the migration of existing NHS shared administrative services, so that the NHS care record service data spine can be used. We are working together, and I am pleased to say that across England, we can prove that we can work with the system to produce results daily. Choose and book is rapidly being taken up across the country, and we are making progress on electronic prescriptions and many other measures. I am sure that that is something that the devolved Administrations will want to consider.</p>

 Among the large number of answers that I have received from Ministers is one from 4 September last year in response to a question about what information the Department collects from primary care trusts, acute trusts and strategic health authorities on the allocation of budgets for choose and book, as well as information returned about assessment. The answer was &#147;None&#148;.

 We regularly collect information in different ways on the choose and book system and how it is working. I was pleased to visit a GP practice on Monday, and I talked to the GP about how it was working in that area. One thing is true: the IT to support choose and book has been delivered; the IT to support electronic prescriptions has been delivered; the broadband network has been delivered ahead of schedule; and digital X-ray machines have been fully deployed across London and the south of England. That is what is happening, and it is transforming lives.

It is not just embarrassing, it is shameful that no Government Department is prepared to get a grip on the problem, whether it is the Department for Communities and Local Government funding local authorities, or the Department that runs the health service.

 Some very specific things have been done to bring local authorities and the NHS together at the local level. Local area agreements bind them together through shared objectives and targets, joint appointments are increasingly made between the health service and local government at local level, and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill requires a duty of partnership for the first time from local government, primary care trusts and other health bodies.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is at the heart of the debate about re-engineering services away from the acute end of the national health service into community-based health services and social care.

Local area agreements, a statutory duty of partnership, guidance on how services should be commissioned in an integrated way&#151;all these matter, but so does the culture at local level.

However, as I recently saw at Harrogate district hospital&#151;one of the two best hospitals in the country, according to the Healthcare Commission&#151;it is very possible for a small hospital that has made itself the focal point for a wider network of care to provide outstanding services to patients within its community.</p>

I congratulate the staff at Manor hospital and the local primary care trust.

Eighteen hospitals will expect to achieve that 18-week target one year ahead of time by the end of this year. Staff at Gateshead, Walsall and other hospitals are reorganising services. For instance, in the case of orthopaedic patients at Walsall, the staff found that it was taking 200 hours of staff time, much of it administrative, to take a patient from initial receipt of the GP referral through to the hip replacement or other operation. By reorganising the way in which they worked&#151;not by putting in more money&#151;they reduced that to just 30 hours, enabling them to transform the lives of between six and seven people in the time they had previously taken to treat just one.

If it were to be acted upon in the north-west of England, where there is one type 1 A and E department to every 207,000 people, half the A and E departments in that region would have to shut.

 I think that we can all see the next Conservative party campaign coming, with the misleading propaganda that we have come to expect from it on health. The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point that different A and E departments will offer different sorts of services. For the most specialist services, including stroke services, about which I know he has a long-standing concern, a larger population is required to ensure that specialist staff are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to deal with the patients who need that care. Different A and E departments will provide a different range of services. That will be one of the key themes of the guidelines and proposals on urgent and emergency care that the Department will publish shortly.</p>

Those were adult, often mixed-sex, wards, which contained people who had committed homicides, in which the girls were subjected to sexual abuse and invasion of privacy, and received little or no age-appropriate treatment from inappropriately qualified staff and no help with their education. On behalf of the hundreds of children placed in those wards&#151;the number is growing&#151;they begged for the age-appropriate amendments to the Mental Health Bill to be retained. They do not think that the Lords amendments would prove to be a straitjacket, because they would provide for age-appropriate treatment and allow for emergency admission. Why are they wrong?</p>

 I am not saying that those girls are not well intentioned, or that we do not want to ensure that the situation improves. At the moment, the number of such bed days&#151;that is, the number of days when a bed in an adult ward is occupied by under-16s and 16 to 17-year-olds&#151;is dropping. We need to ensure that we have more accurate information about that.</p>

If they were on an adult ward, that would be difficult to achieve. In that sense, the problem is a real one because the CAMHS specialist would not be assigned to an adult ward. Were it more appropriate for the care of an individual aged 17 to 18 to place them on an adult ward, they would not have access to the specialist. As I have said, however, there are certain problems with the Lords amendments&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. One of the most important reforms introduced by &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; was to open up new opportunities for nurses to build their skills and take on new responsibilities. Under the old Whitley scale, a clinical nurse specialist grade 1 could hope to achieve a salary of &#163;26,000&#151;barely twice that of a newly qualified nurse. Under the new system of &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;, by November this year a nurse consultant at the highest level will be able to earn more than &#163;90,600, which is a measure of the change and improvement that we have been able to make.</p>

 I understand the concerns of nurses and other health service staff about the staging of the pay award. When we accepted the independent pay review body recommendations across the public sector, not simply those for the NHS, we decided to stage the implementation for this year as we took account of the wider economic position on inflation and interest rates. That is not only fair to nurses and other public sector staff, but right for the public as a whole.</p>

 I have just explained, as I have on many occasions, why it was necessary to take account of the wider economic circumstances. It would not be in the interests of newly qualified nurses or anybody else were we to see inflation and interest rates return to the levels that they reached under the Conservative Government. We will not take risks with the economic stability and strength that have been achieved, particularly as a result of the policies of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. The hon.

Given that the independent review body for nursing not only rejected the Government&#146;s figures but criticised the Department of Health for failing to provide any evidence as to how its estimate was reached, does the Secretary of State understand how angry and cheated nurses up and down the country feel when the Government seem to be plucking figures out of thin air in order to keep salaries low?</p>

<h3 align="center">Carers (Identification and Support)</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="70424-0004.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="07042428000466"><h5 align="left">3.33 pm</h5>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="70424-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07042428000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require health bodies to identify patients who are carers or who have a carer; to require identified carers to be referred to sources of help and support and to make further provision in relation to such arrangements; to make provision in relation to the responsibilities of local authorities and schools for the needs of young carers and their families; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07042428000151">In March 2006, I introduced a Bill with the same aims as the first part of this new one. As I told the House then, 1 million carers in the UK care for more than 50 hours per week. The 2001 census figures show that carers are twice as likely to suffer ill health if they care for 50 or more hours a week. Medical research also suggests increased ill health among those caring for a person suffering from dementia or stroke disease. It is my view that we must intervene to identify and support the most hard-pressed carers, who care for more hours than the hours of any full-time job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07042428000152">In my Worsley constituency, the highest level of caring commitment is needed in the two wards with the highest levels of people with stroke and heart disease, and with cancer. While the national average is one in five carers caring for more than 50 hours a week, that rises to one in four in Walkden North ward in my constituency, and to one in three in Little Hulton ward. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07042428000153">Those carers play a vital role in health and social care. They are key partners in care for the NHS, but their own health is also threatened and there is a need for recognition of carers&#146; health needs. In 1999, the Government gave GPs and primary health care teams a five-point checklist for use with carers in their practice population. The first requirement in the list was that GPs should identify those patients who are carers or who have a carer. Eight years on from the launch of that national strategy, research shows that the work done nationwide by GPs and primary care teams to identify carers in their practice population is still inconsistent. Research by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers concludes that only a small proportion of the total number of carers is being identified. Even GP practices with good links to their local carers&#146; organisations are not doing the work necessary to identify all those carers whose health might be affected by their caring responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07042428000154">Two carers known to Carers UK provide examples of how important it is to identify carers. Valerie Low of Carlisle cares for her husband, who was severely brain damaged in a car accident in 1997. For years, Mrs. Low did not know that advice or respite care were available to help her as a carer. Now that she has been identified, she arranges respite care from Crossroads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07042428000155">Tracy Barker from the Isle of Wight has cared for her son for 16 years. He has autism, asthma and epilepsy. Like many parent carers, Ms Barker did not see herself as a carer and had no idea of the support available to help her. She struggled to pay bills, yet she had not been told about carer&#146;s allowance. Eventually, she had to move to a different area for financial reasons, and then she suffered depression. Now that she has been identified as a carer, she receives carer&#146;s allowance and has attended a number of courses that have helped her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07042428000156">If they are not identified, carers will struggle without the help or support that they need. My Bill would require that primary care trusts and local health boards ensure that effective procedures exist within primary care to identify carers, and that carers are referred for advice and given regular health checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07042428000157">The Pensions Bill also requires the identification of those carers caring for 20 or more hours per week so that they can earn the carer&#146;s contribution credit. My hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions Reform has made a commitment to use the Government&#146;s review and update of the national carers strategy as an opportunity to explore how that identification can be carried out by health and social care professionals. That is a welcome step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07042428000158">In previous years, hon. Members of all parties have given their support to carers week, which this year runs from 11 to 17 June. Its main objective is to enable new and &#147;hidden&#148; carers to access support and services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07042428000159">Young carers are perhaps the most hidden of all carers. The 2001 census records some 175,000 young carers, but only 30,000 of them are known to young carers support services such as the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and other children&#146;s charities. Indeed, a survey by NCH and Carers UK showed that fewer than one in five of known young carers have received an assessment of any kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07042428000160">The Princess Royal Trust for Carers believes that it is likely that the most vulnerable young carers, including some of the 13,000 who care for more than 50 hours a week, continue their caring role throughout their childhood without any support. Young carers may have parents with substance misuse or alcohol problems, and the extent of that problem is not fully understood. The &#147;Hidden Harm&#148; report estimated that 250,000 to 350,000 children have parents with serious substance misuse problems. The alcohol harm reduction strategy for England states that between 800,000 and 1.3 million children are affected by parental alcohol problems. In the families of alcoholics or problem drug users, children may find themselves responsible for their parents&#146; safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07042428000161">My Bill would place duties on social services authorities to consider what support services are needed to sustain the parenting role in such families. When a parent is assessed for community care services, support services should be offered if it is found that the adult relies for support on the caring role of his or her child. In that way we can ensure that the health, education and well-being of the child or young person are not impaired by caring responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07042428000162">Young carers may have a parent with an illness such as multiple sclerosis, or with a learning or physical disability. The parent may rely on the care from their child, as a case known to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers illustrates. A single parent was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and loss of mobility, which affects not only her but her children, aged 8 and 12, who have to provide her with the round-the-clock support she needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07042428000163">Such children are missing out on their education and, like other young carers, they find themselves misunderstood at school, treated as truants and bullied by other children. Schools need written policies stating the support that they will offer young carers. My Bill would require that both schools and local authority children&#146;s services have policies in place to support such young carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07042428000164">Many health and social care professionals are frustrated by the difficulties they experience due to different thresholds for service provision for different client groups. An adult mental health worker may be aware of several children affected by their parent&#146;s mental health condition. However, unless the children are at risk of serious harm the health professional will probably not be able to help them. The general duties to young carers and their families outlined in my Bill would help. A simple joint working protocol between children&#146;s and adult services, combined with a training programme for staff, would help to solve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07042428000165">Census figures tell us that a minimum of 2 per cent. of all children in the UK are young carers. However, work by Professor Saul Becker of Nottingham university and others suggests that the true number of young carers could be much higher&#151;possibly 1 million of the 3 million children and young people who live in families where there is serious illness or disability. Whichever figure we use, we need now to bring in measures so that schools and local authorities recognise the issues faced by young carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07042428000166">I have outlined how the measures in my Bill would ensure that health professionals identify carers and refer them to much needed help and support. As we move towards the Government&#146;s review of the national strategy for carers, I hope the measures outlined in the Bill will offer a sturdy framework for improved services and support to carers. My Bill is supported by Carers UK, Contact a Family and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. I thank Carers UK and Luke Clements for helping me to draft the Bill and Alex Fox of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers for his input on young carers. I also thank the House for giving me the opportunity to present it today.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07042428000172">The reason why we have called this debate and given up Opposition time to such an important subject is that time and again we have sought answers from the Secretary of State for Health and Ministers about what has happened to the modernising medical careers programme, in particular the recruitment and selection process. With your consent, Mr. Speaker, we put an urgent question that the Secretary of State had to answer, because previously she had provided no good answers. Last Monday, she came to the House to apologise unreservedly&#151;about time&#151;but also to announce a further review and the conclusions of the first review group she had instituted. Serious questions and issues remain, however, and many junior doctors across the country and the consultants responsible for the interviewing process feel they have not been answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07042428000173">Our purpose today is therefore threefold.

I suspect that many Labour Members, on the Back Benches at least, understand the problem. We will see later whether they are willing to come to the House to express to Ministers the sentiments that they have no doubt expressed to their constituents in private.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that whatever the flaws or otherwise of the electronic system, the underlying problem is the surplus of applicants compared with places? Will he commit his party to increasing funding to the health service by the same level as we are committed to doing so that these doctors have a real prospect of a future in the NHS in the years to come?</p>

<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="07042428000175"><a name="70424-0004.htm_spnew8"><a name="07042428000592"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman must know that, in the general election the year before last, we committed ourselves to exactly the same level of funding as applies now. However, we are talking not about the next election, but about what is happening now. We are committed to the same level of funding, but we are also committed to a far more efficient use of that funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07042428000176">The hon. Gentleman could have said, &#147;By the way, the Government spent &#163;72 million on the NHS university&#148;, but that turned out to be completely wasted. What is their response to that waste of money? It was to try to suppress the report by Sir William Wells that was designed to examine where all that money had gone. Let us first be concerned with spending money effectively before we start debating how much money there will be beyond the comprehensive spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07042428000177">The Secretary of State is sometimes at pains to challenge us on whether we agree with the principles behind modernising medical careers. Yes, we agree that modernising medical careers is a necessary process. To put it at its simplest, let us consider whether services in the NHS should be provided in the long run by specialist doctors or by doctors in training. Patients and the public would expect the services to be delivered by specialists and that it would be a consultant-led and increasingly a consultant-delivered service. When one looks across the world, one sees that this country has been unusual in the extent to which services in NHS hospitals, in particular, have been delivered by doctors in training rather by doctors who have their specialist certificates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07042428000178">The principle of modernising medical careers is accepted and we also accept many of the principles in the documents of 2002 and 2004 that led to it. We should not rely on doctors in training for service delivery and training must be limited in time. It cannot be open-ended. As Sir Liam Donaldson said in his report about the &#147;lost tribe&#148; of senior houses officers, we cannot have junior doctors who drift from one SHO job to another for years without ever making progress in specialist training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70424-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07042428000179">Let us remember that one of the principles of MMC was that it was intended to be flexible and widen career choice. Where did that one go in the translation of principles into practice? The way in which MMC has been implemented is lamentable. When people look at the political gravestones of the figures in the Government, they will see carved on them, &#147;It should have worked in principle, but it didn&#146;t work in practice.&#148; The Government started out with good intentions, but time and again they have failed to deliver. Here is another lamentable and shocking example of how they have failed to turn what, five years ago, was a straightforward set of principles into something that works in practice for those in the NHS today.</p>

 My hon. Friend is putting forward an excellent case. Like many hon. Members, I have been meeting young doctors, including some who are now going to go abroad. Those doctors are worried that they will not receive sufficient training under MMC. For example, orthopaedic surgeons received 22,000 hours of training under the old system, but they will receive only 6,000 hours of training under MMC. There might well be a happy medium, but the Government have certainly not got this right.</p>

 I understand exactly the point that my hon. Friend makes. I have had exactly the same conversations. I think that most junior doctors would acknowledge that it would be difficult to sustain the degree of clinical experience that used to obtain and that that would probably not be consistent with the delivery of services by specialists. However, my hon. Friend is right that there is a balance to be struck. Surgical specialties, especially, are, in effect, crafts as well as academic disciplines. While the structure of MMC and its focus on specific competencies address important issues, the programme has significantly failed to reflect accurately the importance of clinical experience and academic achievement, which should be involved in the selection of candidates.</p>

 I, like Ministers, care about what is happening, but perhaps Opposition Members have been more open about some of the problems. Locally, we have discovered that filling out 150 words is worth the same as a PhD, which involves three years or more of hard work. An explanation of that is needed. On the first day the system opened, it was apparently not possible to apply for a job within 50 miles of Worthing or for one in genito-urinary medicine. The problem is not the computer or the method of consulting the people who put the thing together. The problem was caused because the system was not run as a trial in at least one region to determine the experience. Will my hon. Friend commit us to go on working not only for senior and junior doctors, but for those in the MMC system who resigned because of a loss to confidence, by backing the doctors and, if necessary, saying to the Government, &#147;Why don&#146;t you drop your defences and join in working out the problems and solving them?&#148;</p>

However, I remember standing at this Dispatch Box on 20 December 2005 and making it clear to the Secretary of State that there would be a problem in August 2007 because two year cohorts of applicants would be coming together in one year, so the number of applicants for training posts would effectively double. The Secretary of State said that that issue had to be addressed. With a year and a half in hand, I was foolish enough to imagine that she would solve the problem. When, on 13 December 2006, Lord Warner said that junior doctors in England should be pretty confident about securing a training post and that additional training posts would be created, I was foolish enough to think that the Government had considered the situation and arrived at a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70424-0005.htm_para1"><a name="07042428000187">There was a good deal of forewarning. The royal colleges rightly told the Government that the programme should be piloted, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West suggested, but that did not happen. Last year, junior doctors in the British Medical Association wanted a delay of a year. To be fair, I was not sure that that was the right thing to do because it would have harmed the circumstances of the foundation programme graduates. None the less, the BMA was rightly pointing out serious unresolved problems.</p>

 I strongly support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s motion. Does he agree that the key point about MMC is that the number of training posts will not meet the need of the people who want to apply? The principle should be that all those who are qualified for a training post, and who are capable of being trained to consultant level and wish to be trained to that level, should have a training post; otherwise, we are wasting money by putting them through medical school and house jobs. A solution in which those people are parked in career-grade posts, so that they become fellows or hold staff grades or trust grades, is not acceptable, because then the service will be delivered not by consultants, but by a demoralised and often racially segregated group of doctors who are not fully trained and who are not specialists&#151;and that is not the way we want our health service to go.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is leading me further into what I was hoping to say. Let me just respond to that point. From what I know of the interviews that are already taking place, many consultants holding the interviews are meeting well qualified applicants; I see that the Secretary of State is nodding merrily. However, unfortunately, we know that many well qualified applicants did not get interviews. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) suggests, we need a process in which well qualified junior doctors have progressive opportunities to enter specialty training, and that is what our motion says. It also suggests that it may not be possible for all well qualified applicants to secure specialty training or run-through training posts this year, but we have to put a stop to the current structure, which, in effect, limits the ability of some people, particularly senior house officers, to enter specialty training next year, or the year after that, if they do not enter the run-through training process this year.</p>

 Surely specialisms are to be held by the people best qualified to fill the posts, but how can that be reconciled with a situation in which people are confined to applying for posts in certain geographical areas? That means that if there are only two or three posts going in an area, and someone is the third or fourth best qualified person in the area and so does not net the post, they are unable to qualify, or even to apply, for similar posts in other parts of the country, even though they may be much better than the people who are allowed to apply for those posts.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes an important point. He reminds us of the most important reason why we are debating the subject. I have received hundreds of e-mails on the subject, and I have met many constituents, as I am sure that colleagues from across the House have done, who are concerned for their careers, for their livelihoods, for the fulfilment of their vocation to be a doctor and care for patients, and often for their family life. I ask hon. Members from across the House to imagine how they would feel if they were junior doctors, who are highly motivated professionals who have gone through graduate education, and who have, in some cases, worked in the health service for several years. They are senior professionals by any measure, but the net result of the current structure, including the way in which the review group has changed things, is that there is one interview for one unit of application, and that might be for a post anywhere in the east of England, from Hemel Hempstead to Cromer. That is the sum total of their ability to exercise control over the future of their career.</p>

 Dr. Mary Weisters and Dr. Tracy Graves practise general surgery and neurology respectively.

According to the figures, they have a one in 30 chance and a one in 13 chance respectively of securing a job at a time of rising demand for medical services. Does my hon. Friend not agree that it would be a scandal bordering on criminal irresponsibility if they were shunted out of the national health service or, as happens at present, patronisingly encouraged to go abroad&#151;something that they do not have the slightest desire to do?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he further reinforces my point. I have often met married junior doctors who are wrestling with the issue of how they can both secure posts in a way that is consistent with maintaining their family life. That is intensely difficult. My hon. Friend&#146;s point is a fair one; the British Medical Association is today warning that literally thousands of junior doctors could end up going overseas. What is the Government&#146;s response? Well, we saw the document produced in the Department of Health last week. It was not published, but it found its way out. The Government are &#147;volunteering&#148; junior doctors to join the Voluntary Service Overseas, so that they go abroad. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Well, it struck me that VSO is about volunteering&#151;not the distressed reallocation of doctors from the United Kingdom to overseas, which is outrageous.</p>

 Further to the point made by our hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), how do I explain to my constituents at the Horton hospital that we are likely to lose 24/7 consultant-led paediatrics, consultant-led obstetrics and a special care baby unit in the near future, because we have been told that there are insufficient doctors? How is a community like north Oxfordshire to accept on the one hand that there is a substantial downgrading of NHS services in Banbury and the surrounding area in a way that has never taken place before while on they other it can see that junior doctors are being thrown on to the scrapheap?</p>

 There is only one way for my hon. Friend to explain that to his constituents: it is chronic mismanagement of the national health service by the Government. It was the Government&#146;s intention to continue the expansion of consultant posts, but that has been torpedoed by the mismanagement of finances and deficits in the health service so that across the NHS posts have been frozen, consultant posts have disappeared and specialist consultants in some specialties cannot find posts. The consequence is seen not only in the impact on Horton hospital in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, but across the country. The increase in medical school output or in the number of junior doctors coming through would have been consistent in due course with a larger throughput into consultant posts, but the Government&#146;s attitude is that those consultant posts have been lost for financial reasons and they are cutting back on the hospital sector, so they want to maintain a tight bottleneck at the point at which junior doctors enter the further reaches of specialty training. They are stopping the flow, and they are literally forcing large numbers of doctors to leave the country.</p>

It is an arbitrary system. The scoring system, recruitment and application system have been made &#147;objective&#148; in a way that has become virtually arbitrary. Those who are selecting candidates for posts across the country were unable in the initial process to see anything like sufficient of the clinical experience, the academic achievements and the character of the candidates presented to them. It turned into a scoring system in which someone could literally&#151;and I have evidence in my file&#151;pay &#163;129, go on a course, and be told how to answer the questions to be selected for interview. That is utterly outrageous.</p>

acknowledge that figure&#151;we have not even been told how many are run-through training posts and how many are fixed-term posts. The disparity between the figure of 18,500 and anything up to 34,000 posts is principally the result of the combination of two annual cohorts coming together because the new MMC process is shorter than the old training process, the right of European economic area nationals to apply without legal restrictions in this country, and a large number of overseas doctors who, for example, have highly skilled migrant programme visas.</p>

Each candidate arrived armed with a brief one-page summary, hand-written immediately prior to interview and a portfolio the size of one or two telephone directories. Three colleagues and I were supposed to review these in 30 minutes flat, at the same time as we conducted a structured interview, marked each domain individually, and finally came to an agreed score for each domain that will be forwarded to MTAS . . .

 The hon.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that. The Secretary of State will no doubt tell us more in a moment, but she has this afternoon announced the terms of reference for Sir John Tooke&#146;s review: that it will be independent of the four health departments&#151;good; and that it will have an independent secretariat&#151;good. But there are two problems. First, she has not announced the membership, and I entirely endorse what the hon. Gentleman said. It is essential for the confidence of the medical profession that Sir John Tooke&#146;s review is conducted by people who are in no sense, whether positively or negatively, associated with the decisions that have hitherto been made about the MMC and MTAS processes.</p>

There is a good argument that legitimate expectations of junior doctors in the application process have been completely failed, and there are still problems in trying to manage the application process. People cannot obtain interviews and are being logged out and obstructed, and there is scope for gaming for those who have already had interviews. To that extent there is an uneven playing field between those who had first round interviews and those who are in round 1B.

Ninety-seven per cent. of them wanted to see the previous system of appointments restored for this year. I do not necessarily agree with that. However, there is something that we can and must do between now and August. It is not good enough to wait for Sir John Tooke&#146;s review in order to produce a report in September. We must consider foundation programme graduates who should, in all cases, be able to access specialty training.

It has asked hospital trusts and SHAs to respond by 27 April.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. He is also right as regards the financial cost, or otherwise, of converting staff grade posts and trust grade posts to junior doctor training posts. Clearly, some service functions may have to go with the loss of those service posts, but I think that most junior doctors will be prepared to do some supervised service as the price of having a career in training. Does he agree that if the Government plan junior doctor posts, there must be some central planning to get the consultant expansion that is needed to underpin all of this?</p>

of State would agree, turning trust grades to training posts is not without cost. That would have to come from the MPET&#151;multi-profession education and training&#151;budget in strategic health authorities. The Government have admitted that in the last financial year&#151;2006-07&#151;they cut &#163;350 million from education and training budgets. Three or four weeks ago, the chief executive of the NHS said that that was for one year only. We are now at the start of the new financial year. It is clear from the SHA board papers that some SHAs are already planning to cut &#163;136 million out of their training budgets for this financial year. We know where the money could come from for more training posts, because there is money in the training budgets, yet the Secretary of State sits there saying that the Department cannot afford them. It could afford them were it not mortgaging the future of the NHS to deal with its financial mismanagement to date.</p>

Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned, there have already been three written ministerial statements as well as last week&#146;s oral statement.

As on previous occasions, the hon. Gentleman has simply understated the very real problems of the old system that modernising medical careers replaces. That system, as the whole House would acknowledge, has always produced outstanding doctors for the NHS, many of them world leaders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70424-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07042428000241">However, that system was also wasteful, inconsistent, often unfair and, indeed, as the Royal College of Surgeons said several years ago, &#147;most unsatisfactory&#148;. Some junior doctors had to apply for a new training post every six months. They were sending in different applications in different formats to different hospitals and different post-graduate deaneries at different times of the year. There was no proper national curriculum and no standardised assessment process. It has always been the case that, because of the intense competition for medical training posts, junior doctors who could not secure the senior house officer job that they wanted found themselves filling in time in the wrong post&#151;from the point of view of the skills that they wanted to develop&#151;in non-training posts or as a locum. Sometimes, as Conservative Members pointed out, they had to do so for years on end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70424-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07042428000242">Remedy UK, the newly formed group that has been so critical&#151;and understandably so&#151;of this year&#146;s problems says in its briefing paper on MMC that many of those in the old senior house officer job were in short-term or non-training posts or endured poorly planned training with no clearly defined end-points. There were certainly deficiencies in the selection and appointment procedures, along with inadequate supervision, assessment and career advice. It was precisely because of those problems that, following the leadership of the chief medical officer, the Department of Health sat down with the medical royal colleges, with the British Medical Association, with the post-graduate deaneries and others&#151;including, of course, representatives of the junior doctors&#151;to devise modernising medical careers, which almost everybody agrees is the right way forward. Indeed, Professor Douglas&#146;s review group has confirmed that.</p>

It concentrated instead on how to change the process so that it would be fair to junior doctors and meet their needs and the needs of the NHS as a whole. In particular, every eligible applicant was invited to reaffirm or revise the order of their application preferences and was guaranteed at least one interview for their revised first preference specialty. That is now happening and, over the past few days, more than 25,000 applicants have taken the opportunity to revise the order of their preferences and have done so successfully on the much-maligned medical training application system&#151;MTAS.

 Last year, the main focus of the discussions, particularly with the British Medical Association, was on the number of training posts that would be available.

 The junior doctors who have been in contact with me are not now so concerned about the process, which they find rather academic, but they are desperately worried about their jobs.

 First, in response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and other questions, I want to clarify the total number of training places available: about 23,000 postgraduate medical training appointments are available across the UK this year, which is more than ever before. Of those, 3,000 are being filled by recruitment to general practice, and just over 19,000 places are available on MTAS at the moment, with a further 700 to be added to the system. We all know very well that there are more applicants than training posts. That has always been the case, but it does not mean, as headlines and some press reports claimed at the weekend, that there will be 10,000 unemployed doctors.</p>

About 16,000 say that they are working as senior house officers, but because of the deficiencies in the present system, many of those posts are not proper training posts either. Regardless of the outcome of applications for the new training posts, the NHS will continue to need all those jobs and possibly more in the future, because the number of patients is increasing, and so is the number of doctors&#151;the NHS now has over 30,000 more doctors than 10 years ago.</p>

 A couple of years ago, the province of Ontario in Canada abolished grade 13, which led to a double cohort going to university, for which steps had to be taken. My right hon. Friend talks of posts for medical graduates, but the difficulty is that no steps appear to have been taken to plan for the inherent and entirely foreseeable problem of the double cohort of SHOs at one end and recent medical graduates at the other. SHOs who started under the old system are competing with recent medical graduates for an insufficient number of training posts&#151;I stress the word &#147;training&#148; to my right hon. Friend. As I understand it, a lot of those people will be redundant from 1 August. Will she assure me that a sufficient number of training posts will be available for those doctors?</p>

 The number of posts must be based on the needs of patients and the service as well as the needs and wishes of trainees. As I have tried to stress, it has always been the case that some doctors in training have either had to change their specialties or been unable to progress in their training to consultant grade. The new system does not change those realities.</p>

The right hon. Lady shakes her head, and she is entitled to do so, but can she assure me that there will be no such scenario anywhere in the country?

 As I have just said, the great majority of applicants who are already in non-training staff posts, trust posts and a variety of other non-training posts will still have those jobs because they will still be needed in the NHS.

 Further to the point made so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), is the Secretary of State aware that in my constituency Queen Elizabeth hospital has made it clear that because of the changeover date of 1 August, no elective work will be done during the first week of that month? All day surgery will be cancelled for a week, which will mean the cancellation or postponement of probably 100 operations and a consequent increase in waiting lists. Will that happen throughout the country, and why will it happen in my constituency?</p>

 The issue of the changeover date is nothing new. Trusts have to plan for it very year, and that is what they are doing this year. It is not exactly unpredictable or novel. As I have said, it is up to individual trusts to decide how to organise staff in order to meet their patients&#146; needs.</p>

We must recognise that it is necessary to balance fairness to doctors in training with the needs of patients and the NHS. It would be completely wrong to create a specialist training post for everybody who wants to become a consultant in a particular specialty, including for people who have in the past applied for training posts year after year, as some have done, and have not been able to progress in their training, or to create posts regardless of whether the NHS actually needs so many consultants in a particular specialty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70424-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07042428000283">Cardiothoracic surgery is an example of such a specialty. Because technology and medical practice have transformed how cardiothoracic patients are treated, the NHS already has far more fully trained cardiothoracic surgeons than it needs. This year alone we have 300 applications for five speciality cardiothoracic posts. It would not be right for the NHS  <br>

to create another large number of cardiothoracic training posts simply so that there are enough for every applicant who would like to specialise in that field. Equally, however, those applicants who have that field as their first choice and who are disappointed must have the opportunity and support that they need to progress in another specialty. That is an important point, because what we need in terms of training&#151;and I believe that we will get this with modernising medical careers&#151;is a system that not only gives dedicated and excellent junior doctors the chance to progress in their careers, but enables the NHS to have the right number of people with the right skills at a time when medical practice and technology are changing faster than ever before.</p>

 It is instructive that the right hon. Lady chose the small specialty of cardiothoracic work, which has always been oversubscribed, and it would be interesting to find out whether she can give any other such examples. However, may I return her to a question that she has still not addressed, despite having been asked it at least three times this afternoon? There was an entirely predictable consequence of the double cohort. What planning did the Department make to deal with the double cohort issue?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is ignoring that, because of how the old system worked&#151;with junior doctors applying for jobs all over the country, and with different application systems and things happening at different times of the year&#151;there was no national system. Therefore, we had no numbers in respect of the amount of people who had been applying unsuccessfully for training posts. I agree that it is clear, with the benefit of hindsight, that it would have been better if we had predicted that almost everybody in a non-training post would take the opportunity of this year&#151;which is the first year of a system that is much fairer and much more transparent and that has more training posts available than ever before&#151;to make an application. Of course it would have been better if we had predicted that. We failed to do so, and I have apologised for the problems and distress that that has caused. More importantly, however, we are now putting that right.</p>

excellent post, and I am sure that someone will fill it admirably. He also ignores the fact that 23,000 postgraduate medical training places will be available across the whole of the United Kingdom, which is more than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70424-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07042428000288">Let me deal with the issue of doctors going abroad, which the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) just raised. At the weekend, there was some quite disgraceful reporting in some sections of the press. On the one hand, they were busy saying how disgraceful it is that doctors have had to suffer the distress and added uncertainty of this year&#146;s difficulties, while on the other they ran a headline saying that they are all going to be shipped abroad to do voluntary service overseas. That is absolute rubbish. It has always been the case that some British junior doctors have chosen to go abroad at some stage in their training to get extra experience to further that training. Some do voluntary work in, or are on secondment in, the developing world&#151;an issue on which the noble Lord Crisp recently produced an excellent report. However, there is no question of junior doctors being forced into those options or being shipped abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70424-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07042428000289">We all need to focus on the interviews that are taking place and that will continue over the coming month, the first round of job offers that will then be made, and the enormous effort that will go in&#151;thanks to the work not just of the review group, but of consultants and the postgraduate deaneries around the country&#151;to matching, as far as is possible, junior doctors with their first preference application, and to match, wherever possible, medical couples with their combined preferences through the medical training application system, which is an issue that was specifically raised. Of course, there will then be a second round of interviews and job offers. Once all that has been done, we will then ensure proper support, as I indicated a moment ago, for those trainee doctors who have not secured the training post that they wanted.</p>

 I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend for patiently explaining the issues and for being generous in giving way. She talks about focus, and what I am focusing on is the figures that she has given this afternoon, which I have perhaps misunderstood. She mentioned 23,000 training opportunities and 32,000 applicants. I am focusing not on the MTAS system&#151;good or bad as it may be in terms of the computer system and the lack of CVs&#151;but on the fact that apparently and entirely predictably, 9,000 doctors, whom it costs &#163;250,000 a throw to train and who have been in the system for a minimum of six years, will be redundant. That will be a great loss to the taxpayer, to the NHS and to them personally.</p>

 I am afraid that on that point my hon. Friend is absolutely wrong. Well in excess of 9,000 of those 30,000 applicants working in the NHS are working in non-training jobs that the service will continue to need. They are the so-called &#147;trust&#148; jobs&#151;the service jobs&#151;but they also include some of the senior house officer jobs, which are not training posts, despite their name. Those jobs, as well as the 23,000 training places, will continue to be needed and to be filled by junior doctors. That is why the headlines about 10,000 unemployed or redundant doctors are simply wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70424-0008.htm_para0"><a name="07042428000309">How on earth did we reach this point? The origins date back to the chief medical officer&#146;s report in 2002. Its original principles clearly attracted widespread support. Self-evidently, there is a need for a modernised and focused career structure for trainee doctors. More standardised training based on competencies is the right way forward, and it is entirely reasonable to focus both on clinical skills and on the communication skills that I readily acknowledge are important for doctors. There were also legitimate concerns about patronage and bias in the old system. In any modern service those features are unacceptable and need to be challenged. Career advancement should always be based on merit, not on who a person knows or even the colour of their skin. I suspect that that has been a problem in the health service in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70424-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07042428000310">What went wrong? The Royal College of Physicians points to two failures. The first was that modernising medical careers had become a straitjacket. It was too inflexible: it forced early career decisions on young doctors and from that point demanded a training schedule that gave them little opportunity to change direction to a different specialty. It shortened the training period, leaving many doctors concerned that their experience would be reduced as they went through the training process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70424-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07042428000311">The second failure was the introduction of the medical training application service&#151;MTAS&#151;which was set up by the Department of Health to select junior doctors for MMC training posts. The royal college described the system as &#147;deeply flawed, and unpiloted&#148;&#151;it had specifically requested that the system be piloted. Many concerns have been raised about how the unpiloted system has worked. It seems remarkable that so much emphasis appears to be placed on creative writing skills&#151;we have heard about the number of points allocated for that competency&#151;compared with clinical excellence. It seems that doctors who have undertaken research to prepare for a specialism could be disadvantaged. No CVs are considered and there is no proper acknowledgement of academic qualifications. The central question that the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), must answer when he responds is: how on earth did that happen? Is not it incredible that an entirely new, sophisticated web-based system was introduced without proper piloting?</p>

They include the assessment methodologies used in the selection process, including the relative merits of competency-based and more traditional methods of selection and recruitment; the level of choice on offer at application; and the lack of flexibility available to trainees on run-through programmes. They are all issues that would emerge from pilot programmes and the problems would be ironed out before a programme was rolled out nationally. How on earth was the system introduced without proper piloting?</p>

 May I clarify the position for the hon. Gentleman? I wrote last autumn expressing concern about the system and I was assured by the then Health Minister, Lord Warner, that it would be all right on the night. When it became apparent in the spring that it was not all right on the night, I wrote and asked who was being disciplined on account of this failure. After many weeks, I have still not received a reply to that question other than the answer that I received from the Secretary of State in the statement last week, when she said that no one had been disciplined.</p>

However objective a scoring system, once different assessors are introduced on to a panel, objectivity is destroyed.

Will the targets with which acute hospitals must comply be adjusted to take account of the disruption that will inevitably occur, given that if a surgeon is interviewing, he or she is not operating?

Induction procedures will take doctors away from their duties, and I understand that many hospitals will, in effect, operate bank holiday working arrangements during that period, cancelling operations and clinics. Newly appointed doctors will find that their predecessors have already gone, leaving inadequate knowledge of the patients on the wards for whom the new doctors are supposed to be caring.</p>

This may be the only chance I have to put that on the record before a change of Prime Minister. It is an idea that I have held and discussed with Cranfield School of Management, Henley Management college and others. It is relevant to all parties. How we manage major Departments is fundamental to the effectiveness of Government.</p>

How jealous we were of Fleet street, where there was an age-old tradition of a trade being passed from father to son, apprentices being guaranteed work, and jobs for life. The changes that took place in the mid-1980s were bitterly resented by those families and particularly by the young workers, who perceived entry to that trade as a vocation for life. I see some resonance with the Government&#146;s acceptance of the arguments and their guarantees of employment for junior doctors.</p>

 That is precisely the point that I am leading into.

 I will give way in a minute, but it is important that I make this point because it is precisely on the issue of modernising medical careers in areas that have been underfunded, traditionally and historically, and which because of that have had recruitment problems for many years. The shift in allocation is one of the bravest things that the Government have done. The 11.5 per cent. increase in PCT funding last month was the biggest in the north of England&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> This is absolutely on the subject. The subject is how my area can recruit the consultants and the GPs that it needs, and how, in an area such as Cresswell, just outside my constituency in the constituency of my hon.

 The hon. Lady is choosing not to listen to the point that is being made. The question of recruitment is fundamental to the changes that are taking place in modernising medical careers.

Equally, what if a hospital such as mine cannot get the consultants it requires to cover accident and emergency and questions whether it should have A and E, or if an area such as Cresswell does not have enough GPs?

Of no professionals is so much asked, in terms of resilience and commitment, as doctors. When doctors commit to the profession of medicine, an enormous amount is asked of them as regards training, and there is an assumption that at the end of their training period they will eventually have an opportunity to work and that that will be reflected in a fulfilled sense of commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07042428000382">There is a need for change in doctors&#146; training and most people agree that it was appropriate to make a change. However, in their manner of doing that, the Government are at fault not only in the detail but in the larger issues. They have been greatly at fault in three main matters: administration; computer failure leading to mismatches occurring, and the number of jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07042428000383">The Secretary of State provided several facts when trying to explain the position.

Apparently, there are to be 23,000 training posts and 32,000 doctors are seeking them. However, she gave us many other numbers which sought to lead us to believe that there was no problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07042428000384">I am afraid that there is a problem, because the Government have failed to deal with the double cohort&#151;the two different groups of doctors who will enter training in August.

The doctor is 28 years old, has been qualified for six years and has always wanted to specialise in intensive care. She was offered a post in August last year. It was a two-year post in anaesthetics, which would lead her to qualify in anaesthetics or go further and use her anaesthetics qualification to specialise in intensive care. Now the two-year post that she was offered in August 2006 has collapsed, leaving her with the prospect of no medical job after August this year.

I am happy to explain that that is one of the reasons for my participation this afternoon. However, people obviously want to bring the debate to the personal level. In preparation for the last week&#146;s return to Parliament and the Secretary of State&#146;s statement and today&#146;s debate, I met the junior doctors&#146; leader in Stafford, local NHS managers and local providers of health education. Like many hon. Members, I have also met a junior doctor from my constituency who lobbied me about his personal circumstances, and representatives of the campaign that Remedy UK has organised for today. I am pleased to have an opportunity to take part in the debate to support the points that they made to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07042428000389">It is worth starting from the point of view expressed in the original words of the motion. What has been extraordinary about the history of medical training in this country is that it suffered its share of severe underfunding for decades before 1997, which led to a shortage of training places. That led, in turn, to a shortage of qualified doctors, consultants and nurses in the NHS, which created quite a challenge for the new Government, who were committed to improving the situation very quickly. Although the Government could turn on the tap for more money to pay for more doctors, nurses and consultants, there were not enough of them to recruit because the training places had been cut for years before. That is an important point for hon. Members to take into account about the history of how we came to be in the present situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07042428000390">The obvious corollary at the time was that because the money was made available and the posts were there to be filled, we recruited outside the country to fill the vacant posts. That is relevant because while people talk about the double cohort of people coming through to training posts now and the senior house officers also looking for a training post, we also have the added pressure of non-EU citizens in this country whom we recruited who still want jobs in the NHS. There was something of a failed attempt by the Government last year to squeeze them out. That in itself was hurtful to quite a large number of my constituents who came from the Indian subcontinent in order to work in this country because we needed them. All those points should be taken into account when we reflect on the situation today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07042428000391">It is a good thing, is it not, that more people are in training, completing it and coming forward in greater numbers? It is also a good thing that recruitment and retention generally in the NHS has been good over the past few years. I hesitate to say that it is good now, because I am not reading a Labour party brief and want to tell it as it is. Obviously, the Government&#146;s insistence on getting rid of deep-seated deficits, which started last year&#151;an insistence, incidentally, that I support wholeheartedly&#151;has led to a crash in recruitment and retention. That provides a further additional pressure&#151;on top of the three that I have already identified&#151;when it comes to the training  <br>

places available for junior doctors now. It is easy to add them up and see that four pressures have all come to bear this year on the problem of the number of places available for the junior doctors who are seeking them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07042428000392">The review body, comprising all the bodies that the Secretary of State described, and then Ministers took the decision that this year is the year in which modernising medical careers for junior doctors should kick in. It is certainly a difficult year. In the looking back that the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) called for, and in seeking attributions of blame for the current situation, a good question to pursue would be whether there was any opportunity to hold back from making it this year. However, it is fair to say that modernising medical careers is the right thing to do and has gained widespread support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07042428000393">It is remarkable that no one in today&#146;s debate has asked to turn back the clock and go back to the previous system. Every hon. Member has spoken about how MMC could have been introduced more effectively and how it should be improved in future years. In some areas of recruitment&#151;before it was applied to junior doctors&#151;it has been implemented without the sort of reaction that we are talking about today. General practitioners two years ago provide a good example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70424-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07042428000394">When I met the leader of the Stafford junior doctors, she drew my attention to certain issues that I strongly support. First, for example, it is right to standardise training standards for junior doctors seeking specialty posts. It is also probably right in this day and age for there to be an online system. It reminds me of my adult son and daughter who use the internet, rather than pen and paper, as second nature when it comes to compiling a CV for a job application. Those aspects are right and are here to stay.</p>

All those personal circumstances, which I discussed with the leader of Stafford&#146;s junior doctors, were individual tragedies.</p>

individuals who each demand more respect from the system&#151;and the people administering it&#151;than they have been getting over the past few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07042428000399">In fairness to the Secretary of State, she has apologised at least three times for what has gone wrong with the system and for the distress that that has caused to those affected. One review has proposed changes that are about to be introduced, and she has also announced a further, broader review, which has been mentioned today. The shadow Secretary of State made a temperate speech today, with many good points. One of them was about the independence of that review, and the importance of all of us having confidence in its deliberations and conclusions. That is an important point for the House to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07042428000400">Meanwhile, making a success of the first review, with its guarantee that every junior doctor who applies for a post and states their first preference will have at least one interview, is placing a terrific strain on managers and consultants to deal with the extra work that they are being asked to do over the short space of time between now and August. It is fair to say that they are the hidden heroes who are solving this problem right now, and they deserve our thanks. The hon. Member for North Norfolk made that point earlier. A number of consultants wrote a letter to <i> The Times</i> earlier this month to say that they had been placed under a lot of pressure, at a time when they had plenty of other work to do to meet the demands of patients and the NHS. We owe them a debt of gratitude. That letter, incidentally, also called for the scrapping of MTAS and a return to the previous system, so although I said that no one in this debate had asked for that to happen, other people certainly have. We should remind ourselves, however, that the previous system had serious faults too. It did not find a specialty training place for every junior doctor either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07042428000401">If the Minister listens to the shadow Secretary of State, and to my hon. Friends who have said the same thing, he will realise that there is the prospect of a win-win situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) made the point that certain areas are short-served by the NHS at the moment, and we could create a win-win situation by expanding the number of training places available for junior doctors in those areas and in specialties where there are shortages. Perhaps those shortages exist because people do not want to take on those specialties, and it would be wrong to force anyone to do something that they did not want to do, but this could give us an opportunity to ask people to look again at specialties where there are shortages, in which they might be able to do a good job. We could create a win-win situation by filling the posts that we need to fill and finding places for the people who want them. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to that point later.</p>

Friend the Minister tell me more about their prospects in future years? Can they always expect to be treading water and becoming what some people call the second lost tribe, or will they have the prospect of moving on? It is in the context of their fear that they will have nowhere to go that we hear the constant talk of people being forced to emigrate to find a job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07042428000410">I shall return to the effect that all this is having on my constituents.

job, however. The Secretary of State has said that nothing in the new system will change that basic fact. If they do not get a specialty training place, they will still have a job. That is the point of my question to the Minister. What are the prospects for those people who still have a job, even though it is not the training post that they want? That is a reasonable question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07042428000413">I mentioned earlier that a university in Stafford offers health training. Admittedly, it does not train junior doctors, so I will not push my luck too far in talking about issues other than modernising medical careers. I want to make the point, however, that there have been superb improvements in medical training in recent years. There have been some great developments, from foundation degrees to professional doctorates. In terms of continuing professional development, relationships between NHS employers and training providers have been much improved, including the excellent development of mentors for newly qualified doctors and other health professionals. Much better recognised training and qualifications have been developed for those in the support teams for doctors and consultants. For example, last week, at Staffordshire university, I heard about training for operating theatre staff, the pilot for primary care staff, and the current deliberations about whether help can be provided in the training of care home staff. We should celebrate all those excellent developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07042428000414">Everyone I listed at the beginning of my contribution has said that better work force planning is needed. Nobody would disagree with that. We are dealing with one of the biggest work forces in the world, not just in the country, so it is understandable if it presents more difficulty than others. Clearly, good work force planning involves listening and research, engaging those who know what is happening and have expertise to offer, piloting changes before implementing them more widely, on which I agreed with the hon. Member for North Norfolk, and, having carried out pilots, conducting proper evaluation before the final implementation. If there are lessons to be learned from today, I hope that the Minister will accept that those points cover some of them.</p>

We are all dependent on knowing how much we will earn this year, particularly if we have a mortgage to pay. Thousands of junior doctors do not even know whether they will be able to make their mortgage payments, let alone whether they will be able to pay any debts that they may have brought with them out of university or medical school, or whether they will be living in a particular area with their families or working in a particular region.</p>

There has been much speculation about how many doctors will not have jobs, and the figure seems to range between 9,000 and 11,000, so we can safely say that it will be about 10,000. We know that the Department of Health is in discussion with VSO about finding employment for our junior doctors, which is a shameful position for the fifth largest employer in the world to be in.</p>

Will she leave 10,000 doctors without jobs? We need an answer. What will happen to those doctors? If they are unemployed, she will hear a lot more about it.

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07042438000002">This afternoon I met four junior doctors, all of whom have had job offers within a very short period&#151;in Brisbane, Singapore and Toronto. Almost all are at the specialist training stage, and they could be described as emblematic of the problems created by MMC. Often those who have made the most progress in their training are most affected. It is a great shame to see &#163;1 million of investment and training going elsewhere, as I did when I met those doctors today. The hon.

 The hon. Gentleman has rightly raised the allocation of public resources. Many innovative health authorities, including those in my area, are paying GPs salaries rather than giving money to their practices and giving doctors a quasi-self-employed status. Does the hon. Gentleman support the move towards salaried GPs?</p>

 It is certainly worthy of debate, but I want to concentrate on the Secretary of State&#146;s approach and what it means to my constituents who came here today. Apparently they will have jobs in the NHS, but not necessarily in their particular specialties. It is rather like telling a promising young libel lawyer that he or she can have a job as a conveyancing solicitor. What those doctors heard from the Secretary of State today was not about jobs for GPs; she seemed to be saying that they might as well emigrate, and with great immediacy take the training jobs that are being offered to them elsewhere in the English-speaking world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07042438000005">I have seen the Department&#146;s leaked document revealing the desperate measures that will be taken to try to find jobs for doctors somewhere in the NHS. The suggestion that somehow jobs can be found in accordance with the model in the highlands and islands of Scotland shows how desperate the situation has become for the Government. Junior doctors cannot retain much confidence in the system when&#151;as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) pointed out&#151;they see such a demonstration of the arbitrary nature of the selection process. I know of a consultant who had to deal with 650 applications in four hours. The 150 that were not dealt with went straight into round two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70424-0010.htm_para28"><a name="07042438000006">As others have said today, a large number of applicants are not sure whether their applications were even considered.

 Is it not bizarre that that is probably the only recruitment website in the world that does not allow applicants to attach CVs to their applications?</p>

 Notwithstanding the bold statement that the process is fair, it can only mean that people who have invested not only years of training, but before that many years securing the necessary qualifications to begin that training, are being given a most unreasonable deal. I would not be at all surprised if the junior doctors whom I met today said, &#147;This is the last straw&#148; and took up those job offers abroad, which are better than anything that the NHS can provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07042438000010">The new system involves a great deal of uncertainty. Others have spoken of the danger of court action. There are questions to be asked about the quality of the curricula to be provided, and also about the standing of the medical training that our country provides. That standing is important not only to junior doctors but to the United Kingdom as a whole, but the &#147;gold standard&#148; is in danger of being compromised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07042438000011">It is always difficult for politicians to recognise that they have made mistakes, and we are grateful that the Secretary of State has been able to apologise. However, as the hon. Member for Bassetlaw observed, it takes leadership to be able to recognise that it is time to cut one&#146;s losses. If junior doctors are to be given the confidence that will enable them to stay in this country, they must be offered the prospect of jobs in the NHS through the provision of training jobs in the first place. If we are not to lose a quarter of a million pounds&#146; worth of training for all the junior doctors who will depart these shores within the next few months, we must accept what the Opposition motion says. Jobs&#151;training jobs&#151;must be given to people who have invested so much of their time to become junior doctors and serve the people of this country.</p>

 The disaster that threatens to derail MMC is the medical training application service, so I shall concentrate on that.</p>

The briefing from NHS Employers glosses over all the difficulties. The date of 1 August has always been a nightmare, because junior HOs have always changed over on that date. The fact that SHOs and registrars did not do so in the past has made it slightly easier, but I fear that there will now be a disaster. NHS Employers says:</p>
<a name="70424-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07042438000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Employers are working with their consultants and junior doctors now to ensure that services for patients are not adversely affected by the change in timing.

exactly 40 letters: one expressing support, one expressing qualified support and the remaining 38 expressing tremendous worry. These are not whingeing letters from consultants. In contrast to the opinion of many Members, consultants work very hard for their patients, and the relationship between a consultant and his junior staff was&#151;I hope that it still is in some ways&#151;that of a father and their family. I remember consultants whom I worked for who were father figures, and I hope that I, too, was such a figure to my juniors. Therefore, I take seriously the comments of consultants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07042438000023">Other problems include the stupidities in the scoring system&#151;such as applicants getting two points for having a PhD and four points for their 150-word description of their personal qualities. There are also problems to do with the time involved for consultants drawing up the shortlists, let alone interviewing, and the fact that the interviewers do not know whether applicants have put their institution as their first  <br>

The knock-on effect on spouses and families has been referred to; such families will now face uncertainty, and there might be splits between partners and between parents. The short time that is available to relocate is also a problem, as are the costs to the NHS of relocating.</p>

 I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate because, like other Members, I have received many letters from constituents, many of whom are directly involved in the process or who have brothers or sisters or more distant relatives who are directly involved in it.

The situation is depressing. Getting the Government to take action has been like pulling teeth&#151;to use a medical simile. Over a period of several months, the Minister and the Secretary of State have had to come back to the House to continue to explain what is happening in respect of this unfolding disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07042438000039">One clear way that we can tackle this matter and give some genuine confidence to the junior doctors who are listening to the debate, and to those who will read about it tomorrow in <i> Hansard</i>, is to vote for the motion before the House. That will give them the confidence that the necessary training posts will be in place over the next few years to help us work through this crisis in a measured way, which is what we need to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para28"><a name="07042438000040">I want to ask the Secretary of State about the Tooke review. It is obviously easier&#151;and, given the judgment calls already made by the Department, more appropriate&#151;to get out of this mess by subcontracting it out to Sir John Tooke. However, in her opening speech the Secretary of State said that Sir John might make recommendations to the House earlier than August if he considers it appropriate to do so. Why is that not her decision? Surely it is appropriate for junior doctors to know much sooner what is going to be done about this problem, rather than having to wait until the end of the summer. By that time, many will have already taken alternative decisions about their careers. People cannot just put their lives on hold until this Government manage to talk their way out of this shambles.</p>

Secretary of State&#146;s, or those of the many junior doctors who will not get a second bite of the cherry, once they have lived through this shambles?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para30"><a name="07042438000042">This is not good enough, and it certainly is not the best year ever for the NHS and the doctors whom we have been discussing today. The NHS has been fundamentally financially mismanaged in the past decade. As an accountant, I was astonished to see financial boom in the NHS followed by bust. Such boom and bust is largely responsible for the destabilisation of recruitment in the NHS&#151;an issue far broader than the catastrophe that MTAS has created. How many more shambles have to occur before the Secretary of State takes genuine responsibility, instead of continually subcontracting Government policy out to other people and putting off taking decisions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para31"><a name="07042438000043">The situation is urgent for those involved; they have not got until August to wait for answers. If the motion before the House is accepted, that would at least provide them with some certainty about their roles and what will happen in the coming years. It would give us the chance to take a thorough look at what has gone wrong, and to consider in detail what needs to be done. As I have said before, as someone who has been in business I know that when many different issues unravel over time one needs to take a step back and to look at the fundamentals of what is going wrong. However, our junior doctors cannot wait for an holistic review process. We need to give them some certainty by voting for the motion before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para32"><a name="07042438000044">Having read this debate in tomorrow&#146;s <i> Hansard</i>, not many people will have much confidence in this Government and their ability to deliver and work their way through these dramatic problems. It is not just doctors who are concerned about the recruitment process. I have no doubt that many nurses throughout the country who are finishing their training courses will be shuddering at the prospect of the process that they will have to go through to find a job over the summer months. It is not good enough to be told that we are having a review, and that there will be no answers before August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70424-0011.htm_para33"><a name="07042438000045">The Secretary of State referred in her opening speech to creating some additional training posts. It is incumbent on her to give the House a sense tonight of the number of such posts. What is the approximate number? What is too low, and what is unrealistically high? That is what we and junior doctors need to know. I doubt whether many of us have much confidence in the management team at the very top of the Department of Health. Frankly, the sooner that that team is changed and we have people who can run professionally an organisation that so many of us depend on&#151;whether we work in it or are treated by it&#151;the better.</p>

Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) gave a series of worrying accounts in a similar vein from other consultants throughout the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) gave further evidence from junior doctors who had written to her with personal stories of how this catastrophe has affected them in a direct way. In her excellent contribution, she was right to ask&#151;as a number of other Members did&#151;that the second, Tooke, review be truly independent. That means that when Sir John Tooke chooses his team, its membership should not include those previously involved in this process, because they would inevitably bring to the debate preconceived ideas. It is important that this issue be approached with fresh eyes.</p>

Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) suggested that Ministers should avail themselves of the services of the Cranleigh or Henley school of management. Of course, those schools teach leadership, which is what is needed now. Next, my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) underscored the seriousness of the crisis. He asked that Ministers give the House regular situation reports as the reviews go on. That is important, given the enormity of the problems facing the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07042434000056">Much of MMC and MTAS has been designed to remove the influence of the old boy network&#151;I suppose that one can call it that&#151;that Ministers believe has been responsible for the appointment of junior doctors in the past. NHS Employers is a metastasis of the Government&#146;s cheerleader, the NHS Confederation. In its briefing note, it identifies the twin crimes of &#147;patronage&#148; and &#147;bias&#148; in the appointment of junior doctors. In its zeal for reform, it does not pause to consider at what terrible cost those sins have been purged. Many will believe that the Health Secretary&#146;s surgery has been somewhat worse than the disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07042434000057">Apart from the drearily predictable NHS Confederation, there have been remarkably few apologists for the mess over which the Health Secretary has presided. Let us set aside for a moment the administration of MTAS, which has caused so much heartache, and focus on modernising medical careers. We can applaud the intention to move forward to a more focused, competency-based training that reflects what has been happening in other trades and professions, and in other countries. We hope that training will be more flexible and, as women make up half the medical work force, that it will facilitate a better work-life balance. It is surely right that doctors are better able to communicate with patients and colleagues, and that communication is a key element in any training or assessment process. Modernising medical careers recognises that, but we have grown an inflexible monster that forces early job choices on young doctors that will be difficult to move out of and into. Practical experience will be curtailed and all of a sudden that &#147;second to none&#148; training about which the Health Secretary boasted in her speech last week is beginning to look far less robust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07042434000058">MTAS is truly remarkable. In place of a CV and hard data encapsulating hard-won academic qualifications and clinical experience, applicants are invited to furnish a load of soft mush. Other hon. Members have mentioned scoring, and the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) referred to that. The essential concern is that the influence of PhDs, for example, has, as we discussed earlier, been eclipsed by offerings in essay form that are made up at short notice and in a way that, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) noted, is capable of being imparted in a course that costs very little.</p>

I understand from a written answer sent to me on 13 March that MTAS will cost &#163;6.3 million over five years. Can the Minister who will wind up the debate confirm that that does not include the cost of the paraphernalia of failure&#151;review  <br>

 The Health Secretary is nodding. In contrast, however, NHS Employers has at least some grip on reality. We learn from its leaked report of how it is desperately scratching around for jobs abroad to offer doctors that it recognises will be unemployed on 1 August. The NHS Employers briefing paper talks optimistically of service posts that have been converted by employers into training posts. How many of those have there been after Lord Warner&#146;s announcement of 13 December, and how many more does the Minister anticipate? Other hon.

Given that many of the available training billets in the UK will be going to European economic area doctors, it seems reasonable to ask where the reciprocity is. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) spoke about banning European doctors, and that point may be germane here. Certainly, we recognise that the treaty obligations into which we entered&#151;rightly or wrongly&#151;forbid us from banning European doctors. That is simply not possible, but NHS Employers might consider Europe as it trawls around the world. Many Labour Members have been greatly exercised in the past by unpaid researchers attached to MPs&#146; staffs.

 The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) is right to say that this has been a good debate, and I shall do my best in the time available to answer some of the points that have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07042434000072">This matter is of fundamental importance to the country. We must ensure that patients get the best possible care from highly trained and motivated staff, but we recognise that there has been a significant impact on the lives and careers of those dedicated and hard-working staff who are applying to progress their training as doctors in the NHS. Young people and their families will be watching today&#146;s proceedings closely, and we know that they will have gone through considerable anxiety. I know from the emails that I have received&#151;and I am sure that other hon. Members of all parties have received similar messages&#151;that there has been considerable anxiety about this matter.

One of the interesting things about today&#146;s debate was the degree of agreement on both sides of the House, expressed by almost every Member who spoke, about the principles behind MMC. The programme has the potential to benefit both doctors and patients in the NHS and it is important to note that its foundation stages have been successfully introduced. We believe that we can build on that success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07042434000074">The difference between us and some Opposition Members is that they suggest that all the measures were hatched in secrecy in the Department of Health and that we did not involve anybody else in drawing up plans for this stage of the implementation of the MMC programme. That is not the case. We have worked closely with the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges, the BMA, NHS Employers and others over a long period. However, we are not washing our hands of the issues. We have tried to face up to them, but the important thing is to take action now to help people and to put in train a wider review of the system so that when this year&#146;s process is over, we can ensure that lessons are learned and that, in time, we can bring in a strengthened system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07042434000075">The suggestion crept into many of the comments today that there were no unfairnesses or problems in the old way of doing things. That simply is not the case. If we accept the principles of MMC, we must also accept that there were myriad unfairnesses in the old system. The difference is that those unfairnesses were not out in the open, in the transparent way that they are now&#151;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ] </i>It is because they are transparent that we can work through the issues that have been identified and create a fairer training system for doctors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07042434000076">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) made a speech that was good in many ways. He, too, endorsed the principles of the programme and observed that patronage and bias had been problems in the past. Despite the laughter from the Conservative Benches, the hon. Gentleman was right to identify those problems. He suggested that the system was too inflexible&#151;a point raised by the shadow Secretary of State in his opening remarks. I draw the attention of both Members to one of the points in Sir John Tooke&#146;s terms of reference:</p>
<a name="70424-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="07042434000630"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the lack of flexibility available to trainees on run-through programmes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07042434000077">Sir John will examine that specific point in his review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07042434000078">The hon. Member for North Norfolk spoke about the lack of a pilot for the scheme. In fact, the electronic portal for foundation recruitment was piloted in 2006. The application form was based on an existing form used in the London area, and the current form was piloted pre-launch in at least two deaneries. At the end of the day, we can review the programme and consider whether there was enough piloting and I shall take on board the conclusions of the review. However, it is not the case that the scheme was rushed through with no attempt to consult or to pilot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07042434000079">The hon. Gentleman asked how many extra interviews would be required. Originally, 26,000 non-GP interviews were scheduled. The number of extra interviews required following the Douglas review will depend on how many junior doctors change their first preference. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that process has been going on over recent days so it is obviously too early to give him the figures. However, we estimate that guaranteeing one interview for each eligible applicant will require between 13,500 and 23,900 interviews. The number will depend on how many doctors change their preference. We shall of course need to balance the requirements of the  <br>

service&#151;another point made by the hon. Gentleman. We believe that the provision of extra interviews in round 1 is likely to reduce the number required in round 2, but we shall work through that issue as we go further down the line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07042434000080">We shall not know how much additional cost will be incurred until the end of the process. However, the proposals have been agreed with the deaneries and NHS Employers. We believe that is the right action to take, because it will bring back a degree of fairness and meet the complaints we faced&#151;that the system was unfair and people were being denied opportunities. Like the hon. Member for Westbury, the hon. Member for North Norfolk asked about the provision of care to patients during the period of the review. We shall not relax any service standards or targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07042434000081">The hon. Member for North Norfolk asked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about the 700 posts that are to be added. Originally, a small number of one-year posts was held over for round 2. After the review group&#146;s recommendation, those posts were loaded on to the system for the extended round 1, so the 700 posts will soon be available on the system. I hope that that answers his question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07042434000082">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) made an interesting point, which again goes back to the principles of the MMC programme. He asked about the needs of communities such as his, where traditionally there have been problems in the recruitment of both hospital-based staff and GPs. My area is in a similar position. My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) pointed out that in his area, too, there were real difficulties in recruiting more GPs. MMC is being introduced to ensure that we can address those recruitment problems, especially for shortages such as that of GPs in the north of England. In principle, the scheme enables people to move from over-subscribed to under-subscribed specialties and we believe that the review group&#146;s proposals for early announcement of recruitment for GP training will encourage applications in that field, which has traditionally been under-subscribed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para28"><a name="07042434000083">The hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) asked about double cohorts and why we could not guarantee everybody a place. May I give him a snapshot of the situation? At present, about 3,000 senior house officers are training in surgical specialties, feeding into about 500 specialist training opportunities for surgery. It is the case, as it always has been, that not everybody can be a consultant surgeon. The difference is that under the old system people hung around trying to progress their careers, but could not obtain opportunities to do so.</p>

 I was coming to that point, but first I wanted to do justice to the excellent and thoughtful speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), as well as to other points that were raised. The shadow Secretary of State makes an important point&#151;that we must do what we can to ensure that help and support is available for doctors displaced this year. Of course, they will be able to apply in future rounds in future years, even if they are applying from a non-training or staff grade post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07042434000089">There is much more we can do this year. We are working with the service to maximise the number of job opportunities available in and leading up to the end of the 2007 recruitment round. We will invite any displaced doctors to register on NHS Jobs and NHS Professionals so that they can quickly and efficiently be matched to the vacancies that will continue to emerge, to training posts and to locum appointments, as was always the case. Posts will become available in any normal year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07042434000090">We will work with the postgraduate deaneries to maximise the number of training opportunities available within the overall number of job opportunities. In particular, we will undertake urgent work with the medical royal colleges and the service to establish the need for additional training posts. We will ensure that doctors who take up jobs in service grade posts continue to have support to ensure that the training and development opportunities in those posts are maximised. Those unsuccessful this year will be able to reapply next year. They will also be able to apply for posts that emerge, as they always have, through the course of the year. I am glad that the shadow Secretary of State raised that issue because I am pleased to put that point on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70424-0012.htm_para32"><a name="07042434000091">I fear that I cannot do justice to all the sensible points that were made in the debate in the time that I have left. I conclude by saying that we recognise the anxiety that this year&#146;s round has caused. We have not sought to dismiss it; we have sought to engage with it and come up with solutions to give people real answers to the difficulties in which they find themselves. Implementing quickly the recommendations of the review group will further help the position that people find themselves in and, crucially, will give support to people who have been displaced by the process and will help to enable them to progress their careers as they had hoped to do.</p>

 I note that the motion condemns changes to rubbish collections. However, no doubt the hon. Lady is aware that 61 Conservative-controlled councils have introduced fortnightly rubbish collections, presumably as a worthy attempt to increase recycling. Is she condemning them?</p>

 I will come to that subject. However, I should share with the hon. Lady the fact that, unfortunately, we need to be careful about the information that the Government publish on that subject. A parliamentary answer that I received listing the councils that had moved to fortnightly collections cited a number of councils that have not done that, including King&#146;s Lynn and West Norfolk borough council and Ashford borough council, which have no plans to do so. She might like to talk to Government Departments about the accuracy of the information that they provide.</p>

Likewise, we have long supported giving communities the final say on the type of leadership structure that they have. It makes perfect sense to give local authorities greater involvement in health and well-being&#151;indeed, some councils such as Kent county council already have that greater involvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70424-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07042445000011">The main focus of Sir Michael&#146;s work was the thorny issue of local government finance. One of the first things he did was dismiss local income tax as a viable alternative. For me, the most telling line in the report is the one in which he said that a local income tax</p>
<a name="70424-0013.htm_brev3"><a name="07042445000031"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;might mean substantial increases in tax for the working population.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70424-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07042445000012">He also set out why a local income tax would not necessarily be a fairer tax: it is because income is not always the sole determinant of wealth. Those are failings that Members of all parties have acknowledged, including the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70424-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07042445000013">It is a symptom of how controversial local government finance has become that the Government tried so hard for so long to bury the report. The review took nearly three years, had a wage bill of more than &#163;300,000 and was subject to numerous changes in remit, but the final indignity was that the Chancellor tried to bury its publication on the day of the Budget. He wanted to bury the report because he knew that it would confirm people&#146;s worst fears about the tax-raising appetite of the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70424-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07042445000014">Surely Ministers know that there is real, palpable fury out there about the level of the council tax. No matter what Ministers say publicly, they know that responsibility for a 92 per cent. rise lies firmly at the door of the Treasury. People who paid just &#163;57 each month on a band D property in 1997 are now paying &#163;110. Taxation in any form is never popular, but if council tax was a mild irritation in 1997, it has become a gaping sore today.</p>

 One of the local authorities controlled by the hon. Lady&#146;s party is Dudley metropolitan borough council, which serves part of the area that I represent. Dudley council has received record resources under the Labour Government and this year its settlement is above the average for metropolitan authorities, yet it is still increasing the council tax by 5 per cent. while cutting services. It is closing swimming baths and cutting services for the elderly; it is even cutting school transport for special needs schoolchildren. Is that what the Conservatives mean when they talk about the proceeds of growth? Will she condemn the record of Dudley council, which is receiving record resources and cutting services?</p>

Ironically, council tax is the most visible of all tax bills. It is not deducted automatically at the point of income or added automatically at the point of sale. It is worth noting that if council tax rises were commuted into income tax, it would be equivalent to a 4p rise.</p>

The only solution that the Government offer those who cannot pay is an application form for so-called benefits. The application form is 40 pages of intrusive questions that actively deter a proud generation of pensioners who find the term &#147;benefits&#148; an indignity.

What a way to treat pensioners. Not only is the Chancellor complicit in the collapse of people&#146;s pensions, but a third of the increase in the state pension is now clawed back by the Treasury through increased council tax, yet instead of finding ways of reducing the tax burden, the Government are considering recovering council tax after people have died. A typical pensioner drawn into that macabre &#147;pay later&#148; scheme could leave a debt of as much as &#163;64,000 after 20 years.</p>

That brings me on to the proposals that the Government have not ruled out, including the call for additional tax bands at the upper end and for changes to the ratio between the bands. In particular, appendix C models changes from the present 3:1 ratio to 5:1 and even 10:1. To put that in layman&#146;s terms, on a band D property, the bill would go up by as much as &#163;119. That is the tip of the iceberg. Rebanding cannot take place without revaluation, and revaluation will mean that bills go up. That is exactly what happened in Wales. Despite assurances from Ministers that the revaluation would be revenue neutral, four times as many homes moved up a band as went down, and the average bill went up by 10 per cent. in the first year.</p>

 My hon. Friend has a longer political history than I do, so he will well remember the original reasons why the Conservative Government took the business rate to the centre. Businesses were exposed to increases in rates which made it virtually impossible for them to carry on their businesses. The relationship of trust was damaged by profligate, often Labour, councils. For that reason, a decision was taken to introduce a uniform business rate. The relationship of trust between local government, central Government and the business community still needs to be rebuilt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70424-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07042441000032">That subject was addressed in the Lyons review, but the Government have already made it clear that at present they have no intention of repatriating the business rate to local government. That was their response to their own review. Rebuilding that relationship of trust between local government and business is of the utmost importance, because the business community is one group in our society that faces the dilemma of having taxation levied at the centre without one-for-one representation.</p>

Would not one way of restoring trust be to strip that away so that the money can be returned to taxpayers or put into services?

That is why we have proposed the Sustainable Communities Bill, a Bill which the Government rather complacently see as unnecessary. Giving local communities the right to decide the spending priorities for their area is necessary. It is also necessary to give planning decisions back to town halls, rather than regional quangos and Whitehall Departments. Crucially, it is necessary to get council tax back down to sustainable levels. When it was first introduced, people were not protesting on the streets and pensioners were not going to prison.</p>

But he did not take the opportunity to mention the under-investment, the neglect, or the sheer arrogance that characterised the Tory years. He certainly did not mention the devastating impact on all our communities. The Opposition may not care to remember, but millions of people throughout the country do. They remember the years of diktat and demoralisation. They remember the funding cuts. Even in their last four years, the Tory Government slashed funding by 7 per cent. in real terms. Millions of people remember schools with leaking roofs and outside toilets. They remember the contempt for local democracy. They remember Nicholas Ridley&#146;s maxim on councils: &#147;The more they squeal, the more I know I&#146;m right.&#148; They remember Tory Ministers&#146; disdain for the local government work force. They remember the thousands of committed workers who had to fight for their pensions and holidays as a result of compulsory competitive tendering. We all remember the low point of the poll tax, with councils and Government locked in bitter opposition and people rioting on the streets. That is the history.

We are introducing the community call for action. Where people have concerns about a local issue, the call for action will help them to get a response from their council. It could be graffiti; it could be youth facilities: whatever the issue, local people will have a new way of getting things done. We are freeing local government to get on with the job by slashing red tape. We are strengthening local area agreements, which set out what councils and key partners will deliver for local people, and how. I believe that in the future they will be one of the great success stories of local government. We are trusting councils to understand the needs of local people, and giving them greater freedom to meet them.</p>

It has not only increased its council tax by the largest amount in Greater Manchester&#151;4.9 per cent.&#151;but is making its citizens pay the council tax every month on days earlier than they are used to paying it, and has wasted money on the new council logo and &#163;400,000 on consultants at the same time as closing two day-care centres and an elderly people&#146;s home.</p>

What discussion has he had with the Inland Revenue and what does he believe the compliance cost of a local income tax would be? What confidence does he have in the Inland Revenue in respect of the redistributive element in the light of the mess that it made of the working families tax credit?</p>

 I am not sure whether the hon.

The nature of the questions strongly suggests to me that he has not taken the opportunity of reading what Sir Michael Lyons said about local income tax: it is a thoroughly practical tax with many advantages, but will take some time to introduce. It is rather like the reform of the council tax that the Labour Government are talking about and very different from the fossilised, &#147;stay as you are&#148; solution that the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman seems about to move on to forms of local government, but I have not quite finished with council tax. I am not sure what gimmick the Liberal Democrats will propose from year to year. They have a policy one year, and if it does not work they change it. I remember that one year in Newcastle-under-Lyme the Liberal Democrats promised everyone &#163;100 back from their council tax bills. The cheque was inconveniently dated 1 April. How can anyone believe what the Liberal Democrats say from one election to another when they flip-flop as it suits them between Tory and Labour?</p>

 That has obviously come from the Labour party briefing and is, of course, completely mistaken. We have supported local income tax to my certain knowledge for 22 years and the policy may go back even further than that. What we definitely need for our local democratic institutions to function properly is a secure source of locally determined income. The flaw in the existing council tax and, to an even greater extent, in the fossilisation of it proposed by the Conservatives is that such a secure source would be restricted. Indeed, they would mean a cutting back of the opportunities for local democracy to flourish. I believe that I promised the hon. Member for Ludlow that I would give way to him.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seeks to characterise the past 10 years of Conservative action over council tax, so I draw to his attention the fact that residents in South Shropshire, which has been Liberal Democrat-administered for the past four years and partially so for the whole of that period, have had to suffer the second largest increase in council tax in the country&#151;beaten only, I believe, by Kingston upon Thames, which is another Liberal Democrat-controlled council. The reason why the hon. Gentleman wishes to deflect attention from council tax to local income tax is that Liberal Democrats cannot manage council tax efficiently for their residents.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman looked at the record of Liverpool city council or, indeed, that of my colleagues in Islington in north London, he would see a very different picture. He should take a look at the percentage increases as compared with cash increases. I would not mind betting that the council tax in South Shropshire is currently lower than it is in some of the flagship authorities that the hon. Gentleman is so proud of.</p>

 The original legislation that brought in the council tax made provision for revaluations, but under certain circumstances where there was a disparity between regional house prices and the ratios prescribed between the different regions of the country. The fact remains that the ratio between the regions is the same today as it was when council tax was introduced, so there is no need at present for a revaluation.</p>

She did not mention explicitly charges for council services, though she did mention rubbish collections. What she did mention was the pressure on social care for local authorities. Of course, she is right about that, but what she did not say was that it was her Government who introduced charging for social care at local level in the first place. That charging is creating some of the difficulties that have already been illustrated in the debate.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am more than happy to explore the intricacies of housing policy and national allocations, but I suspect that we are probably straying from the broad themes of the debate. It is certainly the Liberal Democrat view that decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level, and that relates to planning decisions just as much as to financial and service decisions on health care, highways and public transport.

The motion has offered us nine lines of nothing to debate, and it is hard to believe that their conversion, as announced from their Front Bench, is genuine. I looked for a local government policy in the Conservative party&#146;s previous manifesto, which I understand was drawn up under the supervision of their current leader, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). I found a policy with a hard figure on it: a &#163;500 council tax rebate for pensioners over the age of 65. No doubt that seemed an attractive vote-winner somewhat analogous to the &#163;100 that has been mentioned. What it is, however, is another step in centralising local government finance and reducing the independence of local government, which is exactly the opposite direction to that mentioned by the hon.

 Whenever the future of local government is debated, it inevitably becomes a discussion about the need for greater localism. Few Members would dispute that when localism means greater local management and devolving more power to front-line management, it is highly desirable. Local accountability and control, however, raise more difficult questions. I will discuss that in relation to my constituency in Swindon.</p>

National Government remain accountable to national taxpayers for the money that they spend, and therefore need to retain some measure of control over how effectively it is spent. It is important that local authorities are not required to raise all the funds that they need locally, because the uneven distribution of resources across the country would inevitably result in an inequitable meeting of needs. Moreover, in my experience in Swindon, the Government&#146;s ring-fencing of funding to ensure that the greatest needs are met first, whatever the competence or bias of the local authority, has protected some of the most vulnerable people.</p>

The current relationship needs to change. It is not that I think transferring power from one bunch of politicians to another bunch of politicians will necessarily improve the position. The key at all levels of power is accountability, and at both local and national level politicians clearly need to become more accountable. My primary concern is that the relationship is opaque and does not encourage leadership at local level. The experience of Swindon exemplifies that. A recognition of the role of partnership and of the part played by other partners is a crucial requirement for all leadership, but Swindon borough council is currently failing in that regard.</p>

I pay tribute to the officers&#151;now ably led by a new chief executive&#151;for all the work that they have done, but the crucial turning point was intervention by the Government. The Department for Education and Skills drove through a new structure for education, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, as it then was, worked tirelessly to teach Swindon borough council how to transform the delivery of services.

&#163;1 million for building capacity. National Government have enabled the borough council to take part in a local area agreement that is innovative and will make a huge difference to the people whom I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07042457000058">Of course, councillors from all parties deserve credit for their willingness to embrace the agenda for change, and I pay tribute to the current Conservative leader for his determination to improve the town. The fact remains, however, that the improvements would not have been possible without all that funding and support from the Government, and&#151;crucially&#151;we have never heard a word of acknowledgement or thanks from any Conservative councillor. Reading Conservative councillors&#146; election literature, one would think that they had personally raised the money to build all the new schools for which they are now claiming credit, not to mention the libraries and other community services on the basis of which they are trying to persuade people to vote for them. That is no way to provide decisive and visionary leadership. Any consistently visionary and successful local leadership must be based on coherent and consistent policy positions, which is not the case in Swindon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07042457000059">Swindon is a growth area, and it is expected that 35,000 new houses will be built there. Privately, Swindon borough council wants that to happen, subject to the provision of proper infrastructure; publicly, it says that it is a threat being imposed on them. To say one thing privately and another publicly&#151;to say one thing in Swindon and a different thing in London&#151;does not provide leadership for the people of Swindon; nor does it provide any basis for the relationship between all the strategic partners who need to work together to secure Swindon&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07042457000060">All partnerships depend on trust. Trust and partnership cannot exist together when one partner persists in saying contradictory things to different audiences depending on a narrow and sectarian view of what they think will maximise their vote. We must have greater clarity about mutual responsibilities. If there is greater clarity about the relationship between local and central Government, that will stop this kind of dodging and diving and encourage local authorities to show more leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07042457000061">I shall now heed your strictures, Madam Deputy Speaker, by concluding. I hope that in his reply my hon. Friend the Minister will take note of the need to provide greater transparency, so that all the partners in delivering services to people who depend on them will acknowledge their role in a mutually supportive partnership.</p>

 I shall be succinct. I wish to make only two points, which I am delighted that the Minister is present to hear as they are aimed predominantly at him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07042457000063">First, I recommend that the Minister changes the system of listening to local government following the distribution process. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) and I regularly did that, and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) mentioned it. Some councils have good causes and it is possible to change things to help them. In respect of others, revealing information can be  <br>

discovered, especially if one does a bit of work beforehand. I found a few Labour councils to be difficult in terms of some of the positions that they took, and I found that some Liberal Democrats positions were extraordinary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07042457000064">I cannot remember if it was the Liberal Democrats group that came with the Minister for Hazel Grove, or rather the hon. Member for Hazel Grove&#151;that might have been a Freudian slip, although I hope that we never have a Minister from the Liberal party. The Liberal Democrats council members came after having worked all night&#151;or so I was told&#151;on a project, and they were determined to put their case, which they did. We listened carefully to them. Their case was demonstrated with graphs, until it was pointed out by me and one or two of the officials that if the axis of the graphs were changed slightly exactly the reverse argument to that they were making applied. That is an entertainment that I suggest the Minister tries. He will find that the position of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove is often pretty fraudulent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o369"><a name="07042457000065"><a name="70424-0017.htm_spnew19"><a name="07042457000228"><b>Andrew Stunell:</b>
 I am happy to report that that group was an all-party deputation from the authority.</p>

 What a shame&#151;I could have gone on a little further, but I do not have the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07042457000067">My second point is that the Secretary of State and Ministers have in the past gone on at some length about the fact that they were removing some of the ties and burdens on local government. That was a little fraudulent because the burdens referred to had been imposed on local government by this Government. It is a bit like someone having an arm handcuffed to a wall for a number of years and then the people responsible saying, &#147;We are now going to release you&#148;, and then asking him whether he feels better&#151;when at the same time another Department has nailed his other arm to the wall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07042457000068">Some of the effects can be followed. The best value system was introduced&#151;that title is a misnomer if ever there was one&#151;as was the comparative performance assessment, which brought with it myriads of targets and books of prescriptive guidance, and other Departments joined in. The best example I can give involves Mole Valley district council. It is a tiny council with a budget of &#163;10 million. The last comparative performance assessment cost it &#163;250,000, plus weeks of getting ready and dealings with auditors and so forth. The Audit Commission has been mentioned&#151;I understand that it is five times greater than when we left power and Labour came to office&#151;and it is merely hounding local government. When that &#163;250,000 was geared&#151;it is geared, as it moves on to council tax&#151;it added &#163;1 million to local tax for that little council with a budget of &#163;10 million. That is outrageous. The Secretary of State has said, &#147;Well, we are taking it away&#148;, but other things have been added, not only by his Department but by other Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07042457000069">The Secretary of State spoke with some glee about the local area agreement. It has been hyped as a new way of streamlining funding and reporting. I invited the Minister to come with me to a certain well-known Conservative council that he likes very much and that endears him to local government, and to listen to it independently on what this means to it. It means excess  <br>

bureaucracy and time-consuming work. There are hundreds of pages of prescriptive guidance on process, on format&#151;on all the agreements. It means minute scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07042457000070">I rang the council and spoke to the chief executive and some of his senior staff to ask whether the situation got better after my attempts to get the Minister to take notice and to reduce bureaucracy. The chief executive said, &#147;No, it&#146;s worse. There are more mandatory indicators, all of which are based on national priorities and all of which effectively remove the so-called local aspects. Moreover, there are more than just the six-monthly reviews.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70424-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07042457000071">The chief executive also said that he was looking forward to September, when the local government section of the Department will descend on him and his council. Little boys and girls just out of university and with no real understanding of life will descend on the council to tick it off and to tick various boxes. Rather than looking at actual outputs, they will be looking at process. That will cost the council a lot of money, and the situation will then be exacerbated by the gearing. An horrendous amount of time will be wasted, the costs will be ghastly and the gearing will exaggerate the process. If the Minister actually believed what he has been saying and got off local government&#146;s back, there would be a reduction in costs and a reverse gearing effect on council tax.</p>

 This has already proved to be a highly emotive debate, which is indicative of just how important local government is to Members. Sadly, it has also been very predictable. It has clearly been a simple mechanism to enable the Opposition to run scaremongering stories, in the final week of the local election campaign, that have no foundation in fact. As chair of the all-party group on local government, that saddens me enormously. I would therefore like to focus on the positive aspects of the all-party group&#146;s work and on some specifics of the future of local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07042457000073">The all-party group, supported by the Local Government Information Unit, is reviewing the possibility of enhancing the role of the councillor and of encouraging more people from diverse backgrounds to step up to the plate and seek election, thereby bringing with them a wealth of experience. We hope to feed our findings into the Roberts review being undertaken for the Department for Communities and Local Government. The future of local government depends in part on the quality of the people whom we attract as councillors. The stream of negativity from the Opposition today is hardly a good advert for the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07042457000074">The all-party group heard from a range of witnesses&#151;from councillors from all the main parties, from experts such as Professor Steve Leach, from Paul Wheeler of the political skills forum, from Dr. Stuart Wilks-Heeg of the university of Liverpool, and from those representing minority groupings. We also asked the media to participate. There is an enormous amount of enthusiasm from elected representatives who have submitted evidence on the role that they have undertaken, and for the innovative work going on within existing parameters to engage the public more  <br>

widely, and to assist them in understanding the service that their council and councillors can offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07042457000075">Interestingly and in contrast with today&#146;s debate, the all-party group meetings have been productive. It has been largely agreed on a cross-party basis that some of the problems flagged up tonight can be resolved only if we move forward in a more consensual and positive way. The view has also been expressed that the best authorities already make good use of existing powers to reach out to their residents and electorates. There is some excellent practice out there, and the Government&#146;s beacon council scheme certainly does an excellent job in highlighting best practice and disseminating information more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07042457000076">A number of Members have, through various early-day motions and private Members&#146; Bills, supported the extension of local authority power and the wider empowerment of individuals in their relationship with their local council. The Local Government and Participation in Health Bill takes forward most of the key strands of the ideas being put forward and further enhances arrangements through local area agreements, for example, without some of the drawbacks of the measures proposed by others. The Opposition pamphlet setting out their position on sustainable communities raised concerns from experienced Members in all parts of the House. It suggested that local authorities should be given greater powers to set targets and to establish programmes directed at local needs, but quite how that fits in with proposals that would require Whitehall to deliver an action plan to achieve them I cannot imagine. Full cognisance does not appear to have been taken of the fact that local decision making means decision making within the locality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07042457000077">It is unclear how the Opposition&#146;s proposals would be achieved&#151;how the mechanisms and the administration of their proposed scheme would be handled. Given their dislike for all things regional&#151;and, by default, for regional offices&#151;would they move this power and responsibility toward the centre? They have come up with few genuine proposals for the future of local government that stand up to scrutiny, and we have heard nothing new from them today. However, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill has managed to obtain broad support, and its passage through Committee was notable for the positive and often consensual debates that were held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07042457000078">That approach has been mirrored elsewhere. Lord Bruce-Lockhart, the Conservative chairman of the Local Government Association, welcomed the White Paper that preceded the Bill, saying that it reflected the growing confidence in, and competence of, local government, as well as the belief that the best way to deliver the best services to local people is at a local level. Front-line services should be focused on the needs of those who use them. Lord Bruce-Lockhart also acknowledged that the proposals would help to free up elected councillors to put local people first in the delivery of the right services at the right time and in the right place. Many of the witnesses to the all-party group have supported the view that the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill is a real step in the right direction and that the challenge is  <br>

there for authorities and individual councillors to grasp the opportunities presented to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07042457000079">The Leader of the Opposition talks about taking responsibility and the avoidance of Government interference in other areas. He should, therefore, support what the Government are trying to achieve with local government. The Government want to release some of the central controls and to enable far greater control over decision making to be devolved to councillors and citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07042457000080">In his report, Sir Michael Lyons reaffirms the importance of local decision making and sees a positive future role for local government in fostering a new public confidence in our local governance arrangements. It is an incredibly detailed and thorough piece of work, as one would expect from Sir Michael. Although he dwells at length on a number of matters outside the question of taxation, Sir Michael does tackle the thorny issue of trying to find a solution to the perennial problem of local taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07042457000081">It would be in all our interests to resolve that problem once and for all and to accept that, at least in part, local taxation needs to be property based. No tax is popular, but every party in this House that aspires to being in government should want that problem sorted out in a way that at least enables local government to operate on a sound footing, plan long term and offer clarity to the taxpayer. The approach that I have suggested would also promote a greater sense of fairness and justice than currently exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07042457000082">The Opposition have tried to imply that the Government want to introduce a waste tax in addition to the council tax, but that is merely further scaremongering. That proposal was simply one of the many options put forward by Sir Michael Lyons for consideration. Local authorities of all parties are looking at mechanisms that would enable the better management of waste. Some are using sticks and others carrots: for example, Conservative Barnet council has been targeting residents in respect of waste, and fining them. Which council can say that it would not want to use such a power in the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07042457000083">When I sit through our debates on local government, I am always saddened to hear the unremittingly negative comments from the Opposition. They have yet to come to this House and offer any serious positive proposals that will help local government move forward. Hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench could take lessons from those of their colleagues on the Back Benches who attend the all-party group. They contribute in a positive way, and understand the important contribution that local government and local councillors make to their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07042457000084">It may be that the Opposition&#146;s attitude to local government is still shaped by the 1980s and early 1990s, when local government was seen as a nuisance. It was the subject of swingeing cuts that caused morale among councillors to plummet, but the mood now is very different. Yes, councillors have been subject to inspection&#151;but what a difference that has made. There has been an impressive turnaround in the number of authorities ranked as good or excellent&#151;</p>

In order to get elected, they made rash spending pledges that took money away from core services, such as transport and waste disposal.

bodies whose responsibilities touch local government: the regional development agencies, the learning and skills councils, planning bodies and Government offices. The implications of devolution are huge in terms of the whole geometry of regional governance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07042457000096">The Government have been a bit all over the place. There was a period of enthusiasm for elected mayors, but then it was realised that impregnable Labour cities which it might take us several elections to have a go at in the normal course of events could fall at a single blow in a mayoral election when an outsider entered the race. Then there was the period of enthusiasm for universal unitaries, when the present Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made a brief stopover at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as Minister of Communities and Local Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07042457000097">We are now in the period of unitaries   la carte, so I am interested in where the debate on city regions will go.

Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) said that Swindon did not have the capacity to be a unitary. There is a real dilemma. The Government have insisted that we need more capacity in a number of sectors, so the health service has been reorganised to create more capacity. We were embarked on the creation of more capacity in police services, but the Government have withdrawn from that process. The dilemma is: to what extent do we trade off capacity for accountability? We are all legitimately concerned about the responsiveness of our institutions to the general public and about people&#146;s disengagement from the political process. However, if we unremittingly seek capacity as the sole good, the cost will be paid in terms of identity and accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07042457000100">I am sympathetic to the notion of the small unitary, because I want councils whose leaders can be recognised and accosted in the street, as happens in many French areas&#151;it is well known that I have some sympathies for the way the French do these things. We recognise that accountability has a cost, but if we are to move through local authorities to devolve to the citizen, we must make sure that there are accountability structures.

which is the trade-off between neighbourhoods and local accountability and the strategic capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of organisations. Given his wisdom and expertise in government, I would be really interested if he could give us his thoughts on how we might take the debate forward to ensure that we best resolve the problem without the usual yah-boo that seems to get in the way of addressing some of the challenges in local government.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those remarks.

Business rates are frankly off the agenda; I do not see anybody introducing them against opposition. I regret that, because they should be returned to local authorities. The circumstances that led to their nationalisation are past and there is a huge history now of working between business and local authorities. In fact, incorporating mechanisms that safeguard against abuse does not require a PhD. Relatively simple mechanisms can be deployed and I hope that we will move back to recognising that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70424-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07042457000104">Revaluation is also probably off the agenda.

I note the Secretary of State&#146;s little words &#147;in this Parliament&#148; and I look forward to the manifesto that says that if Labour is re-elected, it will reband and revalue in the next Parliament.

The council tax is more than ever centre stage, because nobody tonight has mentioned the fact that schools funding now goes directly to the schools. If one abstracts schools funding from the formula, one sees that council tax is getting on for half the revenue of some local authorities. It is a much more high-profile tax than it was. Redistributive business rates and council tax now form a huge element of the tax resources of local authorities.</p>

clearly linked? Because of gearing and the Government&#146;s paranoid desire for control, the difficulty with the current system is that neither of those two things are in balance. We cannot have accountability because the Government dictate, and the accountability has gone from the council tax because the gearing has exaggerated the cost of local services.</p>

 I am sure that that is the case. On top of that, the Government, for reasons that we understand, wish to restrain the increases in council tax. If we do not have capping, the threat of capping has done that job and that has been used by both parties. I welcome the movement to two-year funding, and longer-term funding is clearly a sensible way to go.</p>

The fact of the matter is that there is no north-west passage&#151;that is the problem. There is no pathway through the ice that is blocking the way. The return of business rates is not a panacea, given that the money is not a new source of funding, but it represents a more devolutionary way of applying the tax that creates more initiative.</p>

Until we have that, the cries for devolution and localism will lack substance. If I may come back to my Francophile tendencies, I am bound to note that 3 May falls between the two rounds of the French presidential election. The turnout in the first round of that election was 85 per cent., but I suspect that we would be happy if we got half that turnout in a significant number of the councils being contested throughout the United Kingdom and, perhaps, in Scotland. The truth is that there is not enough at stake to make it worth while for people to turn out. People turn out when there is something at stake because power is the adrenalin of democracy. We need to put more adrenalin in our democracy.</p>

deception&#151;saying one thing and doing another&#151;and partly owing to simply the absence of information. I do not remember seeing anything at all in the Conservative manifesto, which I have re-read, about the &#163;34 million in cuts that the council is introducing across the board over the next few years. There are a few salutary lessons to be learned by anyone who is thinking about voting Conservative on 3 May, so I will run through one or two of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07042457000115">The first thing that one gets is school closures of an especially perverse kind. Hurlingham and Chelsea school, which is a much loved and much improving school in Fulham, was told out of the blue last autumn that it would close. The council then set out to rubbish the school systematically by writing to prospective parents to tell them that they should not send their children there. The head teacher, who is a very mild-mannered man, wrote to the leader of the council last week to say:</p>
<a name="70424-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="07042457000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the persistent misrepresentation of data has been a major fact in hiding the real context since your administration came to power&#148;.</p>

 Not at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07042457000119">The fact that the council persisted with the closure meant that the matter had to go to the supposedly independent school organisation committee, but the council replaced members of that committee with people whom they thought would vote in its favour. However, the council&#146;s presentation to the committee was so lamentable that even the people whom it had deliberately put on to the committee could not vote for the proposal. As a result, the proposal should have gone to the independent adjudicator today, but yesterday the council withdrew its proposal for closure. Although it gave no reason for that whatsoever, the reason is clear: there was no basis for the closure except for the fact that the site was valuable and the council wished to sell it off for capital gain. Despite all the hurt and distress that has been caused to children, parents and teachers, the council has made no apology. It has instead said that it will set up an independent commission, which will be an ill-thought-out body with no remit, chaired by a Tory peeress.</p>

 When I attended the annual meeting at which the council tax was set, I had the opportunity to speak to several Labour councillors, who blamed the hon. Gentleman for sowing the seed of these problems. Let me ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question: does he think that the Labour group was unwise to suggest that it would have delivered a lower council tax and cut the council budget deeper?</p>

 It is surprising that I know more about what was said at a meeting that I did not attend than the hon. Gentleman does about a meeting that he did attend.

I can tell him that I do not meet anyone in the borough who does not think that they have had a raw deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07042457000125">To return to my brief, the second thing that happens under a Tory council is cuts to the voluntary sector. I have a separate Adjournment debate on that subject on Monday, so I will not dwell on it, but the thick end of &#163;1 million is being cut from voluntary sector organisations, which include one of the best law centres in the country, organisations that support older people who are trying to get back into work, and organisations that provide for the single homeless. Opposition Members have supported many of those organisations in the past, and have sat on their management committees, but now the funding for all those groups is being cut by the Tory council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07042457000126">Thirdly, I should mention social care. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), who spoke for the Opposition, shed crocodile tears on that subject, and I have alluded to the increase in charging that the Conservatives in Hammersmith and Fulham had promised not to introduce in their manifesto. Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability, one of the voluntary organisations under threat, said:</p>
<a name="70424-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="07042457000178"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Before the election when seeking votes, Conservative councillors undertook to sustain the no charging policy&#151;but now they have found a way to erode it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07042457000127">Some 1,400 people described as having moderate care needs are at risk of losing all home care services because of the changing criteria. Kevin Caulfield, the chair of the coalition against charging, said:</p>
<a name="70424-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="07042457000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We expect our council to lead on policy and practice that improves the quality of life of older and disabled residents&#151;not introduce policies with poor consultation that will only result in increased poverty and isolation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07042457000128">The fourth result of a Conservative council is increased charging that far outweighs any cut in taxation. There has been a 25 per cent. increase in meals on wheels charges and there is a &#163;6 charge for refuse sacks for recycling. The borough does not meet its recycling targets, but it will now charge people for the sacks that they need in order to recycle. When challenged on that, the council said that people had been misusing the sacks. They had been keeping them at home and not using them, and the charge was the solution to that problem. The council is looking to increase parking charges by 50 per cent., to &#163;2.40 an hour. It has increased burial charges by 52 per cent. and it has even proposed to charge school governors for the police checks made on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07042457000129">The fifth result of a Conservative council is an end to social housing programmes across the borough. There is also a change in housing allocation policies, and families are now being put into one-bedroom flats. As for those who happen to be made homeless, the council has even cut the grant that provides for the storage of people&#146;s furniture while they are looking for another property, so that furniture has to go, and there is very little chance of getting it back. Sixthly, there are cuts relating to environmental policy. Almost &#163;1 million has been cut from refuse and street cleaning services. I have mentioned recycling; today I received a letter from someone who had asked the council why they could not recycle their kitchen waste. The council&#146;s response was that Government regulations meant that it could not take that waste. The person found that perplexing, as they live only 50 yd from Ealing, which does recycle kitchen waste, but I have already alluded to the honesty with which the local authority acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07042457000130">Seventhly, I notice that there is a reference to library services in the Opposition motion, but those services are not free from attack either. The mobile library and the housebound readers&#146; service have gone. The main reference library is being closed, and its specialist book collections are being dispersed and sold off. The council is also phasing out qualified librarians, because it does not think that it needs them at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07042457000131">Policing is the eighth thing that suffers. The previous Labour council invested in extra officers and safer neighbourhood teams. The Conservatives have promised&#151;another promise&#151;24/7 neighbourhood teams, but the first thing they have done is cut three additional officers, which represents a 25 per cent. cut, from Hammersmith Broadway, the ward with the highest crime in the borough that was the scene of a tragic murder only a month ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07042457000132">I am not suggesting that all councils are like Hammersmith and Fulham, or that they are all quite as crackpot and doctrinaire in their behaviour. However, I make a plea to anyone who is thinking of voting for a Conservative council in May to heed the lessons of what the Conservatives do in office, rather than what they say they will do when they are trying to get into office. We have heard some erudite speeches about principles, but I suspect that when people go to vote on 3 May they will be most interested in whether their councils can provide reasonable taxation as well as the services that local communities demand. That is not being done&#151;those services have been cynically cut in Hammersmith and Fulham&#151;and it is a lesson that everyone should bear in mind.</p>

boundaries. First, there is a deep imbalance in funding for councils. I am often told that money is taken from the south-east and is given to Labour&#146;s marginal seats in the north, and there is clear evidence of that imbalance. We now have the facts. Of East Sussex councils, Wealden has the highest proportion of elderly people&#151;certainly of the over-80s and over-85s in the country&#151;and that is partly why we have roughly the third lowest gross domestic product in the country. However, the grant per head that Wealden receives from the Government comes in at &#163;54.03. The maximum level in the country is &#163;133 per head, and even the average is &#163;92 per head. If Wealden were funded at the average level for district councils, it would have a further &#163;5.5 million a year that it could spend on local services or use to reduce council tax. It would increase its grant level by well over half.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07042457000135">Another way of looking at it is to consider the proportion of council spending that has to come from council tax. If we look at the country overall, the average is 46.1 per cent., but the lowest proportion is in Exeter, where it is 21.6 per cent.&#151;I am not sure what Exeter has done to be so special, apart from being a marginal seat&#151;but in Wealden, it is 63 per cent. That is why council tax has been driven up so much: my councils do not receive the same level of grant as other authorities.</p>

If councils in East Sussex were funded at the average levels for metropolitan boroughs across the country, the county would have a further &#163;113 million a year to spend on vital local services or to reduce council tax. There is tremendous anger about the fact that we are getting a bad deal, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) is absolutely right that it is an issue that must be dealt with. The greatest frustration experienced by my local councillors stems from the fact that, every year, they are required to provide more services to the Government, but are not given the means of paying for them, so they have to find those funds from their own resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07042457000139">Secondly, the Government have increasingly eroded local councils&#146; ability to make decisions that they believe are right for local people. Housing was mentioned earlier, and it exemplifies the problem better than anything else. The current system is top-down. There is enormous anger in Wealden that hundreds of houses are imposed on us every year by people who do not know the geography of the area. That happens because of the way in which the process works. The anger is as much against the process as against the number of houses to be built.</p>

We are facing the closure of the accident and emergency unit and the maternity unit at the hospital in Haywards Heath, which provides services to the town of Uckfield, yet we are still expected to build hundreds of houses in that town because of the formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07042457000142">What we need is a new approach whereby local councillors, elected directly by the people whom they serve, are able to make decisions on how many new houses there should be, where they should be built and what type. It is the Government who will not allow them to make those decisions, and who are forcing them to follow the existing procedures against their will.</p>

In her opening comments the Secretary of State said that the Government should be judged on their results, not their rhetoric. We will indeed judge them on their results. They have fiddled the system of funding local authorities, which has made matters infinitely more difficult than they should be. They have undermined local decision-making, and they will be truly judged on 3 May.</p>

Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) and I agree with every word. In particular, he touched on the issue which neither Lyons nor much of the debate has yet touched on&#151;the need for us to consider the balance not just in funding, but in competencies, between central and local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07042457000146">Like my right hon. Friend, I have some knowledge of local government in France. The turnout figure is a point at issue, and that applies at local level as well. It is not insignificant that if one takes the average for all local authorities in the United Kingdom, 60 to 70 per cent. of total budgets come from central Government, whereas in France about 25 per cent. on average comes from central Government and about 45 per cent. is raised locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07042457000147">One thing that Lyons got right was to identify a weakness under our current arrangements whereby local authorities are unduly dependent on one single variable source of taxation in the council tax. It is right that there should be a significant element of property taxation in the portfolio, but having identified that, Lyons ducked the issue of what other areas of discretionary spend we could put in the local government armoury. That is my second point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07042457000148">One of the great frustrations associated with local government is the difficulty of attracting people&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07042457000151">One of the reasons why people do not get involved in local government or vote at local council elections is the belief that local government has very little discretion. That has been made worse under the current financing regime by the extent of ring-fencing. The evidence demonstrates that about 50 per cent. of the funds that come from the centre to local government is ring-fenced. Back in 1997-98 that was 4.5 per cent. Steps could be taken immediately to reduce the amount of ring-fencing, in the same way as we should be reducing, as has already been said, the level of controls and the targets culture, which impose a considerable burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70424-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07042457000152">I would go further. I take the view, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, that the time has come when we should consider, with certain safeguards, returning the business rate to local authorities, not least because there is a need to encourage them to broaden their tax base. When I was a local councillor, there was almost some positive competition among London boroughs to encourage business to have more commercial development in the local authority because we gained benefit to our tax base. It would be healthy for us to look at that once again. In the same way, if we follow that localist path, perhaps we must accept that we should think again about capping.</p>

The Minister knows that he has at least achieved one part of the Government&#146;s amendment in relation to Bromley&#151;he has brought it stable funding. It has been at the floor in terms of grant settlement for the past six years and it has consistently had the second lowest level of formula grant support in London for the past six years.

considerable demands for capital expenditure for education purposes, it is denied access to the supported capital expenditure revenue element of funding that comes from the Department for Education and Skills. So we are in the peculiar situation that, even if we could borrow under the prudential regime, there would not be any central Government funding to pick up the borrowing costs and we would then have to dip into revenue costs to cover that, which would push us even tighter against our settlement because of being at the floor.

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07042457000169">I was not intending to contribute, but three elements of the speech by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) prompted me to do so. First, she failed to explain precisely what is Conservative policy with regard to the funding of local government. She told us very eloquently what she and her party are against, but did not explain what they are in favour of or what they want to replace the council tax of which she was so critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07042457000170">Secondly, the hon. Lady failed to explain why revaluation would of itself lead to higher council taxes or how the total amount paid could somehow be increased by the process of revaluation. It would of course inevitably lead to some paying more, but, equally, to some paying less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07042457000171">Thirdly&#151;this element most prompted me to get to my feet&#151;the hon. Lady accused the Government of making local councils mere agents of central Government. As somebody who was a council leader for a considerable proportion of the Thatcher and Major years, that accusation seemed pretty rich coming from the Conservative Benches. During those years as council leaders, my colleagues and I did our best to protect the most vulnerable in our communities from the devastation that the Tories caused to the services that we were providing on their behalf. I was well aware of the reality behind the Conservative commitment to local democracy. The reality was savage cuts in services, massive job losses and the devastation of the morale of members and officers in local government&#151;and, of course, the poll tax.</p>

I wanted them to go further and faster, but I recognise that they have at least begun the process of rebuilding local leadership, of rebuilding the investment in local people, and of re-empowering locally elected representatives. I welcome the steps that have been taken. Local government and the political parties, at local and national level, need to respond to the challenge and to play their part, particularly in encouraging and enabling good-calibre candidates to stand for local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07042457000173">We must not forget that local government and local democracy are too important to the well-being of our society to be allowed to wither, and certainly too important to return to the denigration and devastation of the Tory years.</p>

The authority for annual review of local government is set out in the Local Government Act 1992. Section 13 states that the Secretary of State may request the Electoral Commission to undertake a review, which in this context means,</p>
<a name="70424-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="0704253001101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the replacement in any non-metropolitan area, of the two principal tiers of local government in a single-tier&#148;.</p>

I cannot recall the House passing any special resolutions to enable the Secretary of State to introduce the review.

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0704253000014">We are not considering an academic question, because local authorities have spent hundreds of thousands&#151;perhaps millions&#151;of pounds preparing for the review. They are responsible to their residents, who will look to them for the authority for expending that money. To have lawful authority, both Houses of Parliament and Her Majesty must agree. A draft law and a law in progress is not enough. Will the Minister for Local Government clearly set out the authority so that we can all understand it?</p>

Hammersmith council I know exactly what the wedding guests felt like in &#147;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0704253000032">The Secretary of State made an interesting point but was rather unkind about Trafford. I took the opportunity to look into all the metropolitan district councils surrounding Trafford&#151;and guess which authority had the lowest council tax? [Hon. Members: &#147;Trafford.&#148;] Yes, Trafford, and guess which party controls Trafford? [Hon. Members: &#147;The Conservatives.&#148;] Yes, and all the others have levied vastly higher counciltax bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0704253000033">The Secretary of State went on at some length about all the questions that we have been asking, suggesting that we were scaremongering about a new way of raising council tax and revaluation. Indeed, the Minister for Local Government got rather upset about it all. Yes, we have tabled a number of parliamentary questions and we have taken the opportunity to use freedom of information legislation. We know that the Government are looking into computer-assisted mass appraisal and automated valuation models and that they have spent the best part of &#163;500,000 buying in bulk cameras for their inspectors to have a look at various things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para30"><a name="0704253000034">We also know&#151;the House may be interested in this&#151;that the council tax inspectors in the Valuation Office Agency have been holding high-level talks with local tax inspectors in Hong Kong. That gives a whole new dimension to a Chinese takeaway. The talks included a summit at Hong Kong&#146;s new Disney resort on the logistics of holding annual council tax revaluations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para31"><a name="0704253000035">As my hon. Friends will testify, I have always been of a romantic disposition, dreaming in my youth of far and distant places. In my early years, I was much taken with the book, &#147;Beau Geste&#148; and felt that to see the world, a period of recruitment in the French foreign legion was the thing to do. I see now that I was wrong and that the Valuation Office Agency is the place for exotic travel, taking in Disneyworld and Hong Kong. Admittedly, unlike in the foreign legion, one is unlikely in the Valuation Office Agency to be shot at by Tuaregs or the Vietcong, but there are other discomforts. The air conditioning in some of the five-star hotels can be a little tricky after one has spent the day talking to Mickey Mouse. There is surely no distance that the Government will fail to travel in order to rob pensioners of their savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para32"><a name="0704253000036">There is one sure test that shows how proud Government supporters are and how much they want to win in May. Are they prepared to be associated with Labour policies? Are they prepared to put their names on the ballot paper? Are they prepared to wear the party&#146;s colours? We all know where the Conservative party stands. We are standing over a record number of seats&#151;90 per cent. of all the contests have a Conservative party candidate standing, and it is even higher in some regions. The Liberal Democrats are just treading water, but the Labour party has gone backwards, contesting not far short of half the seats in the election. That is the lowest number of seats  <br>

contested by any Government party at a local election. It is the clearest indication that no one trusts this Government. Nobody believes that their policies are working and their closest supporters are too ashamed of Labour&#146;s record in local government to wear a red rosette.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) on the flourish at the end, which has done for local government policy what George Best did for the soft drinks industry&#151;not much at all. I congratulate him on the flourish, but what is clear from the debate is that the traditional stance of the Conservatives in opposition is not to have a policy. We know that they do not have a policy, because they have not said anything positive in debates over the last two years. We know that it is the job of Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition to oppose Government policy, and we expect them to do that, but if I were Her Majesty, I would want my money back, because they have failed to do it effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para33"><a name="0704253000038">The Conservatives are not stopping at opposing our policy, however. They are engaging in a rather dangerous and disingenuous campaign of misrepresenting the Government&#146;s policy. They are misrepresenting the Government&#146;s policy, and they know that they are doing so. The comments made by the Government in debates in Committee on the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill&#151;which my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) rightly observed was a consensual Bill&#151;have not been passed to the Conservative Front-Bench spokespersons who have been speaking tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para34"><a name="0704253000039">On restructuring, the Government asked councils whether they wanted to put forward proposals to move to unitary structures. It has already been pointed out that half the councils that have put forward proposals are controlled by the Conservatives. These are not proposals from the Government. They are the result of a devolutionary approach to restructuring, which stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by the previous Conservative Government, who imposed unitaries on Scotland and Wales without so much as a proper consultation, and who introduced changes following the Banham review, after a helicopter flight by the then Secretary of State, Michael Heseltine, with an Ordnance Survey map and a felt tip pen&#151;his words, not mine. The idea that the Government are putting a gun to the head of councils and threatening to withdraw resources is a scandalous accusation, and it is not true. I understand that there are local elections going on, but I wish that the Conservative party would keep the arguments at local level and not pretend that the proposals are those of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70424-0020.htm_para35"><a name="0704253000040">The power to direct has been agreed with the Conservative-led Local Government Association on a cross-party consensual basis. The commitment has been given to the Committee considering the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill and to the House by the Secretary of State that that will be the case, yet the myth that it is not the case is perpetuated.</p>

frankly a misrepresentation, and they know it. They say that the Government are proposing new powers for inspectors; we are not. The powers of inspection were laid out in 1991 by the then Conservative Government who introduced the council tax. The law does not allow an inspector to enter someone&#146;s home without the permission of the householder. There are no plans to change that, and the Conservatives know it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70424-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0704253000042">The Conservatives no longer have a policy to engage in a constructive debate about the future of local government. Instead, they opportunistically attack the Government on the basis of misrepresentations. At least the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) took us into a proper policy debate, because he understands local government finance in a way that I suspect some of his colleagues do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70424-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0704253000043">I shall apply myself in a moment to some of the serious policy points that have been made, but before I move off my criticism of the Conservatives&#146; attack, their strategy and their tactics, let me issue a warning to them. It is a warning that was sounded by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter). In the 1980s, the Thatcherite councils in Wandsworth and Westminster were seen as flagships&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70424-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0704253000046">In that period, there were two flagship Thatcherite authorities which the leadership of that Government&#151;particularly under Kenneth Baker, now Lord Baker&#151;used to drive policy changes through the Conservative party. People now face not a flagship but a U-boat, because Hammersmith and Fulham council is the true face of the Conservative party at local level. Let me give some succour to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush: the arguments from Hammersmith and Fulham council and the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) for extra resources cut no ice against the background and the eight policy measures explained to us.</p>

It is not backed up by the facts, by the figures provided independently by the House of Commons Library, or by the Local Government Association&#146;s policy. I give the warning about the U-boat of the Conservative party at local level, because millions of voters on 3 May will look to Hammersmith and Fulham council for an example of what would happen were they to be taken in by the scaremongering of the Conservative party and its supporters in the press.</p>

require a redistributive amount that would diminish the local discretion sought. The idea of localisation of business rates ignores the reality of the direct support grant, the changes made in the past 10 years and the &#163;1 billion extra provided through the local authority business growth initiative scheme, which is welcomed by councils across the political spectrum.</p>

I disagree with him, however, on his criticisms of local area agreements. There is broad and deep consensus for the idea of joining up funding at local level, and of changing the performance regime.

 It is a pleasure to talk tonight about plant science and climate change because, in some ways, climate change has become the media story of the decade. Although there is a tendency to overblow some of the claims of what might happen, most of us accept that things will happen and that they are beginning to happen. I want to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0704253001052">We see the effects of climate change all around us. In a funny way, I often think about Vivaldi&#146;s &#147;Four Seasons&#148;, which could become three seasons. That would be quite a revolutionary change in classical music. We look at the papers and see reports of snow-less ski slopes and flowers blooming at all the wrong time throughout the winter. That is not something that just happens on the equator or elsewhere; it actually happens in this country as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0704253001053">When it comes to combating climate change, things are not as simple as they appear. Research recently and a great deal of column space has been devoted to talk about air travel, carbon emissions and carbon offset schemes. People argue scientifically that some of those schemes might not do what it appears that they would do. Recent research from the Lawrence Livermore laboratory in the United States and the Carnegie Institution at Stanford university in California suggests that planting trees to offset carbon emissions could contribute to global warming unless the trees are planted in the tropics. That is an interesting new aspect that we had not thought about. It is only research and more needs to be done, so I guess that what I am saying is that there are no quick fixes when it comes to climate change, but we have to adopt and develop the policy of planting trees, whether they are in the tropics or elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0704253001054">The rule of no quick fixes also applies to the first generation of biofuels. Although the need for zero-carbon fuels is obviously real and present, the deforestation of developing countries taking place in the rush to make way for biofuel plantations is having a more severe effect on the planet than many of us imagined. It is argued that the carbon emitted by burning the trees and the peat to make way for biofuel crops far exceeds any savings that one could hope to make from burning renewable fuel instead of petrol. A further side effect is the destruction of many natural habitats and ecosystems as developing countries struggle to get into the new market, effectively throwing environmental concerns to the wind. Interesting questions in this area still need to be resolved, despite the fact that we acknowledge that climate change is taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0704253001055">If we look at this complex issue closely, we find that our mission is to consider not only how to prevent global warming, but how to deal practically with its consequences in the United Kingdom. We must ensure that we enter the 21st century with secure energy and food supplies. If we are to find the solution, we must examine the science that is being developed with plants in this country. We cannot look abroad for the  <br>

solutions to our energy problems. We should be implementing schemes that will enable us to be responsible for what happens in the UK by concentrating our efforts on a second generation of bioenergy crops that use biomass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0704253001056">Biomass in itself is just a source of energy production along with other renewable energy sources, such as wind, wave, geothermal and sunlight. Miscanthus, switch grasses and willow and poplar trees can all be grown in the UK to contribute to the biomass initiative. Their growth requires less land than existing biofuel crops. They are renewable and carbon-neutral. They do not require the volume of chemicals and pesticides that have led to the criticism of crops such as rapeseed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0704253001057">Short-rotation coppice willow is being grown at Rothamsted Research. The crops grow on marginal land of low quality and require little input. If such second-generation bioenergy crops were grown on 350,000 acres of UK land and processed to produce fuels such as diesel, some 7 per cent. of the UK&#146;s petrochemical needs would be met without reducing food production and with very little input. While such plant development is important, we need more research. It is welcome that the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council has put &#163;20 million into that research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0704253001058">We face a situation in which before the research has been done, many countries and companies are planting vast areas of biofuels. I argue that that will damage the environment. If we are able to produce more bioenergy crops in the UK, we will be able to control the way in which they are farmed and regulate the carbon dioxide that is emitted. We could reduce the carbon dioxide emitted by the transportation of imports. In that way, we would guarantee our energy security, which is a real problem that relates to the sources of our energy production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0704253001059">It is almost certain that there will be competition for farmland between biofuel companies and the food industry. Our main concerns will be reducing carbon emissions and ensuring that we have effective farming systems. Bioscience offers us the possible solutions that we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0704253001060">As the climate warms, it will be almost inevitable that we will witness further physical changes to the UK countryside. That will have a massive effect on farming in this country. Arable farmers will need crops that can grow and be harvested under variable temperatures and rainfall. For example, it is predicted that the average temperature in East Anglia will have risen by 3 C by 2050. It is no use George Bush telling us that we will reduce global warming by talking in terms not of Fahrenheit, but of Celsius, even though the numbers are obviously reduced. There will also be greatly reduced rainfall and much more water evaporation and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0704253001061">The climate can affect the length of a harvest and soil structure, which vary massively even from year to year. Owing to global warming, farmers will face new infections and parasites. Wetter winters will make cereal crops more prone to fungal diseases such as Fusarium ear blight. We will simply not be able continue to grow the variety of crops that are traditionally grown in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0704253001062">There are a number of ways to approach the problem. The rising temperatures will lead to a lot of  <br>

drought, and in East Anglia, yields of sugar beet are expected to decline by half in areas that are already experiencing those difficulties. We can increase rainwater catchments, and irrigation efficiency; those are practical starting points, but we must also look into the genetic make-up of plants that can survive in extreme climates. We are really gifted at such work in this country; we have centres such as Broom&#146;s Barn, Rothamsted and the John Innes Centre in Norwich, which are tackling the problems of developing drought-resistant sugar beet. We can now isolate the genes that allow plants to cope with extreme temperatures. Those genes can also be bred into commercial crop varieties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0704253001063">We can protect cereal crops from fungal diseases by introducing genes with a natural resistance. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have isolated several genes that decide whether a plant needs a cold period before it will flower. The traditional teaching is that there has to be a cold period before an explosion of flowers will appear. There is a cold trigger that can be bred in and out of plants to produce winter and spring varieties, and it varies; that occurs in plants in Spain, Sweden and in this country, and we are learning how that happens. That technology will become really important as temperature changes take place. Crop protection is another important subject to consider. All our farmers, including organic growers, rely on plant protection products of some kind. As biofuels and food compete for land, we will only meet the increasing demand for both if we ensure that more crops make it to the harvest stage, through the responsible use of pesticides and effective land management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0704253001064">Plant science has a central role to play in all our futures, and in combating climate change, and we miss its importance at our peril. It is sad that job losses are occurring in places such as Rothamsted, which had a net reduction of 17 members of staff in 2005-06. The John Innes Centre is absolutely world-class&#151;the best in Europe&#151;and it produces research that everybody admires; I mentioned just some of it&#151;the research about flowering and the genes involved in it. I not just talking about genes that make better-looking plants, but genes that are commercially important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0704253001065">How long will we be at the forefront of plant science if we do not make the necessary investment and address the fact that people are not entering the profession? Many young people do not see that plant science is really quite an appetising profession. We have to link up that kind of science with innovation and public benefit. As you will know, Mr. Speaker, I am also actively interested in biomedical sciences and biomedical research, for which a plethora of research and development funding has been made available by the Government, charities and the pharmaceutical industry. We may bemoan the conditions that those sciences face, but they are nothing like as bad as the what is happening in the plant sciences. There is one research council involved in plant sciences, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and only one charity involved in plant science, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, which was set up by the former Minister for Science and Innovation, Lord Sainsbury of Turville.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0704253001066">We have to acknowledge that the plant-breeding industry in this country has been affected by the  <br>

genetically modified crops debacle and the &#147;anti&#148; attitude of the public. In the House, too, people were against GM crops and fought against them, and that has caused people in the industry to leave the UK and go elsewhere to develop their talents and the new sciences. We get &#163;336 million in funding a year, but a glance at the title of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council&#151;the body that gets that kind of money&#151;shows that it has many other areas on which to spend that money, including biotechnology, another area that has a world-class dimension to it. Plant science always falls down the list of priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0704253001067">It is important to establish the industry in this country. BP is setting up a $250 billion biofuels research centre in California, rather than in the UK. That is really strange to me, given the scientific expertise that we have. It was Schwarzenegger himself who agreed to match the investment, while the research council could offer only &#163;20 million. It is sad that that has developed in the states, as it could have developed here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0704253001068">While the UK has very good plant-breeding technology, our ability to use that knowledge is extremely vulnerable. It is regarded as underfunded and unsexy, in fact, by many young scientists, and I have attended many meetings at which young people have said they do not want to go into plant research, because there is no money or career structure. We need to develop plant varieties that are specific to the UK&#146;s climatic and social needs. The multinational plant-breeding companies are willing to do so, and it will help us with our food and fuel security, but we must make them regard it as a priority to be developed in the UK with the backing of our proud and talented researchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0704253001069">The Government, too, must start to think about plant sciences and practical solutions to climate change that they can develop to provide energy, resistance to diseases and so on. Things are going to change, and we cannot wait 20 years. We must accept that it is going to happen. Malaria is likely to come to this country, but many plant diseases will come here, too, and we should research them now. We have to get the agricultural community behind us, and they are a conservative, resistant lot. We must not scare the pants off them, but we must make them acknowledge the fact that there is a serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para28"><a name="0704253001070">Climate change is an extremely important issue for the Government, and a great deal has been said about that. We have introduced a draft Climate Change Bill, which we are very keen on, and which we want to develop. The leader of the Opposition wears organic trainers, whatever that means, but despite all that, plant sciences have had a bad deal. Although stem cell research is the front-runner, plant sciences have as much to offer in tackling climate change as anything else, so I am very pleased to present this debate.</p>

Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), because he has an unparalleled knowledge of science in the House, having chaired the Select Committee on Science and Technology. His scientific background, too, stands him in tremendously good stead. This evening, he spoke about many things including, first, the need to plant trees, as well as biofuels and the danger of monoculture. I hope that he agrees that peat bog remediation is every bit as important as the need to plant trees. I was on the top of Blackmoor in the Peak district at the weekend looking at the depletion in the peat. The peat bogs in this country represent a greater sequestion of carbon than the entire forests of France and the UK combined. They are infinitely more powerful, and they store carbon for thousands of years, rather than just for hundreds of years, as standing forests do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para29"><a name="0704253001072">My hon. Friend spoke about the dangers of biofuels, particularly of monoculture. Bioethanol can be a very good biofuel if it is used instead of petrol, but it is not so good if, to produce it, we destroy virgin rainforest, and I absolutely agree with the point that he made. I wanted to pick up one more initial point in his contribution, and echo his praise both for the talented researchers in this country and for their work on plant science and in other scientific areas. That is certainly an industry that will come more and more to the fore as we face up to the problems of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para30"><a name="0704253001073">Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally. About 36 per cent. of the UK&#146;s total methane emissions and 67 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions come from agriculture&#151;for example, from artificial fertiliser, manure and livestock. Although agriculture is only directly responsible for around 1 per cent. of UK carbon dioxide emissions, the sector can help to mitigate CO2 emissions from other sources through carbon sequestration in soils, as we have mentioned, and timber, and by producing energy crops to replace fossil fuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para31"><a name="0704253001074">On 13 March this year we published the draft Climate Change Bill for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill would make the UK the first country to set a long-term legal framework for reducing emissions over the next 45 years and beyond. Although the draft Bill focuses on carbon dioxide, which is not the most significant greenhouse gas for agriculture, the independent committee on climate change, which the Bill establishes, will have a duty to advise the Government in relation to other greenhouse gases whenever the Government asks it to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70424-0022.htm_para32"><a name="0704253001075">Agriculture is central to helping us meet our objectives on climate change, and is significant in the UK&#146;s climate change programme. Farmers growing crops or rearing livestock on grassland will feel the impacts of our changing climate very directly, and they need to be ready to adapt to these impacts. All farmers have a major role to play&#151;for example, by reducing their direct greenhouse gas emissions, managing the land in ways which help sequester carbon, and supplying bioenergy crops as an alternative to fossil fuels.</p>

what farmers can do to reduce emissions. It includes research on climate change mitigation in agriculture, the impacts of climate change on farming, including both livestock and arable sectors, and the vulnerability of UK agriculture to extreme weather events, about which my hon. Friend spoke. This is within the 2007-08 DEFRA budget of &#163;70 million for sustainable farming and food science, including animal health and welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0704253001077">Specifically in relation to plant science, our research and development programme is looking, for example, at the vulnerability of crops to extreme weather events, which are expected to increase with climate change; at the long-term plant breeding challenges faced by the plant breeding sector; at how to develop crops for energy that will support our climate change and renewable energy targets, at a price which is competitive in the market for renewable energy; at how to increase commercial yields of biomass crops; and at how to determine and demonstrate the most economical systems for growing biomass crops, consistent with the protection of the environment and, of course, with minimal use of pesticides and fertilisers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0704253001078">The direct effects of climate change on crops has been well researched in DEFRA research and development. Further research is being commissioned to build on this. Current considerations suggest that climate change impacts do not threaten the viability of UK agriculture as a whole, but particular regions and individual farm businesses need to be aware of both the risks and the opportunities. In decades to come the impacts of climate change will be more defined, with winter rain becoming more sporadic and intense, and summer rain more scarce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0704253001079">Crop yields are affected by many factors associated with climate change, including temperature, rainfall, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, extreme weather events and climate variability. Models developed through the research that the Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council and DEFRA have funded on plant science and crop development are producing predictions based on possible climate scenarios. These can be updated as more reliable models of climate change become available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0704253001080">Potential threats from climate change to farmers growing crops include prolonged and more frequent droughts, changes in rainfall distribution, increased risk of new crop diseases or some pests becoming more serious, and increased vulnerability of crops to variable or extreme temperatures. Soils are also likely to be affected by variation in temperature and rainfall. Some soils are likely to form impenetrable caps, increasing the risk of run-off and subsequent pollution events and flooding. Cracking in soils after dry periods may prevent rainfall from being retained and further increase subsequent droughts. Hotter, drier summers may also affect subsoils and make it more difficult for plant roots to penetrate and grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0704253001082">On the other hand, rising temperatures and longer growing seasons will provide opportunities for farmers to grow new crops, such as energy crops, and supply new markets. For some commodities, the UK could have an advantage compared with traditional competitors. As the climate changes, some crops will become easier to grow and others harder. Landscape  <br>

features may also change&#151;for example where crops grown for fuel replace those grown for food or set-aside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0704253001083">We have a continuing programme of research looking at the contribution of different land management practices to climate change objectives&#151;both adaptation and mitigation. Through previous work, which has been published, the UK is well served with information on impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0704253001084">We need to work with farmers and land managers, and with organisations such as the Rural Climate Change Forum, to ensure that farmers have the information and advice they need to turn the results from climate change research into practical action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to adapt to these impacts and make the most of new opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0704253001085">Basic plant science in the UK is funded by BBSRC rather than DEFRA. The BBSRC investment includes a large proportion of the &#163;30 million per annum spent at its research institutes&#151;Rothamsted, the John Innes Institute in Norwich and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research, and there are also many projects funded at universities related to plant science. Much of that research investigates the fundamental processes in the life of plants that climate change is likely to affect. By understanding how these responses work and linking them to the genes involved in well studied &#147;model&#148; plant species, scientists and subsequently commercial plant breeders will be able to breed characteristics into crops to help them tolerate and continue to grow under more extreme conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0704253001087">In addition to DEFRA&#146;s specific agriculture and climate change research, the UK spends about &#163;5 million annually on research and development connected with the genetic improvement of UK grown crops. This will underpin the development of crop varieties better suited to future climates and new crops and markets. The DEFRA research links with a specific BBSRC crop science initiative, which seeks to apply results from fundamental plant science to crops. These together form a basis for collaborative work with industry&#151;with plant breeders and farming organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0704253001088">For major field crops, including wheat, oilseed rape, biomass, pulse crops and oats we have invested in resources and techniques to underpin plant breeding by creating crop genetic improvement networks that focus on traits that will help commercial breeders introduce varieties that can improve the environmental footprint of production systems or help to address the likely stresses on crop plants from climate change. Similar projects are in place for grass and forage and some horticultural crops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70424-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0704253001089">The oilseeds genetic improvement network&#151;OREGIN&#151;provides an example of the collaborative work in progress. Researchers based at Rothamsted, the John Innes Institute, Warwick university and elsewhere are all involved. Since it was established in 2003 it has provided a focus for the research and stakeholder communities associated with oilseed rape and brassica crops. The project has provided reference and experimental material and built expertise as a basis for studying aspects that may be affected by changing temperature, such as oil profiles and risks from attack of pests and pathogens, and the more efficient use of inputs, such as nitrogen fertiliser.</p>

 My hon. Friend characterised farmers who were &#147;conservative&#148;&#151;I am sure that he used that word adjectivally with a small &#147;c&#148; rather than to denote any political association. In fact, I have been pleasantly surprised by farmers&#146; willingness to see themselves increasingly as land managers, landscape managers and environmental managers who are prepared to get their remuneration not from the subsidies for production that we used to, and in some cases still do, pay as a result of the cap, but as a result of the public goods that they are creating. They are increasingly ahead of those in many places in the rest of Europe in appreciating their role to that effect&#151;</p>
