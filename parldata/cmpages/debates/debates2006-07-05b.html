 For 18 years, the Conservative Government did absolutely nothing to address this issue. The financial assistance scheme has been expanded from &#163;400 million in 2004 to &#163;2.3 billion starting from this October. It will provide substantial assistance to Allied Steel and Wire staff and it has been widely welcomed, including by their trade union, Community. We accept that there are issues that have to be resolved in the European Court of Justice, but we are confident that the scheme that is now in place will go a long way towards providing protection for staff who have lost their pensions. On top of that, we have the Pension Protection Fund, which will provide long-term security for people who have invested their savings in occupational pensions.</p>

 Not surprisingly, I completely agree with my right hon. Friend. We have seen 700,000 children lifted out of poverty right across the United Kingdom, but she is right: we still need to do more.

 Child tax credits, like the employment tax credits, have an administrative cost, but they target the resources on those most in need, including children in Wales and right across the United Kingdom&#151;and, I dare say, also in the hon.

The Conservatives&#146; repeated attempts to sabotage the programme&#151;they opposed it in the first place and they would like to scrap it&#151;would leave thousands of children in Wales and hundreds of thousands of children across the United Kingdom destitute, as they were when the Tories were last in power.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. Yesterday, the Welsh Affairs Committee heard repeatedly from the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety that the Government remained firmly attached to an all-Wales police force, yet we have also heard about an extended period of consultation. Will that consultation include a full examination of what the Minister described as &#147;innovative alternatives&#148;, including the federated model that the right hon.

 I am not sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen has made that point, but I will certainly check. It is significant that no chief constable&#151;especially Barbara Wilding, the chief constable of South Wales police force, which is the largest in Wales&#151;has supported the idea of a federation. She makes the compelling point that that would not work. Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary advanced the original case for a single police force in Wales to bring together capabilities for tackling the huge new threats of serious and organised crime, drug dealing and terrorist activity. The problem with the Liberal Democrats and other critics of the policy is that they do not have a serious alternative for dealing with those new threats, and until they produce one, no one will take their criticism seriously.</p>

 I am still slightly unclear about the Government&#146;s position.

 Obviously, we want to ensure that we proceed with as much consent as possible so that we can tackle the new threats. As I said, no one has yet provided an alternative that would deal with those threats or deliver the capabilities to measure up to them. Of course we are not going into this with a closed mind. The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety made it clear to the Welsh Affairs Committee the other day that he thought that some of the handling of the matter over recent months could have been better, so he is now ensuring that that happens. None of the four chief constables to whom I have spoken&#151;I am seeing the North Wales chief constable next week&#151;has come up with an alternative.

We are meeting targets on reducing waiting times, and that is a result of the massive investment that is now going into the health service in Wales. We will be spending  &#163;5 billion this year, which represents a rise of over  80 per cent. since 1999. That is &#163;1,600 a person. We now have 450 more consultants and 7,300 more nurses,  <br>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently met Airbus senior management because of the latest concerns about EADS and its share price.

 I can give my hon. Friend that reassurance. Rigorous assessment of options by the joint MOD-Marine and Coastguard Agency procurement team led to a recommendation of harmonisation under a private finance initiative. The MOD and the MCA will continue jointly to manage and task the service, and will retain a high proportion of military aircrews. There will be no reductions in the service provision of search and rescue helicopters. The Government are committed to delivering a future service that is at least as effective as the present one.

Preventing that country from becoming again a rogue state that backs terror is, inevitably, a complex mission. It means supporting the Afghan Government in a range of tasks and confronting the Taliban. Major General Peter Wall has said that resistance has been &#147;more virulent&#148; than had been anticipated. Can the Prime Minister confirm that that is the case?</p>

 Yes, it is clear that the Taliban will fight hard, particularly in the south of the country, to regain their foothold and turn Afghanistan back into a failed state where al-Qaeda had its headquarters and the people were brutally oppressed by a regime that was not just bloody in what it did to its own people but in what it exported to the rest of the world. So, yes, they will fight hard, and the mission of the British forces is absolutely clear, as is the mission of the other forces, for example, Germany and Italy in the north and west of the country: it is to support the Afghan Government centrally and locally so that they can reconstruct their country and so that what the Afghans voted for&#151;a stable, prosperous, democratic, tolerant society&#151;can come about.</p>

As I indicated yesterday, if they need more, we will make sure that they get more. In the end, it is important to realise that the operational plans are drawn up and implemented by the commanders on the ground, which is how it should be, but if they desire more from us, of course, we will make sure that we give them every support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="60705-0002.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000132">I just want to make it clear that the British troops who are there are doing the most extraordinary and heroic job. They are fighting a battle that is important not just for the security of Afghanistan but for the security of the wider world. It is absolutely right that we give them every support, and we will do so. Sadly, we have lost troops in Afghanistan, and so have many other countries, including Germany, Italy and Spain. It is important to realise that when they give their lives in the service of our country they do so in support of a mission that is absolutely necessary and vital to our security in this country.</p>

 If I may again deal with the reciprocal arrangements, it is not true that the United States has a different evidential burden from this country.

It is not correct to say that the United States has been given preferential treatment or that the arrangements in respect of evidence are not reciprocal. However, I do understand the real concern that the families will have about what happens when they go to the United States, and I have asked our officials to see whether there is any support or assurances that we can give so that if they are extradited, they are given the opportunity to be bailed.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his recognition of the extra money that has gone in. It is that extra money which, for example, in the strategic health authority in which his constituency is situated, has meant more than 6,000 more nurses, 800 more doctors and over 1,000 more consultants; and for treatment for the patients, all the waiting times, out-patient and in-patient, have come down dramatically. But all health trusts will have to live within their means. That is so, irrespective of the amount of money that we put in. It is important that health authorities and the trusts take the decisions that are necessary to put our health service on a sustainable basis. That sustainable basis is one where waiting times will continue to fall and treatment will continue to improve.</p>

In accident and emergency departments, which we were discussing a moment or two ago, I think that most people would say, never mind even on a statistical basis, that they are considerably improved from where they were a few years ago.

<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="06070578000184"><a name="60705-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="06070578002697"><b>The Secretary of State for Health (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</b>
 In the White Paper &#147;Our health, our care, our say:  a new direction for community services&#148;, published in January, we outlined our proposals to create a new generation of community hospitals and services. Today I am announcing that we will make available up to  &#163;750 million of public capital investment to realise that vision, and I am publishing guidance on how primary care trusts can access the money. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library, and copies are available from the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06070578000185">Developments in medical technology and clinical practice are making it possible to provide far more care in local communities, closer to where people live, and even in people&#146;s own homes. During the unprecedented public consultation for &#147;Our health, our care, our say&#148;, people made it clear that, whenever it is safe and effective, they want more convenient, local and personal services, with more consultations, diagnostic tests and treatments in local facilities. Moving more services out of acute hospitals and into communities will help to improve care for patients, and will deliver better value for money for taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06070578000186">We are already making a major investment in GPs&#146; premises and health and care centres, as well as in community hospitals. A billion pounds of capital has been invested through the NHS local improvement finance trusts alone. We will now take the next step by making up to &#163;150 million of capital available in each of the next five years, starting this year&#151;a total of up to &#163;750 million&#151;for the development of a new generation of community hospitals and services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06070578000187">The investment capital will be available to PCTs for a wide range of community schemes, including the redevelopment of some existing cottage hospitals. Services could include in-patient and out-patient facilities, diagnostic tests, specialist clinics, minor surgery, health and social care services for people with long-term conditions, dentistry, rehabilitation and palliative care and other services. For people who are seriously ill or injured, or people needing complex treatments, care will of course remain in acute hospitals, where patients can be treated by specialist teams using the most advanced technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000188">PCTs that want to use the new investment capital will need to engage fully with local people to ensure that services are truly designed for the needs of patients and users. They will also be expected to work closely with other local partners, including general practices and other NHS services, local councils, voluntary organisations and others in the independent sector, to develop effective plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06070578000189">I made it clear in the White Paper that decisions on the long-term future of existing community hospitals should not be made solely in response to short-term budgetary pressures that are not related to the viability of the community facility itself. I have asked strategic health authorities to assure themselves that all PCT proposals for changes to community hospitals are consistent with the long-term strategy of the White Paper: to move care closer to patients&#146; homes, and to ensure that local people have been properly consulted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06070578000190">Ultimately, however, changes in the configuration of local health care services in a particular area require local decision making. Primary care trusts, with their broad perspective across hospital, community and primary care, are best placed to make those decisions in consultation with local people and their SHAs. The new investment fund will make it easier for PCTs to establish the right services in the right places for the people whom they serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06070578000191">PCTs will be able to choose how they use the newly available capital, investing it simply as public capital, extending the scope of their local investment finance trust schemes or adopting a new approach: the community venture, a more flexible joint venture approach that will give a wider range of public, voluntary and private parties an opportunity to pool their skills, or indeed their investment, for the benefit of the local community. It will, however, be for PCTs to decide which model is adopted. Whichever one is chosen, PCTs will of course need to demonstrate that investment proposals are sustainable and can be funded over the longer term. As we said in the White Paper, we expect to see a strategic shift in how the NHS provides care, with a redirection of funding to support the provision of more convenient services in local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06070578000192">PCTs that already have advanced plans for community services, as many have, should submit them to their strategic health authorities by the end of September. For schemes that are ready to start in the next financial year, proposals should reach the health authorities by the end of December. After that, there will be a regular rolling programme managed through the SHAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06070578000193">This new programme builds on the unprecedented investment that we have already made in the NHS. It will help to ensure that there are even better services for patients, with better value for money, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="06070578000194"><a name="60705-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="06070578002698"><b>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b>
 I am, of course, grateful for advance sight of the Secretary of State&#146;s statement, although it has all been trailed in the press beforehand, as usual. The Secretary of State once again claims that she is the saviour of community hospitals. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> Well, Labour Ministers have been saying that for four years. The right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) said exactly the same thing in 2002. However, within recent months 80 community hospitals have been under threat of closure or partial closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06070578000195">In January, the Secretary of State said that community hospitals would be safeguarded by the White Paper. Why has that had so little positive effect? We discovered last week with the abortive notice in the <i> Official Journal of the European Union</i> that the Secretary of State&#146;s policy is not even understood in her own Department. As a result of the White Paper, we also know that her policy is not understood or not listened to across the NHS. Why are they simply ignoring her?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06070578000196">The threat to community hospitals is little diminished since January. For example, in Wiltshire, services have already been lost at Westbury and Bradford-upon-Avon hospitals, and there are threats to Warminster, Melksham and Trowbridge. The Secretary of State talked about the review process, but the  <br>

strategic health authority in Suffolk did the review process on proposals in the area and said that it would close Walnuttree hospital, St Leonards hospital, the Sage day hospital in Newmarket, Hartismere hospital, the Hayward day hospital in Ipswich and Bartlet hospital, and reduce services at Aldeburgh hospital. That is the result of the review process that that Secretary of State says will happen as a consequence of her White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06070578000197">The Secretary of State now offers a capital fund. In some circumstances, capital for rebuilding or refurbishment will be useful and I welcome that. However, can the Secretary of State explain what proportion of this fund will go into providing health centres&#151;her so-called polyclinics&#151;for GPs and out-patients, rather than existing community hospitals that continue to provide in-patient services? Last year the NHS had capital that it did not spend. The underspend on capital budgets by the NHS last year was &#163;1,165 million. The NHS has capital: it is overspending on revenue. PCTs are cutting revenue and contracts. Community hospitals are closing because their primary care trusts will not commission services from them, because of the revenue shortfall. Can the Secretary of State explain how a capital fund can be a solution to a revenue problem?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06070578000198">If the Secretary of State wanted to support community hospitals in the way they need it, she would ensure that the plan in the White Paper for unbundling the tariff happened now&#151;not in 2007-08. Will she do that? Will she also ensure that the tariff is split so that part of the payment for patients who are stepped down from the acute sector goes to the community hospitals where they are sent? Will she also confirm that decisions about community hospitals will be reviewed in the way that she describes and will be made specifically in consultation with, and with the agreement of&#151;if they offer it&#151;local GPs? In theory, from the end of this year, practice-based commissioning should mean that GPs decide where they want to commission services, but the PCTs are pre-empting that and closing services so that they will not be available for GPs to send patients to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06070578000199">The Secretary of State said that the fund would be available to the third sector, including charities. I hope that the whole range of charities and voluntary organisations will be able to bid. She mentioned community organisations and I hope that she will make it clear that local private sector and voluntary partnerships can work with GPs to take over community hospitals. Many such hospitals used to be locally owned, because they were established through public subscription. Will the Secretary of State ensure that the assets can be transferred to the third sector and out of the NHS, at a high discount, so that they can be owned and supported locally? That will be as important as the ability to bid on the fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06070578000200">No one can say that health care provision will not change. Care closer to home is a legitimate objective and has been for many years; that is what community hospitals offer. I know from my special interest in strokes that that is precisely what community hospitals can do; that kind of intermediate care bed is exactly what people need to step down at an early stage from an acute hospital. Under this Government, the number of such beds increased between 2002 and 2004-05, but they are now being shut down. There is a complete reversal of approach by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06070578000201">Why? Because community hospitals are being caught in a financial squeeze between rising costs in the acute sector and the cost of meeting GP contracts. We told the Secretary of State last year&#151;she admitted it in January&#151;that short-term financial pressures are forcing decisions that are contrary to the long-term interests of the NHS. Unfortunately, that is still happening and she needs to take more measures to stop it. She must give community hospitals the chance to prove their worth and GPs the chance to decide where patients are treated, and she must tell the House why the promises made in January have yet to be fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para16"><a name="06070578000202">The Secretary of State did not have the boldness to tell the House today what she told the <i> Sunday Express</i> last Sunday when she said:</p>

I know what is happening in my own constituency, where services and wards are being shut at Brookfields community hospital in Cambridge; the young people&#146;s mental health service is being shut down and the PCT is refusing to fund the hospice at home service. That is what is happening on Planet Earth. The Secretary of State should come back to Planet Earth and resolve those problems for community hospitals.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for a reply that was somewhat longer than my initial statement&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;No, it wasn&#146;t.&#148;] Indeed, it was&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] The Leader of the House was counting and I shall rely on him in the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06070578000205">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire  (Mr. Lansley) talked as though no new community hospitals and facilities had been opened under our Government, but thanks to the investment that we have been making, which Opposition Members voted against, new community hospitals have been opening in recent years; for instance, Withington hospital in south Manchester, Prospect Park in Berkshire, which I visited last week and which offers superb intermediate care, the new community hospitals in Edgware and Willesden and many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06070578000206">It is absurd of the hon. Gentleman to imply, as I think he is trying to do, that every one of the existing community hospitals is fit for a modern health service. The reality is that many are not. We have many existing cottage and community hospitals where, despite the absolute dedication of the staff, they are struggling with Victorian workhouse facilities that are wholly unsuitable in a modern health service. In some cases&#151;</p>

 Let me give the hon. Gentleman the example of Norwich, which I visited a couple of weeks ago, where the local director of community services and his staff explained that they had had too many community hospitals and too many community hospital beds. They have reorganised services and closed two community hospitals, taken beds from a third and put the services into a new facility in an  <br>

existing hospital. They have put more staff into the community, so they are looking after more patients in their own homes, as well as in the community hospital. They are giving patients better care, the staff have greater job satisfaction and they are saving money that can be invested in other services. That is precisely what the NHS in Suffolk, Norfolk, Gloucestershire, Surrey, and many other parts of the country that have been overspending, needs to do to provide better services for patients, with more modern, but quite possibly fewer, community hospital facilities and more services delivered to people in their own communities, all of it fit for patients in the modern world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06070578000209">The hon. Gentleman asked how a capital fund would help deal with revenue shortfalls or overspending in some parts of the country. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet NHS colleagues, my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) and people from the wider Yorkshire area. Their primary care trust has financial problems, but they are clear that, by reorganising services that are currently spread across three or four NHS and local council sites and putting them into one new community hospital, enabled by our new capital fund for which they will bid, they will be able to give patients better services closer to home and save the money that they need to save to live within their very substantially increased means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para21"><a name="06070578000210">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned unbundling the tariff. Let me restate our commitment to unbundling the tariff: we are working on that, and we will introduce a pilot next year. But it is already perfectly possible for PCTs to contract outside the tariff, thereby perhaps getting better value for money for the community services that they need. In any good consultation on new community services and hospitals, GPs will already be involved; they have to be involved, of course, particularly in anticipation of practice-based commissioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para22"><a name="06070578000211">The full range of partners certainly includes the private sector. For instance, it delivers MRI scans in Withington community hospital in south Manchester, which has brought down the waiting time for such scans from months in some cases to just two weeks for most patients, with the report delivered to the GP 48 hours later. That is a superb service. The future of community hospitals can also certainly include the transfer of assets, where that is appropriate and agreed by the local NHS, to a local community charitable trust. That is precisely what is happening with the Wells-on-Sea community facility, which was proposed for closure, but which will now house community facilities. Through such organisations, the voluntary sector and the local community has an enormously important role to play in modern community hospitals. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="60705-0004.htm_para23"><a name="06070578000212">The hon. Gentleman ended his speech by scorning the idea of more convenient medical services. The reality is that, with modern medical technology, it is now possible to offer, for instance, some chemotherapy services for cancer patients not only in a community hospital or health and care centre, but in their own home, which is far more convenient and much better for such patients. Renal dialysis provides another good example of that. Thanks to the investment that we are making in the NHS, this capital fund will enable that new generation of services to be provided to our patients.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, for whom I have considerable respect, is talking rubbish today. Whether the local NHS decides to close certain community facilities because they are no longer the right ones for local people, or to open new or refurbished facilities because they are the right ones for local people, should be local decisions. What I, as Secretary of State, am doing is ensuring that the support is in place for such local decisions, and in particular that the capital investment is in place, which many parts of the NHS have told us that they need so that they can reorganise their services&#151;sometimes their existing cottage and community hospitals&#151;in order to give better services to patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="60705-0005.htm_para2"><a name="06070578000222">The hon. Gentleman needs to focus on the services that are being delivered to patients, rather than on the number of buildings or beds, because not only in respect of acute hospitals, but also of some community hospitals, it is better for many patients if community services are taken into their own homes. That was precisely the point that the excellent nursing and care team in the Norwich community hospital made to me: by reducing the number of beds and putting half of the staff into the community, they were able to give intermediate and rehabilitation care to more patients, some of them in the community hospital, and others looked after by community staff in their own homes. Moreover, they had reduced emergency admissions to the acute hospital by more than 600 in the past six months, thus enabling savings of money that can then be reinvested in better care. That is what the hon. Gentleman needs to look at.</p>

The test in all of this, which I invite the hon. Gentleman to support, is to get the best services for patients with the best value for patients and for public money.</p>

 There is, of course, an extremely difficult situation in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency in the wider health community. Unfortunately, there are serious deficits resulting from overspending, and the local NHS is having to consider some difficult options, to see how it can continue to offer the best possible services to people within the substantially increased budgets that we have given it. Indeed, other parts of the region are having to hold back on their own spending to compensate for that overspending while the problems there are sorted out.

 I think that if the right hon. Gentleman looks at the figures, he will find that large numbers of community and cottage hospitals closed in the years when his party was in government. He will also find that at least as many new community hospitals have been opened as have closed in the years of our Government. As for funding, he is right to say that the tariffs that we pay hospitals for acute services do, depending on the operation concerned, include an element of rehabilitation, although often not the full costs of rehabilitation. That is one of the reasons we are working on unbundling the budget, but even within the current system primary care trusts have considerable flexibility. A large part of NHS funding is not spent on acute services to which the tariff applies, and can be used outside the tariff with all the flexibility that primary care trusts need to deliver services within community hospitals and other community settings.</p>

This is not about saying, &#147;Let&#146;s keep everything as it is,&#148; in particular district general hospitals. It is about looking at which services can be better delivered&#151;better for patients, that is&#151;within the community closer to home, and which services, because of their medical complexity, need to be delivered in a regional or even national specialist centre. Where the issue about critical mass relates to the provision of an essential service&#151;particularly accident and emergency&#151;it is the responsibility of the primary care trust and the strategic health authority to make sure that the essential service is not threatened and that the right relationship continues between the accident and emergency service and, particularly, orthopaedics and trauma services.</p>

 The hon.

He said that it was proposed to remove 15 out of the 45 beds. I am not aware of the detailed situation, but I know that in many parts of the country, community nursing and therapy teams have found that by reducing the number of in-patient beds, staff can support more patients who need, for instance, rehabilitation support within their own home. That model is already working well in Berkshire, Norwich, Dudley and many other places. That may well be precisely the logic that the local NHS is applying in Potters Bar. I think that I also heard the hon. Gentleman say that although those beds are closing, other services will be provided in that part of the building. On the face of it, without knowing the details, that sounds exactly like the flexible use of community facilities, responding to changing patient needs and changing medical technology, that the local NHS should be engaging in as it continues to get the best possible services with the best value for money.</p>

 It is simply untrue to say that the NHS or the Government ignore local consultation. I refer to the recent consultations that we had on the reconfiguration of primary care trusts, where a number of options went out for consultation and decisions were made in the light of that local consultation. The overview and scrutiny committees of local councils have an increasingly important role to play in ensuring that local consultations held by the NHS on reconfiguring services are genuine, and that the outcome is satisfactory for local people. If an overview and scrutiny committee is dissatisfied with the way in which the NHS has conducted the consultation, it has the power to refer the matter to me. Obviously, I look at each of those cases extremely carefully, and where I think it right to do so, I refer them to the independent review panel for its advice. However, I stress again that those decisions are best made locally wherever possible. I hope that in the hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for coming to see me yesterday to discuss that, and bringing NHS colleagues who described the possibilities for a new community hospital in Selby. The thinking behind the community venture model is that it would allow not simply a public-private partnership on the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;model, but a much more flexible partnership between the NHS, other public service partners, such as, for instance, the local council, and the voluntary sector, as well as, potentially, the private sector. That would focus not just on a building, which is really what the LIFT partnership is about, but on the services that need to be provided both in a community hospital building and in other settings such as GP practices, health centres and patients&#146; own homes.</p>

 The proposals for Epsom involve the development of a smaller critical care hospital surrounded by&#151;I think&#151;nine community hospitals or health care centre settings. More care will thus be delivered closer to patients&#146; homes, which will be much more convenient for them, but critical care and complex acute cases will be located in one specialist hospital facility. There has been wide consultation on that model of care, and it got widespread public support. The issue is not cuts in funding&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman suggested something of that kind&#151;but the way in which the unprecedented sums that we are investing in the NHS, which will continue to grow by 9 per cent. this year and next year, are used to best effect for the local population, and how we ensure that when there is overspending, the NHS in the area comes back into financial balance and does not expect other parts of the country to go on bailing it out.</p>

 A little girl born this morning in the middle of the most deprived ward in my constituency will live 14 years less than a little girl born this morning in Wollaton, the prosperous ward next door. It will not surprise the Secretary of State to know which ward has a mega regional hospital, and which has no community hospital or facilities whatever. In that context, will she consider entertaining bids not merely from the local PCT, but from the collective local strategic partnership&#151;such partnerships exist in each of the major cities in the UK&#151;so that we can move forward a lot more quickly? One of the most difficult points that was raised with me this morning when I tested the idea locally was anxiety about having private finance initiative-related schemes, or LIFT-related schemes, because of their long-term expense. Will she consider bids and offers from organisations other than PCTs, with a broader financial base?</p>

 Yes, we certainly would consider such bids. My hon. Friend is doing outstanding work as chair of his local strategic partnership, so I thank him for that. The community venture model to which I referred earlier is precisely suited to a bid from a partnership of the kind that he describes. Capital investment could come from a variety of places, thus reducing the revenue implications for the NHS in future years. The model is good and it will help to address some of the shocking health inequalities that persist in our country, which are why we are determined to insist on fair funding for different parts of the country with different health care needs.</p>

 Two in-bed units at Doddington community hospital in my constituency have already closed recently, in the teeth of opposition from GPs and the total opposition of local people. What price the much-vaunted boast of listening to local opinion, I ask myself. Does the Secretary of State agree that if GP practice-based commissioning is to mean anything at all, GPs should have a crucial say in what services are provided in their local community hospitals?</p>

<p><a name="st_o139"><a name="06070578000258"><a name="60705-0006.htm_spnew5"><a name="06070578002739"><b>Ms Hewitt:</b>
 As I said earlier, it is absolutely essential that local people are consulted. In many parts of the country, those consultations, which often take place on very difficult issues, have been extremely well led and conducted by primary care trusts, and they often lead to a solution being found that is better than the original options put forward. It is important that that happens and that GPs are closely involved. GPs who are closest to their patients are superbly qualified to act as not only advocates for those patients, but experts on redesigning services and bringing them closer to home. If services are redesigned they will change, so, for example, there might be fewer beds in some places and more in others. The reconfiguration of services, difficult and unpopular though it sometimes is, is part and parcel of creating the best possible modern health care service, so I would hope that the hon. Gentleman would support that.</p>

 I warmly welcome the additional money that the Secretary of State has announced and congratulate her on her victory over the Treasury in securing it. How will it affect the pathway project in Leicester? As she knows, that project will be downsized by &#163;200 million and the downsizing will fall primarily on the hospital in my constituency, Leicester general. Will the reorganised PCT be able to apply for money from this fund to deal with any of the facilities and services that it will not be able to provide because of the reduction in funds for pathway?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. The pathway project in our city is a PFI project. At the moment, there is no reason at all why it should not continue under the private finance initiative. As he and I heard recently from a hospital chief executive, the aim is to provide far better services for patients from Leicester and Leicestershire with all the facilities in the original proposal, but with better value for money, so that the local NHS does not find itself in financial difficulties in future years. It will certainly be possible for the PCT to examine whether the new fund would also assist in improving community facilities, but whether it uses the new capital fund or PFI, one test, of course, is that the services and buildings must be financially sustainable for many years to come.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is, unfortunately, overspending in the NHS in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire. That must be dealt with because it is taking place despite the fact that there is more money than ever before and more growth money is coming in future years. Of course the NHS in his constituency is examining how it can reorganise services. I described earlier the situation in Norwich, where by reducing beds in some facilities and closing two of the older community hospitals, better services are being provided for patients and financial savings are being made that can be reinvested in other services. It seems to me that that is precisely what the hon. Gentleman should be supporting and expecting from his local NHS. The capital will help when what is needed is a reorganisation of services, perhaps across different facilities, the modernisation of existing old buildings, or the creation of a completely new facility that would, for example, allow services to be taken out of the acute hospital and provided more effectively, with better value for money, in the new facility. Although the capital cannot be used simply to cover overspending on the revenue account, it can certainly be used to support a reorganisation of services that will be more cost-efficient and thus help to deal with financial problems.</p>

 Given the turmoil being caused in south-west Kent by the threat to services at Sevenoaks hospital, Edenbridge hospital and Tonbridge hospital, and the fact that the Secretary of State is now allowing a year for primary care trusts to submit bids for the new capital, would it not have been more sensible to have announced a moratorium on any further closures until all the bids had been received and evaluated and the tariffs had been sorted out?</p>

 No, I do not accept that at all. There are circumstances where it is clear that the local NHS has too many community hospitals or that some such hospitals are based in outdated buildings that no amount of capital can sensibly be expected to modernise. There may be too many beds in some community hospitals, or perhaps more staff could be working to support more patients in their own homes. Those are judgments that the local NHS needs to make&#151;particularly, but not only, in view of current financial difficulties. The White Paper at the beginning of January set out a very clear strategic direction, which we have reinforced with PCTs and strategic health authorities. The new capital fund will meet many of the requests for capital support that PCTs have put to us. Contrary to the repeated assertions of Opposition Members that we have had nothing but closures of community hospitals, the Community Hospitals Association has confirmed that for  every closure in recent years, a new hospital has  been opened.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I draw a matter to your attention and seek your advice? On 4 July,  I received a written answer from the Home Office in response to a question that I had tabled on 30 March. My first point is that that is lamentably slow. Secondly, if one looks at the content of the answer, there are good grounds for concern. My question was:</p>

Furthermore, what on earth does the expression &#147;disproportionate cost&#148;&#151;it keeps being thrown back at us&#151;mean? It is entirely subjective.

I do not wish to question your ruling in any respect,  Mr. Speaker, or to seek in any way to open up the subject matter of that question. However, as I thought about what happened, I saw something that seemed to me to be new, as I had not encountered it during my 19 years in the House. I sensed two separate issues: one was the code of conduct for MPs; the other was the ministerial code. While I entirely accept your ruling, Mr. Speaker, it raised an approach that I have not come across, as I said, in my 19 years. Would you be willing to reflect on my points and decide whether it would be appropriate to provide some general guidance on how we should or should not approach Question Time in the light of what happened today?</p>

We must recognise that every hon. Member is entitled to natural justice, which means that when Members put a matter before the Parliamentary Commissioner, they should leave it with him. Until such time as the commissioner reports back, it is inappropriate to raise the matter with the Prime Minister or any other Minister. We should bear it in mind that the question put to the Prime Minister was about a specific Minister&#151;the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;and that there is nothing to stop any Member raising with the Prime Minister general matters relating to ministerial conduct or the conduct of an hon.

It also requires the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to ensure that such reductions in energy usage are not at the expense of higher carbon intensity in the resulting energy use.</p>

We are all aware of the pressing need to take action on climate change. The most effective way to reduce emissions from energy use that contribute to climate change is to use less energy, and to use what we do more efficiently.

Its conclusion was that, even taking into account the additional measures announced in the updated climate change programme, UK CO2 emissions would reduce by only 14 per cent., compared with 1990 levels, by 2010.

highly electricity intensive&#151;electricity has an especially high carbon footprint. According to February&#146;s Department of Trade and Industry projections, if no new policy measures are introduced to tackle energy demand in the commercial and public services sector, its use of electricity is projected to soar by a staggering 45 per cent. from 1990 to 2020.</p>

The Bill simply requires the Government to take reasonable steps to achieve the reductions in energy usage in the commercial and public services sector that they have already described as cost-effective and practicable. For 2010, that means a reduction in energy usage of at least 10 per cent. compared with 2005, and a further reduction in energy usage of 10 per cent. below 2010 levels.</p>

 Clause 19 provides for a change in the VAT accounting provisions for sales of specific goods to tackle missing trader intra-community fraud. That fraud is an organised criminal attack on the VAT system, which, in 2004-05, is estimated to have cost up to &#163;1.9 billion in stolen VAT.</p>

When the reverse charge applies, it is no longer the seller&#146;s responsibility to account for and pay the VAT on the sale to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, but that of the customer. Subsection (13) of new section 55A, which clause 19 introduces, of the VAT Act 1994 provides for amendments to be made to that Act by Treasury order where it is necessary and expedient for the reverse charge.</p>

We have to make sure that there is the minimum impact, particularly regulatory impact, on businesses generally. The reporting requirement should be kept to an absolute minimum. The provisions will need to take into account consultation on those elements. Thus far businesses have been totally supportive of the Government&#146;s actions&#151;they have been consulted&#151;because they are well aware of the dangers that such fraud poses not only to the Revenue, but to their activities as legitimate businesses that can be undermined by fraud.</p>

We debated the issue at some length in the Standing Committee on 11 May, and I do not intend to reprise the whole debate on the Floor of the House, but there are a few points that need to be reiterated in debating these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para17"><a name="06070578000316">The problem of MTIC fraud has become so widespread that the Office for National Statistics now adjusts UK trade figures to take into account estimates of MTIC fraud. As the ONS points out, by definition the extent of such fraud is difficult to measure accurately. However, HMRC, in a press release dated 26 January 2006, estimated UK VAT losses from MTIC fraud to be between  &#163;1.1 billion and &#163;1.9 billion for 2004-05. It is interesting that the Paymaster General used the &#163;1.9 billion figure a few moments ago. In April 2006 the Government announced the first annual fall in VAT revenues since the UK started collecting the tax in 1973, largely because of a significant rise in estimated carousel fraud, which is a particular breed of MTIC fraud.</p>

To clear up the confusion, will the Paymaster General tell the House the latest Government estimate of the scale of MTIC fraud and its cost to the Exchequer?

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06070578000324">The Government&#146;s solution to the problem, as set out in clause 19, is essentially to introduce a so-called reverse charge procedure for certain categories of goods that can be specified by secondary legislation. This is intended to combat fraud by passing the duty to account to the Government for the VAT further down the chain to legitimate businesses. As the HMRC press release of 26 January 2006, which outlines the process, explained:</p>
<a name="60705-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="06070578002462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Under the reverse charge procedure the suppliers of the goods do not account for VAT on their sales when selling to other VAT-registered businesses. Instead, it is the responsibility of the purchaser of the goods to account for the VAT, although they can recover this VAT in the normal way.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para22"><a name="06070578000325">This means that HMRC is not put into a position where it may have to make repayments of VAT where the corresponding tax on the purchase has not been paid to HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para23"><a name="06070578000326">A similar procedure was adopted some years ago to combat missing trader fraud in the gold bullion market, apparently with some success, and the intention is essentially to apply the same solution here. However, the Government&#146;s solution, including that which is set out in the amendments, depends on the Government obtaining a derogation from the sixth VAT directive in order to apply the reverse charge in situations where it was not originally envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para24"><a name="06070578000327">On 1 June, a little while after our debate on these matters in Standing Committee, the<i>  Financial Times</i> reported that the EU tax commissioner, Mr. Lazlo Kovacs, was saying that the UK would most probably receive a positive response to the derogation request. On 7 June, there was an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels, which was rather famously attended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at short notice. Was the matter discussed there? As we return to the subject on Report, which I welcome, I take the opportunity to ask the Paymaster General to update the House on progress in seeking the derogation that is necessary for the procedure to come into effect. In essence, what is the latest state of play in our negotiations with the Commission on this matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para25"><a name="06070578000328">Similarly, when do Ministers anticipate that they will be in a position to issue the orders to implement this element of the strategy? I repeat the question that I put to the Paymaster General in Standing Committee on this issue, which she really did not address at that time. Given the history of our negotiations with our EU partners in recent years, what is our plan B if, for any reason, the derogation is not granted? Given the scale of the problem, what do the Government intend to do then?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para26"><a name="06070578000329">I come now to Government amendments Nos. 18 to 20. As I understand it, the essence of amendment No. 20 is to confer a regulation-making power on Ministers to set out reporting requirements on suppliers in relation to the operation of the reverse charge. Amendment No. 19 appears to be essentially contingent on amendment No. 20, in that it allows for a penalty regime if reporting requirements are not complied with correctly as specified by Ministers in the regulations. This seems reasonable, but why was the provision not included in the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para27"><a name="06070578000330">Conversely, amendment No. 18 confers on Ministers a relatively wide-ranging regulation-making power in the context of the operation of the reverse charge procedure as a whole.

Government amendments&#151;can the Government give us any examples of how the power is likely to be used in practice without tipping off the fraudsters? For instance, will the power be used only to specify the types of goods to which the reverse charge procedure will apply, or is it intended to be used more widely than that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="60705-0007.htm_para28"><a name="06070578000331">Given the scale of the power, I had intended to ask the Paymaster General whether it would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), in his usual perspicacious manner, has already elicited that information in an intervention.

 I have only a few brief remarks. We dealt with the matter in some detail in Standing Committee. We are dealing with what is clearly a significant problem and real efforts have been made in various clauses to overcome it. The Government&#146;s amendments are an exposition of that. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 seek to overcome openings where there could continue to be fraud, and amendment No. 18 confers extra powers, so essentially we are talking about regulation and reporting requirements.</p>

Surely their desire to get around them will be exactly the same. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The Paymaster General is saying &#147;Time&#148;, but presumably once they are on the statute book, the fraudsters will still have time to avoid the regulations.</p>

to be used, those who study them have time to get round the regulations before the authorities can use the powers that are conferred in them. That is the difficulty. That is why there has not been a long exposure of what the powers may look like. This is straightforward, really.</p>

 I thank the Paymaster General for that clarification. There is a development beyond the regulations and reporting requirements that are set out in the amendments. If the requirements are to be enforced, they need to be supported by resources. I refer to an article in <i> The Times</i> of 13 June, in which it is said that there are believed to be 9,000 people involved in spearheading the crime that is known as missing trader intra-community fraud, but Revenue and Customs has only 500 officers to tackle it. The article points to a lack of resources making very difficult the enforcement of whatever regulations are in place to overcome this fraud. In fact, the article goes on to say:</p>
<a name="60705-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="06070578002464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is even a suggestion that fraudsters believe the risk of detection is so low that they no longer trade actual goods but engage in a &#145;virtual&#146; fraud where the trade exists only in the bogus documents used to support fraudulent VAT reclaims.&#148;</p>

 I should like to touch on three issues relating to MTIC fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000341">First, in Committee, the Paymaster General said that the German Government advocated applying the reverse charge generally, but she rightly said that that would create great difficulties for small and medium-sized companies, and was thus unattractive. It has been said, too, that there would be substantial fiscal consequences if we went down that route. Can the Paymaster General confirm whether that is correct? More significantly, I seek reassurance that the reverse charge approach will be neither generally applied nor negotiated away, although one member state is keen to go down that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06070578000342">Secondly, I am concerned about the effectiveness of an approach that requires a reverse charge on certain goods. In Committee, the Paymaster General said at column 135 on 11 May that</p>
<a name="60705-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="06070578002465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;90 per cent. of...losses from MTIC fraud arise from goods that would be targeted specifically under the reverse charge mechanism&#148;.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06070578000344">I should be grateful if the Paymaster General, drawing on the expertise of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, clarified that response. Is MTIC fraud a matter of small, high-value goods being circulated&#151;there is, however, a missing trader, so there is VAT fraud&#151;or is it a matter, as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) suggested, of virtual transactions in which goods are not circulated at all? If it is the latter, it would be easy for fraudsters to move from the small, high-value goods to which the measures apply to other goods and services, so the Bill&#146;s provisions would not be as effective as we would all like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06070578000345">Thirdly, the Government have attempted to reduce MTIC fraud by toughening the VAT registration process&#151;the Paymaster General will recall that I asked a question about that in Committee. Since then, I have tabled written questions on the issue, and I understand that, in the spring months, only 65 per cent. of VAT registration applications were completed within the target 21 days. Can steps be taken to improve and speed up the VAT registration, because it is worrying that it takes a substantial period to register? Complaints about registration come not just from applicants in the high-risk sector of small, high-value goods such as computer equipment and so on but from other sectors. Again, I would be grateful for the Paymaster General&#146;s comments.</p>

 I shall deal quickly with the points made by hon. Members. May I tell the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) that the Government are confident that the European Commission will introduce a proposal in response to our request for a reverse charge? Discussion is under way&#151;hence the amendments&#151;but the proposal will be submitted to ECOFIN for a unanimous decision by the 25 member states. The Commission will not submit it before it is satisfied that there is a sensible working arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06070578000347">That links to the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke). We are confident that we will secure agreement, because this is a matter not just for the UK but for all European member states&#151;indeed, Germany has been mentioned, and its preferred option is a general reverse charge. However, that would cause reporting problems for small businesses and people who are not involved in illegitimate activity, and would completely change the structure and orientation of VAT. The Commission is aware that the problem is urgent and that we need to find a solution. The UK and other member states understand why the Germans want a complete reverse charge, but have made it clear that that is not desirable. We are doing all that we can to ensure a speedy solution, but we must reach the right agreement with the Commission and, after discussions, we must be able to deliver it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06070578000348">May I remind the House of the nature of the powers that are being sought? The provision allows only amendments necessary for the implementation of the reverse charge, and it cannot be used to increase anything else, including the amount of tax payable. As I have said, it is subject to affirmative resolution. It is not an open-ended power&#151;it is necessary purely for the implementation of the reverse charge&#151;so it will lapse three years after Budget 2006. The Conservative Government introduced a similar power in 1993, but it lacked a sunset clause. I believe, however, that a time limit is necessary to ensure that we tackle the issue properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06070578000349">I have dealt with the hon. Member for Rayleigh&#146;s points about the extent of MTIC fraud. The latest estimates for 2004-05 cover a range of figures, and  &#163;1.9 billion is at the top end. However, that represents  a 30 per cent. reduction in MTIC fraud since 2001-02 as a result of the Government&#146;s strategy. We have to wait for the pre-Budget report, even in subsequent years,  <br>

because we require data from European Union member states on the nature of such fraud, which take five or six months to be processed, hence the PBR is an appropriate point for an update.</p>

<p><a name="st_o177"><a name="06070578000350"><a name="60705-0008.htm_spnew5"><a name="06070578002777"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 I thank the right hon. Lady for her explanation of the timings. She said that the figures cover a range, and that we will be given an updated estimate in the autumn 2006 PBR. Given her knowledge of HMRC, does she think that by that stage the figure will rise above &#163;1.9 billion, or will it fall below it?</p>

 I am not in a position to make such a forecast, but the hon. Gentleman will accept that the purpose of the reverse charge is to disrupt the fraudsters. VAT registration and repayment are subject to challenge by HMRC. It will be difficult to assess the strategy that is running in parallel&#151;plan B, as the hon. Gentleman put it&#151;because we hope that HMRC will not need to make those challenges in the first place. People may try to defraud, but our intention is that they should not be successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06070578000352">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne asked about resources. I refer her to column 1090W of the <i> Official Report</i> of 17 May, where I gave the full list to her hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), showing the extra resources and the work that is being undertaken by HMRC. I also gave the figures in Committee. Hon. Members should be cautious about believing what is written in the newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06070578000353">On the question about VAT registration&#151;whether the transaction is fictitious or real and how the Government are dealing with it&#151;the answer is that it can be fictitious, as is increasingly the case, or real. The real is dealt with in the Bill by the stamping of goods, tracking and record keeping, which is the subject of other clauses. That will be effective where there is fraud in the chain, as opposed to the whole chain being fraudulent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para13"><a name="06070578000354">There is the fictitious as well, and I shall give two examples. In August 2005 four people were found guilty of carousel fraud resulting in an estimated loss of &#163;40 million in VAT. They used fictitious companies and false invoices, with the proceeds being sent to a Hong Kong bank account. They received sentences of 22 years. In December 2005 jail sentences totalling eight years were handed down to two men involved in a &#163;58 million fraud. The fraud involved mobile phones purchased from fictitious companies and sold to other mobile phone brokers. The phones never found their way into the legitimate market. It was a perpetual fraud, and the reverse charge is specifically directed at that aspect of carousel fraud. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire is right that we need to look carefully at whether that might mutate into other high value goods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06070578000355">Part of the discussion with the Commission is about what measures will be available to member states to counter such fraud. We need a careful balance so that there is not a reverse charge on all goods. Intelligence and an understanding of how MTIC frauds are perpetrated are needed. There will not be a general tightening of VAT registration. The Department is undertaking rigorous checks at the point of registration where it seems that something is not quite as it should be&#151;missing information  <br>

or a company that has been dormant for a long time suddenly submitting a high claim on VAT or seeking to become active again. Bogus businesses must be prevented from entering the VAT system, so the Department is doing its best to target those checks. If there was a general holding up of VAT registration, the numbers that I gave would have been considerably higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="60705-0008.htm_para27"><a name="06070578000372">We should remember that UK companies claiming group relief on UK losses have up until two years after the end of the accounting period in which those losses are incurred to make a claim. One might ask why they need two years. I suspect that there is no scientific reason for that, but it enables groups to go through the necessary steps. It enables them to draw up the accounts of subsidiaries and determine the scale of any losses incurred. It enables them to revise accounting estimates, and to assess the write-down in the value of assets, such as stock and debtors; and it allows the parent company to calculate the extent to which losses can be carried back against profits made in earlier years. The auditors can audit the accounts, and any adjustments between accounting and taxable profits or losses can be made. Companies need to go through a drawn-out process to assess such profits, to ensure that the auditors have signed off such profits and to calculate taxes and profits properly.</p>

I have worked as an auditor and with companies in preparing their accounts, so I understand why the exercise is not straightforward or quick. My problem with the way in which the Government have introduced the Marks and Spencer judgment in schedule 1 is that without a gap between the year-end and the filing of the claim it would be virtually impossible for any business to submit a robust claim that would withstand scrutiny from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I hope that the Treasury will acknowledge that the process of making a group relief claim is not straightforward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para1"><a name="06070578000374">The Marks and Spencer judgment, which involves a company making a group relief claim in relation to losses incurred in another EEA country, adds a further layer of complexity. Where there is any prospect of losses incurred in EEA territory being carried forward against profits, the losses cannot be claimed, so a business will have to have made decisions about the future of that loss-making company&#151;it may have had to close it during the course of the year, or it may plan to close it down in the next accounting period.</p>

More time will be required for businesses to make those claims, a more thorough investigation will be required and the process will be longer. One cannot simply press a button in an overseas territory at the end of the financial year and produce perfectly formed accounts and a group relief claim.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is the accountant, not me, but he may have misread the provision that he seeks to amend.

Amendment No. 122 refers to the filing of the claim part of the process, whereas I read paragraph 7(4) as dealing with the end of the current period, when the picture is taken&#151;as he has said, the figures are put together afterwards through a long process.

 We debated that point in Standing Committee, where I felt that the Government shared my interpretation of when the claim would be made, so it would be welcome if the Economic Secretary were to clarify the position. The message that I have received in talking to advisers in the field is that the timing of the claim is so tight that it renders impossible the making of a group relief claim. A number of people involved in the area are concerned that the time for making a claim is so tight that it renders a group relief claim practically impossible. The consensus in the sector is widespread, but if the Economic Secretary were to reassure the accountancy profession and business, that would be welcome. The situation is not clear at the moment in the eyes of companies and their tax advisers, which is one reason why the amendment was tabled today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000379">In his judgment, Mr. Justice Park considered the timing of the claim and examined various possibilities. It is important that companies can make such claims and that the right conferred upon them by the ECJ judgment is not rendered impossible to exercise in practice, which is why we have re-introduced the amendment on Report. I was concerned that the answer given by the Financial Secretary in Committee did not address the issue properly, and I want to use the debate on Report to clarify the matter for the sake of those who must implement the provision.</p>

 I hope that I can provide the reassurance sought by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and those whom he has consulted in recent weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para4"><a name="06070578000381">I have re-read the <i> Hansard </i>of the debate in Committee, where<i> </i>we had an interesting and wide-ranging discussion about the role of the ECJ and European decision making in UK tax law and considered the almost philosophical issues around tax policy. However, the hon. Gentleman has raised some particular points, which I shall address in a particular way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06070578000382">As the hon. Gentleman has said, clause 27 and schedule 1 provide for a small extension to the group loss relief rules for companies. That extension allows UK groups to claim corporation tax relief for foreign losses in very limited circumstances. Existing group relief rules for UK losses, including the timing period, which business is keen to retain, are unaffected by the proposed legislation. We are introducing this small extension to group relief following last December&#146;s judgment of the ECJ in the case of Marks and Spencer plc <i> v.</i> Halsey, which set the conditions under which group relief should be extended to foreign losses. Those conditions are very restrictive, which was the intention. Indeed, the way in which members of the European judiciary reflected legal opinions made it clear that the conditions are to be applied in extremely restricted circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06070578000383">Amendments Nos. 15 and 122 go beyond the judgment and relax one of the conditions under which extended group relief is available. The condition is that to be eligible for relief in the UK, there must be no possibility of relieving a loss in a future period in another state. The amendments would change the date by reference to which companies determine whether that possibility exists. The reference date is currently   <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 852</b><br>
immediately after the end of the loss period, but amendment No. 15 would change that to the date on which the group relief claim is made by a UK company. Amendment No. 122 would change the reference date to the earlier of two years after the end of the accounting period or the deadline for filing corporate tax returns of the foreign loss-making company, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06070578000384">On amendment No. 15, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) has said, there is no logic in tying the test of possibility of relief to the rules that apply in respect of claims, because the concepts are entirely separate. The claims rules apply to the claimant company, while the possibility of relief rule applies to the losses of the surrendering company, and there is no logic in trying to create an entirely forced link between the two. We are talking about the definition of the loss period and the point at which the decision is made; we are not talking about the timing of the claim. The claimant company will still have at least two years to claim relief, which exactly mirrors the current relief rules for UK group relief. The difference is that at the time of the claim, the claimant company must look back to the date immediately after the loss period to see whether there is any possibility of relief at that time. As I have said, we are discussing the loss period, not the claim period.</p>

<p><a name="st_o185"><a name="06070578000385"><a name="60705-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="06070578002785"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 Does the Economic Secretary require the loss-making company fully to assess the quantity of its losses immediately after the end of the accounting period?</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="06070578000386"><a name="60705-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="06070578002786"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 As I have said, the company has a two-year period to make a claim. The issue is the date at which the losses from the foreign company are judged to be unrelievable in the foreign tax jurisdiction. Once that date is decided, there are two years in which to make the claim. We are in danger of confusing two different concepts&#151;the two-year claim period and the loss period, which relates to the tax year when the decision on unrelievability was made. There will still be two years for that assessment to be made and for the relief to be claimed back in the UK tax jurisdiction and against UK profits. The idea that an immediate assessment calculation will subsequently have to be delivered to the Revenue at a particular point in time is not in line with what we are seeking to do. The claimant company will have at least two years to claim relief, mirroring current rules for UK group relief. As I said, the difference is that at the time of the claim the claimant company must look back to the date immediately after the loss period to see whether there is any possibility of relief at that time. It is true that Mr. Justice Park decided in his High Court ruling that the relevant time was the date on which a claim was made by the UK-resident company. However, that is not a settled point; it is still subject to appeal. His judgment also considers past claims to group relief, whereby the current legislation sets out the rules that are to apply to claim periods after 1 April 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06070578000387">Amendment No. 15 would provide a fiscal and financial incentive to delay claims until the last possible minute. Moreover, since the ability to claim can depend   <br>

on whether an inquiry is open, companies would have an incentive not to settle inquiries. Those factors would sit uneasily with the Government&#146;s compliance objectives and with businesses&#146; oft-repeated requests for certainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06070578000388">Amendment No. 122 would make the relief more generous than that in the Bill by effectively giving access to up to three years&#146; worth of losses rather than one. That would go beyond the ECJ judgment. Moreover, it would substantially increase the extension&#146;s cost to the Exchequer, from the &#163;50 million estimated in the Budget documentation to &#163;150 million. That is not a concession that we seek to make, nor is it necessary given the distinction between the claim period and the loss period. The amendment could facilitate a form of loss shopping, with companies putting their losses into the state with the most generous filing deadline. It would also cause many practical problems for business and for Revenue and Customs, as filing dates vary from country to country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06070578000389">In short, both amendments would remove important protections in the Bill at substantial cost to the Exchequer. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West that the concerns of the hon. Member for Fareham are based on a confusion between two different concepts. I hope my remarks enable him to assure his friends in the industry that their concerns are not justified and to withdraw the amendments.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for putting on the record his clarification of the important point about the timing of the claim that people can make and its being in line with UK group relief rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06070578000391">One outstanding issue remains. At the end of the accounting period, the overseas company must be aware of its current position and its ability to offset losses that it has incurred against profits of other group companies in the same territory, as well as whether there is the prospect of relieving those losses against future profits to be made. That is a difficult issue, because if there is any prospect whatsoever of profits being made in the next accounting period&#151;for example, if some trading is still taking place&#151;the losses cannot be relieved. If, however, a business has taken the decision to close during the accounting period, at the accounting period end it will know that there is no future prospect of relieving those profits. That issue of how much knowledge a business must have at the end of an accounting period is problematic. It leads to a difficulty in applying the ECJ judgment. It is in line with the Government&#146;s strategy of applying the most restrictive interpretation of the ECJ judgment. I suspect that companies may wish to return to it in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para12"><a name="06070578000392">Given the Minister&#146;s confirmation of the date of the filing deadline, and notwithstanding my concerns about information that a business must have at the end of the accounting period to determine whether it can carry forward losses and whether they are available for relief elsewhere, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 I turn first to the Government amendments in this group on taxation of leases&#151;amendments Nos. 21 to 26. Government amendments Nos. 24 to 26 provide some useful technical clarification of schedule 8, which introduces a completely new framework for the taxation of leases, in relation to the backdating of the provisions. The Opposition have no objection to those amendments being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06070578000397">I particularly welcome amendments Nos. 21 to 23, since they are virtually identical to amendments which I tabled in Committee and which the Financial Secretary graciously said that he would look into. In three places, the Bill imposes a motivation test. The formulation usually adopted in anti-avoidance legislation asks whether the purpose, or one of the main purposes, of entering a relevant transaction is that of obtaining a tax advantage. By contrast, under schedule 8 it is sufficient if the Revenue can show that the circumstances of the case are such that it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the purpose of entering the transaction is to gain the tax advantage. Under the traditional formulation for motivation provisions, it is for the Revenue to prove its case in court&#151;that is, that obtaining the tax advantage was the purpose of entering the transaction. It would have to prove that on the balance of probabilities, according to the normal civil standard of proof. However, under the formulation chosen in schedule 8, the Revenue would no longer have to prove that tax avoidance was one of the motivations&#151;it would have only to show that it was not unreasonable to reach that conclusion. That seems to allow for the possibility that the Revenue might succeed despite failing to show that the actual purpose was to obtain a tax advantage, if it could show that it was not unreasonable to conclude in the circumstances that that was the motivation. It would then be up to the taxpayer to show that the relevant tax inspector&#146;s decision was unreasonable in the circumstances. That alters the ordinary onus of proof and therefore gives rise to significant problems.</p>

I hope that  that change of approach by the Government will be reflected in future and that the &#147;not unreasonable in the circumstances&#148; formulation does not become the norm in tax law. That was one of the main anxieties raised with me by organisations such as the Law Society, which was concerned not only about the  <br>

impact of this measure in terms of the taxation of leases but about the possibility of its becoming the standard form for drafting anti-avoidance provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06070578000399">I am positive about the Government&#146;s amendments to schedule 8, and I need only delay the House with a few remarks on the schedule. The Opposition still have serious reservations about the new framework for the taxation of leases. Although it is improved by the Government amendments, we are concerned that the abolition of tax incentives for leasing environmentally friendly equipment could harm the battle against climate change. The administrative costs of proposed new section 70Q(2)(d)of the Capital Allowances Act 2001 could be excessive, with lessees forced to establish the tax position of their immediate lessors and superior lessors; and, if they are overseas companies, their theoretical position in UK tax law, had they been subject to UK taxes. That could be a complex process and is not one that is required by the needs of the Revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para18"><a name="06070578000400">There is a danger that the new provisions on the taxation of leases could interact negatively with the tonnage tax regime. Overall, we are concerned about the considerable complexity of the new rules in schedule 8. We are worried about the impact that the changes could have on the leasing industry, which plays an enormously important role in UK business investment and fixed capital formation. The Finance and Leasing Association has reported that its members provided the finance in about a quarter of all fixed capital investment in the UK in 2004, involving some &#163;93 billion in new business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para19"><a name="06070578000401">The outgoing leasing rules have proved attractive to foreign direct investors, so their loss might be expected to remove an important incentive to bring business to the UK. We also believe that the shift of capital allowances from lessor to lessee, which is at the heart of schedule 8, will push up costs for the public sector. The NHS in particular has benefited in recent years from reduced costs in leasing equipment, because it can pass on to lessors the tax allowances on those leases which, as a non-taxpayer, it cannot use itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para20"><a name="06070578000402">We hope that the Government will keep the new framework for the taxation regime for long-funding leases under review and monitor its impact on the three areas that I have outlined, namely business investment, the public sector and overseas investment in the UK. We also hope that they will consider seriously the options for simplification, and that they will continue to consult the market participants affected by these rules closely, because of the key role that the leasing industry plays in business investment, and hence in productivity in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para21"><a name="06070578000403">We acknowledge, however, that the Government have conducted a lengthy and detailed consultation with the industry on these matters, and that they have removed a number of the problems that initially arose from their draft proposals. So as well as graciously conceding an important point today, they have taken steps to remove several difficulties that were present in the earlier drafts.</p>

minor, clarification of the provisions. I shall therefore add only a few general remarks about the provisions that the Government are seeking to amend today. There is of course a degree of consensus on the film industry. Members on both sides of the House recognise the importance of making the UK a competitive and attractive place in which to make films, because of the commercial and cultural importance of the film industry, and because it is a highly mobile industry and we are competing with other jurisdictions providing incentives for film makers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para23"><a name="06070578000405">We all agree that the old section 42 and section 48 reliefs have been abused and that they have to go because they are not providing sufficient value for money for the taxpayer. If we are going to have film tax reliefs, it make sense to focus them on the people who actually make films, as the Bill attempts to do, rather than on those who merely wish to reduce their tax bill&#151;the people whom the Chancellor memorably described as the grey middlemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para24"><a name="06070578000406">There are, however, a number of technical problems with the new structure, such as the blurred edges of the definition of a film production company, and the requirement that such a company be involved in pre-production as well as in principal photography and post-production. We are also concerned about the impact of the rules on TV companies, which cannot claim the reliefs but are still subject to the burdens of the framework, including problematic new accounting provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60705-0009.htm_para25"><a name="06070578000407">Above all, we very much hope that the pattern of continuing changes in the film tax regime that we have seen in recent years will not be repeated in the next Finance Bill. There have been recurring amendments to the regime, and the resulting instability creates serious difficulties for the industry, driving up costs and deterring film makers from coming to the UK. We urge the Government to do everything possible to provide a stable tax framework for the British film industry, and one that will provide much greater value for money for the taxpayer&#151;</p>

There is also consensus, however, that we need to safeguard against the practice of artificially inflating claims for relief or abusing the reliefs that we put in place. We believe that the Bill gets the balance right and that the new regime will work, but we will keep it under close scrutiny.</p>

I believe that a fundamental problem still remains, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it again on Report. However, rather than rehearse the arguments that were put in some detail in Committee, I shall ask a number of questions to which I hope the Paymaster General will be able to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06070578000418">Clause 61 seeks to remove the tax exemption that existed prior to the Budget, whereby employers who made computer equipment available for private use could do so tax-free, provided that the annual amount of the benefit in kind was &#163;500 or less. Under the new regime, it remains the case that when the personal use of computer equipment is &#147;not significant&#148;, it does not need to be reported for tax purposes. What value does the Paymaster General attribute to &#147;not significant&#148;? How much below the previous limit of &#163;500 per year will it be? How will the Government assess what does and does not count as significant?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06070578000419">The Paymaster General made the point in Committee that the system was being abused&#151;by being extended to include MP3 players, for example. There was a great deal of discussion at the time about what evidence the Government had used when they decided to withdraw the scheme rather than to tighten the definitions. The Paymaster General was kind enough to give examples of websites illustrating how the scheme could be abused, but can she quantify the scale of the abuse? Half a million people have benefited from the scheme, and  <br>

many family members, as well as employees, now have access to a computer at home as a result. In particular, people found the kind of support provided through the scheme particularly helpful and reassuring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06070578000420">Companies involved in delivering the scheme were reporting an increase in uptake, and I do not believe that that was entirely due to abuses of the system. However, if the Paymaster General has evidence to show that that increase was due solely to such abuse, I would welcome that information. However, the Paymaster General rightly pointed out the perceived weakness of the scheme&#151;that it related only to employees, and that vulnerable and isolated groups not in employment could not benefit from it. The Home Computing Initiative Alliance recognised that, and I understand that it was in discussions with the Treasury and auditors about how best to resolve that issue when the scheme was withdrawn.</p>

Will the entirety of the &#163;370 million in savings generated by the scheme&#146;s abolition be transferred to the new team, or will some of that go back into the Treasury pot? That question was asked in the Committee of the whole House, but I do not see a response to it in <i> Hansard. </i>Finally, will the Paymaster General provide us with an update on the digital inclusion team&#146;s work?

 It is a pleasure to follow the substantive contribution of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). As the House may recall, we debated in some detail the Government&#146;s proposal to abolish the home computing initiative scheme, under clause 61, in the Committee of the whole House on 2 May. On that occasion, the official Opposition proposed the deletion of clause 61, which, as I recall, the Liberal Democrats supported. If the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne presses her amendment to a Division, we shall remain consistent with our original position, return the compliment and support her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06070578000423">On 2 May, I spoke on this matter for some time and, I hope, in considerable detail, going back to the genesis of the scheme under section 45 of the Finance Act 1999. I therefore suspect that the House will welcome the fact that I do not propose to rehearse all that today. Instead, my aim this afternoon is to re-examine the Government proposal under five fairly succinct&#151; I hope&#151;headings. First, how was the decision to abolish HCI taken? Secondly, what was the subsequent impact? Thirdly, why was an alternative scheme not adopted? Fourthly, what is the tax position now, including such questions as: what now constitutes private use, which can be deemed for tax purposes to be &#147;not significant&#148;? Lastly, what really lay behind the decision all along?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06070578000424">On the first question, there is little doubt in the industry or elsewhere that the decision to abolish the scheme was taken late in the run-up to the Budget. That is evidenced by several points. In the days immediately preceding the Budget, the HCI Alliance, which represents companies specialising in this field,  <br>

was negotiating with the Treasury in good faith to see how the scheme could be modified, in order to save it from the allegations that elements of it were being abused. The HCI Alliance was therefore shocked when the scheme was abolished in the Budget on 22 March, while those negotiations were effectively still ongoing. They were not the only ones to be caught out. The Department of Trade and Industry, the scheme&#146;s departmental sponsor, was also taken unawares, not least as it was about to roll out the scheme to its own employees, and was promoting it on its departmental website on the day of abolition, stating:</p>
<a name="60705-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="06070578002470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The real beauty of HCI schemes is that they have the potential to improve performance in almost every area of the organisation. As well as traditional drivers&#151;reducing cost, increasing profitability&#151;they can also contribute to more recent imperatives such as corporate responsibility, individual learning and workplace development.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06070578000425">The Department for Work and Pensions, one of the largest employers in government, was also about to roll out the scheme to its staff, and was also blind-sided by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06070578000426">The announcement also drew criticism from the CBI and the TUC, both of which had actively promoted the scheme to their members. Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, protested:</p>
<a name="60705-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="06070578002471"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Home Computing Initiative has helped thousands of low-paid workers without confident IT skills buy their first ever computer. Unions up and down the country have been promoting the scheme, often linked to training schemes. The sudden closure of the scheme would mean that many hours of voluntary union effort would go to waste.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06070578000427">Moreover, the matter received no prior formal public consultation and, as the Government&#146;s regulatory impact assessment pointed out, unusually, no small firms impact test was carried out in advance of the decision either. In short, it had all the hallmarks of a decision taken hurriedly in the final few days before the Budget announcement, as the printers were straining to print the final version of the Red Book.</p>

had taken advantage of the scheme to help improve their computer literacy and that of their families, which was part of the point of the scheme. More than 1,000 organisations, including public, private and voluntary sector bodies had begun to use the scheme. More than 100 different NHS trusts and hospitals had done so, including King&#146;s College hospital and even the Sedgefield primary care trust, as had a wide variety of local authorities, a number of which were Labour-run. Many other organisations were also planning to adopt the scheme, including, as we have heard, two Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06070578000434">Unfortunately, even for organisations that had already signed up their employees, the benefits will now be time-limited, as once current HCI agreements expire they cannot be renewed on the same terms. That is confirmed by paragraph 71 of the regulatory impact assessment, which states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06070578000435">Therefore, even those people&#146;s HCI schemes will run out when whatever agreement they happen to have signed over the past few years reaches its originally agreed termination date.

 Having worked in the computing industry for 30 years before coming to this place, I welcomed the initiative and the attempt to raise levels of computer literacy, as lack of such literacy has resulted, among other things, in unnecessary recruitment from abroad to fill jobs that UK citizens could do. However, does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that any Government must act if they believe that a scheme has been abused, or that growing numbers of people are using it in a way not anticipated under the original terms and objectives?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. As he knows, I have quite a lot of time for him. At one level, what he says is correct, if the motive had genuinely been to address abuse. First, however, I do not believe that there was widespread abuse of the scheme, as I shall briefly explain. Secondly, as I hope I shall demonstrate, I believe that the motivation was not to combat abuse per se, and that the Government had other reasons. The issue of abuse has been used as a smokescreen, and I shall explain why. I take his point, but I do not believe that what he describes is what happened in this instance.</p>

Since the announcement was made, a number of companies operating in the field, including Red PC, Encompass and Evesham Technologies have, sadly, announced redundancies as a result. The greatest overall effect, however, is on the people who will no longer be able to avail themselves of the scheme, many of whom are in modestly paid jobs. When we debated the matter in the Committee of the whole House, I read into the record a series of e-mails and web comments from people who feared that they would no longer be  <br>

able to use the scheme. I will not go over that again, but in summary, the HCI Alliance estimated that 60 per cent. of the scheme's participants are in blue-collar industries and 75 per cent. pay the standard rate of tax or lower. Three quarters of the people who were using the scheme could hardly be described as rich by any measure. Moreover, the computer supplier Intel pointed out in a letter to me that 21,000 Tesco workers had taken up the scheme, and expressed the view that many of them would not have computers had they not been offered them under the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06070578000439">Why was an alternative scheme not adopted? We debated that at some length on 2 May. If the Treasury was generally concerned about the degree of abuse to which it argued that the scheme was subject&#151;and  I accept that there was some abuse at the margin&#151;it should have been possible to amend the 2004 scheme guidelines to specify a &#147;positive&#148; list of products to which the scheme and the exemptions would apply in future, perhaps supplemented by a &#147;negative&#148; list of those to which they would definitely not apply. That would have been a way of tightening up the scheme in order to save it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06070578000440">There is a precedent. The Government in Sweden have operated a system similar to the HCI for some time, and similar concerns were expressed there about people seeking to exploit the tax advantages by purchasing equipment outside the original spirit of the rules. However, in 2004, rather than scrapping the scheme the Swedes simply tightened the rules on qualifying equipment. It deemed that only personal computers were allowed, with a maximum of one per employee. The monitor size was restricted to 30 in to avoid the alleged abuse by people using the scheme to buy large-scale plasma televisions. Peripherals and accessories were divided into two categories: those primarily used connected to a PC, such as keyboards and printers&#151;which were allowed&#151;and those whose primary use did not involve a PC, such as digital cameras and MP3 players, which were specifically not allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para20"><a name="06070578000441">Even if the Treasury refused to accept the Swedish example wholesale, as we have argued before, restrictions of that kind would be relatively simple to introduce through modification of the guidelines. The Government simply cannot hide behind excuses such as the difficulty of defining qualifying equipment, because we have already given them an empirical example of that being done successfully elsewhere. Furthermore, that very option was included in the Government&#146;s own regulatory impact assessment, under the heading &#147;Refocus the Exemptions&#148;. The more tightly defined scheme, which was option 2 in the RIA, still offered considerable revenue savings to the Treasury, while also offering the prospect that the scheme could continue relatively intact. If option 2 had been used, the taxpayer would have saved money against the alleged abuse, while the scheme&#151;still relatively intact&#151;could have achieved its objective of contributing positively to the spread of e-literacy among the population. The Government could have saved it if they had wanted to; their own regulatory impact assessment makes that clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="60705-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06070578000442">What is the tax position now? Here we see some clarification from the Paymaster General. If the Government are determined to press ahead with their  <br>

decision, that leaves open the question of the tax position following the introduction of clause 61. Paragraph 22 of the RIA states</p>

The Red Book reveals that the decision to scrap the HCI will raise some &#163;300 million in revenue between 2006-07 and 2008-09. No doubt that preyed heavily on the Chancellor&#146;s mind in the run-up to the Budget, given that he is now pledged to borrow an incredible &#163;175 billion over the next six years. Coming from a Chancellor who always likes to wax lyrical about making decisions for the long term, this smacks of short-term decision making of the worst kind. Indeed, we observed the irony during the most recent Treasury questions, on 15 June. The Chancellor himself was berating the Opposition for, in his opinion, not doing enough to encourage investment in computers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06070578000452">This is clearly a decision made in haste by a Chancellor on the look-out for short-term revenue-raising measures. In fairness to the Paymaster General, it must be said that, as so often happens, the Chancellor has made a difficult decision and expected his junior Ministers to front for him. His decision will impede the spread of computer literacy in our country, not least among modestly paid employees and their families, at a time when, according to Hewlett Packard, our international competitors such as China and India are between them churning out more than 100,000 IT graduates a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06070578000453">The bottom line is that the Government could have refocused the exemptions to protect revenue for the taxpayer, and still have saved the scheme. They had that option, but they did not follow it because they wanted every penny that they could squeeze. Nevertheless, I call on the Government one last time to reverse this erroneous decision&#151;although, sadly, I believe I know the outcome even before I ask the question.</p>

 In Committee of the whole House, I made it clear that there were a number of reasons why it was the right time to remove the exemption. I shall briefly repeat each one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000455">The home computer initiative has been used extensively by groups whom we would not generally expect to experience difficulty in accessing information technology. Twenty-five per cent. of participants in the scheme are higher rate taxpayers, more than twice the proportion among taxpayers as a whole. Furthermore, nearly a third of participants are employed in white-collar industries. In March, the Low Pay Commission published the findings of its review of benefits in kind, salary sacrifice schemes and the accommodation offset. It found that take-up rates were often low and that many part-time low-paid workers would gain no advantage from salary sacrifice schemes for home computers and other benefits in kind. The analysis shows that those who can afford to do so have the computers and those who cannot afford to do so, do not. The recommendation was, therefore, to refocus&#151;not to amend&#151;the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="st_o206"><a name="06070578000456"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="06070578002806"><b>David Taylor:</b>
 It may be that the benefit of the scheme was focused on the middle class, IT-literate, higher paid section of the population, but many people would have been happier had the savings&#151;some  &#163;200 million over three years&#151;been refocused in a way that enabled access for older or less-well-off people in  <br>

certain areas. It could have been done perhaps through the community education system, which has had some problems in recent times.</p>

<p><a name="st_o207"><a name="06070578000457"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="06070578002807"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right and I will come to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06070578000458">The HMRC also had evidence that the tax exemption was being used beyond the scope of its original intention, not only in the equipment provided but in the marketing of the scheme, which implied that people could buy that equipment at prices offset against their salary sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name="st_o208"><a name="06070578000459"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="06070578002808"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 Will the Paymaster General give way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="06070578000460"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="06070578002809"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I shall come to the hon. Lady&#146;s points and, if necessary, give way then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06070578000461">The investment for the groups that my hon. Friend mentioned was specifically addressed in the digital review and the Low Pay Commission report. I shall come to those points when I have finished explaining why the scheme was not appropriate. It was the correct time for the Government to remove the exemption and better focus support on the groups of people in our community that my hon. Friend mentioned, so as to increase access to technology for the poorest, the unemployed, the elderly and the low paid. Salary sacrifice schemes cannot provide that access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para6"><a name="06070578000462">During proceedings in the Committee of the whole House, I announced that we would establish a dedicated digital inclusion team. That team has now been set up by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and is working closely with the City of London Corporation. It will champion examples of excellence in using highly effective and efficient information and communication technology to tackle the key drivers of exclusion. It will also promote leadership and understanding and inform decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06070578000463">I also announced that the Government would change the aims and objectives of the digital strategy to focus on digital inclusion. The Treasury will collaborate closely with industry on meeting the goals of the digital strategy, building on the success of more than 6,000 UK online centres&#151;more than half of which are located in the 2,000 most deprived wards in England. Some 90 per cent. of the population live within 5 km of one of those centres, and that is precisely the type of investment that is needed to reach those groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06070578000464">It is stunning that every time the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) is asked about the Liberal Democrats&#146; spending commitments, we are told that they have a commission and are thinking about it. Then she berates the Government for investment in making progress on tackling social exclusion&#151;</p>

 I will give way to the hon. Lady if she will tell me where she will get the &#163;300 million for the unfocused support of those who already have access to the technology and how she plans to tackle the exclusion of everybody else.</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="06070578000467"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="06070578002812"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 Is it right that all the money saved from the withdrawal of the scheme will be reinvested in digital inclusion for vulnerable groups?</p>

<p><a name="st_o213"><a name="06070578000468"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew8"><a name="06070578002813"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I have told the hon. Lady the Government&#146;s plans for spending the money. She has a flipping cheek&#151;I shall rephrase that. It is somewhat audacious of the hon. Lady to suggest that I should forecast future Government spending when she is not even prepared to make a current commitment on expenditure by her party on anything, let alone in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06070578000469">I have made it clear that with the refocusing of the digital strategy, the setting up and use of the digital inclusion team and the discussions that we are having with industry, we are looking at how we can refocus support on targeted groups. I remind the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) that if those people are low paid, unemployed or elderly, a salary sacrifice scheme will not help them, however it is amended. The point of the reports that the Government received was to demonstrate that the resources should now be directed at the groups I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06070578000470">The final question was about the remaining arrangements for when computer equipment is provided by employers solely for work purposes and the definition of &#147;significant&#148; in relation to private use. The HMRC&#146;s interpretation of not significant is that</p>
<a name="60705-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="06070578002477"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;where a computer is provided by an employer because it is necessary for an employee to have it available at home or in the office to carry out the duties of their employment, it is highly unlikely that any private use made of that equipment will be significant when compared to the business need.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06070578000471">It is assumed that the business need would outweigh any consideration of private use. To put that point beyond doubt, the HMRC&#151;in consultation with the employers&#151;has drafted guidance with detailed explanations of the point, which is currently being scrutinised. Employers can still provide computers for business need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06070578000472">It is entirely appropriate that the Government should refocus the resources. There is no hidden agenda. The agenda is clear and it involves reaching out to those who are excluded from information technology and ensuring that the regime as provided is properly used. That is precisely what we have done.</p>

<p><a name="st_o214"><a name="06070578000473"><a name="60705-0011.htm_spnew9"><a name="06070578002814"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 I shall be brief. Although the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) may not approve, I am sure that many other Members will be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06070578000474">The unfairness still stands. People who could have benefited from the home computer scheme will not be able to access it and, as has been said in previous debates and again today, many of those people are in blue-collar jobs and low-income households. Businesses have closed as a result of the end of the scheme, so what confidence can the Paymaster General expect businesses to have in the Government&#146;s proposals to extend digital access to vulnerable groups? Why would they support or invest in future schemes, given their experience of the home computer scheme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06070578000475">3.30 pm</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="60705-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06070578000476">The right hon. Lady has not explained why the Government were not able to tighten the definition, when other countries were perfectly able to do so. For those reasons&#151;</p>

 With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 16, 100, 17 and 101 to 106.</p>

<p><a name="st_o221"><a name="06070578000992"><a name="60705-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="06070578003322"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 These amendments cover two similar areas. They deal with changes to the legislation on &#147;repos&#148;&#151;the name for agreements for the sale and repurchase of securities&#151;and introduce legislation on the factoring of income generally, replacing existing legislation on the factoring of rents from land. Both these areas involve anti-avoidance rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06070578000993">Amendments Nos. 99 to 101 deal with factoring of income generally and are more substantial, so I will describe them first. The ideas behind the rules for structured finance arrangements are not new; they build on, extend and replace legislation introduced in 2000 called rent factoring. However, the structures that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has seen recently are new: they take rent factoring ideas and extend them to types of receipts other than rents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06070578000994">Before turning to the detail, it may be helpful to start by outlining why the amendments are being introduced at this stage of the Finance Bill cycle, rather than on Budget day. The context is that, earlier this year, HMRC became aware that a major corporation had entered into the new type of factoring scheme to avoid paying tax on significant amounts of income. At that stage, HMRC was not aware of the detailed mechanics of the scheme, so the Government were not in a position at Budget time to introduce properly targeted legislation. Work continued to ensure that the scheme was properly understood and then on developing a legislative solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06070578000995">On 6 June, my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General announced to Parliament that the Government would introduce amendments to the Finance Bill on Report to ensure that the new type of factoring arrangement would be properly taxed, and that the legislation would have effect from 6 June. On that day, HMRC published draft legislation and a detailed explanatory statement on its website identifying the types of scheme that the legislation would affect. It also invited interested parties to attend a longer open day later in June, with HMRC  <br>

and Treasury officials, with the object of clarifying the new rules and identifying any areas where they might need to be amended. As I said, this is, in essence, anti-avoidance legislation. The Government do not usually consult about anti-avoidance legislation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o222"><a name="06070578000996"><a name="60705-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="06070578003323"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 Will the Minister explain to the House the principal differences between the draft legislation that was published on 6 June and the provisions in front of us today? What types of transactions were taken out?</p>

<p><a name="st_o223"><a name="06070578000997"><a name="60705-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="06070578003324"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 I was just coming on to explain how the consultation had affected the initial proposals and how consultation had helped us to make better tax policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06070578000998">I was saying that, normally, one would not consult on this kind of anti-avoidance legislation, but because we are talking about a difficult area, we thought that it would be helpful for there to be a period of consultation and discussion about the detail&#151;as long as it was always clear that the legislation would have effect from the date that it was announced, 6 June, and provided that the House was content for these amendments to be introduced on Report. As I said, we held an open day discussion on 20 June, which was attended by about 30 representatives of business and the advisory professions, to go through the legislation and, in particular, to consider whether the exclusions that had originally been built in were sufficient. Those exclusions were to make sure that we did not inadvertently capture appropriate behaviour as we tried to deal with the particular form of tax avoidance relating to this complex way of providing loan finance. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06070578000999">The consultation process has been constructive and beneficial in identifying areas where changes to the original proposals were needed in order to exclude cases that could be inadvertently caught. The process has been welcomed by business as a way of striking the right balance between protecting tax revenues and making sure that we get legislation right. The main exclusions are for transactions that are already taxed in the way that the amendments propose. That includes finance leases and other similar arrangements such as repos, stock lending and some types of Islamic finance. To put the point beyond doubt, ordinary loans are also excluded. In essence, the new legislation for structured finance arrangements will bring other types of financing arrangements into line with the new finance leasing rules, and so remove what would otherwise have been an anomaly from the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06070578001000">I want to confirm in particular that, following discussions, the finance leasing industry is content with the exclusions in the amendments. In response to the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), I should say that it was around those issues of finance leasing that most of the detailed changes to the original 6 June announcement were made. Following those consultations with the industry, we understand that it is content that the exclusions in the amendments provide the right outcome, particularly in relation to any overlap between the leasing rules and the structured finance rules. We think that these measures are a proportionate response to complex arrangements. Had we not acted, several hundreds of millions of pounds of tax would have been at risk. The provisions do not penalise, but put all finance arrangements on a level  <br>

playing field so that a company&#146;s decision on how to finance itself is not driven by tax considerations, but by commercial ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06070578001001">Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are changes to the tax treatment of sale and repurchase&#151;or, as they are commonly known, repo&#151;transactions. These amendments are the Government&#146;s prompt reaction to a recent adverse decision of the special commissioners&#151;the first instance tax tribunal&#151;in a case where there was what is known as a three-legged repo. Clearly, in this case, there was no question of consultation because we were responding to that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06070578001002">Repos are used widely in the financial markets as a form of a secured loan. They typically involve one party agreeing to sell securities to another, with a related agreement to buy back the securities at an agreed future date at a price agreed at the outset. Ordinary repos involve only two parties: the original holder and the interim holder. The special commissioners held that the legislation for taxing repos did not work properly in a three-legged repo situation and upheld a company&#146;s claim to a deduction when, overall, there was no net loss to the group of companies involved. It is very likely that HMRC will appeal that decision, but it opens up the possibility of companies trying to enter into similar schemes in the hope that the special commissioners&#146; decision will be upheld. The possible cost of that could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06070578001003">The amendments on repos will ensure that such a scheme will not succeed in future, whatever the outcome of the appeal. The changes will not have any wider effect on genuine commercial repo transactions. This is another example of us acting quickly and fairly, but properly, to deal with tax avoidance without damaging legitimate transactions. I hope that I have assured the hon. Member for Fareham that the consultation has been well handled, and I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o224"><a name="06070578001004"><a name="60705-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="06070578003325"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 I thank the Minister for his explanation of these complex and technical changes. He was right to suggest that the consultation process has been thorough and effective. Given that many of the issues on which we have had conflict during the passage of the Bill have been areas on which there has not been proper consultation, that is something on which we can agree. The Minister has taken on board fully the remarks made by tax advisers. On that point, may I put on record my thanks to the advisers who have helped us throughout the passage of the Bill? PricewaterhouseCoopers has helped us to tackle some of the complexities of the Bill, but it was not alone in providing us with guidance, support, suggestions and help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06070578001005">The Minister is right to clamp down on the problem. I understand that taxpayers are trying to obtain tax relief on both the interest and the principal. The example given in the explanatory notes demonstrates the extent to which people will structure such transactions simply to acquire tax relief on them. The amendments are thus valid. My discussions have shown that the industry is broadly content with them. Things such as finance leases were in the original scope of the draft legislation and the fact that they have been taken out is welcome. There is provision in the legislation that when other genuine commercial transactions could be caught by the changes, there is a mechanism for ensuring that they will fall outside the scope of the anti-avoidance provisions.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 873</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06070578001006">May I ask several questions about repos? The Minister was right to point out that such transactions are ordinarily straightforward. However, the transactions that came to the Government&#146;s attention through the case considered by the special commissioners involved three parties. The original owner sold securities to an interim purchaser, who sold them to someone else, who then sold them back to the original owner&#151;that is quite a complex loop. When considering such transactions, did the Treasury or HMRC do any research to determine whether any valid commercial transactions involved three parties in a tri-party repo arrangement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06070578001007">I understand that there are frequently occasions on which a third party will act as an agent between the two parties to a repo. Will the Minister confirm whether the use of agents will lead to transactions being classified as tri-party repos and thus fall under the terms of the amendments? Clarification on that would be useful because agents are widely used when such transactions are carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06070578001008">The third issue is assignment and novation of the arrangements. There may be occasions when, for entirely commercial reasons, existing repos are assigned and novated to another party&#151;for example, as part of a corporate reorganisation or a transfer or takeover of business. In those circumstances, since the assignee would not be the party to whom the securities were originally sold, one would not expect that they would be eligible for tax relief in respect of any deemed manufactured dividend or interest. There is some concern that the new rules might capture those transactions inadvertently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06070578001009">I should be grateful if the Minister responded to those three concerns: has there been any research into the valid commercial use of tri-party repos; will it capture deals where an agent has facilitated the repo; and what will happen where there are assignments and novations as part of an ordinary commercial transaction or corporate reorganisation? Will the Minister clarify those three matters?</p>

<p><a name="st_o225"><a name="06070578001010"><a name="60705-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="06070578003326"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 I am happy to clarify those three issues. Having spent some time reflecting on these matters in recent weeks, it is clear that it is a highly complex area and that changes to legislation in respect of market developments over a number of years have led to very considerable complexity. In future, we will look to finding ways to make the legislation more user friendly, without at the same time losing any of the important protections that have been introduced in recent years and in the amendments today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06070578001011">On the first point, I can confirm that protection of revenue is being put in place without affecting normal transactions in any way. We have been careful to ensure that standard repo contracts will not be affected. We are talking about a particularly contrived form of three-party repo&#151;not the sort of transactions that one stumbles into inadvertently. They exist only where taxpayers are attempting to avoid paying tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements. Standard commercial or two-party repos will not be inadvertently affected by the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06070578001012">The second question was about agency cases. I can confirm that they will not be caught by the changes, as we looked into that particular problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="60705-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06070578001013">On the third question about novations, I can confirm that our understanding is that they will not be caught in that way. Following the special commissioner&#146;s decision, we decided to act quickly. We do not want to open up a wider problem. As a result of the commissioners decision, the right thing to do was to act in a speedy manner and hopefully in a well thought out manner. I can assure the hon. Gentleman on all of his three points. More generally, because this is a complex area, we will keep it under review and if we can take further action in future Finance Bills to bring greater simplicity while at the same time keeping proper revenue protections in place, we shall certainly do so. For now, I urge hon. Members to support the amendments, which are necessary to protect the taxpayer from the potential loss of hundreds of millions of pounds. They will also help to ensure that the vast majority of people who go about their proper business in the financial markets will not be affected by the problem.</p>

 I wanted another run around the block on the UK nuclear industry from a financial point of view. Clauses 99 and 100 go hand in hand in amending the Energy Act 2004. Clause 99 deals with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd and clause 100 covers the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="60705-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06070578001027">British Nuclear Fuels Ltd is a Government company, which has a turnover of approximately &#163;3.5 billion.  It appears to me, prima facie, that clause 99 is part of a device to fatten up BNFL from a tax point of view because of the sell-offs that it proposes to make. It will sell British Nuclear Group, and the rumours are that that is expected to raise between &#163;500 million and  &#163;1 billion. It proposes to sell BNG America and is in advanced talks with Toshiba to sell Westinghouse this autumn for a reported &#163;5.4 billion. It also owns a third of Uranco, a uranium reprocessing company, the other two thirds of which are owned in the Netherlands and Germany. British Nuclear Fuels Ltd is therefore a sprawling, large company, which deals with a large industry. Whatever happens in future, it will continue, for many years, to play a significant part in energy delivery and have a significant environmental impact in the United Kingdom.</p>

 Yes, of course these are in a sense backward-looking clauses, but in the context of a public debate about nuclear energy and what we do with the nuclear power stations and the spent materials that we have&#151;a debate that will develop this summer when the energy review is published&#151;we need to try to be aware of the historic cost of nuclear power, as perhaps evidenced in these two clauses, to inform that public debate about the possible future cost of nuclear power.</p>

 The Paymaster General said a moment ago, no doubt accurately, that these clauses are about looking back.

 I quite agree, and that is what I am trying to find out. Whether we talk about existing nuclear power stations or a new group&#151;what the industry tries to dress up as a fleet&#151;we have to look at the question of dealing with spent materials, radioactive waste and so on. That is particularly true of the radioactive waste that we already know exists, because it is here, and the waste that we know will be generated in the next 13 to 15 years, until 2020, the life of the current nuclear power stations. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is a Government body, but as the hon. Gentleman points out, it uses British Nuclear Group as a subcontractor for site management, clean-up and so on, and BNG is likely to be privatised in the next 12 months.</p>

in the United Kingdom. One thing that the nuclear industry has historically been very good at is getting hidden subsidies. I am not sure whether clauses 99 and 100 are indicative of that; I want to find that out. It already has a hidden subsidy through the cap on its public liability insurance, because given the liabilities it would be almost impossible, even with reinsurance&#151;the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) knows a great deal about that and could correct me if I am wrong&#151;to get insurance cover at a premium that would make a nuclear power station viable. There has to be an indirect state subsidy on those liabilities. Clauses 99 and 100 may or may not speak to that, and I wish to find out more.</p>

 As I understand it, the transitional arrangements came in because the European Commission started examining whether there was or is unauthorised state aid in the UK for the nuclear power industry, part of which has been privatised and more of which will be privatised.</p>

The technology has never been operated anywhere without state subsidy, directly or indirectly. The proponents of a new generation of nuclear power stations are looking forward rather than backwards, which the clauses do, to a situation where there will not be state subsidies. I am a little cynical about that. I have heard it all before. Throughout my adult life I have heard about how there would not be state subsidies, and that we would have electricity too cheap to meter, for example. That never worked out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="60705-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06070578001047">We are talking about old technology. It is about  50 years old, as I have said. That is the basic design, however much we talk about advanced gas water and all that, heavy water and can-do reactors, for example. It is, as I have said, old technology. It works in as much as it produces electricity, but it does not work in that it is not economic. Even with today&#146;s high energy prices, there are serious questions to be asked about whether the nuclear power that we have, let alone the nuclear power that we may have in future, is economic, given the direct subsidies for the existing nuclear fleet of power stations and the possible subsidies, whether on insurance or guaranteed purchase of electricity, for future nuclear power stations.</p>

The Paymaster General made a specific reference to the Lib Dem contribution to the relevant section of the Energy Act 2004, which was not debated in Committee, as I found when I looked back at <i> Hansard </i>for that time.

As I said in Committee, the House agreed the provision to prevent a large amount of Government money from moving in circles. To be precise, it was intended to make sure that in transfers from public bodies, one public body does not have a tax-deductible loss, while the other public body receiving the assets has a gain that is also not taxable.</p>

There was a mismatch between what was agreed by this House in the 2004 Act and subsequent clarifications on state aid. What is proposed now&#151;it was included in the state aid notification in respect of the NDA&#151;is not considered as state aid, because the effect of the exemption is tax neutral with respect to the Government, which is why I have mentioned the circular effect between publicly owned bodies.

Where a company is sold during an accounting period, section 29 treats the end of the public ownership as the end of the accounting period. Section 29 does not, therefore, apply to accounting entries made for accounting periods during which the company is in the private sector. At that point, the normal tax rules would apply to that company. Section 29 applies only to public sector companies. I hope that I have clarified that.</p>

 I am talking about the creation of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the movement from its predecessor authority, which is all that these provisions cover. The position as regards state aid confirms that it is tax neutral; otherwise, it would not get state aid. These provisions concern the arrangements in the Energy Act for transferring from one public body to another. The accounting period for those public bodies would end as soon as they became private companies and moved beyond the scope of the provisions.</p>

Under the 2004 spending review, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority received a budget of &#163;2.2 billion for 2005-06. That is to be derived half from commercial activities and, over time, commercial income in recognising those costs. As I understand it, the proposals on tax neutrality within Government, having been agreed by this House in 2004, had to be amended following a mismatch with regard to timing. The Bill lines that up again to preserve the position. I can absolutely confirm to the House that there is no question of state aid subsidies, nor can there be given the clearance that we have sought.</p>

In debating this issue, we return to part 4 of the Bill, which deals with the regime to introduce REITs.

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para0"><a name="06070578001156">However, there are still some weaknesses in the proposed REITs regime that I should like to address, both in relation to our amendment No. 130 and to amendments Nos. 60 and 61, which have been tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young). I shall begin, however, by referring to Government amendments Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06070578001157">Government amendment No. 27 relates specifically to clause 107 of the Bill, which deals with the conditions necessary for a business to qualify as tax exempt under the REITs regime. Condition 3 of clause 107 is that owner-occupied properties should be excluded from tax-exempt status. In Committee, we discussed the operation of condition 3 in some detail&#151;particularly in relation to car parks, as I recall. A related issue had arisen during the consultation process that preceded our Committee deliberations, which was the definition of &#147;owner-occupied&#148; as generally understood under international accounting standard 40&#151;known as IAS 40 for short. That problem threatened to create unintended consequences for the REITs regime. The problem would be that if, in certain circumstances, an REIT company were to provide significant services to the occupier of one of its properties, the company might itself be deemed to be an owner occupier under the strictures of IAS 40, and therefore fall outside the REITs regime under condition 3 of clause 107.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06070578001158">Government amendment No. 27 seeks to address that by ensuring that in such circumstances, where the tenant has exclusive occupation of the property, the accounting definition of &#147;owner occupied&#148; is effectively overridden, so that the REIT company is not deemed to have breached condition 3 of clause 107. The associated Government amendment No. 30 appears to be essentially a drafting amendment, which ensures that the revised application of clause 107 is extended to group  companies via a corresponding change to the associated schedule 17. So far, so good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06070578001159">The British Property Federation welcomed the amendment with the following comment, which is germane:</p>
<a name="60705-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="06070578002493"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We welcome this amendment, which addresses a concern raised by industry during the consultation. However, we are aware that there may be a number of different situations where the definition of owner occupied property inadvertently causes a property to be excluded from the tax exempt business. Government should be aware of this and have a strategy in place to listen to industry concerns and react quickly to those situations through producing appropriate guidance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06070578001160">That seems a not unreasonable request, given that this is an especially complex area. I hope that the Minister and his officials can liaise with the industry to try to address, as far as practically possible, any remaining anomalies in the subsequent guidance, in the light of ever-changing commercial circumstances. At some point, the guidance might have to be updated to take account of changing market conditions. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will address that question when he sums up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06070578001161">Government amendments Nos. 28 and 29 relate to schedule 16 to the Bill.

debated the related clause 111&#151;the issue of potential double taxation of properties held on so-called trading account, and yet another issue relating to the definition of owner occupation, to reiterate the point about the complexity surrounding that term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06070578001162">In essence, those measures were originally proposed in the associated draft regulations, on which I spoke for the Opposition. In Committee, the Economic Secretary intimated that he would be likely to introduce amendments on those subjects on Report, and therefore to include such elements in the Bill, which in principle we welcome. He has kept his word and we commend him for that. We still hesitate about the solution, however, in this instance of what one might call clarification by exclusion. Even though the Government&#146;s solution will now appear in the Bill, they still seek to achieve that clarification by extending the inclusion to encompass all so-called trading properties, which underlines how little this part of the Bill does for residential property, as that is a particular challenge for residential property companies. I shall refer to that topic again shortly, although I suspect that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire will also be keen to catch your eye on that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, when he speaks to his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06070578001163">Our amendment No. 130 is designed to extend the qualifying conditions for a company applying for REIT status under clause 106, specifically by allowing REIT companies to list on the alternative investment market of the London stock exchange&#151;AIM, as it is now more popularly known. When the matter was touched on in Committee of the whole House, Ministers pointed out that, under EU law, that would also entail reciprocal listing on other comparable EU exchanges. Our amendment specifically caters for that, so I hope that it will be more acceptable as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06070578001164">There are several good reasons why REITs should be able to list on AIM. First, property companies registered as REITs are likely to enjoy significant tax advantages over those usually smaller companies denied that status. It therefore seems probable that there could be considerable consolidation in the property market, as AIM-listed companies that cannot qualify for tax-exempt status are gradually taken over by companies on the full listed market that do enjoy those tax advantages. That is potentially unfair, and could cause the United Kingdom property market to be increasingly dominated by a relatively small number of very large REIT companies. That is presumably not what the Government intended when they introduced the regime.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_14"><a name="60705-0016.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06070578002568"><h5 align="left">4.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06070578001165">Secondly, AIM-listed companies themselves might come under pressure to convert to a full stock exchange listing before they are really ready for it, principally in order to be able to qualify for REIT status, thus potentially causing a distortion in the orderly evolution of the market sector. Why not expand the condition at least to cover AIM-listed companies that meet all the other conditions in the Bill? There are a number of them and we have already debated them at length, so I hope I need not repeat them now. That would facilitate greater diversity in the REITs market available to investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06070578001166">I think the third point quite important. I am sure that, given his business experience in the United States,  <br>

my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) will want to expand on it. US experience suggests that widening the listing base is a good way of helping the concept to take off. The <i> Financial Times </i>estimates that more than $300 billion is now invested in US REITs, and notes that spreading the listing base was important to the generation of that significant investment. Our Government would presumably like to emulate that as well, at least on a comparable United Kingdom scale. We know that it worked well in the United States. Why should we not learn from that example? As the Americans have one of the oldest established REITs regimes in the world&#151;I believe that it began in 1960&#151;they have considerable experience in operating REITs, and they found widening the listing base to be a good way of helping the concept to grow. Why do we not learn from our American cousins in this instance?</p>

 I believe that one of the advantages of the American experience, which ties in with something that the Government are trying to achieve, is that quite a large unlisted real estate investment trust market stimulated residential housing. That is one of the Government&#146;s objectives. Conservative Members fear that not having an unlisted market, or even allowing REITs to be listed on AIM, will tend to skew investment towards the commercial rather than the residential market.</p>

 That is an important point. As we said in Committee, we believe that one of the weaknesses of the current regime is that it is already heavily skewed in favour of commercial property. Leaving this impediment in the Bill may make the position worse. I shall say more about that shortly, while&#151;I hope&#151;not entirely stealing the thunder of my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06070578001169">The listing issue is a particular impediment for residential property companies that seek REIT status. In Committee, I made the general point that the REITs regime appeared to have been designed primarily with commercial property in mind, residential property having been included almost as an afterthought. I said at the time that I wanted to initiate a debate on that, and on what might be done to deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06070578001170">The fact that there appears to be a problem with residential REITs is illustrated by the fact that several major commercial property companies, including Land Securities and Hammerson, have already indicated that they have decided to convert to REIT status. As far as I am aware, no residential property company has yet made such a firm commitment.</p>

taking such a step, but commercial property companies have said definitely that they will do it<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>He asked me a question and he must allow me to answer it. The difference is that several commercial property companies have said that they will definitely do it. A consortium of housing associations has said that it is considering doing it, but as I read the <i> FT</i> it has not said that it will definitely do it. So we still do not have a concrete example of any residential property company saying that it will convert to REIT status on these terms. That is an important distinction.</p>

<p><a name="st_o258"><a name="06070578001173"><a name="60705-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="06070578003372"><b>Mr. Newmark:</b>
 I suspect that part of the consideration for residential property companies is the cost of listing, as well as the additional regulatory burden. I suspect that that is the focus of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="06070578001174"><a name="60705-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="06070578003373"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 Yes. If a company is thinking of listing on AIM it will bear several factors in mind, including the cost of that listing and compliance. If it is thinking of upgrading to the full London stock exchange, the cost of compliance and registering will also form part of its consideration. My point is that as the regime exists, it may encourage some AIM companies to go for a full listing when they otherwise would not be ready. They feel that they have no choice, because if they are going to remain in property, they need the tax exemptions to qualify as a REIT company. If they do not qualify and just sit on AIM, they may be vulnerable to takeover by fully listed companies that have that tax wrapper to enhance their power. My hon. Friend again makes an apposite point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para13"><a name="06070578001175">We have established that there has been no definite announcement by any company to convert to residential REIT status. Moreover, residential property companies tend to be smaller, both by market capitalisation and the actual book value of their portfolio, than commercial property companies. While there are several residential property companies that might have little difficulty in obtaining REIT status on AIM&#151;some 60 are registered on AIM&#151;forcing them into a full listing before they are ready could be a serious impediment to them. The British Property Federation argued that point in a note on the subject:</p>
<a name="60705-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="06070578002494"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The property industry in the UK believes the consequence of limiting REITs to listed companies will be to unnecessarily limit the development of REITs because it heightens the barrier for new entrants to the UK REIT regime and as a consequence makes it that much more difficult for new REIT companies to form.

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para17"><a name="06070578001179">As of May 2006, there were 1,528 companies, of which 1,266 were in the UK and 262 were international, listed on AIM. Those companies had a total market value of &#163;74.2 billion and a turnover value of &#163;28.6 billion, to May 2006. So AIM is a very successful market in its own right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para18"><a name="06070578001180">Amendment No. 130 seeks therefore to open up the current clause 106 legislation to allow companies listed via AIM to convert to REIT status. That will enable the development of new or smaller companies in the REIT market, thus helping to ensure that REITs are a sustained, successful investment vehicle across the property market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="60705-0016.htm_para19"><a name="06070578001181">Sixthly, and importantly, during the Committee of the whole House, the then Economic Secretary argued that an impediment to allowing REITs to list on AIM was that under EU law they would need similar listing opportunities on comparable EU exchanges. However, unlike our amendment at that stage, our amendment No. 130 specifically allows for that point. Moreover, the first condition of clause 106 is that to qualify for REIT status a company must be resident in the UK in any case, so even though a company could theoretically list on an alternative EU exchange rather than on AIM, given that it must be UK-resident to comply with the REITs regime generally, in most cases the most likely scenario would be for a UK listing, at least in the first instance. Common sense suggests that in the majority of cases a UK-resident company would probably register on AIM first, rather than going to one of the alternative EU markets. Even were that not the case, and the company registered on one of the alternative EU markets, why in principle need that be a showstopper? Will the Economic Secretary answer that question before we conclude the debate?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a good point when he questions why a UK-resident company would list overseas. If it did so, it would have difficulty with potential investors, so there would, if anything, be commercial pressure to remain in the UK and to list on AIM or the London stock exchange. It would make little commercial sense to go elsewhere, because confidence in the company might be called into question, and if that were not the case, there would be no concern.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for making that important point. He had considerable experience as a commercial lawyer before coming to this place. Indeed, I understand that his wife has ongoing experience as a commercial lawyer, so no doubt they discussed the matter before our debate.

Given that a key condition&#151;the first condition&#151;of clause 106 is that a REIT company must be UK resident, it is likely in practice that in most cases it would register in the UK if it wanted to register on an alternative market rather than on a full listing.

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para0"><a name="06070578001194">The alternative investment market is generally regarded as something of a success story. We would like to make REITs a success story, too. Therefore we would like to know why the Government are reluctant to consider expanding the REITs concept to AIM. We hope that they will concede that point this afternoon, but if they do not, will they at least reassert the position&#151;as given by the former Economic Secretary, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), and repeated in Committee&#151;that, at the very least, they intend to keep this matter under review once the regime is rolled out from January 2007?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06070578001195">I suspect that REITs will at some point be expanded by being listed on AIM. We shall see when that happens. We have put down our marker very firmly in this debate. If the Government do not take this step, I suspect that we will when we become the Government. </p>

 I do not intend to rehearse all the arguments that we had on this issue on Second Reading and in Committee. However, let me state that the whole point of real estate investment trusts is that they offer a regulated, low-risk way for individuals to invest in  the property market. The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) is right that early indications suggest that there might be a question about where the balance lies in terms of the development of REITs and what proportion of them will be commercial REITs as against residential REITs. At present the balance is heavily in favour of the commercial sector, but as the Economic Secretary pointed out, it seems that some residential companies are hesitantly setting out their stall and looking to develop in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06070578001197">Given the way in which the self-invested personal pension scheme was put forward and then withdrawn, it is important that we allow these regulations to go ahead as was suggested in the consultation with the industry, which was very constructive, and let them bed down. At that point, we can look at where the imbalances are, and at ways to overcome them. That is when we should reflect on whether the proposals in amendment No. 130 are required or appropriate. The Liberal Democrats are relaxed about this issue. We would rather see how the REITs regulations bed down over the first couple of years, and how the companies in question bed down in the London stock exchange, and then, if there is a problem, look to AIM.</p>

We also believe that if REITs are local and highly focused residential trusts, they have the opportunity either to complement the existing local authority sector or housing association and private  <br>

residential rented sector, or to provide additional rented properties in areas where there is little provision, or none at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06070578001200">However, the Bill as it stands will force all REITs to be listed on the stock exchange. We believe that that requirement alone might prevent the creation of the smaller, local, highly focused residential trusts that we would like to be created, along with the inevitable larger commercial ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06070578001201">As we know, the minimum entry level for a stock exchange listing is &#163;750,000, plus another &#163;750,000 for fundraising, plus 2 to 5 per cent. in commission, and advisory costs of some &#163;250,000. Fundraising on the stock exchange can be for any amount. We also know that the typical value of a stock exchange-listed company is &#163;100 million upwards. If one combines those costs with the other rules&#151;that 75 per cent. of a REIT&#146;s commercial activity must come from rentals, and that 90 per cent. of the rental income must be returned in dividends to investors&#151;there is a very real danger, to which the hon. Member for Rayleigh  (Mr. Francois) alluded, that REITs will focus solely on high-end commercial and retail properties that already offer a guaranteed high rental income. It is also likely that, to cover the listing costs and to meet all the other rules and obligations, such trusts will purchase property rather than seek to develop it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para6"><a name="06070578001202">Our view is that to encourage smaller, more focused residential trusts to deliver rented housing, the entry bar should be far lower than the stock exchange listing requirement in current legislation. For example, the minimum entry cost for introduction to the alternative investment market is about &#163;300,000. Fundraising accounts for another &#163;300,000, and there are similar commission levels of 2 to 5 per cent.; however, the ongoing advisory costs&#151;some &#163;50,000&#151;are far less than the &#163;250,000 figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06070578001203">In AIM, companies tend to be in the &#163;10 million to &#163;150 million range, with fundraising costs in the of &#163;2 million to &#163;20 million range&#151;the kind of figure that a small, locally focused residential trust might seek to raise. Further down the range is the off-exchange market, with a minimum entry figure of &#163;30,000, fundraising costs of about &#163;100,000 and similar commission levels, but with ongoing advisory costs  of some &#163;10,000. Ofex caters for businesses up to the &#163;20 million mark&#151;not a tiny sum&#151;whose fundraising costs are in the &#163;300,000 to &#163;4 million range. Of course, there is also the opportunity for any business or trust to be financed privately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06070578001204">So, given the other conditions applying to REITs&#151;not least the residency qualification&#151;there seems little logic in forcing a REIT to be quoted on the official list; indeed, in the light of the associated costs and the typical size of businesses on the list, there is almost a disincentive for local residential trusts to be created. Our amendments would eliminate that requirement from the Bill by deleting subsection (5) from clause 106, thereby removing the condition that a trust company&#146;s ordinary shares be listed on the stock exchange. The only argument previously posited in favour of full listing is that it would perhaps give confidence to investors and to those seeking to rent a property from such a trust.  <br>

However, a given individual or business will take the decision to invest or rent after applying the correct degree of scrutiny and due diligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06070578001205">Although a full listing indicates a large company with deep pockets, a small, privately funded trust&#151;or one whose shares are traded on AIM or Ofex&#151;could prove to have better local knowledge, equally experienced management and excellent internal management systems. In short, there should be no assumption that a stock exchange listed company is always a better option than one that is not listed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06070578001206">The key point is that although I welcome the creation of the REIT regime, the Government should not limit the creation of highly focused local residential trusts through the mechanism of a stock exchange entry and its associated fundraising costs. We have great hopes that REITs will complement the existing social and for-profit rented sector, but that opportunity would be enhanced by a more liberal approach to the regime&#146;s operation from the outset. I suspect that the Government have some sympathy with that argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para11"><a name="06070578001207">We want a commitment from the Government that they will move as quickly as possible to liberalise the REITs regime, in order to ensure that the hoped-for benefits in the residential sector are brought to fruition, and that REITs do not simply become players in the high-end commercial property market. I hope that, when the Minister sums up, he can guarantee, or at least hint at, the fairly speedy liberalisation of the market.

This is the fourth and penultimate time that I will speak in the Finance Bill proceedings on real estate investment trusts. Let me summarise where we are. There is a background of an all-party consensus on the need for a new investment vehicle to promote investment in residential property, attracting long-term institutional funds, broadening the market, giving a wider choice for those who want to rent and enabling private and institutional investors to get exposure to the residential property market that they do not have at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06070578001222">I remind the House that there is enormous potential here. I understand that there is a proposition to build the Olympic village through a REIT. There is also the possibility of using REITs to provide student accommodation and other opportunities. However, the key question is whether we will have the correct regime. My amendments Nos. 60 and 61 approach the problem from a slightly different angle from the one that I moved in Committee. They would amend clause 112, which introduces the entry charge, or conversion charge, which is the entry tax that must be paid to become a residential REIT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06070578001223">It is worth bringing to the House&#146;s attention the fact that the entry charge, or conversion charge, was not a feature of the regime initially proposed by Kate Barker, who focused on residential REITs. The conversion charge came on to the radar when the concept was extended from residential REITs to commercial REITs. By converting to a REIT, a quoted company will avoid capital gains tax liabilities, so to defray any possible loss of revenue, the Government decided to introduce a conversion charge to compensate the Treasury for the prospective loss of finance. I have no difficulty with that as a concept. In my view, the charge was set at a generous level, and the Minister explained how it was calculated. When the announcement was made, the market was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para27"><a name="06070578001224">Although a conversion charge might be appropriate for a commercial REIT, I argue that it is wholly inappropriate for a residential REIT. We have established that no quoted residential property company is likely to convert, so a residential REIT will have to start from scratch. In an earlier intervention, the Economic Secretary referred to 17 housing associations that are forming a consortium with a possible view to converting to a REIT. If one examines the model that that consortium will have to follow, one realises that there are severe disincentives to adopting the REIT structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para28"><a name="06070578001225">The first thing that will happen when a housing association wants to put its residential properties into a residential REIT is that it will have to pay capital gains tax on any profit from the disposal of those properties. That will crystallise a capital gains tax liability that would not have been there otherwise. Capital gains tax will have to be paid on any properties transferred from the existing portfolio to a residential REIT. Secondly, stamp duty at 4 per cent. will be payable by the REIT vehicle on purchase, and, thirdly, the REIT will have to pay a 2 per cent. charge on conversion. Those are serious disincentives before any new supply is created. If the objective is to establish a more benign fiscal regime, it is absurd to start by expecting a residential REIT to pay three taxes that it would not have to pay at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="60705-0017.htm_para29"><a name="06070578001226">I shall outline what has gone wrong. The original regime was aimed at residential REITs, but that has been transferred to cope with commercial REITs, so that regime is simply inappropriate. The Economic Secretary is frowning, but those three taxes&#151;capital gains tax, stamp duty and the conversion charge&#151;will be payable before a residential REIT gets into the business of providing new homes, which is the object of the exercise. In a sense, the commercial property companies have become the cuckoo in the nest. The  <br>

 Does the hon. Gentleman think that having smaller REITs might enable more local and regionalised funds to be brought into play? Many people feel that they would like to help particular geographical areas, rather than necessarily contributing to the national pot. The smaller ones, operating on a regional and local basis, can be very attractive.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. We discussed in earlier debates how to stimulate housing, but not just in the south-east where there are enormous stresses and strains. My hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) alludes on his website to the fact that there is already far too much house building in the south-east. If we want to stimulate such building out in the regions&#151; I see that I have finally got the attention of the Economic Secretary&#151;I suggest that we follow Schumpeter&#146;s principle that small is beautiful. If we want to encourage regional housing developments that tend to be smaller, the particular residential housing required is more likely to be of the right size to be on AIM, but not to have the wherewithal, facility or finances to list on a fully listed stock exchange.</p>

That is all we ask. We want the Economic Secretary to be open minded and watch how the market develops.

Friend the Member for Rayleigh raised&#151;that about 190 are publicly traded REITs in the USA, with assets totalling more than $475 billion. The shares of those companies are traded on major stock exchanges, which sets them apart from traditional real estate. Other REITs may be publicly registered, but non-exchange traded or even private companies. About 800 REITs are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not trade on any stock exchange. Yet, as we have heard, the US is an extremely successful market. Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as we have heard, looks to the US as an example of where a successful REIT market has been developed, and one that we should emulate.</p>

I would not go as far as to suggest that we follow the US example of having an entirely unregulated REIT market with no listing requirements at all, notwithstanding the success of the experience in the US. I ask the Government to reflect once again on the advantages of AIM, which has a simple listing requirement, a flexible regulatory approach and lower compliance costs. It is transparent, it is established and&#151;this is an extremely important point&#151;it is the world&#146;s leading market for smaller companies. I am concerned that without further consideration of the proposal introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, the Government will create an oligopoly of institutional investors. Instead of creating an inclusive, flexible and entrepreneurial REITs market, we will end up with a REITs market that is exclusive, inflexible and commercial.</p>

 Indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="60705-0018.htm_para30"><a name="06070578001287">I wish to consider whether condition 3, which requires REITs to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, is appropriate, as it excludes shares traded on the alternative investment market. My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) made an eloquent case for the inclusion of such shares. In the Committee of the whole House, however, the then Economic Secretary, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), argued against doing so, and the present Economic Secretary referred to those arguments in Standing Committee. Three arguments have been deployed including, first, the assertion that REITs require full regulatory protection, presumably to avoid a scandal. REITs are new products, so one would not want something to go wrong in the early years by listing them on AIM, which is regarded as a higher-risk market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="60705-0018.htm_para31"><a name="06070578001288">We must, however, consider AIM&#146;s role. My hon. Friend did so, and spoke about the market&#146;s success. I, too, have visited the London stock exchange website, and the very first words on the AIM homepage state that the market is</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06070578001289">Many REITs are growing businesses&#151;as a new product, they will probably grow larger&#151;so it is appropriate to list them on AIM. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) said that the market provides an opportunity for regional REITs, as did the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). That is an important element which I, as a localist, would support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06070578001290">The argument is about investors trusting the investment manager. If they want the security of a more highly regulated market, they should invest in REITs that are listed on the London stock exchange or their European equivalents. If that is what the market demands, there are unlikely to be many REITs listed on AIM. There could easily be REITs that are aimed more at institutional investors, which it would be more appropriate to list on AIM because it is less regulated and less expensive. I therefore do not find that argument entirely convincing. However, it is worth stressing that at almost every stage of the Bill, the Government said, and I hope the Economic Secretary will reiterate, that the matter will be kept under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06070578001291">When we discussed AIM in Standing Committee, the flavour of the remarks made by the Economic Secretary was that AIM was part of a transitional process: a company lists on AIM for a while, then it grows and gets a full listing. Clearly, some companies do. The figures on the London stock exchange and AIM website that were quoted by my hon. Friend show that in total 1,528 companies are listed. The total number of admissions is 2,401. Many of the 900 or so companies that are no longer listed on AIM will no doubt have a full listing. Some may not. Some may have been merged, and others may be de-listed altogether. That still leaves a substantial number, 1,528, which remain on AIM, so we should be a little careful about characterising AIM as a stage that a company passes through. It does not always work like that. For many companies it is their final destination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06070578001292">I turn to the second argument used by the former Economic Secretary, that the expression</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06070578001293">That is true, but it should not be leading policy. Just because the expression &#147;recognised stock exchange&#148; is appropriate for qualifying for an ISA, that does not seem to be a persuasive argument for it to apply to REITs and for condition 3 to be drafted as it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06070578001294">The third argument, which my hon. Friend dealt with thoroughly, was set out by the former Economic Secretary when he said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06070578001295">He made two arguments to support that. One was the cost to the Exchequer of allowing that to happen, which the former Economic Secretary said would be difficult to quantify at this point. The second was the risk for small investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06070578001296">The same points about caveat emptor, trusting the people and the reality of the risk can be made again, but I come back to what my hon. Friend said about condition 1, which states that a company must be UK resident in any event. If that is the case, it is unlikely to want to list in another EU jurisdiction. If it does, that is unlikely to be a commercial advantage in marketing it to the UK, particularly if it was listed on an EU version of the alternative investment market. That would be commercially unattractive, so companies are unlikely to do it. If it is attractive commercially, that is probably because those companies are able to overcome any reputational concerns about the particular market. If the company is able to overcome such reputational concerns, the second argument&#151;the risk to small investors&#151;is likely to fall away. The matter comes down to the issue of the cost to the Exchequer. I am sceptical that it would be extremely expensive, because, for the reasons that I have outlined, few companies will list on foreign exchanges. The leading exchange in Europe is the London stock exchange, and the leading alternative investment market in Europe  is AIM.</p>

remarks on amendment No. 130, because I was engaged in Select Committee. The Government are caught in an academic dilemma&#151;the distinction between the full market and AIM&#151;which may stem from the academic approach that the Economic Secretary has taken to many of the clauses in the Finance Bill, but I want to draw to his attention what is happening out there in the real world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06070578001301">My hon. Friends have already referred to some of these statistics. If one casts one&#146;s mind back to the beginning of this Government, one recalls that 2,704 companies were listed on the main market, and 252 companies were quoted on AIM at the beginning of 1997. As we have heard, the number of quoted companies on AIM had risen to 1,528 by the end of May, which is an increase of 1,276. Over the same period, companies were leaving the full market in droves, many as a result of takeovers and some as a result of migrating down from the main market to AIM. The numbers are revealing: there are currently 1,326 UK companies left on the main market, 29 per cent. of which are investment vehicles, which means that there are now only 939 UK trading companies on the main market. That significant reduction has been more than matched by the increase in the number of companies quoted on AIM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06070578001302">It is also revealing to discover that there are 43 real estate, holdings and development companies on the main market, yet 70 real estate, holdings and development companies are currently quoted on AIM. I contend that companies that have the choice of whether to take advantage of full market listing or to list on AIM tend to list on AIM, because of the lower costs, lighter regulation and the fact that the market has matured. AIM is now regarded as an appropriate place to gain access to capital, whereas in the early days people had their doubts. When the company that I took to market was listed in 1998, we regarded it as appropriate to go direct to the main market, although it was a small company, because there were concerns about access to capital on AIM. Those concerns have been substantially overcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06070578001303">We therefore have to ask ourselves why the Government are not prepared, at the introduction of this new regime, to sanction quotation on AIM as perfectly legitimate and appropriate for new REITs. The arguments that they advanced have been thoroughly demolished by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and, I am sure, by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, whose comments I look forward to reading tomorrow in <i> Hansard</i>. The argument advanced by the Economic Secretary in Committee&#151;that there would be a greater potential risk to investors should these shares be available on AIM&#151;is palpable nonsense. I hope that he will reflect on this debate and on what was said in Committee and will be prepared to accept amendment No. 130 if it comes to a vote.</p>

When he gets there he joins all the political societies so that he can go to hear all the speeches at all the political clubs. I did the same. I joined the Labour, Liberal and Conservative clubs and went to hear very many speeches.

I am pleased that there is cross-party support for our aims for the REITs regime.

I shall start by responding to the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) on Government amendments Nos. 27 to 30. On 2 June,  I made available to Committee members the draft excluded business regulations, which amended schedule 16. That followed a commitment made by my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), which I was keen to honour not only in the spirit but the letter to give sufficient time for proper consideration. As the hon. Member for Rayleigh reminded us, we had a detailed discussion about car parks, phone masts and other matters. I hope that we provided clarity that will give the industry a basis on which to plan ahead. During that debate,  I explained to hon. Members that a better way to effect these changes than the draft regulations would be by way of a Government amendment to the Bill as it passed through its parliamentary stages. As I explained to the Committee, the points that prompted the changes had been raised at a very late stage and it had not been possible fully to analyse the issues in time to table an amendment in Committee. Instead, we decided to expose the issues in draft regulations and to consult on the details, with the aim of making the necessary changes through amendments to be tabled on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para17"><a name="06070578001312">Government amendments Nos. 27 to 30 are the outcome of that consultation. They deal with two sets of circumstances: owner-occupied property, and property held as trading stock. Amendment No. 28, which deals with trading stock, aligns the treatment of rental income from this kind of property with that already set out for rent incidental to a trade of property development. The amendment will keep trading stock property out of the ring fence, which will mean that the incidental rent will be taxable but the measure will remove the threat of double taxation that could otherwise follow from taxation of any increase in the value of the property at conversion and the levy of an entry charge on the same value. The industry was keen for us to clarify that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para18"><a name="06070578001313">Amendments Nos. 27, 29 and 30, which deal with owner-occupied property, address two issues. The first is to ensure that rental income from owner-occupied property is excluded from the tax-exempt business of a UK REIT, as was our original policy intention. The second is to allow into the ring fence some properties that, despite be let to unconnected third-party tenants, fall to being accounted for as owner occupied. Their exclusion was an unforeseen consequence of the international accounting standards definition of &#147;owner-occupied&#148;&#151;as the hon. Member for Rayleigh pointed out&#151;and not in line with our original policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06070578001314">These changes are the result of points being brought to our notice by the industry, and I am sure that it will welcome them. They are fully consistent with the statements that I made in Standing Committee. On the definition of owner-occupied property, I can assure the hon. Member for Rayleigh and the House that we will continue to work with the industry and to listen to any issues arising on the matter. I hope that that will give him the reassurance that he seeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06070578001315">A number of issues have been raised today that pertain to the more general question of the balance between residential and commercial property. I will deal with the specific points first, and refer to the general issue at the end. I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 64 to 68, and then with amendment No. 130, which deals with the listing requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06070578001316">Amendments Nos. 64 to 68 have been tabled by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and his colleagues, and were spoken to today by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie). Taken together, they would remove altogether the requirement that a company should have its shares listed on a recognised stock exchange before it can become a UK REIT. That would allow any company to enter the regime. We have estimated that the cost of the amendments, if passed, would run not into tens or hundreds of millions of pounds but into billions of pounds. It would therefore be quite wrong to accept them. I hope, however, that in explaining why we believe that a requirement for listing is important I shall be able to give some reassurance to the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06070578001317">Amendment No. 130 also relates to the listing requirement. However, rather than removing it altogether, it seeks to extend the definition to include the alternative investment market&#151;AIM&#151;of the London stock exchange and its equivalent in the European Union. This issue was debated at length  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 July 2006">

during the Committee of the whole House, as well as in the Standing Committee. Following those Standing Committee debates, I looked again in detail at our requirement for a full stock exchange listing. As I explained to hon. Members at the time, I had come late to those debates&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South was the Minister during the Committee of the whole House&#151;and I wanted to understand the difference between a full listing on the London stock exchange and a listing on AIM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06070578001318">In passing, I want to say that I completely associate myself with what the hon. Member for Rayleigh said about the success of AIM, and its importance not only as a liquid market but a tax advantage market, compared with a full listing. Capital gains tax, inheritance tax and loss relief are all reasons why we tax advantage an AIM listing in order to bring new companies into listing. The success of London as a market that attracts listings from around the world has increased substantially over the past few years, and I am sure that the success of AIM is part of the broader success of London as a centre for listing. Therefore, I fully support the continuance and strength of AIM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06070578001319">We always aimed to ensure that the UK REIT regime would make property investment accessible to small investors in a way that was revenue neutral in tax terms while providing proper protection. The requirement for a listing on a recognised stock exchange assures investors, especially small investors, that their investments are covered by the full protection of direct regulation by the Financial Services Authority. That has a direct bearing on companies, through rules on dispersion of the share base and share approval for major transactions. An AIM listing has several tax advantages, while a full listing on the stock exchange has several more onerous requirements, ensuring proper protection for the smaller investor through direct FSA regulation, but also ensuring that the tax advantages that I set out are used for the intended purpose. We argued consistently that the right approach was to restrict the REIT regime to a full listing, partly to protect the revenue base and to ensure that it is revenue neutral, and partly to protect the small investor. We made that point consistently in consultation and in discussions with several interested parties, including the Investment Property Forum, the British Property Federation and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and our objective has always been understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para25"><a name="06070578001320">Aside from the regulatory aspects, it is important to take account of suggested changes to the rules in the context of the regime as a whole. We are considering a package of legislation and conditions that combine substantial tax advantages with substantial restrictions and protections to ensure that we achieve our objective, but in a way that does not run to substantial cost. While the costs of the Scottish National party amendments would run into billions of pounds, there is no doubt that these amendments would cost hundreds of millions of pounds, not least because allowing such listings to qualify for other European markets would run not only a regulatory risk but a financial one. As I said to the hon. Member for Rayleigh, I have considered the matter again, as I wanted to understand exactly what was happening, and we still believe that   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 July 2006">

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 917</b><br>
we have the right balance of regulation and protection to achieve a revenue neutral package and encourage the establishment of a REIT regime.</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="06070578001321"><a name="60705-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="06070578003414"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 If more companies were allowed to list as REITs on AIM, they would put their property portfolios into the REIT regime, on which a 2 per cent. entry charge would be levied, which would be revenue raising. The Economic Secretary said that part of the Government&#146;s rationale in not allowing REITs to list on AIM was to protect small investors. What is the difference in principle between small investors investing in lots of other companies listed on AIM but not in property companies listed on it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o301"><a name="06070578001322"><a name="60705-0019.htm_spnew6"><a name="06070578003415"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 We are trying to combine those protections with the revenue neutrality that I talked about. On the basis of our calculations and estimates, a substantial increase in the entry charge, above 2 per cent., would be necessary to make the proposal revenue neutral. As a whole, the package has been put together to allow substantial tax advantages while at the same time ensuring that such investments will be genuine and not for tax purposes. Removing any one of those conditions&#151;especially one as important as listing on a recognised stock exchange, which brings with it a wide range of regulatory and market-driven protections&#151;would, I fear, result in the imposition of detailed rules and potential increases in costs elsewhere, and would undermine the regime that we have put together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="60705-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06070578001323">We consulted for a long time on that regime, and responded in detail to a number of points. We have discussed today whether the Government have been willing to respond to points made in consultation during the Bill&#146;s passage so far. I do not think any Opposition Front Bencher could disagree with the proposition that we have not only consulted extensively on the REITs regime but, in very material ways, responded to what has been said. In the same spirit I took advice on not just cost, but the protection that we could give investors to ensure that their investments would genuinely fulfil their intention of investing in residential property, as opposed to merely benefiting from a tax advantage. Our judgment was that we had got things right.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="06070578001324"><a name="60705-0019.htm_spnew7"><a name="06070578003416"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 The Economic Secretary has said a number of times that the Government believe they have got the balance about right, ensuring both that the revenue base is protected and that there is enough regulation to protect investors. That would still leave  us with very large REITs, probably worth more than &#163;100 million. What will the Government do to encourage smaller trusts with a local residential focus, if the Economic Secretary is not prepared to liberalise in the way that has been suggested today?</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, which allows me to deal with the broader comments made by the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Rayleigh and, in particular, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young). I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman if I took him literally when he started talking about cuckoos.

and understanding of these matters. I am very pleased that as a result of contacts since the Committee stage, we will meet on 18 July so that I can hear from him directly about his concerns and also his ambitions for residential property investment in our country. I was also encouraged to receive a letter from him a few weeks ago, after the Committee stage, in which he told me that he had engaged in a dialogue with a housing association that is thinking of establishing a REIT. I commend him for the work he is doing to ensure that the take-up of REITs is as successful as we all want it to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="60705-0020.htm_para0"><a name="06070578001326">We are not attempting to establish a regime that will try to bias investment in one direction or another. We want a regime that is not particular, distorting or potentially inflexible in the way in which it encourages in the property sector. The right hon. Gentleman asked why the 1996 regime had been too restrictive, which is how I described it in Committee. The main problem was the fixed upper limit on the cost of each unit that could be part of the regime, which was lower than the cost of most houses. It was not successful, because most houses could not be invested in. There are no such restrictions or upper limits in our UK regime.</p>

 I welcome the Economic Secretary&#146;s approach. Does he accept, however, that while a conversion charge may be appropriate for a quoted commercial property company, it is a real disincentive to a residential REIT starting from scratch?</p>

 I think I have explained our diagnosis of the 1996 regime. I shall be happy to discuss the history at our meeting on 18 July, but I think our most important task is to ensure that the regime works. I have assured the right hon. Gentleman that we intend the regime to support investment in both commercial and residential property. I have also assured the hon. Member for Rayleigh and others that we will continue to keep the listing issue under review, and I repeat that assurance today. We do not have a closed mind. We want small investors to invest in both kinds of property under the regime. However, as I have said, on the basis of extensive consultation we believe that we are establishing the right regime, and we ask the House to support it so that we can achieve our objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="60705-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06070578001329">The problem with the amendments is that they would introduce inflexibility and distortions. They would cost substantial amounts of money or would increase the entry charge for other aspects of the regime. The danger is that the amendments would also encourage people to manipulate their affairs to qualify for more generous tax reliefs if they presented their REIT in one way rather than another. That would be a retrograde step. I ask the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire to retain his interest in these matters but to support the regime that the Government propose.</p>

Member for Rayleigh, we always imagined that the commercial property sector would make its intentions clear earlier, because of the scale and sophistication of its operations, but that it would take more time for housing associations and some other smaller investors on the residential side to consider the way forward. We are encouraged by the fact that discussions are continuing.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06070578002404">I should like to take the opportunity to thank all hon. Members who participated in Committee of the whole House and Standing Committee. Our debates have again been detailed, ensuring effective scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06070578002405">The Budget that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor presented to the House in March set out a vision for a strong economy and a fair society, with opportunity and security for all. The Bill delivers measures to enhance productivity, help create a fairer society, protect the environment and safeguard the revenues that are needed to deliver high-quality public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06070578002406">The Bill introduces two new tax regimes&#151;the real estate investment trusts&#151;REITs&#151;and the film tax, which have been warmly welcomed by stakeholders. The real estate investment trusts, which clauses 103 to 145 introduce, will improve the efficiency of our property markets and allow smaller investors greater access to property returns. Clauses 31 to 53 introduce a new and generous film tax relief, which will provide better targeted and more direct support straight to film production companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06070578002407">The Government believe that, in a modern and fair tax system, we need to keep pace with a changing world. We need a tax system in which everyone pays their fair share of tax. To build a fairer tax system, we must take action against those who seek to avoid paying their fair share or set out to defraud the Exchequer. The Bill therefore takes action against tax avoidance, which distorts markets and adds no value to the UK economy. The vast majority of taxpayers do not engage in avoidance, and it would be inappropriate and unfair if the Government failed to act against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06070578002408">Disclosures have enabled Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to become aware that a minority of employers are using highly contrived schemes to avoid paying income tax and national insurance contributions on their earnings. In 2004, the Government announced that they would take action against any such complex and contrived avoidance schemes, if necessary with effect from the date of that announcement. That is exactly what the Finance Bill does, and it is right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06070578002409">It should also be clear to anyone in this House and outside that paying tax should not be voluntary. Before the Budget it became clear that some wealthy individuals were using trusts as a way to shelter wealth from inheritance tax, and schedule 20 addresses that unfairness, bringing the tax regime for accumulation and maintenance trusts and interest in possession trusts in line with mainstream rules for the taxation of trusts and discretionary trusts.</p>

 No.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06070578002412">It is also important that our tax regime remains relevant in a changing world. The Bill changes the tax regime for the North sea oil companies to reflect the world as it is today, while continuing to promote investment in the North sea and to ensure fairness for taxpayers. The North sea is a national resource and it is important that the United Kingdom receives an appropriate share of the economic rent from its exploitation, and of course it is also important in this area and others that the tax system does not provide artificial incentives to indulge in non-commercial tax-driven behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06070578002413">Yesterday there was a very full debate on the importance of protecting the environment, a goal that the Government share, and measures in the Bill help to achieve that by introducing further reforms to vehicle excise duty and increasing the climate change levy in line with inflation from 1 April 2007, to encourage energy efficiency in the business sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06070578002414">The Bill introduces important measures that ensure that the United Kingdom has a modern and fair tax system which keeps pace with a changing world, with incentives for individuals to work, save and invest, supporting business and individuals, while ensuring that public money is used appropriately. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

Before turning to the provisions&#151;I assure the House that I am not going to take each one in turn&#151;I echo the right hon. Lady&#146;s thanks to all the Members who have participated in what has often been a very constructive series of debates. I want also to put on record the debt of gratitude that my Front-Bench colleagues and I owe to many professionals and professional organisations that have given us impartial and very useful advice to aid us in scrutinising the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06070578002418">We welcome also the attempt by the Government in clauses 95 to 98 to provide a legal and tax framework to accommodate sharia-compliant finance arrangements of wakala and diminishing musharaka. I acknowledge the valuable work done by the Government on this issue, which is important not only for our international competitiveness in an increasingly important global market in Islamic finance but for tackling financial exclusion in Britain&#146;s Muslim community. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to one of the imams in Barnet, Mufti Barkatullah, for his work on this important matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06070578002419">We also welcome, as we have said this afternoon, the Government&#146;s framework for real estate investment trusts. We feel that the reform is long overdue, since such structures have been in place in other developed economies with great success for many years. We also feel that more could be done to encourage residential property in REITs, and we continue to believe that REITs quoted on the alternative investment market would be feasible and a sensible extension of the framework provided for in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06070578002420">Although we welcome clause 19, on cracking down on missing trader fraud, we want to know when the Treasury will get the EU derogation that it needs to put the clause into operation. We are grateful for the assurances given on that point by the Paymaster General. I emphasise again the urgency of tackling this problem, which as we have heard again today is estimated to have lost the Exchequer about &#163;1.9 billion in 2004-05. The problem is now so serious that it is undermining the accuracy of our trade figures, and it is high time the Government took effective action to tackle this organised criminal fraud, which is depriving the Exchequer of so much money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para22"><a name="06070578002421">I move on to more contentious matters. One of the main reasons for opposing the Bill is that we do not believe that it is a green Bill. We do not believe that it implemented a green Budget. The Red Book shows that the proportion of green taxes is falling as a proportion of tax revenue. It is lower than it was in 1997-98. The Chancellor&#146;s headline-grabbing scheme on car tax will have a minimal impact. Anyone who delves into the small print will find that schedule 8 abolishes tax incentives for leasing environmentally friendly equipment. We regret that the Government voted down the entirely reasonable demand that the Chancellor report to Parliament on the uptake of crucial microgeneration technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para23"><a name="06070578002422">As for the climate change levy, sticking in the words &#147;climate change&#148; does not mean that the levy works to tackle climate change. It is a tax that does not do what it says on the tin. Yes, some of the climate change agreements that the levy has produced have been useful but the fundamental problem remains that it is a tax on energy and not on carbon. It needs to be converted into a genuine carbon tax that does much more to encourage and promote the uptake of clean renewable energy than it does at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para24"><a name="06070578002423">The second key reason for opposing the Bill is that we believe that it will further undermine our competitiveness in an international world economy. The Chartered Institute of Taxation put the problem in measured terms as follows:</p>

Our experience is that the UK is becoming regarded as a more difficult place to do business, with the complexity of the tax system being perceived as a disincentive to invest.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para25"><a name="06070578002424">The institute describes the UK tax system as &#147;spinning out of control&#148;.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para27"><a name="06070578002426">The abolition of the zero per cent. rate of corporation tax and other changes to business tax relief are prime examples of chronic instability in our tax regime. Year in and year out, the Chancellor announces initiatives that make a good soundbite in the Budget. He is not in his place today but he turns up for the Budget. Businesses carry out the difficult, time-consuming and expensive task of adapting to yet more changes in the tax system. Just as they have become used to those changes, the Chancellor scraps them and his cycle of continuing revolution continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para28"><a name="06070578002427">This pattern of volatility recurs in clauses 31 to 47, in introducing a new regime for the film industry. The Chancellor introduced major changes to film tax in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2002 and 2004-05. Yet still the reliefs haemorrhaged a staggering &#163;560 million from the Exchequer in the past financial year. An entire industry has developed around the misuse of these reliefs. The Opposition certainly hope that the Government&#146;s latest attempt to focus tax breaks more accurately on people making films will provide better value for money than reliefs have proved to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para29"><a name="06070578002428">We are not sorry to see the back of the sections 42 and 48 reliefs. We hope that the Government have at last got it right; otherwise, expect &#147;Groundhog Day&#148; this time next year with yet more changes to the film tax regime in the Finance Bill 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para30"><a name="06070578002429">The continual cycle of change has produced a huge amount of uncertainty in the film industry and has jeopardised some important projects. For example, the filming of the latest James Bond film has moved to the Czech Republic. Even the Government&#146;s most famous civil servant has moved offshore, partly as a result of the instability caused by changes in the film tax regime. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para31"><a name="06070578002430">I move on to a rather less glamorous aspect of the Bill. Schedules 8 to 10 introduce what the Finance and Leasing Association describes as the biggest change to leasing taxation for a generation. A thriving leasing industry is crucial for business investment and productivity, both of which have performed poorly under Labour. We are not convinced that the Government have fully thought through the impact of these eye-wateringly complex new provisions, given their impact on business investment, on indirect investment and on the public sector. These areas face higher leasing costs as a result of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para32"><a name="06070578002431">We are dismayed at the phenomenal complexity of pension provisions, supposedly adopted with a view to simplification. We believe that the Government&#146;s attempts to prevent recycling of lump sums could discourage people from saving for their old age. The provisions are incredibly widely drafted. The Economic Secretary tells us, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, innocent transactions will be excluded by detailed guidelines.&#148; It is not acceptable to draft a hugely expansive statutory  <br>

provision that catches many entirely innocent taxpayers and then to say, &#147;It is OK because we will not tax everyone who falls within the statute. We will only tax the bad guys.&#148; This is suspiciously close to taxation by decree. That is why Opposition Members oppose the provisions. We regret that the Government have failed to address the injustices caused by the annuity rule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para33"><a name="06070578002432">We strongly oppose the Government&#146;s hare-brained proposal to bring forward the filing dates for tax returns to September. The Carter report would involve a huge amount of unnecessary hassle for taxpayers and would impose great pressure on their professional advisors, so we urge the Government to reject it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para34"><a name="06070578002433">The abolition of the home computing initiative is a major blow to the competitiveness of the economy. Thousands of low-income families, many of whom would find it difficult to obtain credit to buy a personal computer on the open market, have benefited from the scheme. The Government&#146;s decision to abolish a scheme that it recently relaunched does not help us to embrace the digital age or develop the highly skilled work force that we desperately need to compete with the new global economic giants of China and India. It does not help the Government Departments that were rolling out the scheme when the Chancellor&#146;s axe fell; nor will it help working people in Britain to develop a good work-life balance; nor does it help people striving to improve their skills and their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="60705-0021.htm_para35"><a name="06070578002434">In conclusion, the Opposition oppose the Bill, because it fails to equip us to compete effectively in the globalised world economy. It heaps further confusion, complication and instability on a tax system that the Chancellor has made one of the most complex in the developed world. It contains no effective measures to tackle climate change, and despite the Chancellor&#146;s ignominious retreat on a range of key issues, schedule 20 still imposes punitive new inheritance tax charges on a wide range of ordinary hard-working people whose only wrongdoing is to use a trust to provide responsibly and prudently for their family&#146;s future. Those iniquitous new IHT charges were introduced without consultation. They are deeply flawed, which is why the Government have tabled no fewer than 50 amendments to the schedule that brings them into effect. They are retrospective, and they penalise thrift and prudence. They hit the sick, the dying, the mentally ill and the vulnerable, as well as those struggling with the misery of divorce. They have caused needless anxiety to thousands of people across the country, and I urge the House to oppose them and the Bill this evening.</p>

 We support certain parts of the Bill, but some of the serious concerns that we expressed on Second Reading remain on Third Reading. However, we broadly welcome the proposals on real estate investment trusts, which are a classic example of the way in which consultation can produce workable legislation. The proposals have been welcomed by industry, because the Government took time to consult, so we largely support them. By contrast, the Government did not consult professionals on their inheritance tax treatment of trusts, and the result was poorly drafted proposals that would have affected large  <br>

numbers of individuals and called into question fundamental assumptions in IHT such as the spouse exemption. Dozens of amendments were tabled to improve the proposals. The spouse exemption has been safeguarded, but it is still not clear how many individuals will be affected by the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para0"><a name="06070578002436">Ministers continue to insist that a minority of a minority will be affected, but they have failed to produce evidence to back that up. The Select Committee on Treasury asked for background information before the Standing Committee considered the issue, but it was not produced. I asked for that information in written parliamentary questions, only to be told that it was not normal procedure to release it. There is a significant public interest in making that information available, as it would allay the fears of many people who are still concerned that they will be affected by the changes, so I hope that Ministers will reconsider their decision and publish the information. Despite the many amendments made in Committee and on Report, uncertainty remains, so I am sure that we will revisit the relevant clauses and schedules in future Finance Bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para1"><a name="06070578002437">Other changes that were made without any warning include the withdrawal of the home computer initiative, which is another example of the Government throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Indeed, they abolished the initiative without prior warning or consultation. Instead of tightening the definition of relevant equipment, they have removed the scheme altogether, even though it helped to achieve computer access for many households, including low-income households. Besides affecting those families, the scheme&#146;s sudden withdrawal has resulted in businesses losing their core work, and has disrupted Government Departments that were planning further roll-outs when the withdrawal was announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para2"><a name="06070578002438">Confidence in any similar schemes that may be announced by the Government has been affected because, ultimately, businesses need to be certain of the stability of the systems that they use. Once again, however, that confidence has been undermined or eroded. One has only to look at the changes to corporation tax to see how further instability and complication have been introduced. Gordon Brown has introduced changes virtually every year, and although we welcome the situation that we are now in, why has it taken the Chancellor such a long and circuitous route to arrive back exactly where he started?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para3"><a name="06070578002439">There have been many measures to tackle fraud and evasion, including missing trader fraud, which we discussed again this afternoon. Although the closure of loopholes in the tax system is welcome, considerable complexity has been added to the tax system by the Bill, and the concern is that it will result in a cat and mouse process, with further complication required every year to overcome further loopholes that have been created by further more complex legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06070578002440">Fundamentally, we see the significance of the Bill in what it does not do, mainly in terms of green action. Limited changes are present in the Bill. We welcome the revalorisation of fuel duty and the climate change levy, but at best these measures will only halt the decline that we have seen in green taxes as a proportion of the total tax take. They will not increase the proportion that it represents. We are disappointed that the Government  <br>

did not adopt the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), as it would have helped make strategy, which is clearly lacking from the Government and the Treasury, very clear. I find it astounding that the Paymaster General can refer to the constructive debate that took place on the new clause yesterday, but refuse to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06070578002441">What we see in the Bill is tokenism of the worst kind, which has been announced with fanfare but will do next to nothing to change behaviour. The clearest example is the introduction of a new band of vehicle excise duty for the most polluting cars, which introduces a differential in value to the next band down equivalent to less than a tank of petrol for the most polluting cars. I was glad to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) about those proposals in her remarks on Third Reading, but we saw no proposals from the Conservatives for green measures. We have seen tokenism from those on the Conservative Benches, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06070578002442">To conclude, what we would like to have seen but in large part did not see is action to follow the rhetoric that is so often expressed by the Government on green issues and on many other important matters. We have not seen any significant simplification of our tax regime. We have not seen any changes to make the tax regime fairer. Inequalities are still growing, and the richest 20 per cent. are still paying less in tax as a proportion of their income than the poorest. We have also not seen any greater devolution of spending power in the Bill. The United Kingdom remains one of the most centralised states in Europe.</p>

 It is 10 years since I last served on the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill, and it will be 10 years before I do that again.

On the contrary, it is a reflection of the increased length and complexity of the Finance Bill that only those with the most acute understanding of the country&#146;s tax system can play a useful role on the Standing Committee. It is rather like a soap opera. If one misses a few episodes, it is very difficult to catch up with the plot.</p>

 Unlike my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), this was my first experience of the Finance Bill, and I want to make one or two observations. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that hon. Members are keen to watch France play Portugal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06070584000022">As we have progressed through the Bill, I have been surprised by how frequently the European Union has cropped up. On Second Reading I addressed the question of why we are substantially changing group relief as a consequence of a European Court of Justice judgment. That is usually an important issue, yet the UK Government have little scope for manoeuvre given the existing constitutional position. Several times during the Bill&#146;s passage&#151;for example, when we attempted to tackle missing trader intra-community fraud, leasing rules or film taxation&#151;we found that the motivation for changing the law was that it was required by an ECJ judgment or potential judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para19"><a name="06070584000023">I echo the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire as regards the sheer complexity of the tax system and, as a consequence, the need for outside expert advice. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Economic Secretary anticipates my point. An error or oversight by Treasury officials was spotted by an eagle-eyed professional adviser&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Name her!&#148;] Her name is Mrs. Rachel Gauke, a lawyer at Travis Smith. It would be fair to say that other errors have been spotted by professional advisers who are not necessarily as eagle-eyed as my wife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para20"><a name="06070584000024">The Government got themselves in a bit of a muddle on their initial drafting with regard to trusts. They attempted to tackle it without consultation, so that professional advisers were unable to provide their input, although they did when the draft Bill was published. To be fair, I must add that the Government have made a substantial number of amendments in that area, for which I am grateful. We now have a better Bill than we did initially&#151;better, but not good enough. The complexity in the tax system remains considerable. Speaking as a non-tax lawyer, it is always difficult to grasp even the relatively small elements that we cover in the course of a Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="60705-0022.htm_para21"><a name="06070584000025">As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire said, we live in a globalised world where capital flows from one jurisdiction to another, and we have to be careful to ensure that we have a fair system that not only deals with evasion but is manageable for individuals and for businesses. Conservative Members are deeply concerned that that balance is increasingly being got wrong, which is of major concern for the long-term competitiveness of the British economy.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para6"><a name="06070584000537">I am grateful for the opportunity to convey to the Minister the concerns of my constituents about the proposed reorganisation of the ambulance service in Teesdale by the North East ambulance service. Let me begin by describing, very briefly, the area affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para7"><a name="06070584000538">Teesdale is in the western part of my constituency, and measures 325 square miles. The valley consisting of several villages west of Barnard Castle has some 10,000 inhabitants, and 29 per cent. of the population are over the age of 65&#151;twice the national average. The region is an area of outstanding natural beauty and attracts many tourists and other visitors, who unfortunately sometimes come to grief on the 200 miles of B and C roads. There are also four large trunk roads&#151;the A66, the A67, the A68 and the A688&#151;where serious accidents sometimes occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para8"><a name="06070584000539">At present, there are two ambulance stations in the area, one in Middleton in Teesdale and one in Barnard Castle, with a total of seven staff working 12-hour shifts and then being on stand-by for 12 hours at night. They have to live within 3 miles of the station so that if they receive urgent calls, they can arrive in time. Under the current rules governing response times, 75 per cent. of life-threatening accidents&#151;accidents in category A&#151;must be reached within eight minutes, while 95 per cent. of category B accidents, involving serious injury, must be reached within 19 minutes. Category C accidents can involve alternative kinds of treatment, but category D requires &#147;GP urgent&#148; calls, and the GP will say what the time should be. Those rules were set by the NHS, and I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para9"><a name="06070584000540">According to figures from Durham Dales primary care trust, more than 40 night-time emergency calls were received in Teesdale in 2005&#151;the most recent year for which statistics are available&#151;of which 95 per cent. fell into categories A or B, or were &#147;urgent GP&#148; calls. As local GPs have confirmed, that means that in most cases those affected needed hospital treatment. There were 7.5 per cent. more calls than in the previous year. Incidentally, that picture is very different from the national one, in which 70 per cent. of 999 ambulance calls do not fall into the very urgent categories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para10"><a name="06070584000541">As the Durham Dales PCT says, NEAS has consistently met national response times to save patients&#146; lives, and that has been recognised by the award of a three-star rating for the past four years. That is why people locally find it hard to understand why changes need to be made. In two respects, the situation in Teesdale is different from that in the other rural areas in the north-east, such as Weardale and  <br>

Northumberland. First, Teesdale is more populous. One of the complaints local people have made is that the level of calls in Teesdale is higher than in Amble or Belford, which are not being reorganised in this way. Secondly, it has not been difficult to recruit staff, which was a problem in Weardale. I am concerned that NEAS, in its enthusiasm for efficient administration, has treated all the rural areas as homogenous, when they are of course quite different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para11"><a name="06070584000542">The original proposal from NEAS was to close the ambulance stations in Middleton in Teesdale and in Barnard Castle and replace them with single paramedics. That proposal was totally unacceptable, as the nearest hospitals are 30 to 40 minutes away in Bishop Auckland and Darlington, so the time taken to reach hospital would have been extended by 40 to 50 minutes, as the paramedics would first have had to attend and make an assessment. Moreover, the idea would not have met national guidelines. It provoked local people, including health professionals, those working in the service and the patient and public involvement forum. I have received a petition signed by 5,000 people, 3,620 of whom live in Teesdale&#151;a third of the whole community affected. The petition makes it clear that they want a double-crewed paramedic ambulance 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para12"><a name="06070584000543">Following much work and activism by local people, NEAS has modified its proposal, but I am afraid that it is still putting forward a solution that appears at first sight to be worse than the current one. I shall therefore ask my hon. Friend for some clarifications and assurances. NEAS now proposes to close the Middleton in Teesdale station only. No reason has been given for that. My hon. Friend needs to understand that Middleton in Teesdale is some 12 miles from Barnard Castle. It takes half an hour to get to Middleton in Teesdale, and that time will be added to all journeys to the upper dale, including those to large road accidents on the A roads in the Pennines. Furthermore, it would probably be slower than having people on stand-by in Middleton in Teesdale. Would it be possible to retain the Middleton in Teesdale station? If not, why not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para13"><a name="06070584000544">As I have explained, the original proposal was that a paramedic would arrive on a motorbike and not be able to take a person to hospital straight away. Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm whether, under the revised proposal, the paramedic will always arrive with an ambulance, which can take the person to hospital immediately, if necessary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para14"><a name="06070584000545">A third issue that staff have raised with me is the medical qualifications of the emergency care assistants who drive the ambulance, which will be less than those of existing ambulance staff. That does not seem to be very safe, especially for complex problems or where more than one person has been injured, say in a car accident. Surely that marks a worsening of the service and patient care. My understanding is that no job description has been agreed with the trade union, Unison, for the new care assistants. Is Teesdale being used as a guinea pig to test a new practice, in the hope that it can be rolled out nationally if the ambulance service thinks that it works well?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para15"><a name="06070584000546">The latest document from the Durham Dales PCT makes much of the overall increase in staff numbers in the service. Incidentally, I would be interested to know  <br>

why the new arrangements will leave Weardale and Teesdale with the same number of staff, when Teesdale has three times as many calls as Weardale. More fundamentally, the paper from Durham Dales PCT states that</p>
<a name="60705-0023.htm_brev5"><a name="06070584001514"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Community Paramedics will take on a number of other roles in general practice and the wider community.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para16"><a name="06070584000547">That sounds like an ambulance driver cum health visitor cum district nurse role, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of time will be spent in each role. How will that fit in with other work? What would happen, for example, if a community paramedic was helping an old person with medication and an emergency call came in?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para17"><a name="06070584000548">I have some questions about the funding implications in respect of the extra paramedics. Will the PCT, which ultimately pays for the service, have to cut other services to finance the proposals? Has extra money gone into the budget for this year and successive years to pay the additional staff costs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para18"><a name="06070584000549">My hon. Friend the Minister should be aware of the wider context of the proposal. First, the air ambulance service in the north of England is continuing to struggle financially. The NEAS says that it does not rely on the service, although it is invaluable, so can my hon. Friend tell the House how many times the service has been used in the area over the past two years? As I am sure she is aware, the air ambulance service relies entirely on voluntary donations&#151;unlike Scotland, where it is state funded&#151;and recently one of the helicopters was grounded due to shortage of funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para19"><a name="06070584000550">Secondly, there is an interrelationship between the proposed reorganisation and the ending of the GP out-of-hours service in Teesdale, which is another local concern. Soon, there will be no GP service in the evenings or from early evening on Friday until Monday morning, which is 60 hours in total. As the nearest hospital is in Bishop Auckland, 20 miles away, it is highly likely that the ending of that service, coupled with the NEAS reorganisation, will further increase the number of ambulance calls. Has that possibility been taken into account in the proposals?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para20"><a name="06070584000551">The most important thing is that the ambulance service retains the confidence of local people. Chapter 7 of the recent health White Paper, &#147;Our health, our care, our say&#148;, is headed &#147;Ensuring our reforms put people in control&#148; and states:</p>
<a name="60705-0023.htm_brev6"><a name="06070584001515"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;People&#146;s voices need to be heard and they have to count. This includes everyone, including groups such as children and young people who do not always have the choice to participate...Commissioning must be informed by people&#146;s voices and be responsive. Local people must play a role in the planning, design and delivery of services.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para21"><a name="06070584000552">The people of Teesdale have spoken. I hope that they will be heard.</p>

County Durham and the Tees valley area who have made such great progress in improving the NHS. I am sure that my hon. Friend will join me in praising the work of NHS staff in helping to make some of the improvements in her local area. Some of the funding increases for PCTs in her area have contributed to more doctors and nurses and to cuts in waiting times in recent years. We all welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para22"><a name="06070584000554">Real progress has been made in the health service in my hon. Friend&#146;s area, but alongside record levels of investment, we must recognise that reform is certainly needed to deliver the NHS fit for purpose in the 21st century that we all want. It is vital that the local NHS can consult local people, and I shall set out some of the structures for doing that later in my speech. As my hon. Friend rightly said, it is important that the views of local people are taken into account. That is why many NHS organisations are looking, with local stakeholders, at changes in the organisation of their services. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that, as we see different roles emerge for staff and changes in technology, there is more that we can do to meet patients&#146; needs, and that it is important that we take those steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para23"><a name="06070584000555">My hon. Friend asked a number of questions about the background to why changes are being made to the rural ambulance service in County Durham. In June 2005, the Department published the results of our national review of ambulance services&#151;carried out in conjunction with staff&#151;which examined some of the associated clinical issues and the changes that we wanted to make to services. That review set out how we can transform such services, moving them away from a focus primarily on resuscitation, trauma and acute care, and toward becoming a mobile health resource for the whole NHS that takes health care to patients in the community, rather than always transporting them to emergency care. We certainly support the review and we are considering how we can implement the recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para24"><a name="06070584000556">As my hon. Friend said, her constituency is served by the North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which is made up of dedicated and hard-working staff. As a result of their dedication, increased investment and wide-ranging reform of working practices over the past six years, ambulance performance has improved, as my hon. Friend mentioned. The local ambulance service is now reaching more patients with life-threatening conditions faster than ever before. In 2004-05, the service responded to 77.4 per cent. of category A calls within eight minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para25"><a name="06070584000557">However, there is always scope for further improvement, and Durham Dales primary care trust, which commissions ambulance services in the area, has launched a 12-week public consultation exercise on proposals to modernise them. The trust&#146;s vision is to provide an equitable emergency care service across the whole area. As my hon. Friend said, the PCT is currently serviced by three standby stations. Staff who have been on duty during the day at those stations are also expected to be available to respond to emergency calls and GP-urgent calls from their own homes at night. So at the moment, the crew are alerted by ambulance control at their homes, they get dressed, travel to the station, pick up the ambulance and respond to the incident. Inevitably, that results in delays, and response times are not always being  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 947</b><br>
achieved, due to that delayed action at night. Unfortunately, that can of course mean that patients do not always get the best service that we want to see, and the long hours that crews are required to work are detrimental to their health and well-being, as well as to the overall provision of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para26"><a name="06070584000558">The new proposals represent &#163;200,000 in additional investment in ambulance services, which is very important. My hon. Friend asked whether that will be to the detriment of other services, but we should consider the knock-on effects of a reduction in emergency admissions as a result of introducing a new service. It is important to provide that additional investment, and I hope that that gives my hon. Friend some reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para27"><a name="06070584000559">Standby working practices will be replaced by 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week cover for the communities in Durham Dales, which will ensure proper round-the-clock cover at all times. As my hon. Friend said, the current staff of 11 will be increased to 22 and will comprise 12 community paramedics and 10 emergency care assistants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para28"><a name="06070584000560">Each ambulance will be staffed by a two-person crew. There will be a highly qualified community paramedic who will be trained to respond quickly, assess and treat patients, and, if necessary, transport them to hospital. An emergency care assistant will be trained to the equivalent level of first aid responders and will also be qualified to drive an ambulance under blue light conditions. That was changed during the pre-consultation period to ensure that an ambulance with a two-person crew would be available at all call-outs. I hope that that addresses my hon. Friend&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para29"><a name="06070584000561">That is very much in keeping with the Department&#146;s wish to transform the service nationally. That is some of the background. Community paramedics will differ from traditional ambulance crews in that they will work more closely with other health care professionals. For example, working alongside GPs, they will be trained to a higher skill level in areas that will best meet the clinical needs of the community that they are serving. For example, they will be able to treat patients in the community or in a surgery, carry out urgent home visits on behalf of a GP, and assist nurses with tasks such as taking blood, immunisations and monitoring heart rhythm. As a result of those changes, the local health service will be able to make sure that it is making the best use of resources, providing more convenient services from the patient&#146;s point of view, and, of course, developing team working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="60705-0023.htm_para30"><a name="06070584000562">Coming back to the wider benefits, more patients being treated in the community will mean fewer unnecessary accident and emergency attendances, which is important when we think about a lot of our constituents, who might be taken to an accident and emergency department because they were not treated at home or in a GP&#146;s surgery when they could have been. Once in hospital, it is much more difficult to get out. If we can prevent those unnecessary admissions, it is better for patients and better for the local NHS. However, responding to 999 calls will always be the priority. As is the case now, should there be a serious incident, the ambulance service will always deploy additional ambulances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para0"><a name="06070584000563">Two double-crew community paramedic ambulances will cover the Teesdale and Weardale areas. The two new bases in the Durham Dales will be for equipment storage and routine vehicle maintenance, replacing the three current stations. The two new ambulances bases would be in Stanhope to cover Weardale, to improve response times to emergency calls, and in Barnard Castle to serve the Teesdale area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para1"><a name="06070584000564">Ambulance cover in my hon. Friend&#146;s area is provided across three stations, as she said: St. John&#146;s Chapel, Middleton in Teesdale and Barnard Castle. I am aware of her concerns that these proposals would mean the closure of Middleton station, but it is important to note that Barnard Castle and Middleton in Teesdale currently operate as a single unit. As such, ambulance cover in Teesdale is based in Middleton for only one week in three. For the other two weeks, ambulance cover is provided from Barnard Castle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para2"><a name="06070584000565">Establishing the community paramedic base in Barnard Castle will formalise that shared rota arrangement. It means that there will be a greater number of staff and a higher quality of service. Barnard Castle has been indicated as the proposed site because its population is 5,326, which is several times larger than that of Middleton in Teesdale. The analysis of calls shows that there are twice as many calls from Barnard Castle as from Middleton. Barnard Castle is centrally located. It is important to stress that no final decisions have been taken and that none will be made until after the public consultation exercise. I will run through exactly how that is taking place a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para3"><a name="06070584000566">The existing system is slightly outdated for a modern ambulance service. Such a service needs to be responsive to the needs of patients and to improve the working lives of staff. We must consider whether the kind of stand-by arrangement about which we have talked really offers an acceptable work-life balance for ambulance staff. I understand that some staff in the stand-by stations approached the ambulance service to request a change to working practices. In addition, as my hon. Friend said, it is effectively a condition of employment at present that crews must live no more than 10 minutes away from the ambulance station. That can place restrictions on the recruitment pool that is available, and although that might not be a problem at the moment, it is important to think about the future. I understand that the PCT is keen to talk to local schools about recruitment to, and career prospects in, the ambulance service so that people continue to be encouraged to come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para4"><a name="06070584000567">I hope that I can assure my hon. Friend that the review is about achieving better response times. It shows a desire to do more for local communities and to work in partnership with primary care. It is not a cost-saving exercise, and there will be &#163;200,000 of additional investment. My hon. Friend asked where some of the changes came from. The community paramedic concept certainly arose from to a desire to provide fast response times to life-threatening emergencies in rural areas. She asked about the national roll-out, and such a system has been introduced successfully in several other rural ambulance services. As I said, staff numbers will be increased from 11 to 22.</p>

As she will know, it is funded by a charity, and it is not possible to give completely accurate figures. However, I believe that since the service commenced, it has attended about 8,000 incidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="60705-0024.htm_para6"><a name="06070584000569">My hon. Friend talked about the importance of public consultation and the local voice being heard. It is important to remember that the NHS has a legal responsibility to promote public involvement and consultation under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. I know that an extensive public engagement process took place from July to October 2005, which included public and council meetings at which patients and the public were given the opportunity to comment. Given what my hon. Friend said about the petition, people certainly seem to know about the proposals. The PCT and the ambulance service examined closely the views that had been expressed when it considered the proposal to replace the stand-by working practice with the new way of working. As I said, several changes were made to the proposals at the pre-consultation stage. For example, there will be crews of two persons, rather than one.</p>

period has closed, the feedback will be considered by Durham Dales PCT, which will take into account the results of that consultation before making its final decision. I would really like to assure my hon. Friend. While she has obviously reflected some of the local concerns, it is important to remember that the consultation is guided by the attempt to improve services for patients while also seeking to improve the working lives of staff. It is important that the extra investment is accompanied by the sort of modernisation that we have talked about.</p>

If we can secure a system that achieves that while at the same time encouraging people to join the ambulance service and to feel that they have a good career structure within it, that is the way to proceed. I know that my hon. Friend has engaged with the local NHS on the way forward and I encourage her to continue to do so. I know that she will reflect her constituents&#146; views during the consultation period and I hope that, in the end, we arrive at a system that improves patient services as well as the working lives of staff.</p>
