<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41117-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 The Government are determined that existing communities will share fully in the benefits of the big new investment to support housing growth in the Thames gateway. I am pleased to say that only last week the Government announced &#163;100 million of funding to new Thames gateway projects, aimed at improving educational, health, environmental and transport provision in the gateway. Since last year, the Government&#039;s investment in community improvements in the gateway has risen to &#163;475 million.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41117-01_spnew0"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 I am grateful for that reply from my right hon. Friend. May I extol the virtues of the All Saints neighbourhood project? It is essential, if the gateway is to develop successfully, that the existing communities not only feel the benefits but are part of the development. That will include not just shiny new buildings away from some of the poorer areas in the Medway towns, but improvements in street lighting, the environment and safety&#151;all the things that impact on people&#039;s daily lives when they open their front doors. When my right hon. Friend is giving out the money, will he ensure that councils and other delivery units engage with the communities, especially those in Chatham?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41117-01_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 My hon. Friend may extol to his heart&#039;s content, because he is right in everything that he says. He is right about the Chatham social regeneration project, which was one of the successful projects and will, following our announcement last week, receive &#163;550,000 from my Department. That project covers streetscape and public realm improvements in the area around Luton Arches in his constituency and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>environmental enhancements to Fort Amherst. The project also builds on the &#163;10 million ODPM allocation for the regeneration of Chatham town centre.

 (Con): Unlike the rest of the Government&#039;s community plans, the Thames gateway project has merit, but serious concerns about the infrastructure, the environment and community buy-in were raised in the recent debate by the hon. Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw), for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) and for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas). What specific steps will the Minister take, beyond the usual consultation procedures and representative process, to ensure that the existing population&#039;s interests are taken fully into account? The people of the Medway towns, Bexleyheath and Ilford want action, not just more talk from this lacklustre ministerial team in a careless Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41117-01_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman does his best, but it is a dismal effort. We did have a debate on the Thames gateway on Monday evening and the immense benefits that the scheme will confer on local communities were universally acknowledged by all the hon. Members who contributed. The fact is that absolutely every aspect of the investment programme in the Thames gateway is based on the involvement of local communities. Indeed, the entire mechanism for the delivery of the Thames gateway project is based on local delivery vehicles.

 (Lab): In my constituency, we have had a &#163;100 million bridge and a &#163;25 million new ring road. We are grateful for those and we are looking forward to the development of the Thames gateway. In conjunction with the housing projection for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, will my right hon. Friend produce an infrastructure audit, so that we will get the schools, the GPs&#039; surgeries and so on at the same time as the housing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41117-01_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right, and to his list of transport investments in his constituency we can add the Sittingbourne learning hub, the Elmley Sheppey building crafts centre to train apprentices, and the Sheerness children and family centre. All of those are benefits conferred as a result of the Thames gateway projects. He is also right that we need to bring in the necessary health and education provision simultaneously with the housing developments. My Department is working closely with other Departments to ensure that such simultaneous delivery is secured.

Given that in the north-east the people voted overwhelmingly&#151;by 78&nbsp;per cent. to 22 per cent.&#151;not to have a regional assembly, those bodies now lack any political or moral authority. Should not we now abolish those white elephants and hand planning powers back to locally elected authorities where they rightfully belong?

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41117-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No, and let me quote someone on this subject:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Despite the north-east vote, there will still be a requirement for effective regional planning functions, provision of democratic mandate for the regions and effective scrutiny of other regional bodies&#151;a role in which the assembly and other voluntary chambers have shown themselves to be extremely competent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the North West regional assembly does a very good job, as does the Northwest Development Agency, in considering strategic issues in the north-west? Does he further agree that the result of the vote in the north-east the other week in no way diminishes the fact that, at the end of the day, there is still a very strong case for democratic accountability in the regions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41117-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I agree very much with my hon. Friend. The Government expect the North West regional assembly, like other assemblies, to perform functions in relation to regional planning and the oversight of the regional development agency, but it also does a number of other jobs in the north-west and contributes to the wider debate on economic development and regeneration, which is absolutely critical to that region. Clearly, as I said in the response to the previous question, there is an ongoing and important role for regional assemblies, which include a majority of members from elected local authorities.

 The hon. Lady will know only too well that there is a strong case for the preparation of regional planning guidance and that that was put in place by the Conservative party when in government. The structures that the Conservative Government proposed called for consultation with elected representatives from local councils, plus others involved in regional development. The difference between the outcomes then and now is that, in those days, the Secretary of State decided what the outcome was&#151;it was entirely a decision by central Government&#151;but we have modernised the system and devolved power so that decisions are taken by bodies such as the one chaired by the Conservative whom I quoted a moment ago, who

 (Lab/Co-op): What his strategy is for meeting the decent home standard.  [198434]
</p>



<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41117-02_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 In 1997, we inherited 2 million non-decent homes. Since then, more than &#163;18 billion of public and private money has been invested to reduce that number by more than 1 million. That means 650,000 homes with new central heating, 240,000 new kitchens, 180,000 new bathrooms, making a real difference to people&#039;s lives&#151;people who suffered from the massive disinvestment of the previous Administration. We remain on track to deliver our commitment to make every home in the public sector decent by 2010.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41117-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Love: </b> 
 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on attaining 1 million improved homes earlier this year, but there is considerable concern about the lack of affordable accommodation for key workers in Greater London. What steps is he taking to ensure that they can have decent, affordable accommodation, so that we do not continue to lose key workers from the capital?
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41117-02_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 That is indeed a very important problem. The first tranche of the starter home initiative delivered about 10,000 affordable homes under the key worker programme. We have also established a new programme&#151;the key worker living programme, which began in March 2004&#151;and 16,000 people will benefit from it. In the borough of Enfield and my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, about 120 people have already been helped by that programme and 264 further applications are being dealt with at the moment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41117-02_spnew1"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Deputy Prime Minister will be aware that Macclesfield borough council achieves a housing standard far in excess of the decent housing standard. It is known in his Department as the Macclesfield standard. Will he ensure that Macclesfield borough council continues to get sufficient resources to enable it to continue to manage its own housing stock and not force it into a large-scale voluntary transfer, against the wishes of tenants, who have my support?
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41117-02_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am glad to hear of the new Macclesfield standard. It is a pity that it did not apply throughout the previous Administration, which is why we inherited 2 million houses of a non-decent standard for which the programme has been developed. It is true that we gave a choice to tenants as to whether they would like to opt for the transfer programmes that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Those transfers have brought in something like &#163;18 billion-worth of money from the public and private sectors and allowed us to implement the programme more quickly. We leave it to the tenants to make a decision and three quarters of those asked have voted overwhelmingly to adopt these programmes.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Jaywick Sands because I have made the Department aware of the fact that some people in that area are living in 1930s holiday homes. The area has deteriorated for several years under the control of Tory Essex county council and Tory Tendring district council. My constituents are looking to the Government to make a difference. Will he assure them that he will look at the area specifically so that the local people have a right to a decent home to live in?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41117-02_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I do not know the full details of the point made by my hon. Friend, but I will certainly look into the matter and write to him. One of the difficulties that we inherited is the fact that, in the last five years of the Tory Administration, they slashed housing investment by half. We doubled it in the same period after. That is the real difference, and that is why people look to this Government to make a real difference on housing.

 (Con): To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that the programme for decent homes for key workers should not be restricted just to those who work in the public sector? It should cover those who work in catering, cleaning, retail and other low-paid jobs in the private sector.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41117-02_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 To be honest, matters of state aid are involved, but the hon. Gentleman makes a decent point about a broader definition of key workers. We have established a certain key worker definition at the moment, and we are following that. We hope to make a statement about housing matters shortly.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41117-02_spmin5"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, 2004 and supporting regulations provide for county councils to have an extensive role in the new planning system, which came into force on 28 September 2004. It would be premature now to be considering further changes to county councils&#039; planning powers.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41117-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Is the Minister aware that Norfolk is having forced on it nearly 100,000 extra homes? Is he aware that this will put intolerable new pressure on already overstretched services and infrastructure? Is he aware that my constituents want more affordable housing, but they do not want thousands of more executive-style homes that are occupied by second home owners? Surely it would be far better if such key decisions were taken by a county council that is directly elected by local people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41117-02_spnew5"><b> Phil Hope: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and housing issues across a region as well as within individual local areas. The fact is that one of the key benefits of this Government&#039;s regional planning policy has been the investment of &#163;3.9 million for housing in King&#039;s Lynn and west Norfolk. That is providing homes for key workers and affordable housing for people in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area.

</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41117-02_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns. We are trying to ensure that local authorities have the ability to undertake the responsibilities that they are given. A key part of having the ability to deliver those functions is having the resources to do so. She will know that, since 1997, local authorities across the board have received an increase of 30 per cent. in funding from the Government. Local authorities suffered desperately to deliver services under the previous Administration who cut funding by 7 per cent. in the previous four years.

 (Con): The Minister will be aware that the South East England regional assembly draft housing numbers plan is out&#151;it is a pretty shoddy affair. It is lightly done and ignores a few basic factors, of which I shall cite two. First, the extrapolation of growth from the past ignores the fact that after land has been built on, it has gone, so the continuation of that process threatens the green belt. Secondly, economic growth in the south-east is based on productivity to a greater extent than actual given numbers. Will the Minister reflect on his first answer and recognise that county councils need a strengthened role, even if they must save the dignity of the Deputy Prime Minister and put things through the regional assemblies?
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="41117-02_spnew9"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The fact is that the South East England regional assembly has a Conservative majority and is chaired by a Conservative councillor, so the hon. Gentleman is criticising his own party. Perhaps he should hold a debate inside his party and decide how it should deliver the affordable homes in the south-east that are desperately needed by people with sons and daughters who cannot afford to find a place to live in their areas.

</p>








<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41117-02_spnew13"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Once again, we see the Liberal Democrats moving from one position to another. There is no mistaking the fact that their national position is different from their local and regional positions. The previous system was hopelessly bureaucratic, but the new system gives county councils clear powers on sub-regional policies and responsibilities for surveying in their areas. It allows them to produce new waste and mineral plans and to form joint committees with other authorities on key aspects in their areas. To go back to the older system would be to go back to delay and conflict, and that would fail to deliver the housing and infrastructure that the Government are delivering.

Those unelected bodies have no legitimacy in doing the Government&#039;s bidding by bulldozing over our countryside. Their powers must be returned to the people. Does the Minister understand that while he and his colleagues might run from the decision of the people of the north-east, they cannot hide from the verdict of the people?

 I thank the Minister for that statement, although I have to say that EERA&#039;s proposals are, as many of my constituents think, both undemocratic and, frankly, unsustainable.

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="41117-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point about the importance of combining infrastructure investment with new housing provision. It is precisely because of the Government&#039;s recognition of that that we have defined the growth area strategies and are ensuring a more integrated approach rather than the one that his party pursued when in government, which led to the sprawl of uncontrolled low-density development that produces the problem about which he complains. If Hertfordshire has a problem of development, it is because when his party was in government it allowed large-scale urban sprawl in that area.

 In July I published a discussion document &quot;The future of local government: Developing a 10 year vision&quot;. This vision puts local government at the heart of our communities in the years ahead. It also makes clear that both local and central government will need to change to meet the challenges of building sustainable communities in which people want to live.

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="41117-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mudie: </b> 
 I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for that answer. In his post-referendum review, will he assure the House that councils will be key deliverers of services and not just enablers, handing out contracts to the private sector? Will he also assure us that such ideas as taking all primary schools or high schools out of direct local government control will not be part of his future plans?
</p>








<p><a name="st_44"><a name="41117-03_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I can assure my hon. Friend that local authorities are key in developing local and national services. I can also tell him that the extra powers and resources that we have provided will enable them to do that.

<a name="41117-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_4">Regarding whether the community assets of schools, whether secondary or primary, are directly controlled by the local authority, I assure him that in Leeds and other parts of the country, as he knows, there is an increasing amount of community involvement in the new deals, the new neighbourhood areas, Sure Start and the local strategic partnerships. More than 1 million people are now participating in decisions and sharing community assets. In that sense, the community is enriched by using those assets for the benefit of the community, working with local authorities in creating new services for the citizens in their area.

</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41117-03_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point; he has tremendous experience of working in local government. As he will know, our new document on local vision makes it clear that we want more active citizen engagement and participation, which will be brought about by greater local leadership and will certainly be to the improvement of the community.

<a name="stpa_7">The chief executive of the Child Support Agency has just resigned. The agency is in crisis. What is the Prime Minister going to do to get a grip on the problem and help some of the poorest families in our country who are not getting the money that they are entitled to?
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="41117-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The first thing to do, obviously, is to ensure that the information technology system that has caused so many problems is sorted out. The second, and perhaps most important, problem is that there are still a million cases being dealt with under the old system&#151;the system that we inherited. Over time, there will be a migration to the new system that we introduced, which is far simpler. It is important that we manage to migrate as many cases as possible from the old system to the new.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41117-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister has been in office for seven and a half years.

The Child Support Agency has failed to collect &#163;750&nbsp;million owed to some of the poorest families in Britain. Those people desperately needed that money to help bring up their children. They have been denied it by the failures of this Government. Do they not deserve better?

 Of course what has happened is not acceptable. That is precisely why it is important to change.

<a name="41117-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_8">To return to the Child Support Agency resignation this morning, as well as the computerisation problems to which the Prime Minister rightly referred, there is of course the fact that the Government have been changing the specifications, which has added to the problems. As the CSA is as we speak leaderless, the staff are bound to be demoralised and the agency is failing in its functions, will the Prime Minister as a matter of urgency scrap the Child Support Agency and transfer its purpose directly to the Inland Revenue, so that it can get payments to those most in need?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41117-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am not sure that transferring to the Inland Revenue is the answer to the problem. The reason for the difficulty is that people have to pay child support when they have an obligation to support children on divorce or the separation of partners. The CSA was established by the previous Government in order to try to ensure that the system worked in an effective and fair way without the need for long drawn-out court hearings. Unfortunately, that system did not work. I do not in any way minimise the difficulties under the new system that we are introducing. It is not acceptable, as I said a moment or two ago. However, there will be new leadership of the Child Support Agency, we will have to sort out the computer programme that has been the cause of the present problems, and we will then have to ensure that as many people as possible get on to the new scheme, which is a lot simpler and more effective.

<a name="stpa_9">Talking of new leadership, there will have to be a new leader of the National Assessment Agency, too, as its chief executive has resigned this morning.

They set unrealistic targets, the quangos and agencies cannot deliver, and the recipients on the front line, after seven years of Labour in power, are left languishing.

 It is extraordinary of the right hon. Gentleman to say that we should not have testing and exams for pupils. An independent authority is needed to carry that out, and it has done so. I simply point out to him that it found that there was not any problem, either with the quality of marking or with the results. There has been a problem in the system, which is the reason for the resignation. We cannot have it both ways&#151;either arm&#039;s-length agencies carry out these functions, or they are carried out direct from Government. I will certainly look at his suggestion that we transfer child support to the Inland Revenue, but it

 Housing in Wales is the responsibility of the Assembly, but we have put a substantial amount of additional money into housing, and affordable rural housing in particular. Of course, the situation is difficult, because there is a strong economy and the fact that more people are in work&#151;unemployment figures are again down today, and are at their lowest level for 30 years&#151;puts pressure on housing. However, interest rates&#151;again, under this Government, they are at their lowest for several decades&#151;are important in enabling people to afford their homes.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="41117-03_spmin16"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>

 The Police Federation estimates that it will take seven minutes on average to fill in the new form. The police will be assessed on it under the police performance assessment framework, affectionately known by the police as PFAF. From today, if a police officer in London wants to stop a gang of half a dozen yobs in the street, it will take the best part of an hour to fill in the forms.

 First, as a result of the Government introducing dispersal orders and other measures to deal with antisocial behaviour, we are able to take action against gangs of yobs in the street for the first time.

 I have not failed to answer the question. I have answered it. I have explained why we think it is necessary to do that, following the Lawrence inquiry. An important part of policing in London is to police with the support of the local community. In relation to policing in general, in London and elsewhere, there are record numbers of police, and they are now supported by community support officers who, incidentally, were opposed by the Opposition. We are reintroducing neighbourhood policing throughout London. Crime in London is down, not up, and as the commander in Brixton said:

Will he indicate his plans to build on the success of this week&#039;s enterprise week?

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41117-03_spmin24"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is important to recognise the extra investment in education that is going into our schools. We have boosted investment in each pupil by a significant amount beyond what we inherited. We are also setting up business and enterprise specialist schools, which will help too. The child trust fund, which is just starting, will make a big difference by giving children a nest egg for the future. In addition, the proposals on child care will enable parents to balance work and family life to a far better extent.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="41117-04_spnew0"><b> Richard Younger-Ross: </b> 
 That is a shame, because the Post Office proposes to close the Newton Abbot Crown office and the sub-post offices in Queen street and at Keyberry and to replace them with one franchise given to Costcutter. Will the Prime Minister condemn the Post Office for refusing to allow any other local business to bid for that franchise, and will he support the commercial workers union in asking for the sell-off and franchising&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41117-04_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is not correct to equate closures with franchises. More than 280 of the 550 directly managed post offices have been successfully franchised, and I understand that there are high customer satisfaction levels with that. The problem that we face is quite simple. The combined losses of those 550 directly managed post offices are more than &#163;70 million a year, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I greatly hope that, in the next few days&#151;it may be a little longer&#151;we will make progress to ensure that, on the republican side, there is a complete end to violence, and on the Unionist side an acceptance that if that is so there should be power sharing.

 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the regulation of the vehicle servicing industry.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">There are approximately 25 million cars on the road in the UK. The garage servicing industry is worth an estimated &#163;9.8 billion a year&#151;around &#163;350 per car. The cost of shoddy repairs is estimated to cost UK car drivers &#163;170 million per annum. The questions I pose today are, are we getting value for money, are our cars being serviced to the highest standards, and is safety being compromised?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In dealing with this issue I have worked very closely with <i>Which?</i> and the Consumers Association. Last week, <i>Which?</i> published the results of an undercover investigation. It took 48 cars to 48 garages across the country and asked them to fix relatively minor faults such as worn brake discs, and then it asked independent, trained experts to check the quality of the work. Seventy-three per cent. of the work undertaken was unsatisfactory and 67 per cent. of the garages that <i>Which?</i> took the cars to, failed to pick up the faults. <i>Which?</i> has conducted other research in the past into MOT servicing, and only eight of 36 garages performed the tests correctly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The report&#039;s findings are nothing new and, although the figures are high, erratic quality in the servicing of vehicles is not a recent phenomenon. The public, consumer organisations and Government agencies have complained about it for decades. The latest investigations by the Office of Fair Trading and by trading standards authorities reveal some gross abuses of consumer confidence. Interestingly, the problem appears as endemic in the franchise dealer workshops as in the small independent garages. Despite the efforts of vehicle manufacturers to get their franchisees to observe quality standards, they have failed to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Most car users think that, if they take their car to a recognised franchisee&#151;they often pay over the odds to do so&#151;they will get a good deal. That is not always the case. On the other hand, I do not want to condemn all garages or tar them all with the same brush. Personally, I have received excellent service in my constituency from a one-man operator, Jack Frodsham, who serviced my car for many years, and from a franchise operator, KA Ford, which gave me some expert and timely advice last week that saved me more than &#163;600. I congratulate those garages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The latest attempt to tackle poor standards was the good garage scheme, which is also known as the CarWise scheme and has been promoted by the Department of Trade and Industry. The proposal, which is based on codes of conduct, self-regulation and asking the consumer to distinguish between good and bad, was welcomed by consumer groups and hailed as a way of sorting out the mess of garage servicing without legislation. Unfortunately, the scheme received a mixed reception in industry circles, and the industry finally withdrew, refusing to fund it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The scheme would have cost about &#163;10 million to set up&#151;only 35p for every car on the road in the UK. The industry claimed that the consumer would be up in arms 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1358</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about having to pay that 35p per year and per car for the service. <i>Which?</i> could not believe it, so it conducted further research with 1,100 people to find out what they were getting for their money and what they wanted from a mechanic. Some 93 per cent. of the people surveyed said that they would be concerned if they thought that their car was being serviced by a mechanic without suitable qualifications. People said that they wanted to be able to trust their mechanic. In order to get that trust, the industry has to listen to what people want: some kind of decent standard that is nationally recognised. Some 87 per cent. of those surveyed told <i>Which?</i> that they would pay extra for an approved technician to work on their car, and 67 per cent. said that they would travel further to get their car serviced by someone who was suitably qualified. With the consumer prepared to pay more and travel further for good customer service and a professional repair, it is unclear why the industry has not responded more positively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Following the decision to scrap the good garage scheme, the Government did the only thing they could, and encouraged the industry to develop a code of practice and work with the OFT and its consumer code approval scheme. While some societies and organisations, such as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, have joined the scheme,<i> Which?</i> informs me that the Retail Motor Industry Federation, whose members are mainly independent repairers, withdrew its code, claiming that the OFT kept changing its criteria and the goalposts. The criteria are relatively low anyway, but, by signing up, a trade body can demonstrate its commitment to standards and good consumer service. I hope that the RMIF will reconsider its position following this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">There are many in the industry who support regulation and licensing. Philip Branley of the insurers Allianz Cornhill said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;In principle we would be in favour of a national licensing scheme. Anything that improves the standards and enhances consumer confidence has to be a good thing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The automotive trade magazine representing body repairers and small independent garages conducted e-polling and found that 82 per cent. of its trade readership supported licensing under a mandatory scheme. Obviously, there is concern about who will pay to set up and monitor a scheme. As I have asserted, however, the public have stated that they are prepared to pay more, as long as they are guaranteed quality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">The Government are also helping out in other ways, such as improving competencies with the modern apprenticeship scheme. I believe that 7,000 apprentices are currently being trained to be mechanics. I point to the centre of automotive technology in my constituency&#151;a &#163;1.5 million project in Rhyl college aimed at giving young people, both male and female, the chance to gain these 21st century skills in the car servicing industry. Many in the industry welcome that help and realise that competency is the core of improving consumer confidence. Some, such as the Institute of the Motor Industry, Automotive Advantage and several dealer groups and manufacturers, already operate a code of practice and a raft of qualifications to help train mechanics. Their positive input should be recognised and encouraged by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Regulation has been introduced successfully in other industries and sectors. The gas installation industry, for instance, is now covered by CORGI registration, and in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1359</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the aerospace industry mechanics are trained to the highest standards. Today&#039;s automated, computerised cars are a different beast from those of 30 years ago. The knowledge and skills required to service such cars are of a far higher standard, and deserve recognition and respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">Failure to regulate could have tragic consequences. In the words of Alan Hodgkinson, chief executive of body repair network ABS, who supports regulation and licensing,

</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41117-07_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Cabinet Office  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.

</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41117-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 With this we may discuss Lords amendments Nos. 50 and 51 and the Government motions to disagree thereto.
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41117-07_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 These amendments provide the vehicle for bringing part 2 of the Bill, on emergency powers, to an end three years after it has been brought into force. The Government are unable to agree with that approach. The idea of sunsetting part 2 of the Bill was originally raised by the Joint Committee that conducted pre-legislative scrutiny of the then draft Bill. The Government in their response made it clear that a sunset clause is relatively unusual and requires careful consideration. The issue was discussed at some length on Report and Third Reading in the other place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_18">The arguments against sunsetting are compelling. Sunsetting legislation is appropriate when the powers it contains are expected no longer to be needed after a certain period, or if their use should be reviewed by Parliament. This Bill does not meet either criterion. Time-limiting the Bill is clearly not appropriate. No one believes that emergencies will stop happening in three years&#039; time. If part 2 of the Bill were to be repealed, something else would simply have to be put in its place. The purpose of review by Parliament on a triennial basis, it is suggested, is that&#151;given the nature of the powers&#151;Parliament should assess whether it is appropriate for them to continue to exist, in the light of the way in which they have been exercised. I understand that that was the main intent behind the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_19">Provision for regular review by Parliament may be appropriate where the exercise of powers is of legitimate parliamentary interest but their exercise is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the intent being that some powers&#151;given their nature&#151;should not simply be handed over to a Government to exercise indefinitely in the manner of their choosing. That argument, however, does not apply to part 2 of the Bill. Any exercise of the powers it confers will undergo detailed parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_20">I would also question the utility of review every three years, given that part 2 is a last resort option for dealing with only the most serious of emergencies, for which existing legislation proves insufficient. It is not intended for regular use. It is worth noting for example that there was a 29-year gap between the uses of the powers under the present legislation. It simply would not have been necessary or sensible to review the Emergency Powers Act 1920 every three years during that period.
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="41117-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister says&#151;and she is right, because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1365</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clause 27 applies&#151;that there will be parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations. Will Parliament be able to amend the regulations through the process of scrutiny?

 Yes. In a totally exceptional provision, it will be possible for Parliament to amend the regulations&#151;for example, to impose additional limitations and constraints on their use by providing that the use of the powers should come to an end after a certain date.

<a name="41117-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_21">Emergency regulations would be laid before Parliament as soon as was reasonably practical, once they had been made, and would require the assent of Parliament to continue in force. Any further set of regulations made after the lapse of the regulations would also have to go through the same process of parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="41117-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Richard Shepherd  (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister talks of detailed scrutiny, but the regulations would be in the form of an Order in Council and subject to the statutory instrument process. The detailed scrutiny would have to take place in 90 minutes. Or does the Minister know something that the House and the Standing Orders do not?
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="41117-07_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important and interesting point. I said that I would expect detailed scrutiny by Parliament to take place, and I accept that 90 minutes is indeed unlikely to be sufficient to debate regulations of such importance. It is likely that in the time of such an emergency there would be a call for a major debate on the subject of the crisis and the Government would respond to that and provide the appropriate time. The hon. Gentleman may question why we have not chosen to amend the Standing Orders to reflect that expectation. I would argue that it would not be appropriate to complicate the Standing Orders with varying procedures for different kinds of regulations. However, I place it clearly on the record that we would expect detailed scrutiny of the regulations to take place.
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="41117-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 As the Minister will know, it has been thought right to have sunsetting for a small class of provisions, including the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&#151;an obvious example&#151;and the Terrorism Act 2000, which repeated the provisions that used to be in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973. Given that the Bill proposes to give, rightly, the most draconian powers to Ministers in an emergency, it surely also falls into that category and should be treated seriously.
</p>








<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41117-07_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is not alone in trying to draw parallels between the Bill and the Acts that he mentioned. Indeed, several of their Lordships also attempted to draw such parallels. They argued that because a review mechanism was appropriate in those contexts, it would be appropriate in this case. I beg to disagree. The powers in this Bill are not intended to be used on a regular basis. The powers in the Acts to which the hon. Gentleman referred are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny when exercised. We are dealing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1366</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with a different type of Bill: it is an enabling Bill and the exercise of the powers it contains would be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny. The other Acts that have been mentioned grant ongoing powers that can be evaluated after a certain period of time has elapsed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="41117-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Richard Allan  (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b> 
 Following the point made by the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) about the nature of the scrutiny of the regulations once they are invoked by a Minister, we are concerned that those debates will be focused on the regulations before the House, rather than on the wider principle of whether the powers should have been used at all. We seek a review or a sunset provision because we want a review of the legislation as a whole, rather than the specific regulations that may have been invoked at a particular moment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_35"><a name="41117-07_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 It is worth bearing in mind the fact that we envisage the powers being used only for the most serious situations. It is unthinkable that any emergency that such powers would be connected with would not be debated in full while that emergency was taking place, including the Government&#039;s handling of the situation and the use of emergency powers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41117-07_spnew10"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Of course the particular circumstances that arise would probably be debated, and the particular measures taken would also be debated, albeit ex post facto and at not very great length. The point that is being made&#151;I hope that the Minister will address it&#151;is that the powers and their appropriateness to the situation would not be the subject of such a debate. That is what we would like to see scrutinised every three years. What is wrong with that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_37"><a name="41117-07_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The true parallel to draw here is between the exercise of the regulations and the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Terrorism Act 2000, not between the Bill and those Acts. They do not all fall into the same category. The regulations would be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny and, as I was in the process of telling the House, I cannot conceive of their being used in practice without a full parliamentary debate or without scrutiny after the event of how they had been exercised in practice and of whether greater limitation should have been imposed on their use. There is no real parallel between the Bill and the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, as this is a purely enabling Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_38"><a name="41117-07_spnew12"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 But of course, the underlying anxiety is the very definition of what constitutes an emergency, which lies in the Government&#039;s hands and in the hands of the parliamentary majority that the Government normally have. With such a very loose definition of what constitutes an emergency, with the powers being so enormous and with the rights of scrutiny dependent on the Government&#151;not necessarily this Government, because of course the Minister is arguing for a permanent Act&#151;we want the greatest possible clarity about why all that is appropriate.

<br>&nbsp;<br>amend the regulations, which is an exceptional provision and additional safeguard that strengthens the robustness of the scrutiny process, but the emergency regulations contain their own sunset clause: they lapse 30 days after they are made and fresh parliamentary approval must be required if further regulations are to be made. One could speculate about the composition of a Parliament that would somehow override the rule of law and the detailed safeguards in the Bill, but I would argue that that would be a function of the will of Parliament and the extremism of Members of Parliament, rather than anything to do with the functions of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">The Bill contains far more safeguards than its predecessors. It contains provision for detailed parliamentary scrutiny and amendment by Parliament of its provisions. It also contains in-built sunset clauses on the use of the regulations. In summary, the Government simply cannot agree to these Lords amendments. We are replacing a long-standing, generic framework that is entirely unsuitable for sunsetting, and effective arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny are already set out in the Bill in relation to the regulations made under it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_40"><a name="41117-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 The Government have improved the Bill in the other place, and I pay tribute to the work of my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe, who led for the Opposition in the other place and was able to persuade the Government to do some things that I had found it very difficult to persuade them to do in the House. She has obviously got some silky skills that I have not yet acquired. It was good that the Government were prepared to tighten the definition of an emergency. Although I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), the definition is now better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_23">The Government now recognise the role of the voluntary sector&#151;something that we have pressed for throughout our debates in Committee. The test for urgent directions under clauses 7 and 8 is more objective. That is good. Clause 7 directions will be made in writing&#151;something that we pressed for in Committee. Again, that was a good change. The removal of clause 19(5)(a), which would have allowed a Minister to treat certain situations as coming under the definition of an emergency irrespective of whether they came within the categories set out in the Bill, and the recognition of the role of parliamentary and judicial scrutiny of emergency regulations under clause 22 were all to the good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_24">On these Lords amendments, however, we wish the Government to go further. In the other place, my noble Friend argued that clause 34 should contain the three new subsections in Lords amendment No. 50, to provide sunset provisions for part 2. After three years, part 2 would fall unless both Houses agreed to renew it, but if they agreed to a renewal, it would last for another three years. We are used to that approach in the context of emergency powers.

That is why the Bill has been introduced. Given the effects of such a Bill on liberty, it is only right that the latest circumstances should be considered.

 I would echo the comments made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.&nbsp;Heald) about some of the improvements that have been made to the Bill, but we continue to have some concerns. The Liberal Democrats were open-minded in the debate that took place in the House of Lords. My colleague, Lord Avebury, made it clear that we were looking for some kind of review procedure, although not necessarily as proposed in the Lords amendment with which the Government now seek to disagree, but that we would not be happy if the provisions did not contain an ability independently to review the way in which the powers may be used. Unfortunately, the Minister in the House of Lords gave us nothing, so we made it clear that in lieu of there being no alternative, we would vote with the Conservatives to ensure that we kept the issue alive.

<a name="stpa_30">We suggested as an alternative the kind of procedure that is followed under the Terrorism Act 2000, whereby my noble Friend Lord Carlile has a statutory responsibility to review some of the provisions used under that Act. That is very useful. It has kept issues alive and on the political agenda that we fear would not otherwise have been kept alive so forcefully if the procedure had simply involved a Home Office Minister reporting on the powers under that Act. So we seek to support the principle of independent review in resisting the Government&#039;s attempts to remove the Lords amendments.

I would love to see the provisions not used at all, and to return on a triennial basis with a report simply making a nil return to say that the powers had not been used and that the legislation could therefore be allowed to continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_32">Our fear, however, is that the powers in the Bill will not be used only in extremis. Ministers might be tempted to use them rather than go through the normal legislative procedures. Even in a case as serious as the attacks that took place in the United States on 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September, we were able through the normal parliamentary procedures to introduce the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. It was contentious, but it got through the House in reasonable time. Similarly, we responded to the foot and mouth crisis with legislation that is specifically about how we deal with animals in such a situation and that, I hope, will pre-empt the need for emergency regulations. Parliament has enacted legislation ahead of any potential crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_33">We want that approach to continue. The normal approach to an emergency should be either to foresee the emergency and have the legislation on the statute book so that the part 2 powers are not needed, or to come to the House to introduce legislation in the normal way, again so that the part 2 powers are not needed.

<a name="41117-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_34">We believe that there might be a temptation&#151;perhaps out of laziness or because Ministers do not want to use up their valuable slots for pre-emptive legislation&#151;to fall back on the powers in the Bill. If such a mindset takes hold, the powers may be used inappropriately as an earlier port of call than they should be. We see them very much as a last resort that should be used in extremis. The triennial review proposed in the amendment would be a good way to address those genuine concerns.

 Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that a great deal of thought has been given recently to how legislation should be dealt with? The report of the Constitution Committee in another place proposes much more post-legislative scrutiny. If we are dealing with draconian powers such as those in the Bill, they are the obvious candidates for such an approach. A sunset clause is the obvious way of forcing post-legislative scrutiny.

 The hon. Gentleman has expressed my sentiments effectively. We are at one on this. We are seeking to find a way of monitoring the Bill, because it is potentially so powerful. Because we fear that it will be used more frequently than is strictly necessary, we want to be able to return to it. The Minister suggests that we can do that when we are confronted with an emergency or discussing the detail of regulations that are there to deal with that emergency. However, to suggest that we will be calmly stepping back and reviewing all the possible legislative options that the Government could have used instead of the emergency legislation is fantastical. We will not do that. When the House is confronted with an emergency and a Minister says that we need emergency regulations, the reality is that the regulations will go through using the Government&#039;s majority. There simply will not be the scope to take the constitutional or long view that we would need to challenge Ministers as to whether they strictly need to use the part 2 powers in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41117-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 May I suggest to my hon. Friend that the inclusion of a sunset clause would allow the House to consider part 2 in detail for the first time? We were denied that opportunity under the guillotine to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) referred.

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="41117-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 That is true. We would be able to consider the provisions after three years, although we have not yet been able to consider them for five minutes. We are considering a piece of primary legislation that will create a framework that will affect the rights for which the House has fought for centuries. We had annual Army Acts so that we could control the supply of money to the Crown to ensure that the Crown could not do that which we did not want. The same important point is relevant to the Bill. The Government should not shrug off our anxieties and complaints. They could bring forward individual pieces of legislation. They could have addressed our point. Although I think that there should be an annual review, I shall gladly support their lordships&#039; amendments.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41117-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I agree with many of the points that hon. Members have made. The Bill, with its power to deal with enactments with such a broad brush, is Orwellian in its range and depth. The permanence of the arrangements takes us way beyond &quot;1984&quot; into the indefinite future. There are profound reasons why we should object to such infringement of the liberty of the people of this country and Parliament.

<a name="stpa_51">I said that the Terrorism Act 2000 subsumed and superseded the temporary provisions imposed on Northern Ireland under the Acts passed between 1989 and 1996. However, when my hon.

The Bill of Rights is regarded as a permanent safeguard, but this Bill will not cover it. No doubt we shall later consider the interaction between the Bill and the Human Rights Act 1998, which is a temporary palliative because it may be amended or repealed, and the Bill of Rights, which any person in this country would regard as the bulwark of our liberty.

<a name="stpa_56">The Bill will override the most fundamental aspects of liberty and freedom in this country. As there is not at least a sunset clause to guarantee that the powers be reviewed regularly, I condemn the Bill&#039;s provisions for their lack of liberty and permanence and I condemn the intolerant, totalitarian thinking behind them. The Labour party is supposed to be the descendant of Tom Paine and &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;. The Bill is a disgrace.

<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41117-10_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 We have had a passionate and interesting debate, although I think that most of the arguments expressed by Conservative Members reflected their fundamental disagreement with the Bill itself, rather than their view that a sunset clause would be the most appropriate way to deal with the situation before us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_57">The Bill has been drafted to enable future emergencies to be covered flexibly under it. The provisions are sufficiently flexible to ensure that specific supply systems or facilities may be covered under the definition of an emergency when serious damage to human welfare is threatened. It also allows examples about which we are not yet aware to be addressed. However, specific powers will be contained in regulations issued under the Bill, so any debate on the Bill itself would be only a rerun of our debates throughout its consideration in the House and the other place.
</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41117-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 Does the hon. Lady appreciate that a debate on the Bill some three, six or nine years after it has come into force&#151;after which we might know about circumstances in which it was used&#151;would be different from today&#039;s debate, because we are currently discussing our fears due to the fact that we do not know the way in which the Bill will be used? We are asking for the opportunity to debate the Bill after we know how it has been used in practice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="41117-10_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Bill itself does not restrict individual liberty. It is the provisions made by the regulations that may infringe or restrict civil liberties. I have outlined the safeguards, which are in the Bill and include detailed parliamentary scrutiny under the regulations.
</p>








<p><a name="st_60"><a name="41117-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right when she says that individual prohibitions are contained in regulations, but she is bound to concede that the powers are created in clause 22(3). Whether Ministers should be able, through regulations, to do this and that does lie on the face of the Bill. It is that which we need to review.
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41117-10_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Bill, which we have debated for a while, has far more safeguards built into it than the Emergency Powers Act 1920, which it replaces. The triple lock is the cornerstone of the safeguards set out in the Bill. Three stringent tests must be met if emergency powers are to be used. First, the emergency must be serious and require immediate action. Secondly, it must be necessary to take emergency powers, such as when it is not possible to introduce a Bill in the usual way; that deals with one of the points raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). Thirdly, emergency regulations must be proportionate to the aspect or effect of the emergency at which they are directed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-10_para7">

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="41117-10_spnew10"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 The hon. Lady refers to the test of reasonableness. Hopefully she will be aware of the case of Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson in the late 1940s, in which the question of reasonableness, which had been imported into regulation 18B of the defence regulations, came into question. Where is the test of reasonableness expressly stated in respect to the application of the powers? Furthermore, does she agree that Lord Diplock and a series of other judges said that the case of Liversidge <i>v.</i> Anderson was bad law? I asked in Committee for that to be examined, but I do not think that it was.
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41117-10_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I have had no indication from business managers that there was insufficient time to discuss that in Committee. The public law test of reasonableness applied to the 1920 Act and will continue to apply. We would agree that the case the hon.

 This is an important point, although relatively small. We understood that the inclusion of Treasury Ministers or Lords Commissioners was to allow for a direct reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. No one would have difficulty with that. However, the Bill as drafted includes the first three Whips from the Whips Office. There is something ludicrous about Whips who never speak in the House being able to amend primary legislation.

<a name="stpa_60">The question is whether the Bill should be subject to a sunset clause after a period of time or whether it falls into the same category as the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Let me explain the difference. Under the Act, things are being done&#151;perhaps as we speak&#151;such as the detention of foreign nationals who are suspected of being terrorists and the sharing of relevant confidential information between Customs and Excise or the Inland Revenue and the intelligence services. In other words, there is something to review&#151;the action that has taken place under that Act&#151;after two years of its operation. We hope that part 2 of the Bill remains unused for many years to come. The legislation that it replaces remained unused for 29 years.

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me finish my point. What would the review team review unless and until emergency regulations were made? The debate and the review would merely be a rerun of the debates in the course of the Bill&#039;s passage. If regulations are made, they will be scrutinised in depth by Parliament at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_61">The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.&nbsp;Heald) suggested that the Cabinet Office and the Government are promoting the use of sunset clauses. I do not differ from him in that. In fact, I am the Minister with responsibility for better regulation and know about promoting the use of sunset clauses in government. Cabinet Office guidelines&#151;I have taken the trouble to look them up&#151;say that sunset clauses should be used where appropriate. They also set out a long list of when that might be appropriate. I shall read out just two items that might interest the hon. Gentleman were he making this point. Examples include&#151;I say this to argue that they should not be used in future&#151;measures extending the powers of the state or reducing civil liberties, reserve powers that may never be used or bodies that are set up

One might argue that those are relevant to this debate; it could be argued that part 2 of the Bill extends the powers of the state or reduces civil liberties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">I would argue, however, that the need for any regulations made under the Bill to be approved by Parliament offsets any argument that the Bill itself should contain a sunset clause. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that sunset clauses are appropriate for the regulations, which is why I pointed out to the House that there is an in-built sunset clause; the regulations will lapse 30 days after they are made. The House can shorten that time if it wants to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">Another hon. Gentleman&#151;I am afraid that I forget exactly who it was&#151;argued that the existence of an in-built sunset clause does not prevent the Government from laying another set of emergency regulations. But if that were done, the whole process of parliamentary scrutiny would have to be gone through again; and the triple lock would apply; and the debate would have to take place; and in that debate there would undoubtedly be an evaluation of how the powers in the Act and the regulations had been used.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="41117-11_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Does not the Minister understand the distinction, which I have been making throughout the debate, that if a Whip were, on a regular basis, stationing an armed person at the end of one&#039;s road to stop one&#039;s movement, one might want, after three years, to review the operation of the Act, as it may be that on one occasion that action was justified?
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="41117-11_spnew12"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman does not seem to have much faith in the concept of Parliament, which is here to scrutinise the exercise of the regulations and decide whether the triple lock applies and whether the powers exercised are appropriate and reasonable. That is why the triple lock is set out, and Parliament has the power not only to debate but to amend the regulations to ensure that they are being used in an appropriate fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">I believe that Parliament can be quite effective in scrutinising the Government from time to time. I believe that Parliament would not be shy of criticising or constraining the Government were it, for example, to consider that a situation was not an emergency, that the range of powers should be narrowed or that the powers were being exercised in an unreasonable way that was not consistent with the nature of the emergency. I would not expect Parliament to be any less effective in scrutinising emergency regulations than it is in other cases; in fact, I would hope and expect it to be more effective and assiduous in scrutinising those regulations.
</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="41117-11_spnew13"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I fear that in her response to my previous intervention the Minister completely failed to understand the point that I was making about the test of reasonableness, and she really must take it on board. Under article 18B of the defence regulations there was a test of reasonableness, but it was overridden in the view of Lords Diplock, Scarman and Reid as being bad law. That is the point; if we do not have an express test of reasonableness, the liberty of the subject is severely at

<br>&nbsp;<br>risk. The Minister made the point that she wanted proper, effective scrutiny, but she walks away from it when it is offered.
</p>








<p><a name="st_81"><a name="41117-11_spnew14"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I beg to disagree. There is a public law test of reasonableness in the Bill. It does not have to be shown in the Bill; it will still apply to the Bill. The safeguards set out in the Bill are far, far stronger than those that applied under the 1920 Act, legislation that was not used by any Government for 29 years. It lay on the statute book untouched.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">The safeguards that we have built into the Bill are far stronger. They include a triple lock on the use of the powers, making sure that the legislation could not simply be taken through Parliament and that the use of the powers must be reasonable and proportionate. Those are strong safeguards, and there are additional ones built into the Bill; for example, one that will protect compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998, which we are about to debate in the next group of amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">The Bill will not somehow become unnecessary after a period. Sunset clauses are appropriate if a situation is to come to an end after a short period. That is why we have included express provision for sunsetting in the use of the regulations. It is why we have also provided, exceptionally, for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny in the exercise of the regulations. It is why I argue, too, on behalf of the Government, that sunsetting for the Bill itself is not appropriate.

 I beg to move, That this House agrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41117-12_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b> 
 With this we may discuss Lords amendment No. 42 and Lords amendment No. 46, with amendment (a) thereto.
</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41117-12_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Government amended the Bill in the other place to reinforce three key areas of protection against the possible misuse of emergency powers: first, protection of fundamental rights; secondly, protection of the limitations and safeguards on the use of the powers; and thirdly, protection of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review where those are affected by the emergency or by response efforts. I remind the House that that presents us with a particular challenge, balancing on one hand the rights of the individual and proper protections for our democratic institutions, and on the other the ability of Government to take action for the collective good in the most serious of emergencies. We now accept that the Bill has been improved by the other place, but because we believe that we have struck the right balance, we will not accept the Opposition&#039;s attempt to reintroduce proposals that were long debated in the other place and ultimately rejected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">It is important to be clear from the outset about the function of emergency powers and the safeguards in the Bill to prevent their misuse. Emergency powers exist to make temporary changes to the law, as we have just debated, where effective response is prohibited by insufficient powers or hindered by statutory requirements. Any regulations made will be temporary and can be made only for the purposes of preventing, controlling or mitigating an aspect or effect of the emergency in question. They must be necessary and proportionate, compatible with the Human Rights Act and will be scrutinised by Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">The possibility of temporarily amending legislation of constitutional importance was examined in detail both by the Joint Committee that undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and during debates in both Houses. Discussions have also taken place with civil liberties groups. The Government, too, are concerned that emergency powers should not be used to make substantive amendments that undermine the constitution of the United Kingdom. We are satisfied that the Bill cannot be used for that purpose, given the absence of any express power to do so. In the light of concerns expressed by civil liberties groups and by Members of both Houses, the Government looked again at the position of the Human Rights Act 1988. We remain convinced that nothing in the Bill would allow the Government to disapply or amend it. However, an express provision to the effect that emergency regulations cannot disapply or modify any provision in the Human Rights Act would offer the certainty and reassurance that is sought.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">It has always been the Government&#039;s intention that emergency regulations should be entirely compatible with the Human Rights Act and should not be used to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1383</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>modify or suspend it. We believe that, unlike other pieces of constitutionally significant legislation, the Human Rights Act sets out the relationship between the individual and the state that is at the heart of the operation of emergency powers and fundamental to concerns about their possible use. Our acceptance of express protection in the case of the Human Rights Act must not be seen as casting doubt on the fact that emergency powers cannot be used to make substantive amendments to constitutionally important enactments, an issue discussed at length in Committee and in another place. We are convinced that the absence of specific protection for that Act would not allow its disapplication or modification.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41117-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 The hon. Lady will know that, throughout our previous proceedings, we said that the provision that she has now made for the Human Rights Act was needed. It is hard to see why the same principle should not apply to habeas corpus or the Bill of Rights. Can she make a distinction between the Human Rights Act on the one hand and the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus on the other?
</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41117-12_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Bill of Rights was passed to declare the rights and liberties of the people and to ensure the succession to the throne. With the passing of the Human Rights Act and the Regency Acts, those intentions are effectively protected. Many of the protections set out in the Bill of Rights have been overtaken by the Human Rights Act, and others, such as the protection given to Protestants to prevent them from being disarmed when &quot;papists&quot; are both armed and employed, contrary to the law, are no longer relevant. Other protections in the Bill of Rights, such as the prohibition on raising tax or keeping a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament are simply not things a Government could claim are reasonable, necessary and proportionate under the terms of the Civil Contingencies Bill, given that the purpose of emergency powers is to provide temporary new powers to prevent, control or mitigate emergencies because existing powers are insufficient.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="41117-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 I welcome the fact that the Minister has told the House that the Human Rights Act will be protected, and cannot be amended under the Bill. That is good news. However, can powers and articles in the Human Rights Act be relied upon as a means of attacking the regulations made under the Bill? In other words, can the rights enshrined in the articles of the Human Rights Act be asserted against the regulations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="41117-12_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I certainly can provide the right hon. and learned Gentleman with that assurance. While we did not think it necessary to accept express protection for the Human Rights Act, we thought that so doing would provide additional certainty and reassurance to people who were concerned about how the Bill might be used. That is the spirit in which we acted, and our acceptance of that protection does not in any way undermine or cast doubt on the fact that emergency powers cannot be used to make substantive amendments to other constitutionally important enactments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="41117-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I hope that the Minister does not disagree with the proposition that the Human Rights Act is not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1384</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an entrenched constitutional provision. In fact, in the case of Simms and O&#039;Brien, Lord Hoffmann, a great advocate of human rights, the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and the Home Secretary all said that the Human Rights Act could be amended or repealed. It is therefore not the entrenched provision that the Minister has sought to claim is a bulwark for liberty.

<a name="time_6">
<a name="41117-12_time0"><h5>2.15 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41117-12_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis. The reasons why the Government believe that express protection for constitutional enactments is unnecessary are set out in detail in our response to the report by the Joint Committee, and were outlined by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) in Committee. They have also been set out in the other place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_70">In summary, legislation does not operate in isolation, and must be seen in the context of our wider constitutional law. There are two key presumptions&#151;first, it is important to remember that a power to make secondary legislation would be interpreted in light of the purpose of the power. Secondly, in considering the scope of the power to modify enactments, it is important to acknowledge the status accorded to enactments of constitutional importance in recent judicial announcements. In that regard, Thoburn <i>v.</i> Sunderland city council, known as the metric martyrs case, is the clearest precedent. In the light of recent cases such as that one, the Government believe that the courts will expect Parliament to use clear language before delegating the power to make substantive amendments to the Human Rights Act or a provision of constitutional importance to the Executive. Applying those presumptions to the Bill, it does not expressly permit emergency regulations to modify enactments such as the Human Rights Act, and it makes it clear that the purpose of the power is to prevent, control or mitigate the emergency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="41117-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 I understand very clearly that the Human Rights Act will stay on the statute book, but I seek the same assurance as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). After the passage of the emergency powers, will it remain a robust vehicle for protecting citizens&#039; rights? Will the Minister confirm that, following the passage of such powers, citizens&#039; rights to pursue cases under the Human Rights Act in respect of the application of those powers will remain unaltered and undiminished?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041117/debtext/41117-13.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41117-13_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can certainly confirm that that will be the case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_100"><a name="41117-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is making the case that the Human Rights Act is entrenched, so it is appropriate to name it in the Bill. However, it is not entrenched, because primary legislation passed by the House could do away with it. That route would be open to the Government if they were dissatisfied with the Habeas Corpus Act 1816, the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement 1700 or any of the measures listed in the amendment. We are seeking protection for what are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1385</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>considered fundamental steps in our march to liberty. There is nothing distinctive about the Human Rights Act apart from the fact, the hon. Lady suggests, that primary legislation is required to amend, change or repeal it. However, her case is not a good one, because the same argument applies to the other measures.
</p>








<p><a name="st_101"><a name="41117-13_spnew2"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman, to give him his due, makes an extremely good point that the Human Rights Act is not entrenched, as it could be overturned by primary legislation. He also puts his finger on the fact that that could not be done with emergency powers. The House would have to debate the matter and use primary legislation to change the Act.
</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="41117-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 I should know the answer, but will the hon. Lady confirm that the Government can derogate from the Human Rights Act without coming to the House? In other words, if an article in the Act is thought embarrassing in the context of the regulations, a Minister could derogate from it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_103"><a name="41117-13_spnew4"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Let me reiterate the point about the safeguards in the Bill. The Human Rights Act could not be altered, as I understand it, through emergency regulation. If it becomes appropriate to change it and the way in which it operates, that would be done through primary legislation. At that point, I would expect protection for the Act to be reconsidered. If there were to be a derogation from the Act, there would have to be an order approved by both Houses, so that, too, is an essential safeguard in the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="41117-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 The Minister has made effective use of additional information timeously provided. She said that, in the circumstances envisaged, another Order in Council would be required, and she invoked that point as evidence that there would be parliamentary scrutiny. Can she confirm that that new Order in Council would be capable of debate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_105"><a name="41117-13_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can confirm that the order would be subject to the safeguard to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It would be debated by both Houses and would have to be approved by both Houses. If not, it would fall. That is a critical safeguard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_71">We have accepted the arguments that were made in the other place that protection in the case of the Human Rights Act should be made explicit. We do not think that that is a necessary protection, but it is desirable to create some degree of certainty on the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_106"><a name="41117-13_spnew7"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister, but we need greater clarity in respect of the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). We are in a state of derogation, as a result of a ministerial decision&#151;not a decision of the House, though the consequences were&#151;that the life of the nation is currently threatened. On that basis, the Government set aside a contention in the Human Rights Act. All of this is outwith the cognisance of the Bill. That is what puzzles some of us and needs reconciliation. Primary legislation is indeed needed to

<br>&nbsp;<br>change the Human Rights Act, but derogation from it is a ministerial, Executive or Crown function predicated on existing anti-terrorism laws and habeas corpus.
</p>








<p><a name="st_107"><a name="41117-13_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is really making a point about the interaction between Parliament and the Executive in this and other cases and the application of the Human Rights Act, rather than about something that applies solely to the exercise of emergency powers. I have made it clear that, under the emergency powers, the Human Rights Act would have to be respected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_72">I said that derogation would have to be approved by both Houses. There would be a debate and Parliament would have to be content that it was appropriate. I set out earlier, and in the previous debate, the additional safeguards that are in the Bill, compared with the predecessor legislation. I would argue that the safeguards go much further than the previous legislation and are appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_73">Lords amendments Nos. 41 and 46 provide protection for part 2. It is important that part 2 should similarly be incapable of being amended by emergency powers in order to ensure that the tests and protection that it contains cannot be amended. The Bill expressly provides that emergency regulations cannot be used to modify part 2. The Government have amended the Bill to move this prohibition from the clause on scope to the clause on limitations on emergency regulations, where it sits more naturally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_74">On amendment (a), the Government are convinced that no further pieces of legislation require express protection. Adding a list of constitutional enactments&#151;we have already debated this point&#151;to be protected from the amendment would only weaken the safeguards in the Bill. As a consequence of the way in which legislation is made, there is room for legitimate disagreement on which enactments contain provisions of constitutional importance, and we do not believe that it would be possible to prepare an accurate list of enactments that ought to be protected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">Take, for example, the devolution Acts. Some would argue that they are of great constitutional importance. Those less sympathetic to devolution may not agree. There are arguments both ways. The Acts alter the distribution of powers and the way that parts of the country are run. On the other hand, they do not affect the sovereignty of Parliament or the fundamental rights of individuals. There would be a danger that, if the list were not entirely comprehensive, a partial list in the Bill would undermine the protection of Acts that were not cited in it. Therefore we cannot accept the amendment on that point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_108"><a name="41117-13_spnew9"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 We welcome Lords amendment No. 42, which requires a person making emergency regulations to have regard to the importance of ensuring that Parliament, the High Court and the Scottish equivalent can conduct proceedings in connection with the regulations or actions taken under the regulations. The matter was raised in the other place by my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe and by other Conservative peers. It is good that the Government responded and Lords amendment No. 42 emerged. A little credit is due for that.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_76">On Lords amendment No. 46, we have argued throughout the course of the Bill for the protection of a group of statutes to ensure that civil liberties are

<br>&nbsp;<br>respected. On Report in this place, the debate was guillotined. In the other place, peers were able to find the time and minds were changed. The Government agreed to protect the Human Rights Act, saying that it was right to do that in the interests of certainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_77">If it is right to do that for the Human Rights Act, we cannot understand the Government&#039;s approach when they say that it is not also right to do so in respect of the other important Acts of Parliament identified by the Joint Committee on Human Rights that we have suggested on previous occasions. The list has been narrowed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), who is proposing amendment (a). The Acts set out there are the bedrock of our constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_78">Ministers say that the provision is not required. They argue that, if there is no provision allowing amendment of constitutionally important legislation, it cannot take place. They said that about the Human Rights Act, and they changed their mind. If it is right to have that certainty and that declaratory effect for one important part of the bedrock of our constitution, why can we not do it for the others?
</p>








<p><a name="st_109"><a name="41117-13_spnew10"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 In the Government&#039;s responses to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, they cited a Law Lords judgment about constitutionally important Acts, such as the Human Rights Act. In other words, they identified one of those constitutionally important Acts. The other Acts listed in amendment (a) are undoubtedly constitutionally important and of equal standing to the Human Rights Act within the framework of law. There cannot in logic be an argument against the inclusion of the specified Acts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_110"><a name="41117-13_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. How can the Government say that it is necessary in the interests of certainty to list a particular Act, and then say, &quot;Oh, but we&#039;d like to retain the uncertainty in respect of others.&quot;? I agree that that is an illogical position.

</p>








<p><a name="st_111"><a name="41117-13_spnew12"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 Amendment No. 46 seeks to make an important change to the Bill. My Liberal Democrat colleagues in another place would modestly lay some claim to having persuaded the Government to accept it. Throughout the course of the Bill we have argued for the importance of the Human Rights Act to be respected by it. During the Bill&#039;s passage through the House, we were able to secure another concession, so that in clause 20(5)(b)(iv) we now have a requirement for any regulations brought under part 2 to be certified as compliant with the Human Rights Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_79">In a sense, amendment No. 46 is the other part of that&#151;the braces to the belt. It states that any regulations introduced under part 2 must be compliant with the Human Rights Act, and that those regulations in turn cannot modify the Human Rights Act. That provides a certain amount of protection, such that any regulations under part 2 will have to be compliant with the Human Rights Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_80">We believe that there is a particular status to the Human Rights Act. We as a party are constitutionalists: we argue in favour of a written constitution. We do not have one and we do not expect the country to develop one between now and the end of this parliamentary Session, so we seek to develop some notion of a

<br>&nbsp;<br>constitution in the legislation that comes before us. Although I am not a lawyer, I paid close attention to the words in the other place of my noble Friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill, who is an eminent lawyer in that area. He advanced a cogent case for the particular position of the Human Rights Act 1998 in English legislation.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="41117-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I shall give way to someone who is a lawyer.

<a name="time_7">
<a name="41117-14_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="41117-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some people do not believe that Lord Lester was right to assert that the 1998 Act is adequate to deal with all those contingencies? I hope that he will not fall into the same trap as Lord Lester, who asserted that that was why the Liberal Democrat Opposition would not support the official Opposition in the House of Lords yesterday.
</p>








<p><a name="st_115"><a name="41117-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point that disagreements remain. However, I must disappoint him by saying that the divergence on that particular issue between the Whigs in the Conservative party and the modern Liberal Democrats remains. We will not support amendment (a) because the nearest that we can get to a constitutional position is to continue to support and assert the supremacy of the 1998 Act, which acts as a kind of modern constitutional framework guaranteeing the rights of citizens in relation to the actions of the Executive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_81">We recognise that all legislation must be certified as compliant with the 1998 Act, which is a difference between the 1998 Act and other legislation referred to in amendment (a). The clearest way in which the part 2 provisions can proceed is to collect different Acts of Parliament, such as those in the amendment, and insert them into the Bill, but that will not give the ordinary citizen the safeguards that they are looking for on freedom from oppressive or inappropriate regulations. I accept the divergence of opinion and am sure that the hon. Gentleman will ably advance the argument for the inclusion of other legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_82">It is important that all those who are concerned about relations between the citizen and the state should seek to bolster and reinforce the 1998 Act rather than undermine it. Sadly, some of those who seek to challenge this Bill also sought to challenge the 1998 Act as an alien or foreign import. The provisions of the 1998 Act are important and all regulations should comply with them. Now that the 1998 Act cannot be altered by regulations, we have the best possible framework to guarantee the citizen&#039;s constitutional rights in respect of regulations. It would be better still if the Government were to introduce proposals on a written constitution meaning that the provisions of the 1998 Act cannot be overturned, even by a simple majority in Parliament. We would prefer such a constitutional system, but we have not got it. Amendment No. 46 takes us as near as we can get to clarity. Sadly, amendment (a) would not enhance that clarity, but it would dilute the 1998 Act&#039;s particular and special position.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="41117-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Let there be no doubt that what Lord Lester said in the other place yesterday and what the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1389</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) has just said demonstrate the differences between us. Although the Government were pulled kicking and screaming to include the 1998 Act, the words that they sent to the Joint Committee on Human Rights when the Committee sought to include the 1998 Act in the first place were fairly derogatory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_83">The 1998 Act is inadequate in itself to deal with the questions. That brings us to an interesting issue, which is also exemplified by the Government&#039;s agreement to the charter of fundamental rights in the European constitution&#151;dialogue is currently occurring between Strasbourg and Luxembourg on how to resolve that matter. The plain fact is that the charter of fundamental rights might have appeared in the Bill instead of the 1998 Act, or both of them might have been included. In both instances, it is assumed that the arrangements set out in those international treaties should effectively take supremacy over laws made in this Parliament according to constitutional arrangements that have developed over many centuries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_84">For example, we have just heard mention of habeas corpus. I have referred to the great authorities on that subject, in particular the chapter in Bradley and Ewing&#039;s &quot;Constitutional and Administrative Law&quot;, which points out that, with respect to the question of habeas corpus, in the context of article 5(4) of the European convention on human rights, a divergence of view has developed. That divergence of opinion could be dealt with by amending section 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 to add the forms of relief that may be granted in an application for judicial review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_85">We should have grave reservations about displacing the Habeas Corpus Act 1816 in favour of provisions emanating from the European convention on human rights. The Government hope that the European constitution will go through, in which case the charter of fundamental rights would be incorporated and exclusively adjudicated upon by the European Court. That would move us into completely different territory, because it would override the provisions contained in these enactments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_86">We are getting into deep waters, and, thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), I am glad that we have an opportunity to debate the matter at the last minute, because such debate has been excluded during the Bill&#039;s passage. I could enlarge on that matter, but we are running out of time, and I am extremely concerned that amendment (a) should make as much progress as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_117"><a name="41117-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) is right about Lord Lester, who was one of the progenitors of the 1998 Act and who, along with the Government, was instrumental in creating its form. My problem is not with the inclusion of the 1998 Act: Conservative Front-Bench Members and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam know that I submitted to the Committee, of which I was not a member, a list of Acts, of which the 1998 Act was one, and the Committee debated it. The purpose of amendment (a) is to provide 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1390</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the key instances in which the Government would require primary legislation to undermine some of the contentions of those Acts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_118"><a name="41117-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The fact that the Bill entrenches and protects human rights legislation is important, because it will enable judges to interpret regulations against the background of the articles in the human rights legislation, which provides a degree of protection. I shall not go on, because the Minister must reply.
</p>








<p><a name="st_119"><a name="41117-14_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I recognise the sincerity with which the points have been made in debate, but I argue that amendment (a) would weaken the protections inherent in the Bill, and, on behalf of the Government, I strongly feel that we should resist it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">The Government always intended the Bill to be compatible with the 1998 Act, and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) understands that point, but we welcome the additional certainty that has been created by its inclusion in the Bill. However hard one tries to agree a list of constitutionally important Acts that should be protected and put in the Bill, the list would quickly be superseded by other Acts and become redundant. Indeed, I believe that in some sense it could even subject the House to ridicule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">Perhaps more importantly, there is a real danger that any list of constitutional enactments, even were it agreed, will at some point be incomplete and partial. Such a list, which could not be amended, could lead a court to conclude that it was exhaustive and that Parliament envisaged that constitutional enactments not specified in the Bill could be amended by way of emergency regulation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_120"><a name="41117-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> 
 I was on the Committee, but have held back from saying anything until now. I would say this to the Minister: first, the list could be expressed as not being exclusive; and secondly, she has just given the best justification for a sunset clause.
</p>








<p><a name="st_121"><a name="41117-14_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Not at all. At any point in time&#151;during an annual, a three-year or a five-year process&#151;the list would, by its nature, be partial and incomplete, thereby weakening the safeguards inherent in the Bill. Once Parliament begins to list enactments that cannot be amended there is a real risk that a court could conclude that, notwithstanding the other provisions of the Bill, any enactment that is not on the list could be amended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_89">The Government remain convinced that the absence of an express power to amend constitutionally important legislation, coupled with the clear expression of the purposes for which regulations can be made and the safeguards in the Bill that I outlined, ensure that substantive amendments to such legislation are not possible by way of emergency regulation. I accept that that approach lacks the transparency of an express provision for each constitutional enactment in the Bill, and if we thought that we could protect them from inappropriate amendments by including them in the Bill, we would do so. Given that it is not possible to craft an amendment to the Bill that protects the constitutional fabric of the UK, it is better to rely on the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>implied effect of the Bill as drafted, which achieves the effect that we all wish for by ensuring that substantive amendments cannot be made to constitutional enactments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_90">I hope that I have made it clear to the House that any attempt to do otherwise would not offer the protection that we all seek, but could merely undermine the protection that is already there. Because this is such a serious matter, I would argue that it is very important that we do not accept the amendment on constitutional enactments and that the House accept the Government&#039;s position, which will ensure that the safeguards are maximised and that the constitution is as fully protected as possible.

 I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="41117-16_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 With this we may discuss Lords amendment No. 56. I inform the House that privilege is involved in Lords amendment No. 7. If the House agrees the amendment, I shall arrange for the necessary entry to be made in the <i>Journal</i>.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="41117-16_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The United Kingdom&#039;s resilience to disruptive challenges is already high. We have not been complacent. Since 11 September 2001, the Government have substantially increased the country&#039;s counter-terrorism efforts and improved contingency planning for and resilience to a range of emergencies. The amendments relate to the Government&#039;s powers to take effective action to protect the public and United Kingdom interests against acts of terror.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_92">Amendment No. 56 comprises a group of changes in one amendment. Its purpose is to provide a clearer legal basis for regulating traffic to prevent or reduce the impact of vehicle-borne terrorist attacks, especially no-warning vehicle suicide bombings, with which, around the world, we have sadly become all too familiar. We need to be able to protect critical national infrastructure sites, iconic buildings, places hosting events such as intergovernmental conferences and diplomatic premises from the threat of vehicle-borne terrorist attacks. For some sites, traffic restrictions may have an important role to play as part of a counter-terrorist strategy.

<a name="time_8">
<a name="41117-16_time0"><h5>3 pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">We need traffic controls that put a distance between the detonation of a bomb and the target, to reduce the impacts of such an attack. Likewise, reducing speeds at which vehicles loaded with explosives can approach a target enhances defensive measures and can significantly lessen the impacts of an attack. Over the past three years a great deal of technical development has been undertaken to counter the threat of vehicle-borne suicide bombs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">The purpose of the Government&#039;s motion is to ensure that a clear legal framework is in place to control traffic and deploy the necessary measures. It amends the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to enable anti-terrorist traffic regulation orders to be made by traffic authorities on the recommendation of the police; by providing for a Secretary of State override in order to direct a traffic authority to make such an order if it proves necessary; by enhancing existing police powers to control traffic in an emergency to cover terrorism or the prospect of terrorism; and by providing that traffic calming measures normally used to control vehicle speeds for road safety purposes, such as chicanes and pinch points, may also be used as anti-terrorist measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">Our anti-terrorism efforts must not be hamstrung by doubts or hesitation about legal powers, the consequences of which could be devastating. It is therefore crucial that the measures be agreed today.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1396</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_96">Lords amendment No. 7 relates to the Government&#039;s powers to require ports, airports and local authorities to purchase equipment designed to identify the presence of chemical, biological, radioactive or nuclear material&#151;CBRN material&#151;and to deploy it at ports and airports. As we demonstrated with the amendments relating to anti-terrorism traffic regulation orders, the Government are resolved to take the powers they need to combat terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_97">I fully understand the points that were made in the other place. However, the Government already have the powers that their noble lordships have sought to confer on us with their amendment No. 7. Under the Airports Act 1986, the Secretary of State may give directions to the operators of airports in the interests of national security. The Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990 gives the Government wide-ranging power to require port authorities to undertake screening and monitoring. Detailed requirements relating to maritime security have been adopted at an international level, particularly in the international ship and port facility security code, and at Community level, particularly in regulation 725/2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security. The requirements include provisions relating to security assessments for port facilities, provision of information and port facility plans. The provisions are enforced under the Ship and Port Facility (Security) Regulations 2004, under which ships and port facilities can be inspected to ensure that they comply with the Government&#039;s security requirements. Under clause 5 of the Bill an order could be made requiring local authorities&#151;or any other category 1 responder&#151;to perform their functions in a particular way. This could include the purchase and deployment of equipment that Lord Jopling suggested in the other place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_98">The powers that the amendment confers on the Government are therefore unnecessary and otiose. In addition, the new provisions could undermine the robust procedural safeguards set out in the existing powers. Existing legislation sets out in much greater detail the scope of the powers and the procedures to be followed when they are used. If left on the statute book, the provisions of their lordships&#039; amendment would cause significant confusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_99">I am sure that hon. Members will understand that, from the Government&#039;s point of view, the amendment simply would not make sense, and confusion over issues of implementing security arrangements are the last thing we would want.
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="41117-16_spnew1"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to reply to the Minister, who has made a very clear case in terms of Lords amendments Nos. 56 and 7. If I deal with them in that order, I hope that that will be convenient.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_100">I begin with Lords amendment No. 56. The Government continue to talk about a lack of complacency and a need for awareness of the new types of threat that we face today. It is reassuring, therefore, to hear that the threat of, in the colloquial phrase, suicide bombers is being looked at in more detail. It would be interesting to know exactly how far planning has gone within Government to counter the threat to, for example, the approach roads to critical national infrastructure sites, routes that are frequently used for chemical and radiological material, and other high profile targets and iconic targets around the country. Exactly what is being done to counter that threat?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1397</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_101">The Minister will be well aware of the pressure, particularly from the private sector, for security industries to help the wider police family in resisting such a threat and of the difficulty that the private security industry has encountered in training operatives to spot terrorist reconnaissance and the build-up to a suicide-type attack. I should be extremely interested to hear from the Minister not just the theory of this but the practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_102">I entirely take the Minister&#039;s points about Lords amendment No. 7. I pay tribute to Lord Jopling and the points that he raised in another place, because they do, so to speak, hold the Government&#039;s feet to the fire on a series of different measures on which it would be quite incorrect to suggest that nothing has been done yet, but which have yet properly to be implemented in all our ports and all the different points of entry to this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_103">Lord Jopling suggests that special equipment needs to be installed to monitor the contents of lorries, and that we need further special equipment designed to monitor persons, ships, other conveyances or other objects for radiological&#151;I think that should be &quot;radioactive&quot;&#151;material. The amendments also require local authorities and other public bodies to obtain specific static or mobile equipment that is designed to identify the presence of chemical material, biological organisms or radioactive substances that might be used in a terrorist attack.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_104">Undoubtedly, the Government have done something about this. I do not want to go into the details of Project Cyclamen, because if I were to do so it might provide aid and succour to the enemies of this country. It is fair to say, however, that many of Lord Jopling&#039;s points have been at least partially addressed by Project Cyclamen and the installation of various bits of specialist equipment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_105">How thorough has the deployment of that equipment been? Can the Minister say for certain that all airports are covered? I take the point about the Airports Act 1986 and the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990. The fact remains, however, that with the exception of some areas we are wide open to equipment being brought into this country. I have no doubt that trials in the near future will provide a focus for the subject under discussion today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_106">I should be interested to hear from the Minister how far Project Cyclamen has got, how successful its implementation has been, exactly how far the Minister intends to extend it and whether, indeed, our airports are as thoroughly covered as Lord Bassam suggests in his reply to Lord Jopling.
 
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="41117-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Those of us who represent major ports have concerns about my hon. Friend&#039;s point about not going into the details of Project Cyclamen. Does he agree that it is important that those who live in the vicinity of airports and seaports know enough about these matters to be secure in their minds that the work is being done properly? At the moment, they do not have such knowledge, which is a serious worry.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that I am trying to make. I do not want to expose what I regard as loopholes in our defences under the project, but the fact remains that there is much that would be reassuring and deterring if the Government were to deploy more knowledge.

<a name="41117-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_109">would be particularly telling. For example, how much of that mobile equipment is currently in the hands of non-uniformed organisations? How much of it is in the hands of uniformed organisations whose personnel are not yet trained properly in how to use it? On top of that, how much have the Government thought about using the expertise of the 60,000-odd soldiers, sailors and airmen who are all trained to a greater or lesser extent in this field? I suggest that the answer is not very much at all.
</p>

Since 11 September 2001, the Government have substantially increased the country&#039;s counter-terrorism efforts and have improved contingency planning and resilience to a range of emergencies.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 9 November 2004; Vol. 666, c. 782.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_112">I do not think so. Will the Minister tell us how many practical exercises the Government have carried out in resilience terms? I am not referring to table-top or command post exercises. How many practical exercises have there been of the sort that do not take place on a Sunday morning or in a barracks or another controlled area and in which there is a realistic level of civilian traffic, both pedestrian and vehicle, trains are running and there is a realistic amount of congestion to deal with? The answer is not one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_113">Will the Minister look closely at the amendments? I believe that they have great merit, and it appals me that Lord Bassam&#039;s reply concentrates on 30 years of terrorism in Northern Ireland and effective planning and response at a local level. All that is completely behind the curve.

 Following up the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), is my hon. Friend not of the view that, if the Government were a bit more forthcoming with information and about the availability of technology and equipment that could trace and identify the sort of matter or products involved, including nuclear chemicals and other such materials, it would be not only a huge reassurance to those of us who represents constituencies with a major airport nearby&#151;in my case, it is Manchester international airport&#151;but a deterrent to those who might think of smuggling into this country the material that our noble Friend Lord Jopling sought to deal with in his amendments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_140"><a name="41117-17_spnew2"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, which again underlines the point 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1399</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that I am trying to make. In Committee, we suggested to the Government that there should be an effective method of informing the public not only of the threat, but of what they should do in the event of the threat of an attack or an actual attack. The Government told us that that proposal was completely unnecessary, that it was scaremongering and that it would be doing the terrorist&#039;s job for him. Within weeks of making those comments, however, they issued a booklet&#151;it did not go to every household in the country, although they tried to ensure that it did&#151;trying to address precisely those points. As he says, they could go much further in terms of reassurance and in terms of the next leg of the argument&#151;training the public in how to deal with the threat that is in front of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_114">In conclusion, I would be extremely pleased to hear the Minister accept the points that my noble Friend Lord Jopling has made for the simple reason that the amendments would underline the inadequacy of the Government&#039;s response at the moment and require them to produce a wholly better and more cohesive policy in future.

</p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="41117-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The Minister has set out a sensible case in respect of Lords amendment No. 56. We should spell out in legislation the way in which highways alterations will take place for the purposes of civil contingencies, and it is sensible to include such provision in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_115">Lords amendment No. 56 adds up to more than three pages of additional text in a 30-odd page Bill, so 10 per cent. of the Bill could be taken up in dealing with quite a minor issue. Having been in local government, I cannot help but reflect that, just as we love to spell out everything in traffic regulations in intimate and minute detail, down to the width of double yellow lines, when we come to try to define in law how we can make alterations for the purposes of anti-terrorism, we seem similarly to be required to spell everything out in minute detail to give appropriate legal authority. None the less, the provisions are unremarkable in what they are seeking to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_116">On Lords amendment No. 7, the Liberal Democrats are running counter to the thrust of the debate so far today, in which we have been seeking to limit the Government&#039;s powers and tie their hands to a degree. Lords amendment No. 7 offers the Government an additional permissive power to make regulations. The Minister said they could already introduce such regulations, but the amendment, which was moved by Lord Jopling but had the support of my Liberal Democrats as well as the official Opposition, seeks to spell out the way in which the Government can make regulations in respect of the protective measures that need to be taken to prevent harmful materials from coming through ports and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_117">I thought that the Minister helped to strengthen the case for the amendment in his speech. He referred to all the existing measures that require ports and various other people to take the sort of measures that we are talking about. There is, however, quite a complex web of regulatory powers, and it might be helpful for a comprehensive Civil Contingencies Bill to spell out that the regulations affecting the ports authorities and everybody else should fall within the overall framework. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1400</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>They may have to meet other legal requirements anyway, but having one port of call would be helpful, and part 1 could effectively say to responders, &quot;These are your duties and responsibilities.&quot; Including in those responsibilities protection, scanning and the purchase and provision of equipment for detecting the noxious substances might be helpful. It would not mean that those involved did not have other legal responsibilities; it would simply mean that the civil contingencies regulations were pulled together in one place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_118">The Minister may say that the Government will take such action anyway, but the purpose of the amendment is sensible; it seeks to highlight those issues and include them in the Bill. If we send back reasons why we disagree with the Lords&#151;the Government will command the majority to ensure that that happens&#151;I hope that the Government can give additional reassurances in discussions in another place that the issue is covered. The fact that it is covered in other disparate measures is not sufficient reason for it not to be mentioned in the big, comprehensive measure before us today, which seeks to cover all eventualities. Not including such reference will leave a gap that Lords amendment No. 7 tries sensibly to plug.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="41117-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 When the Minister replies to my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer), I hope that he will also bear it in mind that, on the other side of the issue, there is considerable disquiet about actions that are unnecessary, otiose or intrusive. I say again that it is outrageous that, for example, it would be impossible to drive around Grosvenor square. It is unacceptable that such a restriction should be imposed. I think that it is illegal, although I have found it impossible to get an answer from the Government as to whether a proper case has been made under present legislation. The situation is similar with regard to the road behind the embassy. If an embassy cannot operate in a way that enables the rest of the world to go about its business, we should ask ourselves whether it is in the right place. I wish we would apply the same criterion abroad, to avoid an unacceptable impact on the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_119">I hope the Minister will reassure us that the measures will be used for their intended purpose, and not for purposes of aggrandisement or interference. Will he also have a look at measures that have already been implemented, which I consider both unnecessary and intrusive? As I have said, I should like him to look into the measures that we take abroad as well as those taken in this country, especially in regard to embassies.

 I want to follow up the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I fear that the powers in the Bill could well be misused. Let me put a specific question to the Minister, for whom I have had a high regard not just in his current role but in previous incarnations. As an Opposition Back Bencher, I should like an assurance from him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_120">Like my right hon. Friend, I am concerned about the proposals relating to roads. I am thinking of chicanes, concrete blocks and the blocking of roads. My right hon. Friend gave the example of Grosvenor square and the American embassy. I want to be certain that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1401</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposed mammoth, massive, overwhelming powers will not be abused by Government or police, and will be used and maintained only in the event of ongoing need. Roads often remain blocked almost ad infinitum.
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="41117-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman share my hope that the impact of the amendments will be such that a Secretary of State will have to make an order for works such as those in Grosvenor square, which will be challengeable in a court of law if people disagree with it? Surely that would be better than introducing these measures on an ad hoc basis.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="41117-18_spnew2"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that on this matter, at least, he and I are as one. I believe that such proposals should be made only in the context of an order. I seek a categorical assurance from the Minister that these mammoth powers will not be abused, and that the House will have an opportunity to comment on the Government&#039;s proposals. I do not suggest that the Government&#039;s powers to act in a proven emergency should be reduced, but the Minister should appreciate the view of Back Benchers in both Opposition parties that such huge powers should be used extremely sensitively and carefully.

</p>








<p><a name="st_146"><a name="41117-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I thank those who have contributed to this short debate for their generally consensual approach to these important matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_121">The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) spoke of the new suicide threat. Over many years we have, sadly, become used to bomb threats that have generally involved a warning and in which the bombers, because they did not wish to lose their lives, did not take quite as many chances as suicide bombers do. We are now living in a new world, and we should all accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_122">I do not think that the hon. Gentleman or anyone else would expect me to respond to his points in detail. I cannot, for instance, tell him exactly what is being done in the privacy of the House. However, I can reply to his question about the use of wider security forces. In many cases the police co-operate with security guards and forces in ports who are not part of the national police force. Many people join in a concerted effort to create a secure environment around a particular establishment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">There seems to be some confusion about the proposed powers. The debate seemed to centre on how they would be used, which I suppose is inevitable in a debate like this, but our proposals relate not to what we will do with the powers but to where they should lie. The hon. Member for Newark asked about specialised equipment. As I said in my opening remarks, powers allowing the use of such equipment, and allowing the Secretary of State to insist on its use in ports, airports or other places of entry, are already contained in existing legislation. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr.&nbsp;Allan) suggested that we should have just one port of call. I suppose we could have brought all the provisions together in this Bill, but the Bill as it stands is not comprehensive and would not supplant what is in other legislation. That is our difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_124">As was implied by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), the protocols for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1402</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>implementation are terribly important. They are laid out much more clearly in other legislation. I think that, if used as the primary legislation to drive future action, Lords amendment No. 7 would prove inadequate. There are 1,000 ports in this country, and a single piece of legislation applying to them. That is understandable to those operating in ports, but airports are a different matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_125">Powers already exist through my Department and through the Transport Security Directorate&#151;TRANSEC&#151;for the inspection of airports. We carry out such inspections with great thoroughness and rigour to ensure that the correct measures are taken, especially where there is the greatest danger. We take proportionate action: obviously larger ports involving sensitive goods or a considerable number of passengers will need much more attention than smaller, less significant ports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_126">The hon. Member for Newark asked about Programme Cyclamen. I am sure he will understand why I cannot give him a full answer. I cannot put operational deployment on the public record, but I should be happy to have a private discussion with the hon. Gentleman. He also asked about the role of the military. We use the military quite widely. As the existing military aid arrangements are well established and work extremely well, there is no need to place legal duties on the armed forces. The armed forces are closely linked with the civil regional resilience arrangements, and provisions in the new chapter in the strategic defence review, including the creation of civil contingencies reaction forces, will enhance their ability to respond to emergencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_127">The hon. Gentleman asked what practical measures we have taken. Unfortunately, there is not enough time left in the debate for me to go through the three-page list of things that we have done; suffice it to say that many sensible, practical measures have been taken at both national and local level to ensure that we tackle the issue of terrorism. It is not a fixed feast; such matters are constantly renewed in the light of our knowledge and understanding of how the threat to us is changing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_128">The hon. Gentleman asked about exercises. We have in place a co-ordinated, cross-governmental programme for exercises, which covers a comprehensive range of domestic, disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. I can confirm that one such exercise is happening in my constituency over the weekend and during next week&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is happening over several days, not just on a Sunday. Sometimes those are table-top exercises, but at other times they are full and live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_129">The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal made a very good point&#151;the hon. Member for Macclesfield made a similar one&#151;about what is in existing law. In existing law, but not, I am afraid, in the amendment, there are some checks and balances; for example, a permanent fixture on a road would require a local inquiry. The local authority would be required to post a direction to say what was happening and, if necessary, a public inquiry would be held in some cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_130">I shall conclude my remarks. The Opposition may want to push the motion to a vote and if I continue talking they will be unable to do so, but if there are any further points I shall be happy to respond to them in writing.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="41117-19_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The amendments relate to the role of the voluntary sector in contingency planning. The Government now accept that there is merit in capturing in statute the role of voluntary organisations. This, we believe, will create a climate of expectation that their skills, resources and expertise should be used to the full. The Government have worked closely with the voluntary sector to get the text of the amendments and the package of supporting regulations and guidance right. I therefore recommend the amendments to the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="41117-19_spnew4"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for bringing forward the amendments. They represent a breakthrough. The voluntary sector was disgracefully neglected earlier and, in Committee, we could make no progress whatever with the Government on this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_131">The work done by my noble Friend Lady Buscombe should be acknowledged. Her team has worked tirelessly and, at last, we have recognition for bodies such as the British Red Cross and others which have seen the example set by the Spanish Red Cross after the incident on 11 March. I am delighted that the Government have seen sense on this point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="41117-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I simply wish to reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) that it is very welcome that the Government have recognised the position of the voluntary sector. I know that it was a contentious and difficult issue, with different views being expressed within the voluntary sector. Bodies such as the Red Cross have been effective in keeping the issue alive, and the amendments reach a sensible compromise in making sure that the Bill formally recognises issues with which the voluntary sector will be intimately involved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="41117-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mike Hancock  (Portsmouth, South) (LD):</b> 
 I am delighted that the Minister has reflected on what was said in Committee and on Report, but it is not good enough to accept that the voluntary sector is now part of the Bill unless the Government are also convinced that resources should be forthcoming to help the voluntary sector deliver on its side of any arrangements that it may come to. It is not good enough simply to write the sector into the Bill and then deny or refuse applications for the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="41117-19_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Bill originally required decision makers to think that provisions of emergency regulations were in due proportion to an emergency or that an urgent direction was needed. Concerns were raised about that approach in both this House and the other place, and their lordships have replaced those provisions with an objective test. In other words, their amendments provide that an urgent direction must be needed, and that urgent directions or emergency regulations must be in due proportion to the situations that they address.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_132">We have re-examined the matter in the light of their noble lordships&#039; concerns and worked hard to find a compromise position to which I hope that both sides of the House can sign up. Under parts 1 and 2 of the Bill, when determining whether there is an urgent need to dispense with the requirement to consult the Council on Tribunals, the maker of urgent directions will make judgments of fact or near fact, so he will be deciding whether there is an urgent need to issue a direction or whether there is insufficient time to consult the Council on Tribunals. We believe that that approach is appropriate, so we will accept the relevant Lords amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_133">We do not accept that it would be appropriate to apply such an approach to decisions made about the kinds of provision that should be included in emergency regulations made under part 2. Any decision made about the necessary scope of emergency powers, for example, will be more subjective. There will inevitably be a question of judgment. We think that it is appropriate for the Bill to recognise that fact and to indicate clearly who will be responsible for making such a judgment call. However, we think that we should raise the threshold of the test in such cases. We have thus tabled an alternative amendment that will raise the threshold from &quot;thinks&quot; to &quot;is satisfied&quot;. That will require the maker of regulations not only to think that the provisions of regulations are appropriate, but to be satisfied, or pretty sure, of that fact. I urge the House to accept the compromise package.
</p>








<p><a name="st_175"><a name="41117-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Ministers in this House and the other place have gone a considerable way towards improving 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1409</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the nature of the test in part 1, which we welcome. References to Ministers thinking appear throughout the Bill, so I am glad that the inclusion of an objective test in part 1 is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_134">Part 2 of the Bill provides for draconian actions, so although the nature of the test in that part is more important, the Minister has not been able to go as far as we had hoped. We have argued that the proper way to deal with the matter would be to require belief on reasonable grounds. That would have included an objective element, but it would have also required the relevant Minister to justify his actions. The Government&#039;s proposal that a Minister would to have to be satisfied that something were appropriate rather than only thinking that represents a slightly stronger requirement, but it is not strong enough. We shall continue to support Lords amendment No. 37 because we are dissatisfied with the Minister&#039;s approach on the matter, although some improvements to the Bill have been made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="41117-19_spnew10"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 Liberal Democrats in this House and the other place shared concerns similar to those expressed by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.&nbsp;Heald), and we made such arguments in Committee and on Report. However, on balance, we are inclined to accept the Government&#039;s proposal. The Minister has made the case that a Minister&#039;s judgment will ultimately apply, because we cannot avoid the fact that Ministers will make judgments for which they will be held to account about whether conditions prevail to such an extent that emergency regulations should be brought into play.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_135">If we come to challenge a Minister through the legal process or in the House, it is important that the test is genuine so that he or she cannot say, &quot;I thought the measures were appropriate, so you can&#039;t do anything to me. If I thought wrongly then tough luck.&quot; The threshold of the test is important, but we think that the new wording is satisfactory. The inclusion of the word &quot;appropriate&quot; in the Bill will mean that we will have something to get our teeth into when we come to testing a Minister. Although there are several ways in which the provisions could be phrased to give us more certainty, we must strike a balance somewhere. We think that the Government have conceded enough at this stage of the Bill&#039;s passage to satisfy us that the test will be sufficiently robust.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041117/debtext/41117-20.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_177"><a name="41117-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 It would be churlish not to acknowledge that the Minister and the Government in general have made a useful concession. In a sense, one could accept it. However, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) desires to go with Lords amendment No. 37 and I am content to follow him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_136">There is no doubt that clause 22 provides for substantive powers. I reminded the House of the extent of those in our debate on the first group of amendments. The question is: what should trigger the exercise of those powers? The test of &quot;thinks&quot; was too low a threshold. The Minister was right about that. The question is whether there is a significant difference between the concept of being satisfied and that contained in amendment No. 37. I think that there is relatively little 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1410</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>difference between the two tests. The test formulated in the other place sets a slightly higher threshold. In ordinary circumstances, I would not fall out about that, but if my hon. Friend thinks that it is a matter of principle, I shall support him.
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="41117-20_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Amendment No. 37 proposes an objective test, to be satisfied on reasonable grounds. I shall respond to the point about an objective test, unless the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.&nbsp;Heald) has something to add.
</p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="41117-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 If one requires a belief to be genuine, and also to have reasonable grounds to support it, the objectivity comes in the provision of the reasonable grounds. I accept that that is not what the amendment says, as I mentioned in my contribution, but it provides an objective test, something that we welcome.
</p>








<p><a name="st_180"><a name="41117-20_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman makes that clear. In that case, an objective test would achieve the wrong results in certain situations and should be rejected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_137">Let me give an example. Consider the outbreak of a strain of flu that is fatal. Faced with a cluster of flu-related fatalities in an area, the Minister may quite reasonably take the view that there is a threat of serious damage to human welfare in that area, and that it is proportionate and necessary to use emergency powers to impose limits on public gatherings to limit the spread of the disease. If, after a week of laboratory tests and developments on the ground, it becomes clear that the new strain is not highly contagious and it was unnecessary to restrict public gatherings, amendment No. 37 would make the emergency regulations unlawful. Anyone affected by them could successfully challenge them and seek compensation, even though the Minister acted reasonably and appropriately.
</p>








<p><a name="st_181"><a name="41117-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 The decision that would be considered would be the one made on a particular day. The hon. Lady refers to a week later on.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="41117-20_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 That is right, but the longer-term effect of the amendment would be that Ministers would delay taking reasonable and appropriate action to deal with an emergency until they were 100 per cent. sure that they knew what the emergency entailed. That cannot be right. The idea of an objective test, with the threshold set that high, is not appropriate. In addition, I do not accept that stipulating &quot;on reasonable grounds&quot; would solve the problem. As I said on different groups of amendments, it is not necessary for that to be specified. I do not expect the hon. Gentleman to want to re-run that particular argument now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_138">The &quot;satisfied&quot; test is a higher threshold than the &quot;thinks&quot; test and goes a long way towards meeting hon. Members&#039; concerns. Let me give an example of when &quot;satisfied&quot; is a higher test than &quot;thinks&quot;. If a Minister is informed of a credible threat of extensive life-threatening flooding in East Anglia, but there is a suggestion that the wind may change and the rain will fall elsewhere, he would have to balance and evaluate the evidence available. A Minister might meet the &quot;thinks&quot; test if he or she reasonably considered that the flood was likely to happen. The Minister might have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>some doubts, but if the flood were more likely to happen than not, and he or she had reached that conclusion reasonably on the basis of the available evidence, the &quot;thinks&quot; test would be met. However, to be satisfied that an emergency was about to happen, the Minister would have to be more certain. He or she would have to pretty sure that the flood was likely to occur and have no substantial doubts about the point.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. During the Division, there was a good deal of confusion between Portcullis house and the Chamber. A large number of us, hearing that the Division was off, turned back; that may have been our fault. But when we returned, at least two of us&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson) and I&#151;tried to get in the door downstairs behind the Chamber. The door was locked and our passes would not open it, despite the fact that the light was flashing green, so we could not get up to vote. Will you have that looked into?

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="41117-21_spnew1"><b> Tony Worthington  (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was one of the first Members here for the last vote, and the monitors clearly showed that the Division was off. I then moved to Portcullis house and misled hon. Members by saying that the Division was off, which seemed a sensible thing to tell them, as it had been announced. That should be taken into account, in addition to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall).
</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="41117-21_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Perhaps I can clarify the situation for hon. Members. The Division on Lords amendment No. 10 was called off. The Division on Lords amendment No. 37 followed in quick succession. That, perhaps, explains some of the difficulty. I remind hon. Members that in proceedings such as these, Divisions can be called at any time. On the matter of the door, I will draw that to the attention of the Serjeant at Arms.

<a name="stpa_143">Yesterday, in another place, my noble Friend Lord Rooker offered a commitment that our Department will pursue positively with stakeholders the possibility of a compulsory element to the dry run in a local or sub-regional area further to test our proposals ahead of the introduction of national compulsory packs. That would be achieved by commencing the statutory scheme in the chosen area earlier than in the rest of England and Wales. Clause 231(8) provides the necessary powers. We will involve all the key consumer and industry stakeholders in the arrangements and in the monitoring and evaluation of the voluntary and compulsory elements of the dry run.

<a name="stpa_144">We are confident that we have the flexibility within this Bill quickly to respond through regulations to any problems that arise before or during the dry run period or with the compulsory element.

<a name="stpa_149">In this case, there is undoubtedly a degree of repentance on the part of the Minister, and we should be generous about that. He has listened to the concerns expressed by Opposition Members. In that respect, despite my intrinsic reservations about all Liberal Democrats, I have to say that they have been at one with us. He has listened to the concerns expressed in the House of Lords by peers of all parties, including Cross Benchers. He has listened to the concerns expressed by the Law Society. Incidentally, although he withdrew the remark, it was not terribly emollient of Lord Rooker to describe it as the &quot;Lie Society&quot; in the other place. That was not the right tone for the Government to use in making such a U-turn.

<a name="stpa_151">Let me lay my cards on the table. I make no secret of the fact that I believe that home information packs are unnecessary and will be unhelpful.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not right that the state should compulsorily interfere with two freely contracting individuals, and that that is the heart of the argument that Conservative Members have advanced?

<p><a name="st_213"><a name="41117-21_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 For once, there is a nuance of difference between my hon. Friend and I, who agree about so much, so often. As hon. Members know, I am not an advocate of the unbridled free market, and I believe that there is a civilising role for Government and local government. In this instance, however, my hon. Friend is spot on, because the case that the Government made&#151;that this would assist the marketplace&#151;was not made persuasively. It did not persuade Opposition Members and clearly it has not persuaded the Lords.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_152">For that reason, the trial, as we can now reasonably call it, becomes highly significant. If my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) is right about this, as he probably is, and if our reservations are founded in common sense&#151;as, in my judgment, they are&#151;so that significant problems arise during the course of the trial, it is absolutely right that this House should have the power to suspend the implementation of the packs. That would mean that instead of a dry run leading to an inevitability, we would

<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1418</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have a legitimate and genuine pilot scheme. Under a pilot scheme, one tests something, sees what has gone wrong, and alters it. The suspension suggested in the amendment will be essential following the failure that sellers packs will undoubtedly become; otherwise, we will experience the chaos predicted by many experts, colleagues in this place, and Members of the Lords.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_153">I acknowledge that the Minister has recognised those arguments. He has had the courage to make a significant concession, for which we must be grateful. But I have to say, although I do not want to be churlish, that he could have done that a long time ago. We had this debate in Committee, on Second Reading and during several other debates in this place and in the other place. It is an 11th-hour conversion, but at least it is a conversion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_154">I make a prediction and a commitment. The prediction is that, in their trial, sellers packs will be a disaster. The commitment is that, when a Conservative Government are elected to office&#151;as I confidently expect next year&#151;we will use the provision to suspend sellers packs at the outset. We are not convinced about them for the reasons that have often been articulated. I shall not tire the House by repeating them.

Baroness Hanham and Lord Hanningfield have been notable in that campaign, supported by Liberal Democrat Members. Without that pressure and the humble contribution of those in this place, who pale into insignificance beside the eloquence of our colleagues in the other place, we would not have wrung the concession from the Minister. He is a sinner that repenteth and I welcome his repentance. Sellers packs will not work. They will be suspended and the proposed new provision provides the chance to do that. We therefore welcome it.

 The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) represents the amendments differently from my understanding of them. The principle of a compulsory scheme appears to have been accepted by both Houses. The system of buying and selling in this country through chains of transactions means that it is important for one comprehensive system to apply. That will happen and I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister on standing firm and ensuring that that forms part of the eventual legislation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_157">The major difference between Conservative Members and us is that we have always acknowledged the need to introduce energy efficiency into the home sale at some point. We do not believe that it should be at the point of marketing but at the point of sale. That would bring it into line with the European directive. If the problems envisaged with home information packs occur and the proposed new power is needed, we hope that the ability to meet the terms of the European directive can rapidly be established at the point of sale, not of marketing. The Government have not given themselves the power to do that but they would have to do it to fulfil the terms of the directive if they used the proposed new provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_158">I welcome the Government&#039;s change of heart. We are pleased to have played our part in persuading them of the need for it.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="41117-22_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I was sorry that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) was a little taken aback by Lord Rooker&#039;s forcefulness. Perhaps my noble Friend feels that there is quite sufficient emollient on these ministerial Benches in normal circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">I know that the energy performance certificate has been a matter of some concern to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green). The EC directive requires the certificate to be made available when a property is sold. It also says that the certificate should be made available to prospective buyers to enable consumers to compare and assess the energy performance of the property being sold. The objectives of the directive would clearly not be met if the certificate were just handed over to the buyer on completion. It must be made available earlier in the process to provide the consumer with a genuine choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_160">The hon. Member for Ludlow has raised the issue of what happens to the energy performance certificate in the event of a suspension or non-pursuit of the home information package. The power to suspend in amendment No. 128C is a power to suspend all or some of the duties in clauses 137 to 141. It is limited to those clauses and would not affect other powers or provisions in part 5, including the ones in clause 144. However, the power in clause 144(9)(a) to make regulations altering the time at which a pack document is provided will still exist. If a suspension order were to be made affecting the duties under clause 138, therefore, this would not prevent special arrangements from being made for the timing of the production of energy performance certificates, if that were deemed necessary.

The Government have given further consideration to amendment No. 191. We continue to take the view that its effect will be broadly in line with that of existing policies on residential energy efficiency, and that there has been no weakening of the Government&#039;s determination to make serious progress on energy efficiency. However, we recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. We still believe that duties based on specific numerical figures are inflexible and better avoided in primary legislation, but we have decided to accede to the principle of the amendment as providing some comfort that the Government stand by the energy efficiency aim that they have declared.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_163">We listened carefully to the arguments made in this House and elsewhere and we accepted the strength of those arguments. What we emphatically did not take into account was the disgraceful full-page advertisement naming names that appeared in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper after the vote here. It was paid for by Greenpeace and an organisation called ACT, of which I personally had never heard before and of which I wish to hear no more. The advertisement pandered to the vulgar tabloid theory convenient to at least some elements hostile to the Government that Members of Parliament will always in some knee-jerk fashion cave in to pressures from the Prime Minister. Frankly&#151;I speak as a former deputy Chief Whip&#151;anybody with the most primitive knowledge of recent events in this Parliament will recognise that that is a lie.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_164">The advertisement went on to state that the consequences of the vote would be the deaths of 30,000 people. That statement is outrageous. It is in plain ignorance of the facts of the case. Not even the most passionate advocate of the energy and fuel poverty amendments that we were debating would make such a dishonest claim, and nobody did so. The advertisement also betrayed a total ignorance of the way in which Parliament works.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_165">I shall remind the House and, more to the point, those outside, how Parliament does work. I acknowledge the position of those Members of Parliament who felt that they could not support the position of the Government during the debate, some of whom have a long history of advocacy of the energy efficiency target, but I have to say to the House in all candour&#151;I hope that this message gets through to those outside elements&#151;that the voices to which I listened were the private representations of the colleagues who rightly supported the Government in the Divisions. If a Government are to work, they must depend on the support of Government Members, who continued in this case to make the argument with me. It was precisely because I recognised their loyalty and concern that I worked in Government to accept their argument. They are the Members who succeeded and to whom credit should be paid. There will be no names and no pack drill this time, but they know who they are, and I hope that they will claim the credit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_166">After the votes in question, one of my Labour colleagues wrote to <i>The Guardian</i> to say that, if anything, the Greenpeace advertisement would be more likely to heighten the Government&#039;s resistance to the energy efficiency amendment. I cannot say that I was not tempted. There is something of an object lesson here about the perhaps too easy signing of early-day motions; something along the lines of chickens coming home to roost springs to mind. Personally, as a Back Bencher, I resolved after the 1997 general election never again to sign an early-day motion, and I cannot say that I have suffered much as a consequence.

<a name="41117-22_para11">

I know that such outfits have to justify their donations by various stunts, but this stunt could well have backfired, and I wonder whether those involved really care about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_168">I hope that the House will recognise that amendment No. 191B is a significant concession to colleagues who feel strongly about the matter. We are satisfied that the amendment will not place an additional burden on the Government. We have tabled it to rectify some technical deficiencies in Lords amendment No. 191. The definition of residential accommodation in amendment No. 191B mirrors that in the Sustainable Energy Act 2003 to bring the provision into line with the designated aims, and proposed subsection (2) clarifies that that duty does not affect the duty to designate an aim under that Act. Finally, amendment No. 191C, which amends clause 231, the commencement clause, provides that the new clause introduced by amendment No. 191B will come into force two months from the date of Royal Assent.

To counterbalance some of the criticism, let me pay tribute to all those, outside this place and in it, who fought for the cause of eliminating fuel poverty, including all-party groups and, indeed, to those who embarrassed the Government when it became clear that they had started to renege on a public commitment made more than 15&nbsp;times.

Because the Minister has conceded, there will be a return to the original position of recognising the efficacy of a 20&nbsp;per cent. decrease in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010, on the basis of the 1990 levels. That is what the Minister&#039;s commitment means and, in practice, many of the arguments articulated in the other place and in the House will find a form in the Bill in a clear restatement of policy to do something real and deliverable about emissions, fuel poverty and other issues related to energy efficiency.

 As one who suffered damage to his reputation by the Greenpeace advertisement that has been mentioned, I thank my right hon.

I am sure that even the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr.&nbsp;Hayes) would agree, without spin, that my right hon.

 I note the Government&#039;s concession, but we should not get carried away and start thinking that it is a concession of much substance. All that the concession does is require the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to ensure that by 2010 the general level of energy efficiency of residential accommodation is increased by at least 20&nbsp;per cent. compared with the general level in 2000. No sanction will apply if that target is not met. There are no stepping stones, interim or otherwise, on the way to that target. We know that the Government have cynically abandoned a range of targets when it has become apparent that they will not be met. Why should we be party to allowing the general public to be duped into thinking that this is a concession of real substance?

 Let us make no mistake: I do not say for a moment that I would not be a better Minister than the right hon.

Of course, the House and the whole country know that, but when improvements are made, even if they are modest, we have a responsibility to welcome them. The Government have moved in our direction.

If he thinks that it is better than nothing, I suppose that I will go along with his judgment, but we should not send the message from the House that the Government have made a major climbdown or U-turn.

 That is true, but my hon.

There are minor differences, but at last the Bill contains a commitment to energy efficiency that is essential if we are to meet the carbon emissions targets, which we all agree are vital.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. I hope that he can assure me that he feels confident that we know what the general level of energy efficiency was in 2000, so that we have a benchmark against which we can measure. One of the problems is that the Government promote targets, but we find that the baselines for those targets have not been properly defined. For example, the Government certainly kept on saying that they would produce a definition of congestion on the roads, but they never did and they eventually abandoned the target altogether. I shall give way to my hon. Friend again if he can assure me that there is a definition of the general level of energy efficiency in 2000 that would be a proper benchmark.

<p><a name="st_251"><a name="41117-24_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for painting me as the moderate in such matters. The Government&#039;s advisers have been very clear about the benchmark, and we called in aid those advisers when they said that they could not understand why the Government had adjusted their target. So the Government&#039;s advice, based on a proper measurement of the current situation, is in line with our thinking, the Lords thinking and the Government&#039;s new thinking, and I am therefore confident that we have made progress.

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="41117-24_spnew9"><b> Mr. Chope: </b>

 My hon. Friend reminds us that the Bill is not about annuities and the privileges enjoyed by the better-off and the very rich in society; it is about pension security for large numbers of people in final salary schemes, many of whom have been urging the House to take action. As the Minister responsible for the Bill, I have to say that, given the so-called ping-pong that is taking place, I am worried about the measure. We want to see it become an Act of Parliament so that the pension protection fund will be in place to protect workers from April this year. I am sure that common sense will prevail, whatever honest disagreements there may be on this issue, and that the other place will want the legislation to come into force as soon as possible.

 Does the Minister accept that the annuity regime was enacted in wholly different circumstances?

In the current circumstances, people have no incentive whatever to take out a private pension, so does not he accept that the whole matter must be looked into urgently?

Is not it amazing how the Turner report has rapidly become a catch-all excuse for this Government not to do anything on pensions?

No one seems to know when the initial rule of compulsory annuitisation was first introduced, but it is clear that since then much has changed, including life expectancy. In fact, their lordships appear to have had a minor spat about exactly how long people will live, but that is separate from the central issue, which is that many more people now live beyond 75 than ever before. The whole rule is completely out of date.
</p>

I can testify from my knowledge of my constituents that many people have done the right thing&#151;and what the Government claim to want them to do&#151;and made provision during their working lives for their retirement so that they do not need to fall back on the benefit system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr.&nbsp;Willetts) argued only yesterday, what business is that of the Treasury, provided those people do not fall back on the benefit system?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para6">

<a name="stpa_205">The rule is wholly at odds with the Government&#039;s professed policy of trying to incentivise savings. We all know that the marketplace for annuities is difficult, to put it mildly, and that the return on annuities has fallen sharply over a long period. We know that the savings ratio has halved since 1997. We clearly need incentives to save, and even the interim report from the Turner commission makes that clear.

</p>








<p><a name="st_294"><a name="41117-26_spnew8"><b> Mr. Webb </b> 
: I spent a happy hour earlier this evening listening to their lordships as they debated this amendment. Given that the Government have rejected an outright abolition of the annuity rule, the Liberal Democrats also warmly welcome the Lords&#039; attempt substantially to relax it by raising the compulsory age for annuitisation from 75 to 85. It was intriguing to compare and contrast the approaches adopted by the two Ministers: Baroness Hollis gave detailed, careful and thorough arguments, none of which stood up, but they were at least comprehensive; the Minister for Pensions simply said that privilege applied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_211">Even if privilege applies, we do not necessarily need to refuse to accept the Lords amendment. We can say that, although privilege applies, we will none the less accept it. In other words, if we think that it is good, we can say, &quot;Fine. Privilege may or may not apply, but we will take it anyway.&quot; So I am afraid that the Minister has let down the House by not responding to the substance of the Lords amendment this evening. Indeed, he did not even refer to its content at all, as far as I could tell, other than by referring to privilege.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_212">Surely the key point is that we are dealing with a different way of approaching the issue from the one we took yesterday. Yesterday, we said that annuitisation would be allowed in all circumstances except when means-tested benefits were brought into play; today we have the different approach of raising the age from 75 to 85. A different approach warrants a different response from the Minister, but we did not get one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_213">Life expectancy at 65 has been discussed at both ends of the Palace, but Baroness Hollis was still unclear in her response. She seemed to say that life expectancy at the age of 65 had risen by 16.3 years, but she then said that the typical 65-year-old would live to 82. The two statements do not appear to be consistent, so I am not quite sure what was going on there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_214">The issue is significant. If a typical 65-year-old now lives to 82 or 84, as the Turner commission figures on a different definition suggest, the key point is that, since 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1435</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the annuity age was last raised from 70 to 75, life expectancy has risen by three or four years or by perhaps as many as six or seven. I was interested to hear what the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said. If the age became 80 instead of 85, as we are considering now, the case would be overwhelming. That would simply return us to the status quo.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_215">I am struggling to think who passed the 1974 legislation, but the key point is that the annuitisation age was raised from 70 to 75 over a 20-year period&#151;it was first set at 70 about 20 years previously&#151;to keep up with changing life expectancies. As life expectancies move on, unless we want the annuitisation rule to bite harder and harder year after year, we need to raise the age from 75 even if we accept the principle of compulsory annuitisation. It is self-evident that even to maintain the status quo of the original policy intention when the age of 75 was brought in, we must raise it at the very least to 80. The age of 85 goes further in the direction that we want, but the Government should seriously consider 80 as a gracious concession.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_216">I intervened on the Minister and asked whether this was an issue of principle. He declined to say that it was. Indeed, it is extraordinary that Baroness Hollis is saying that we cannot possibly make the change for all sorts of reasons. For example, when people take out a pension, they know it has to be annuitised so she says that it would be wrong to change the rules at the end. That is an issue of principle. She then says that those people have had what she described as tremendously generous tax relief. Because they have all that tax relief, it would be wrong not to force them to annuitise. She gave several other examples that also appeared to be arguments of principle. However, she then said, &quot;Ah, but next year when Adair Turner has reported, we might change our minds.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_217">Is this an issue of principle, or is it not? Patently it is not an issue of principle. If it were, the fact that Adair Turner might come up with a recommendation next year would not change the principle. It is therefore a pragmatic issue and, given the importance that the Liberal Democrats attach to the Bill&#151;unlike the Conservative Opposition we did not vote to decline to give it a Second Reading; we have supported it throughout&#151;we think that the Government need to recognise that it is not an issue of principle. If it were, they would not be saying that they might change their minds next year. Given that is not an issue of principle, why risk the Bill? Why not make a substantive movement in the direction of recognising that, even on a pragmatic basis, the age threshold should be raised.

<a name="41117-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_218">Important contributions were made in their lordships&#039; House about why the argument about tax, which is obviously important, does not hold water. I fully accept that if people have had some tax relief on the fund, the Exchequer should at some point receive a fair share of tax. I accept that principle. We have already pointed out, however, that if people defer annuitisation but start to draw down and then die, 35 per cent. will go in tax. In fact, although Baroness Hollis implied that if the fund were not touched it would be passed on tax free, Lord MacGregor pointed out that if that added to the value of an estate, a tax rate of 40 per cent. could easily apply to the many people who have houses at or above the value of the inheritance tax threshold. That is the higher rate of income tax.

<a name="stpa_219">If we force people to annuitise, the best that we will get is 40 per cent., which is the higher rate of income tax, and we might get less than that. If people do not annuitise and they become liable to inheritance tax, the whole thing will be taxed at 40 per cent. The Exchequer could benefit from not requiring compulsory annuitisation. I accept that the Exchequer has the right to the tax, but it is far from obvious that, by relaxing the rule on compulsory annuitisation, it loses out at all. Therefore, why not give people a choice? What would be lost by giving people a choice? No one would lose because the Exchequer would get its share, and possibly eventually more. If people annuitised, they would get a 25 per cent. tax-free lump sum, but if they did not do so, the whole value of what was left could be liable to 40 per cent. inheritance tax, and thus the Exchequer might receive more tax.

Although such people form a minority now, even minorities have the right to fair treatment, as one might say in a different context. If the proposal would mean that no one would lose and that people would get additional choices, I do not understand why the Government will not accept it.

The Minister should respond positively to a pragmatic matter relating to a Bill that I support. I shall consult my colleagues in the House of Lords on the attitude that they will take tomorrow, but I hope that the Minister will sleep on what has been said and realise that we are willing to be reasonable. If he were to offer us the serious prospect of revisiting the matter, I would be happy to talk to my noble Friends to decide how to take things forward.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Because of your duties in the House today, you may not be aware that the Prime Minister earlier this evening briefed the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), on proposals to restore a power-sharing Executive in Stormont, and at the same time in Dublin the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic briefed the leader of Sinn Fein/IRA, Gerry Adams, on plans to achieve the objective of total decommissioning. Will you find time for the Prime Minister to come to the House tomorrow on this important matter for the future governance of Northern Ireland, to inform the House of what is in these proposals so that we can question him on what was proposed to the leader of the Democratic Unionist party and to the leader of Sinn Fein/IRA in Dublin earlier this evening?

<a name="time_19">
<a name="41117-28_time0"><h5>9.36 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_316"><a name="41117-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Keith Bradley  (Manchester, Withington):</b> 
 I am pleased to be granted this debate on the closure of post offices in South Manchester, because it is a matter of extreme importance to my constituents in that part of the city, as well as to people throughout Manchester who are similarly suffering from post office closures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_229">May I make it clear at the outset that I am not challenging the urban reinvention programme? I supported it in the House and I recognise the need for a proper, effective strategic review of urban post offices to ensure a comprehensive spread of that service throughout the city of Manchester. What I am challenging is the consultation process undertaken by Post Office Ltd., and the decisions on the closures that have been taken as a result of that consultation process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_230">In south Manchester, in my constituency, Manchester Withington, three post offices were identified for closure in the latest round of such closures. I shall briefly discuss each of them. First, I want to make a general point. When the three post offices were announced, one of them was already temporarily closed, but I immediately visited the other two and found that, prior to any consultation process beginning, arrangements had been made for potential pay-offs to those sub-postmasters. They already knew that the intention was to close those post offices before any consultation process had begun. Already there was an intention by the Post Office to identify and make arrangements for those post offices to close.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_231">The consultation process began with Beech road in Chorlton. Beech road is a lively local shopping area that has become more and more popular in recent years. The post office on Beech road is at the heart of that community. The plan to close the post office was greeted with great dismay by local residents and a campaign to keep it open was immediately launched. Petitions were compiled and a public meeting was arranged locally. I pay tribute to the two local ward councillors&#151;Labour councillors&#151;Sheila Newman and Val Stevens, who did so much work to properly gauge public opinion on the proposed closure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_232">Several key points came out of that consultation exercise. First, a significant number of elderly and disabled people who live in that immediate area need local access to post office services. Secondly, the closure of that post office would have a serious impact on other local traders&#151;the area is vibrant and expanding and the post office is part of that local economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_233">Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the Post Office&#039;s view that the majority of current users of the Beech road branch would transfer to Hardy lane post office has no credibility. Anyone who understands the local geography of that part of south Manchester knows that if local people lost their local post office in Beech road, they would look towards Chorlton main post office, because of the natural flow of the population towards the centre of the city. Even now, however, Chorlton post office is incapable of dealing with the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1443</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>number of people who use it. Queues are long and no parking facilities exist, particularly for disabled people. If Beech road post office closes, it is a long walk to Chorlton main post office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_234">When the decision was taken to continue with the post office closure, the Post Office provided this justification:
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_235">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;From our planning assumptions, we would expect the majority of customers to migrate to Hardy Lane branch and others to Chorlton-cum-Hardy branch. I know you are doubtful about Chorlton-cum-Hardy branch being able to cope with any additional business and I hope that when my colleague, Helen Jachim, wrote to you last month she allayed your concerns.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_236">She certainly did not, because the planning assumption that only a minority of people would transfer to Chorlton main post office was wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_237">Even if a minority transferred, the capacity problems would remain, because there is also a proposal to close another post office, which is just outside my constituency in Upper Chorlton road, with those customers transferring to Chorlton main post office. The arguments that have been advanced have no validity and the consultation, which showed local people&#039;s genuine feelings, was totally ignored.
</p>








<p><a name="st_317"><a name="41117-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Graham Stringer  (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend will not be surprised to learn that the story that he is describing in south Manchester has also taken place in north Manchester. The consultation was a sham and a disgrace, and false and misleading information has been put out about alternative post offices and the facts and figures in north Manchester. Today, Collyhurst post office is closed, leaving the people of Collyhurst without any obvious alternative&#151;one of the two alternatives identified is not on a bus route, while the other, the Crown post office, is in the city centre. The situation is unsatisfactory, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>








<p><a name="st_318"><a name="41117-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradley: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s view. The key phrase is &quot;sham consultation&quot;, and my second example will underline that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_238">The second proposal was to close Mauldeth road west post office and Burton road post office, both of which are in the Old Moat ward in my constituency. As I said earlier, Mauldeth road west post office was already temporarily closed, and there were issues surrounding the location of that particular post office. It was only acceptable to confirm that temporary closure as permanent if the Burton road post office was still available to the people of Old Moat, and particularly those in the south of that ward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_239">As a result of hard work by Labour councillors, again, we had an opportunity properly to gauge public opinion during the consultation exercise, and, again, key points emerged. First, and most importantly, a previous closure had occurred in that area on Barlow Moor road in west Didsbury. The justification for that closure was that the Burton road post office would be the receiving post office for those customers. When I did not oppose that particular closure because of circumstances in that area, I made it clear that it would not be acceptable for the Post Office to return at a future date and close the Burton road post office, which is the receiving post office for the one that closed. That is typical of what is happening around the country. And it has been completely ignored by Post Office Ltd.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_240">Secondly, Old Moat is one of the most deprived wards not only in Manchester but throughout the country. The closure of Burton road and Mauldeth road west would mean that the whole ward would have no post office service available to it. That is completely unsustainable in terms of the deprivation factors that should apply when considering closures.
</p>








<p><a name="st_319"><a name="41117-28_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Lorna Fitzsimons  (Rochdale) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend share my utter dismay that although Members on both sides of the House voted for specific money to be allocated to areas of deprivation where sub-post offices were under threat, the Post Office admitted to me that it is closing such sub-post offices, but has passed the buck to my hon. Friend the Minister and to other Departments instead of owning its responsibility to find solutions in areas of deprivation?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041117/debtext/41117-29.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_320"><a name="41117-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a sound point. That flows through all the consultations that we have experienced in Greater Manchester and the north-west.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_241">A second key point about the Old Moat ward is that many elderly people live in that area, and if these two post offices closed, leaving the ward with none, they would have to travel to the centre of Withington, which for some elderly people is well over a mile away, to get post office services. That is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">Thirdly, the justification for closing the Burton road and Mauldeth road post offices was that a significant number of customers would transfer to Hart road post office. That view beggars belief. If the Post Office understood the geography of this part of south Manchester, it would know that the people of Old Moat would not even have Hart road on their radar. When I challenged it about that, it informed me that it had a state-of-the-art modelling system that had helped it reach its conclusion. When it failed to send me the details of that, I suggested that it might be better to ask local people what they thought about transferring to Hart road. The people to whom I spoke would probably need an overnight stay before returning home if they used that post office. It is a completely unacceptable alternative.
</p>








<p><a name="st_321"><a name="41117-29_spnew1"><b> James Purnell  (Stalybridge and Hyde) (Lab):</b> 
 I thank councillors Bernard Walsh and Kevin Welsh for their hard work in Ridge Hill in my area, where we faced exactly the same problem as my right hon. Friend describes. We thought that we had luckily found a solution whereby the mini-market next door would be able to take over the franchise, but the Post Office refused even to meet its owner, on the basis that it wanted to be able to transfer all the business to another post office. Is not that completely unacceptable when someone else is prepared to take over the service for a deprived estate that is on top of a hill and a long way from the town centre?
</p>








<p><a name="st_322"><a name="41117-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In the course of the consultation exercise, I asked Post Office Ltd. to look for an alternative outlet in the Old Moat ward, but silence was the stern reply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">The only conclusion that we can draw from these examples is that the consultation exercise is a complete sham, as my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1445</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Blackley (Mr. Stringer) said. The Post Office knew what it wanted when it embarked on the exercise, and public opinion and the sound arguments that were put by representatives would only be ignored at the end of the consultation process. I ask the Minister to intervene in order carefully to consider the way in which these closures are being undertaken and the process that Post Office Ltd. is employing to arrive at its conclusions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">Will the Minister consider the precise role of Postwatch in this exercise? At a local level, I have received extremely good co-operation from Postwatch. Dario Cottingham has been extremely helpful. He has attended meetings with me, and he attended the public meeting and tried to represent the views expressed back through Postwatch to Post Office Ltd.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">However, I question whether Postwatch is meeting the objectives that it set itself. Judith Donovan, the regional chairman of Postwatch Northern England, said to me:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">for the local area. I question whether Postwatch can justify the closures and its views on them and also fulfil its commitment as the representative of the consumer in the process. Should not it challenge the decisions? Will the Under-Secretary therefore consider its role in the process?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">I strongly believe that we must ensure public confidence in the urban reinvention programme, for which the Under-Secretary is ultimately responsible. I am sure that my hon. Friends from Manchester and Greater Manchester agree. It is not acceptable for Post Office Ltd. simply to ignore the views of local communities in constituencies such as mine. It should set about trying to protect the most vulnerable, the elderly and the disabled in our local communities to ensure that they have proper and efficient access to Post Office services and that south Manchester, Manchester and Greater Manchester have a proper network of post offices that meet the needs of local consumers.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">My right hon. Friend knows that responsibility for postal services has come to me only recently and that there have been many Adjournment debates, other debates and questions in the House about the process. I was grateful for his opening remarks about his support for the principles behind the urban reinvention programme. He is aware of the state of Royal Mail and post offices that we inherited from the previous Government. He will acknowledge and welcome the &#163;2&nbsp;billion that the Government spent on developing Royal Mail and postal services. He also knows that the Government are committed to maintaining a viable nationwide network of post offices for the future. In a wider context, he knows about the massive challenge for everyone involved in achieving that viability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">Under the previous Government, there was no planned programme, and unplanned closures and many gaps appeared in the system. That clearly affects the whole country. My right hon. Friend knows that the Government&#039;s policy for the post office network was based on the performance and innovation unit&#039;s report, &quot;Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;, which was published in 2000. The report was widely welcomed as squaring up honestly to the challenges that the network faced. It made 24 recommendations for the future, all of which the Government accepted. It showed starkly that our network of post offices had not kept pace with the changing needs of its customers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_252">Too often, post offices had become dingy and shabby through lack of investment and were losing business. The business had lost touch with its customers&#039; needs, which are different now from those of a generation ago. Following years of underinvestment, the Post Office business was in a spiral of decline.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_253">It is important to detail the circumstances that led to the company&#039;s rationalisation programme, which includes the closure of some offices, including those that we heard about from my right hon. Friend, and some in my own constituency. He knows that a number of post offices closed in my constituency of Bradford, South and that two days before I achieved this responsibility there were issues surrounding the Crown post office in my city of Bradford. I too have been heavily involved in the process that the Government set up to try to ensure that consultation was adequate and real.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_254">My right hon. Friend will know that in February our hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms), who had these ministerial responsibilities before me, actually changed and detailed more fully the guidelines for the consultations that he expected to be undertaken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_255">My right hon. Friend and hon. Members will know that the Government are Royal Mail&#039;s principal shareholder, and that this Government gave Royal Mail the commercial freedoms that have allowed it to turn the business round, as it is doing. We are expecting to hear in the interim results this week that the situation is far better than it has been in the past. That does not help my right hon. Friend in respect of the closures in his constituency, but it is important to put on the record the general position, which I know that most Members of Parliament support&#151;the need for a viable post office network within a viable Royal Mail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_256">I shall pick up some of the points that were raised. I too, in that meeting with elected representatives from Manchester, was very concerned about the role of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>17 Nov 2004 : Column 1447</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Postwatch, because there is a clear procedure for Postwatch to use if it believes that closures are unnecessary, and I had concerns about the matters that were raised yesterday, and tonight by my right hon. Friend. So I will undertake to contact Postwatch to see what was done to find out why perhaps the next stage proposals were not achieved. I want to know from Postwatch its role in this matter, because as my right hon. Friend has said, it is the consumer watchdog in this case and it should be putting consumers&#039; interests first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_257">I am also concerned to hear from my right hon. Friend&#039;s speech and from the meeting yesterday that the local authority, which has a wealth of information, was not included in the discussions and the final outcome. I will be speaking to Post Office Ltd. about that and I will ask the local authority to furnish me with information about the meetings that it had.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_258">I hope that that helps my right hon. Friend in the detail of the constituency issues that he faces. He will understand why the Government, and I as the responsible Minister, cannot and should not intervene in every case, because obviously, as my right hon. Friend showed great foresight in acknowledging, one post office could close because it was no longer viable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_259">Postwatch has, up and down the country, made representations and resolved to the satisfaction of certain communities some of the closure proposals. I want to know the detail of what is going on as far as Postwatch is concerned and the relationship between the local authority and Post Office Ltd. That is the best that I can offer my right hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para19">
<a name="stpa_260">In addition, now that this programme has been going on for some time, Postwatch is undertaking a survey to look at what has happened to those post offices that have closed, to see whether any gaps have emerged. It may be possible, indeed desirable, for the situation in Manchester to be examined, and we can ask Postwatch to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para20">
<a name="stpa_261">My right hon. Friend used very emotive language, which I know from our dealings on many issues in the past must be sincere, because he does not use such words without great care and cause, and he said that the consultation process was a sham. I would be very upset if that was the case. If the consultation process was a sham, we will need to investigate that, and we will do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para21">
<a name="stpa_262">My right hon. Friend will be aware that the post office closures came about because Post Office Ltd. tested the water with many of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses about their individual positions with regard to the future of their businesses. Many of them felt that their businesses could not continue and were happy to seek part of the payment for closing them voluntarily. That was the basis on which Post Office Ltd. looked at those post offices and their viability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para22">
<a name="stpa_263">With regard to the consultation process, however, there is supposed to be a post office within a mile of any post office that closes. In the most deprived wards, there should be one half a mile away. My right hon. Friend 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="41117-29_para23">
<a name="stpa_264">In general terms, I am quite confident that the principles that have been laid out to support the viable network being put in place are there. What worries me is if those principles have not been followed. Clearly, that is the basis on which we should look at the position outlined this evening. If my right hon. Friend wanted me to do so, I could go into even greater detail about a large number of other things, but I do not think that that would help at this stage.

<p><a name="st_324"><a name="41117-30_spnew0"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 I do not know whether my hon. Friend can comment on this point. Does he think that there is merit in the Post Office investigating someone else taking over a franchise if that is possible? Does he agree that there should at least be discussions on that issue if the consultation is to be real?

<p><a name="st_325"><a name="41117-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point, but if I dealt with it, it would confuse this matter.
